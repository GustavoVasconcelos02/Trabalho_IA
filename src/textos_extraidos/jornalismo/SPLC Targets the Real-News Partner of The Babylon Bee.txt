musk s first directives at twitter was restoring the babylon bee s speech on the platform and it seems likely he bought the social media platform in part this reason twitter had silenced the bee the crime of disagreeing with transgender orthodoxy one of the key issues on which the splc will brook dissent in fact this connection may explain secondary motive behind the splc s attack the daily signal depends on the support of readers like you donate now babylon bee ceo seth dillon revealed the splc s forthcoming attack in post on x splc targets the partner of the babylon bee https the discredited smear factory known the splc is about to publish hit piece doxxing several of our not the bee writers who wished to remain anonymous so they could speak freely without fear he wrote the splc extracted sensitive information from our site then used that information to contact our writers dillon said the splc went digging the information because they re activists masquerading they did it because they lack principles he added they did it because they re vindictive bullies who ve admitted their aim is to completely destroy individuals and organizations they disagree with by making them pay steep price speaking dillon admitted that since he s public figure he accepts that getting attacked comes with the what i won t accept is the doxxing and smearing of our staff because they said some things the splc doesn t like he added the splc published its attack on not the bee tuesday naming 14 pseudonymous writers why is it called the splc the babylon bee ceo is exactly right in fact he arguably understates his case i wrote in my book making hate pay the corruption of the southern poverty law center the splc began noble civil rights nonprofit providing legal representation to poor people in the south it won some major cases getting black men who had been falsely convicted of rape off of death row and even representing white people who faced reverse racism yes even some on the left used to care about that beginning in the 1980s however the splc began quite the organization s morris dees had an uncle in the ku klux klan and his familiarity with the klan naturally bred rather just contempt dees began targeting klan groups to sue them into bankruptcy and since he was doing this in the not in the klan s heyday of the 1920s or the found it rather easy in fact splc staff compared taking the klan to court to shooting fish in suing the klan paid dividends dees cast grand narrative of himself noble knight slaying grand dragons in the courtroom northern liberals who saw the south den of hateful white rednecks sent massive checks splc s attorneys weren t happy with the work many of the leaning attorneys didn t appreciate splc s work with law enforcement and they wanted to help people who actually needed it not find every excuse imaginable to sue klan groups that had barely cent to their name they quit en masse in 1986 while dees doubled down on the strategy the hate map eventually dees ran out of grand dragons to slay so rather than abandoning the strategy he started casting wider net in stroke of fundraising genius the splc expanded its klanwatch project into hatewatch and started publishing map plotting small and splc targets the partner of the babylon bee https hate groups alongside klan chapters gradually the splc added more and more mainstream organizations to the hate today the splc s hate map is political and ideological enemies list that the splc uses to scare donors into ponying up cash and to mortally embarrass those who dare disagree with its leftist agenda if you disagree with the splc s approach on immigration you re an hate if you don t think kids should be told that boy can become girl and vice versa you re an hate if you condemn the ideology of radical islam you re an muslim if you support parental rights in education you re an antigovernment extremist this isn t hyperbole the splc does actually put conservative groups like the center immigration studies the family research council alliance defending freedom and moms liberty on the hate map alongside klan chapters the splc s year in hate and extremism 2023 report released in june describes the groups on the map organizational upholding white supremacy the idea that the splc aims to completely destroy those they disagree with dillon is exactly right splc spokesman mark potok said so at the annual conference of the michigan alliance against hate crimes in lansing in 2007 sometimes the press will describe us monitoring hate groups i want to say plainly that our aim in life is to destroy these groups completely destroy them he said potok reiterated this point at vermont school group in 2008 you are able to destroy these groups sometimes by the things you publish he declared it s not so much that they will bring down the police or the federal agents on their head it s that you can sometimes so mortally embarrass these groups that they will be the results in 2012 an lgbtq activist targeted the conservative christian nonprofit the family research council an attempted mass shooting the building manager leo johnson prevented the attack but the terrorist later confessed to the fbi that he intended to kill everyone in the building he pleaded guilty to terrorism charges and is serving sentence the splc rightly condemned the attack but it has kept frc on the hate map ever since companies like amazon eventbrite and nextdoor have used the splc to exclude people they brand legacy media outlets democrats and others consider the splc reliable arbiter of hate despite the group s many scandals the scandals in 2019 reckoning came the splc the group fired its morris dees and saw its president richard cohen resign this took place amid racial discrimination and sexual harassment scandal amid the scandal former employee came forward calling the hate accusations highly profitable splc targets the partner of the babylon bee https the splc brought in tina tchen former first lady michelle obama s chief of staff to run an internal review and the results of that review have never seen the light of day it seems tchen s job was to brush the scandal under the rug employees weren t happy so they unionized earlier this year the splc restructured in what union leaders are calling classic behavior the splc also faces multiple defamation lawsuits it paid more than 3 million to settle lawsuit after branding muslim reformer an islamic last year judge allowed the dustin inman society s defamation lawsuit against the splc to move forward why attack not the bee despite all these scandals the splc has enjoyed undeserved clout many on the left prop up this corrupt organization because it is politically useful attack dog they can cite to demonize conservatives i wrote in my forthcoming book the woketopus the dark money cabal manipulating the federal government the splc has had tremendous access to the federal bureaucracy under president joe biden splc leaders and staff have visited the white house at least 18 times biden nominated an splc attorney nancy abudu to top federal judgeship and she was confirmed in splc leaders have briefed leaders at the justice department and the department of education about hate and extremism and the fbi s richmond office notoriously cited the splc in its 2023 memo on radical traditional the splc will likely lose this access in january trump takes office the group may harbor some resentment at the babylon bee this development because elon musk appears to have bought twitter in part to liberate the babylon bee and musk s purchase of twitter loosened the left s stranglehold on information musk s new platform x has circumvented the left s ability to censor information that conflicts with its narrative in the name of suppressing misinformation and this development likely helped trump prevail in the 2024 presidential election not only does the splc want to silence not the bee s reporting on cultural issues but it also likely harbors resentment against the entire bee enterprise related posts demonizing dissent what biden s attack on t rump supporters
