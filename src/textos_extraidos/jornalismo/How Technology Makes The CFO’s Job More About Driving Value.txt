the ledger ey s deirdre ryan on how technology is transforming the cfo s role the cfo s role has been in flux transitioning from someone who solely worked with numbers to increasingly becoming leader in strategy i talked with deirdre ryan ey global finance transformation leader about the reasons behind these changes the new challenges cfos today face and what the future likely holds the position this conversation has been edited length clarity and continuity what you think has caused the biggest change to the cfo s traditional role ryan the advance of technology has allowed them to focus in an area that ultimately better supports the goal of their enterprise before so much time was spent processing transactions that was the bulk of the effort not just the cfo but the entire finance organization most finance organizations they probably spent 60 to 80 of their time ingesting and processing transactions so that they could produce accurate financial statements now with digital technologies most organizations have leveraged that capability to automate and it s allowed them to shift their focus to more activities we have point of view that we put together about year ago i brought together some of our best global thought leaders i wanted to very practically say what is finance function going to look like three to five years out there s just so much change and disruption and lot of cfos needed to better understand what i need to look like three years from now five years from now to either gain or maintain competitive advantage lot of that is about automation and leveraging those technologies so that you can pivot your team to really drive value the enterprise one of the major challenges is not just learning how to use this technology but ensuring that the data is clean and can be processed effectively by the system what are some of the other big challenges cfos today are facing ey global finance transformation leader deirdre ryan how technology makes the cfo s job more about driving value https cfo role is evolving but they re in this position right now where they have to balance these traditional mandates basically we need our cpas we need our mbas we have to get the numbers right we have to figure out the so what of the data it s balancing the traditional mandates and what historically has been expected of cfo with bold transformation and being able to help her or his organization envision the art of the possible historically when we wanted to drive improvement in finance typically we would look at an process and say how can we make this more efficient we could make little tweak here put here put some bubble gum here we could drive some efficiency but now what we re saying is let s take step back and think about this differently let s think about the data opposed to the process that s really going to drive value let s take fp historically organizations could have looked at that process and said i m going to tweak this i m going to fix that but now given these technologies that we have you really have to completely reimagine how you re running that department it s such an exciting time but it takes skill sets that finance professionals didn t need to lean on so heavily before that takes really good understanding of the capabilities of these tools and technologies not just reading an article or powerpoint but getting your hands dirty and really understanding it also takes creativity to step back and say how i this in way that s effective efficient but leveraging these technologies changing my mindset and opening my mind to the art of the possible how you see the cfo role continuing to evolve in the next five to 10 years organizations that have put focus on driving transformation hopefully they ll have automated 80 of their transaction processing cfos are going to continue to understand and have automation experts you re not going to completely eliminate human intervention because you want constant process improvement but if that s done their role is going to continue to evolve towards driving value bottom line we think that the role of cfo is going to be data centric function focused on driving value if you ve automated capturing data you have to take advantage of that to drive value facts comme nts chip maker amd announced job cuts last week it works toward becoming more dominant player in
