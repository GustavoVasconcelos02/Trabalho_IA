apple s first gaming keyboard and mouse aren t made by apple at all apple has partnered with corsair its Ô¨Årst gaming keyboard and mouse that could turn your mac mini into the little gaming console that could by kyle barr published november 18 2024 comments 20 ùïè apple spent both 2023 and 2024 setting itself up new face in gaming but even apple doesn t expect gamers to try to play baldur s gate 3 on its profile squishy magic keyboards and magic mouse that s right apple now has official gaming keyboards before you think the mac maker has finally moved on from magic peripherals apple has licensed its gaming keyboards and mice from corsair instead kyle barr2 0 2 apple s first gaming keyboard and mouse aren t made by apple at all https partnered with apple to bring the 180 k65 mechanical keyboard and the 130 m75 wireless mouse to mac it includes all the official mac layouts complete with cmd and opt keys and the function row layout is modeled after the mac s usual layout that s important because apple is supposed to sell them directly in apple stores with the limited glacier blue color which is only available and white edition available online we tested the macbook pro 14 and pro 16 with m4 the m4 imac and the redesigned mac mini are all technically machines now there s k m to match your brand apple s first gaming keyboard and mouse aren t made by apple at all https photo kyle barr gizmodo you could have always used any other mechanical keyboard apple mainstays could even swap out the keys to match the mac layout but this is one of the few times in apple s history it s promoting peripheral if to say yes we re serious about gaming can t you see the keyboard s sick rgb and cool blue styling over there apple s first gaming keyboard and mouse aren t made by apple at all https sent both to put through their paces the k65 is 75 keyboard with steel plate chassis and keys it uses mlx red linear switches with 45g of actuation distance and 4mm travel safe to say it s just on the right side of bouncy my style it has enough resistance i don t accidentally press keys when resting my fingers on them there s clacky sound to them but its dampened well enough i won t overwhelm my coworkers on the desks near the keyboard feels very solid though it s still rather if you d more used to classy mechanical keyboards then of course you re introduced to the icue software corsair s way of updating firmware and modifying the k65 s and m75 s rgb lighting if you re mac user unused to the common bloatware that pc gamers experience welcome to the party pal the m75 ambidextrous gaming mouse feels robust in the hand both the mouse wheel and left mouse button have good feel without being too distracting or mechanical the right mouse button has less immediately clicky sound that caught off guard without doing any accuracy tests it at least feels like strong and quick competitive apple s first gaming keyboard and mouse aren t made by apple at all https games are there to play with apple anyway photo kyle barr gizmodo using this keyboard i constantly reminded myself not to reach the ctrl button instead of cmd but in games like baldur s gate iii the muscle memory automatically kicks in it s also far better time to play resident evil 4 with corsair s items than anything apple offers apple s first gaming keyboard and mouse aren t made by apple at all https when you think of gaming peripherals you tend to think of sports unfortunately apple there really aren t any big competitive shooters and there are 2 or call of duty perhaps we ll find more league of legends players clicking about on mac but these peripherals aren t necessary apple s gaming plans despite corsair s new apple connection these peripherals aren t nearly easy to pair to mac the tech giant s keyboard and mice there s instead you must use bluetooth wire or the included ghz dongles the latest macs including the mac mini longer sport ports that poses problem these existing peripherals and corsair s answer is to include an to converter in the box this sticks out like sore thumb and makes the dongles precarious if you ever dare move your mac and forget they re there you won t be able to change any of the keyboard or mouse settings unless you use mode or plug them in directly at least the included wire is to if you ve used any number of gaming peripherals the first pair of gaming peripherals made mac won t feel that distinct and yet i would rather use the k65 rather than apple s keyboard the mouse is it even apple s first gaming keyboard and mouse aren t made by apple at all https the magic mouse is so poorly designed that apple ceo tim cook can t even come up with anything good to say about it apple made lot of noise about games like frostpunk 2 coming to mac on release then ones like control and cyberpunk 2077 making their way to mac early in there are few other games on the horizon well i attended an apple gaming showcase last week where the iphone maker played games like the brutally underrated prince of persia the lost crown and the excellent resident evil 2 remake on m4 macs alongside recent ipads and iphones prince of persia won t be available until 3 and re 2 will follow up on but you ll have to wait until february 2025 control cyberpunk doesn t even have full release date yet though apple confirmed with that it will include the phantom liberty dlc i honestly couldn t imagine playing the game without it now other upcoming games like neva or wuthering waves aren t the titles that benefit the most from gamer k m apple to become true gaming haven the apple s first gaming keyboard and mouse aren t made by apple at all https
