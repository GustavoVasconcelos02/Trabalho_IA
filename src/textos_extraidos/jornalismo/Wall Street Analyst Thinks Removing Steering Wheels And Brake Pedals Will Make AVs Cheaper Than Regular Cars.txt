wall str eet analyst thinks removing steering wheels and brake pedals will make avs cheaper than regular cars avs will slash costs and corner the automotive market or will they byamber dasilvapublished6 hours agocomments 40 investors are all abuzz right now on the news that donald trump will make it easier to get autonomous cars on the roads tesla stock shot up on the news and wall street analysts justified the jump by saying much of the company s value is based on its ai efforts here s the issue the analysts are wrong and autonomous cars are not the market godsend they re expecting suggested reading tesla stock might be too strong tesla is underperforming and wall street is excited about it the ai bubble is bursting and tesla is going to get burnedphoto tesla wall street analyst thinks removing steering wheels and brake pedals will make avs cheaper than regular cars https spoke with analyst tom narayan of rbc capital yesterday to ask whether trump s promise to deregulate autonomous vehicles would outweigh his promise to end the federal ev tax credit narayan had previously written on the topic when raising rbc s target price tesla saying that autonomy accounts full 77 percent of the company s valuation he told cnbc that av deregulation would far outweigh the tax credit in importance it would allow tesla to create vehicle without wheels and pedals that cuts down lot of costs and can gobble up the the problem narayan doesn t see however is that cutting wheels and pedals won t save that much cost and that the market is far smaller than most think first off the cost savings from removing wheels and pedals from cars would likely be nearly negligible in comparison to the cost of an autonomous vehicle sure brake master cylinders and steering columns are complicated but avs still need to brake and steer the complex systems remain in place with only the human controls removed to save money according to tesla s parts fiche the entire upper steering column and wheel assembly model s costs just at retail pricing nothing to sneeze at sure but not even enough to outweigh the car computer controls aren t the big money sinks in automotive justiÔ¨Åes tesla s market cap more than car sales says rbc s tom narayan read more wall street analyst thinks removing steering wheels and brake pedals will make avs cheaper than regular cars https content then there s the av market which is more dire than analysts think the entire global passenger car market sat at about trillion in studies have shown that 86 percent of drivers want to be able to take over an autonomous car in the event of an emergency meaning that every av manufacturer is only playing slice of 434 billion pie if those numbers hold up globally add in tesla s master plan to allow robotaxi owners to share their vehicles which could allow single vehicle sale to cover multiple interested buyers and the company s piece of that already tiny market could end up infinitesimal context automaker currently holds more than an 11 percent market share globally tesla could well be playing mere tens of billions here that doesn t justify 77 percent of market cap obviously av sentiment varies by location and applying attitudes towards autonomy towards the entire global market is an oversimplification this example chinese car buyers are more open to autonomy than we are over here while folks in india hew closer to our american opinions but even if that total av market doubles or triples in size it s not enough to justify the sort of investment we re seeing autonomous vehicles are not source of infinite income with minimal cost waiting just around the corner locked away by federal regulation they re niche interest that most people won t buy more from jalopnik update pm fixed math errors resulting from punching typo into my calculator the theoretical size of the av market is 434 billion not million meaning an 11 percent market share would net out to about billion still well short of 77 percent of tesla s trillion market cap which comes out to billion and that s based on future in which tesla achieves dominance over the av category while the passenger car market is growing at percent annually it would still take years the entire market size to match that share of tesla s market cap let alone the company s own market share to match that amount plus without avs on the roads and on sale it s tough to say what growth may look like that musk has been promising cars 10 years update we are now on year 11 elon musk has been promising robotaxis to investors since 2016 after hertz workers abandon their location customers show up and take whatever rental cars they want china unveils new space shuttle that totally does look familiar at all buy these evs befor the end of the year to get the full federal tax cr edit tesla scraps factory paint pr otection wrap its unpainted wall street analyst thinks removing steering wheels and brake pedals will make avs cheaper than regular cars https
