platform trucks and suvs from ram and jeep stellantis way back in july 2021 when stellantis had only been in existence few months following the merger of psa and fiat chrysler the company had an ev day at this event the company led by ceo carlos tavares laid out grand plan its transition to electric propulsion that included 100 zero emissions vehicle sales in europe and 50 in north america by while those targets now seem unlikely to be achieved by the end of the decade stellantis is still pressing ahead with the launch of electric vehicles on its four new platforms stla small stla medium stla large and stla frame stla frame is expected to be primarily north american platform that will be launching soon the basis of full size trucks and suvs stellantis launches stla frame platform ram and jeep https stla medium vehicles are already on sale in europe across the peugeot opel and vauxhall brands the first stla large models are due to go on sale imminently the jeep wagoneer s and dodge charger the others are all unibody architectures stla frame the name implies is larger body on frame models starting with the ram 1500 pickup and followed by the jeep wagoneer stellantis stla frame platform will include battery electric variant the ram 1500 rev with up stellantis all three of these larger platforms are designed to be platforms while they are all designed to accommodate battery electric propulsion each can also accommodate internal combustion and various flavors of hybridization including mild and strong hybrids hybrids and extended range evs erevs although stellantis seems to prefer reev stellantis calls their approach unique but numerous automakers are doing something similar most notably bmw which has dedicated ev platform the ix but flexible platforms most of its other models including the 3 5 and 7 series and upcoming suvs the first stla frame products will be the battery electric ram 1500 rev and ramcharger these are the last of the detroit designed trucks to get electrified stellantis launches stla frame platform ram and jeep https the ford lightning chevrolet silverado ev and gmc sierra ev there s also the gmc hummer ev sut but that s not really

frame platform ram and jeep https its internal combustion pickup trucks in creating the lightning while ford retained separate frame and heavily modified it the frame remains the same width with the same mounting points the body the gas version gm created an dedicated platform that integrates the frame rails into unibody unlike the ford frame where the rails are several inches inboard from the edge of the body gm moved the rails out near the perimeter this allowed wider and deeper battery pack in fact the gm trucks use dual layer battery that is effectively two batteries stacked on top of each other while the lightning is currently limited to kwh battery the gm trucks offer battery with well over and range up to 492 miles of range stellantis opted to retain separate frame but the frame appears to be wider than the ford and has more capacity to hold battery the battery electric rev stellantis will offer standard range version with that should provide at least 350 miles of range the large capacity battery is expected to have capacity and stellantis expects this truck to have range of at least 500 miles read more stellantis launches stla frame platform ram and jeep https 1500 ramcharger stellantis the stla frame is designed to support vehicles with length of inches and wheelbase of to with the short bed crew cab ram 1500 measuring long with wheelbase there presumably won t be variant coming anytime soon this platform does support multiple suspension layouts including coil spring or air springs and ground clearance up to which gives it advantage over the lightning in conditions the stla frame platform has also been validated water fording at depths up to the maximum tire size is limited to which means we probably won t be getting an electric rho or trx variant anytime soon the ram will use pair of electric drive modules edms delivering and 615 of torque that should push this truck to 60 mph in each edm integrates the drive motor gear box and power electronics while not rapid the fastest versions of the cybertruck or rivian r1t that is still far quicker than most people ever really need especially in truck the front drive unit has disconnect system that can be engaged under light load conditions to reduce drag and improve efficiency the rear drive unit includes an electronic locking differential to provide more grip off road the rev will use an 800v charging configuration with support charging at up to that matches the capability of the gm trucks and more than doubles the kw maximum charging rate of the ford it s probable that stellantis is using similar setup to gm with voltage splitter that sends to each of the two battery layers effectively treating it two batteries charging in parallel stellantis claims the rev can add up to of range in 10 minutes like the ford and gm trucks stla frame does include support bidirectional power so that it can be used to charge another ev stellantis launches stla frame platform ram and jeep https power home during an outage so far stellantis hasn t announced any sort of integration kit home power backup stellantis stla frame platform supports extended range evs with the ram 1500 ramcharger having stellantis so far the bane of electric pickup trucks has been towing it s not that they can t tow with all of the available options being able to easily pull at least the ram will have tow rating and payload both the rev and ramcharger the issue is that when towing large trailer efficiency tends to drop by at least half and in turn so does the range depending on the trailer type tests of the lightning have shown towing range of little 80 miles up to 150 miles the much larger batteries in the ram should enable towing of over 200 miles with the big battery similar to the capability of the gm trucks this is where the erev ramcharger is expected to shine with smaller battery of just but the same motors the rev it should have range of more than 140 miles on charge far more than most people will use on daily basis that means the ramcharger will be mostly just like the rev and with electric only propulsion should feel the same the smaller capacity battery will be limited to charging at 400v and kw the smaller battery takes up the front half of the frame while behind that is gas tank sitting above the front drive motor stellantis is using pentastar v6 hooked to generator the battery runs down the range extender fires up and maintains the state of charge of the battery so that it can provide the full expected performance capabilities with full charge and full tank of fuel the ramcharger is expected to have nominal range of 690 miles stellantis launches stla frame platform ram and jeep https with the largest trailers the ramcharger should be able to go about 300 miles on charge and tank more than the distance most people will want to go without break even if charger isn t available the tank can be refilled in few minutes while charge shouldn t take much more than 30 minutes while the erev system does add some complexity it will provide lot more flexibility to owners especially those that need to tow long distances 2022 jeep grand w agoneer sam abuelsamid it is also likely to be the least costly to build compared to the standard battery in the rev the smaller battery could be over cheaper assuming adding back the engine generator fuel system and other components the ramcharger will still likely be several thousand dollars less to build although the price to consumers may not be any cheaper timing the launch of the electrified ram trucks has slipped bit the rev was supposed to launch by the end of 2024 but ceo carlos tavares now says it will be arrive in the first half of following the ram 1500 pickups the erev system will also be offered in the wagoneer suv battery electric version is also expected at some point although with the constant changes in production schedules evs it might be couple of years away follow on linkedin
