electric by carmakers are already charging ahead which means millions more of these resource intensive evs will be hitting roads not in decades but several years more of these metals will be needed to produce the many wind turbines and solar panels that will come to dominate global economy increasingly powered by renewable energy sources even if trump administration reverses course on climate initiatives in the us the global trend towards renewables and away from fossil fuels has already been set in motion after decades of false starts and setbacks renewable energy sources currently account nearly quarter of the electricity in the us according to the international energy agency iea solar and wind capacity alone are expected to double by 2027 by that same year the iea estimates renewables will be the single greatest source of electricity worldwide related what s the most sustainable way to mine the largest known lithium deposit in the world all of that hinges on more metals being extracted from the ground the iea estimates the world will need ten times much lithium by 2050 to meet renewable energy demands by around that same time annual demand copper could be greater than the total amount used worldwide between 1900 and global demand minerals broadly is expected to increase percent in the next few decades whether or not we can collectively meet that demand isn t entirely certain has cost products and the new of mineral mining popular science https we might not have enough metals to build wind turbines solar panels and electric cars quickly we need in order to keep the world from warming to the point after which climate change could become truly cataclysmic beiser writes the environmental toll of lithium although minority of new startups are experimenting with innovative new chemical processes to extract lithium directly from rock the vast majority of mining the resource now uses more traditional brine mining techniques which requires vast amounts of water and can take toll on local ecologies in argentina lithium mining operations have already reportedly contaminated streams used to irrigate crops in china lithium mine reportedly polluted nearby

their food locals reportedly told the author the mine s massive water consumption already meant there was less available them to use farming those claims tend to track with 2019 study from arizona state university researchers which found soil moisture and vegetation had declined in the areas near the salt mines between 1997 and that s around the same period lithium mines there quadrupled in size here again is the familiar conundrum beiser writes the spread of digital technology and electric vehicles will ultimately beneﬁt most places but the heaviest costs of this shift are being paid by only some people and some critical mineral extraction may still less harmful than gas and coal supporters of expanded mining critical minerals argue this approach extractive it may be is still far more palatable than an alternative future powered by dirty fossil fuels an analysis released earlier this year by prominent environmental research center called the breakthrough institute compared various types of mining operations and found that mining associated with wind and solar still had much smaller environmental footprint than those tied to coal or natural gas generating just one of electricity with coal is reported to require 20 times the mining footprint the same amount of electricity generated by solar or wind other more experimental ef forts are also being considered to meet

mineral deposits from the seabed at depths greater than 200 meters geological surveys have shown those deep seabeds remain virtually untapped and are rich with copper nickel aluminum manganese zinc

space mining startups some with the ﬁnancial backing of prominent tech leaders like larry paige are exploring ways to one day extract minerals and metals from the thousands of asteroids orbiting between mars and jupiter those moonshot ef forts though admittedly are unlikely to actually gain traction anytime soon get ready more mines in more places all of that points to reality where mines like the one being contested in nevada become much more common in the future it s not all bad news experts are cautiously optimistic innovations in battery tech could make future iterations powering vehicles far more efﬁcient and less than the current generation advances in battery recycling simultaneously mean future evs may be able to source sizable chunk of their necessary metals and components from older models on societal level government leaders in the us and europe say new domestic mining operations could add many needed jobs to shaky economies and help diversify global supply chains still it s almost guaranteed wave of new critical minerals would put pressure on environments and the communities that reside near them all of these approaches from new mines to deep sea
