about ai bots and more recently ai copilots use generative ai to help understand and respond to increasingly sophisticated queries then ai agents are emer ging the next stage of development the focus is on how ai can be used to create increasingly more like nuanced entities that can respond to and interact with actual humans one early use case these agents has been gaming speciﬁcally to use in

to speed up or sometimes replace humans in enterprise environments even with openai chatgpt has certainly been viral hit globally but at its heart the startup has been trying to build business around usage of its apis we see more potential in building agents within the gaming industry he said this approach allows us to iterate faster collect data more ef fectively and deliver product where there are eager users and where emer gent behavior is feature not and yes in keeping with its consumer focus you should not be surprised that now the company is not talking about monetization at all altera
