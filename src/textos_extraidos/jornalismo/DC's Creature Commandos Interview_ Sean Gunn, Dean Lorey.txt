why creature commandos is the perfect point the dc universe showrunner dean lorey and star sean gunn break down why max adult animated show is by isaiah colbert published november 18 2024 comments 7 ùïè starting over is never truth further amplified when the revamp in question is major event in pop culture it s surprising then that one of the first projects that dc is releasing under the guiding hand of james gunn is creature commandos an animated series following bunch of virtual nobodies in the dc mythos dc creature commandos interview sean gunn dean lorey https of the show s december release we spoke with creature commandos star sean gunn and showrunner dean lorey to learn more about how the show came into being and what they hope its legacy will spell the future of the dc universe this interview has been edited length and clarity isaiah colbert io9 while its premise isn t too dissimilar to the suicide squad creature commandos stands the first foray into theread more dc creature commandos interview sean gunn dean lorey https dc under the guiding hand of james gunn in your estimation what makes creature commandos group of unknown best restarting point into the dc universe sean gunn i think it s good example of where the dc universe is going my brother james gunn has referred to it an appetizer and the cool thing about it is that you don t need to know any of these characters there s history anybody can go in and watch creature commandos from episode one and love it even if they ve never read comic book or seen comic book movie in their lives but the hardcore fans will also get easter eggs and things like that i think it s before superman even starts get sense that this is very expansive world with many different nooks and crannies my favorite thing about it is that these characters are unusual but that makes it feel like we re all starting together dean lorey james actually started writing the series before he was the president of dc he d written most of it and picked it up because he was the president i don t know that it s specifically representative of what his dcu is going to be but it is very much like classic sort of james gunn material there s lot of drama there s lot of action it s definitely got comedy but what it really has is lot of heart that i think people are not expecting if it s representative of the rest of the material he s putting out dc then yeah it s classic james dc creature commandos interview sean gunn dean lorey https how does creature commandos approach adult animation differently from other dc shows like harley quinn lorey harley quinn and kite man are both pure comedies we always like to break those stories into dramas because we want to invest in the characters and all of that but ultimately they re comedies and creature commandos is closer to something like the suicide squad or guardians of the galaxy there s comedy in it but it s probably more of picture than it is pure comedy io9 james gunn has knack making group of oddball characters work what s more sean you always seem to end up playing some of the more bizarre crayons in the box with characters like weasel in the suicide squad who makes his grand return in creature commandos is there an ongoing bit between you two to have you voice fringe characters in the dc mythos or is this something you seek out an actor dc creature commandos interview sean gunn dean lorey https i don t mind doing weird stuff i m pretty shameless an actor and i mean that in good way i don t mean to be like anything salacious but my first question is always going to be what s the task and how can i perform it to the best of my ability regardless of how crazy or weird the character is i think that it just kind of worked out that way weasel is such weird character he s almost like big dog so i have this very narrow range of noises and sounds that weasel can make he doesn t speak human words and he growls and squawks and squeaks and purrs and does all kinds of little things like that trying to deliver an emotional performance through that i find to be challenging the suicide squad weasel is pretty straightforward comic relief but he really has to some some lifting here in creature commandos which i really appreciated i also wanted to voice well and james had mentioned gi robot early dc creature commandos interview sean gunn dean lorey https s almost like if james were managing baseball team i m the utility infielder on the bench that he can call in to whatever i can i can play backup shortstop i can play the backup catcher position i can throw few innings of relief if i need to i kind of lot of stuff because he knows my work and i know how he works sometimes he gives some of the harder material i think but i love doing it max io9 what keeps you coming back to work with your brother dc creature commandos interview sean gunn dean lorey https my brother is incredibly talented even though we ve been together our whole lives i set that aside and i m like he s such great i want to work with great writers and great directors so part of it is just respecting his work and knowing that he respects mine there s also the element of us having shorthand communicating with one another that makes it easy there s always learning curve when working with new creator an actor you have to get on common ground and make sure that you can speak to one another and james and i already have decades of that in the bank he can catch up to speed on what s going on with project and what it s supposed to feel and look like very quickly i love working with my brother i like doing other things too i like being known an actor who doesn t just work with james but i also respect and enjoy his work so much that i don t ever want to say when he approaches about project io9 what are recording sessions weasel usually like you need to have honey and tea at the ready or are your vocal cords to make all those noises gunn we laugh lot weasel cause i ll get directions that are kind of like well sean i m sorry to say this but can you longer slower lick dc creature commandos interview sean gunn dean lorey https like that but i m up it i just make sure i warm my voice up and lots of water i just try to find the center of it it was definitely challenging the episode that is weasel s backstory episode has good long sequence that we did in one take and it was tough i ve done lot of voice acting but i don t have quite the breadth of experience like an alan tudyk he s the greatest on the mic but i m working on it io9 you not only voice weasel in creature commandos but you also voice gi robot quirky li l guy whose idea of bonding is killing nazis with his friends how was the process of finding balance between their two distinctively unhinged tones gunn fortunately other than the very first session in the booth they were all separate i ve done several things now where i played two roles i did it playing rocket raccoon in motion capture and kraglin in guardians when i my preparation an actor it s like doing your algebra homework an hour and then putting it aside and doing your english homework i think in some ways creature commandos is easier because weasel and gi robot are so different that it s just matter of finding the center of each voice right before we start and then going from there io9 where does gi robot fit in the pantheon of automatons like the peaceful iron giant and unstoppable killing machines like dc creature commandos interview sean gunn dean lorey https gunn i would say gi robot lands at the very top io9 the very top not even just totem pole gunn i don t know what the spectrum is but man i love gi robot i ve been telling everybody it s character i could really relate to because he hates nazis and i hate nazis and particularly right now in our day and age which believe i m not going to get political but it s good to have hero who is the center of his moral compass nazis are bad it should be hero that everyone can relate to so i appreciate that io9 advertised on the tin basically gunn dc creature commandos interview sean gunn dean lorey https max io9 coming back to james talent making folks care deeply characters who are otherwise unknown redemption and not judging book by its cover seem to be the new prevailing themes of dc replacing the power fantasy themes of old where those themes resonate the most with the cast in creature commandos lorey don t judge book by its cover is very ingrained in the series we learn lot about characters we ve seen before like weasel he has major arc in this season and it s very much about don t judge book by its it s really true of all the characters you have frankenstein who is bit of an intellectual he s also stalker i think the characters are probably different from what you would expect out of those characters and we learn lot of new things about dc creature commandos interview sean gunn dean lorey https it s absolutely true both weasel and gi and even more so weasel lot of these characters have undergone some kind of trauma that has led them to where they are these character s stories may be tragic but they re not tragedies unto themselves even though you get these characters who can be wildly unpredictable and things that aren t great you get sense of where they come from we get to really relate to them i think in the case of gi he has it the best of the creature commandos because he is robot what is interesting about the character is that some little speck of humanity is trying to burst through trauma does not weigh him down the way that it does lot of the other characters and maybe the same is true weasel although weasel is certainly miserable character in his own right i really love how it all works all these dc creature commandos interview sean gunn dean lorey https max io9 while dc projects shine in the mainstream the facto medium the superhero genre dc appears to be on spree of animation its mode of field it has dominated long time how does creature commandos elevate that legacy dc to new heights lorey first of all it s real quality series it has the highest of ambitions and in terms of the legacy of batman the animated series and all think it fits right in there with classic shows like that i think it is very good and wonderful animated history i think it s continuation of what was io9 there s become an increasing anxiety animation fans with new shows dropping in quality after its premiere episode many posit that animated shows drastic dip in quality comes from factors like budgeting and time not being allotted to animators to properly produce to rushed rough or worst cases unfinished animation sequences creature commandos showrunner how did you ensure its animation quality remained consistent throughout its first season lorey lot of it is the people you work with rick morales was the animation supervisor on the show and he did spectacular job we also partnered with french studio called bobbypills and they did good bit of the design work when we get the animation in from the studios we pass dc creature commandos interview sean gunn dean lorey https and really go through and add layers onto the existing animation so there s lot of bites at the apple in terms of trying to make it great io9 what you see the future of dc animation looking like under james gunn s ideas the dcu lorey i expect that we ll see lot of shows with lot of heart the thing that james brings to the table is he loves characters he has real deep love of character and particularly underdogs so i think we ll see more of that i d like to be able to say we re going to see more shows in the harleyverse i don t have news on it yet but we re far along on some things there and in general i think it s just good storytelling we re all about trying to honor the source material of these shows i feel really good about where we re at with harley and the new season will be coming out soonish i m very proud of kite man and i just love creature commandos io9 what you hope new and old fans get out of creature commandos that they ve yet to experience from the dcu so far lorey it s classic blend of heart and extreme action and character i think people will be very surprised at the mix of all of those things inside of one show because it really comes from love james wrote it with enormous passion and we really tried to honor that passion in making it i m very excited people to see dc creature commandos interview sean
