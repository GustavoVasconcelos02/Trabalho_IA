second book summar third book summar four th book summar palgra ve notes dedica tion to alfred tennyson poet laureate this book in its progress has recalled often to my memory man with whose friendship we were once honoured to whom region of english literature was unfamiliar and who whilst rich in all the noble gifts of nature was most eminently distinguished by the noblest and the rarest judgment and patriotism it would have been hence peculiar pleasure and pride to dedicate what i have endeavoured to make true national anthology of three centuries to henry hallam but he is beyond the reach of any human tokens of love and reverence and i desire therefore to place before it name united with his by associations which whilst poetry retains her hold on the minds of englishmen are not likely to be forgotten your encouragement given while traversing the wild scenery of treryn dinas led to begin the work and it has been comple ted under your advice and assistance the favour now asked i have thus second reason and to this i may add the homage which is your right poet and the gratitude due to friend whose regard i rate at common value permit then to inscribe to yourself book which i hope may be found by many lifelong fountain of innocent and exalted pleasure source of animation to friends when they meet and able to sweeten solitude itself with best society the companionship of the wise and the good with the beauty which the eye can not see and the music only heard in silence if this collection proves of delight to labour and to poverty it teaches those indifferent to the poets to love them and those who love them to love them more the aim and the desire entertained in framing it will be fully accomplished may pref ace this little collection differs it is believed from others in the attempt made to include in it all the best original lyrical pieces and songs in our language by writers not living the golden treasury https beside the best many familiar verses will hence be met with many also which should be familiar editor will regard his ﬁttest readers those who love poetry so well that he can offer them nothing not already known and valued those who take up the book in serious and scholarly spirit the following remarks on the plan and the execution are added the editor is acquainted with strict and exhaustive deﬁnition of lyrical poetry but he has found the task of practical decision increase in clearness and in facility he advanced with the work whilst keeping in view few simple principles lyrical has been here held essentially to imply that each poem shall turn on some single thought feeling or situation in accordance with this narrative descriptive and didactic poems accompanied by rapidity of movement brevity and the colouring of human passion been excluded humorous poetry except in the very unfrequent instances where truly poetical tone pervades the whole with what is strictly personal occasional and religio us has been considered foreign to the idea of the book blank verse and the couplet with all pieces markedly dramatic have been rejected alien from what is commonly understood by song and rarely conforming to lyrical conditions in treatment but it is not anticipated nor is it possible that all readers shall think the line accurately drawn some poems gray elegy the allegr and penser oso wordsworth ruth or campbell lord ullin might be claimed with perhaps equal justice narrative or descriptive selection whilst with reference especially to ballads and sonnets the editor can only state that he has taken his utmost pains to decide without caprice or partiality this also is all he can plead in regard to point even more liable to question degree of merit should give rank among the best that poem shall be worthy of the writer genius it shall reach perfection commensurate with its aim we should require ﬁnish in proportion to brevity passion colour and originality can not atone serious imperfections in clearness unity or truth few good lines not make good poem popular estimate is serviceable guidepost more than compass all that excellence should be looked rather in the whole than in the parts and other such canons have been always steadily regard ed he may however add that the pieces chosen and far larger number rejected have been carefully and repeatedly considered and that he has been aided throughout by two friends of independent and exercised judgment besides the distinguished person addressed in the dedication it is hoped that by this procedure the volume has been freed from that which must beset individual decisions the ﬁnal choice the editor is alone responsible chalmers vast collection with the whole works of all accessible poets not contained in it and the best anthologies of different periods have been twice systematically read through and it is hence improbable that any omissions which may be regretted are due to oversight the poems are printed entire except in very few instances speciﬁed in the notes where stanza has been omitted the omissions have been risked only when the piece could be thus brought to closer lyrical unity and essentially opposed to this unity extracts obviously such are excluded in regard to the text the purpose of the book has appeared to justify the choice of the most poetical version wherever more than one exists and much labour has been given to present each poem in disposition spelling and punctuation to the greatest advantage in the arrangement the most poetically effective order has been attempted the english mind has passed through phases of thought and cultivation so various and so opposed during these three centuries of poetry that rapid passage between old and new like rapid alteration of the eye focus in looking at the landscape will always be wearisom and hurtful to the sense of beauty the poems have been therefore distributed into books corresponding to the ninety years closing about 1616 ii thence to 1700 iii to 1800 iv to the half century just ended or looking at the poets who more or less give each portion its distinctive character they might be called the books of shakespeare milton gray and wordsworth the volume in this respect so far the limitations of its range allow accurately reﬂects the natural growth and evolution of our poetry rigidly chronological sequence however rather ﬁts collection aiming at instruction than at pleasure and the wisdom which comes through pleasure each book the pieces have therefore been arranged in gradati ons of feeling or subject the development of the symphonies of mozart and beethoven has been here thought of model and nothing placed without careful consideration and it is hoped that the contents of this anthology will thus be found to present certain unity episodes the golden treasury https noble language of shelley to that great poem which all poets like the thoughts of one great mind have built up since the beginning of the world he closes his long survey the editor trusts he may add without egotism that he has found the vague general verdict of popular fame more just than those have thought who with too severe criticism would conﬁne judgments on poetry to the selected few of many generations not many appear to have gained reputation without some gift or performance that in due degree deserved it and if verses by certain writers who show less strength than sweetness or more thought than mastery in expression are printed in this volume it should not be imagined that they have been excluded without much hesitation and regret far less that they have been slighted throughout this vast and pathetic array of singers now silent few have been honoured with the name poet and have not possessed skill in words sympathy with beauty tenderness of feeling or seriousness in reﬂection which render their works although never perhaps attaining that loftier and ﬁner excellence here required better worth reading than much of what ﬁlls the scanty hours that most men spare improvement or pleasure in any of its more elevated and permanent forms and if this be true of even mediocre poetry how much more are we indebted to the best like the fabled fountain of the azores but with more various power the magic of this art can confer on each period of life its appropriate blessing on early years experience on maturity calm on age youthfulness poetry gives treasures more golden than gold leading us in higher and healthier ways than those of the world and interpreting to us the lessons of nature but she speaks best herself her true accents if the plan has been executed with success may be heard throughout the following pages the poets of england are honoured wherever the dominant language of the world is spoken it is hoped that they will ﬁnd ﬁt audience palgra ve the golden treasur first book summar the elizabethan poetry it is rather vaguely termed forms the substance of this book which contains pieces from wyat under henry viii to shakespeare midway through the reign of james and drummond who carried on the early manner to still later period there is here wide range of style simplicity expressed in language hardly yet broken in to verse the pastoral fancies and italian conceits of the strictly elizabethan time the passionate reality of shakespeare yet general uniformity of tone prevails few readers can fail to observe the natural sweetness of the verse the straightforwardness of the thoughts less the limitation of subject to the many phases of one passion which then characterised our lyrical poetry when with drummond and shakespeare the purple light of love is tempered by spirit of sterner reﬂection it should be observed that this and the following summaries apply in the main to the collection here presented in which besides its restriction to lyrical poetry the golden treasury https or historical anthology has not been aimed at great excellence in human art in human character has from the beginning of things been even more uniform than mediocrity by virtue of the closeness of its approach to nature so far the standard of excellence kept in view has been attained in this volume comparative absence of extreme or temporary phases in style similarity of tone and manner will be found throughout something neither modern nor ancient but true in all ages and like the works of
