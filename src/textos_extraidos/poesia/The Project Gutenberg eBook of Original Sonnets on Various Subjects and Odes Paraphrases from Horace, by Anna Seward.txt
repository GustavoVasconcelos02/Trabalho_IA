twelve alternate rhimes closing with couplet which assume the name of sonnet without any other resemblance to that order of verse except their limitation to fourteen lines i never found the quadruple rhimes injurious to the general expression of the sense but in the excepted instan ces when it is considered how few they are in so large number i ﬂatter myself the idea will vanish that our language

construction it partakes of the nature of blank verse by the lines running into each other at proper intervals each line of the ﬁrst eight rhimes four times and the order in which those rhimes shou ld

quoting the preceding dissertation on the sonnet conscious that there is order of verse upon which so much erroneous opinion has gone forth and of whose beauties the merely common reader is so

upon this conﬁscation proculeius divided two thirds of that large fortune with which the emperor had rewarded his valor and ﬁdelity in the royal cause between licinius and his adopted brother terentius whose fortunes had suffered equal wreck on account of the party he had taken horace wrote this ode soon after the affectionate bounty of proculeius had restored his friend to afﬂuence it breathes warning spirit towards that turbulent and ambitious temper which horace perceived in this young nobleman the poet however has used great address and delicacy making the reﬂections not particular but general and he guards against exciting the soreness people feel from reprehension their prevailing fault by censuring with equal freedom the opposite extreme that kind caution insinuated in this ode proved eventually vain did also the generosity of the emperor who soon after permitted licinius to be chosen augur at the intercession of his favorite mæcenas who had married terentia daughter of that house and whom horace calls licinia in the ode which is next paraphrased upon the election of licinius to this post of honor trust and dignity we perceive the spirits of

himself by his proﬂigate passion cleopatra another commentator observes that the giants and lapithæ are said to have made the palace of saturn shake so also did brutus and cassius and afterwards mark antony make all italy tremble and that it is rome itself that horace would have to be understood by the magniﬁcent palace of saturn some critics seek to destroy all the common sense beauty and character of this ode by denying the allegoric interpretation and also by insisting that licinia was the poet own mistress and not the mistress of his patron it had been absurd and inconceivably unmeaning if when he was requested to sing the triumphs of augustus in the italian wars he should during the brief mention of them have adverted to old fables uniting them not simile but in line of continuation with the numantian and carthaginian wars unless beneath those fables he shadowed forth the roman enemies of augustus the idea that licinia was the mistress of horace has surely little foundation it were strange indeed if he could take pleasure in describing amorous familiarities between mæcenas and the person with whom himself was in love one of these critics alledges the reason why this lady could not be the destined bride of mæcenas that it would have been indiscreet in him to have admitted horace to be witness of his passion erentia it would have been impertinent in the poet to have invaded the privacies of his patron it is not necessary from this ode to conclude that horace had witnessed the tender scene he describes he might without any hazard of imputed impertinence venture to paint from his imagination the innocently playful endearments of betrothed lovers the picture was much more likely to ﬂatter than to disgust the gay and gallant mæcenas 2 the

towards gayer subjects than grecian chronology and the trojan war upon which his friend telephus had been declaiming and this purpose seems to have composed the ensuing ode at table it concludes with an hint that the unpleasant state of the poet mind respecting his then mistress incapacitates him abstracted themes which demand serene and collected attention alike inconsistent with the amorous discontent of the secret heart and with the temporary exhilaration of the spirits produced by the occasion on which they were met this must surely be the meaning of horace in this ode however obscurely expressed people of sense not even in their gayest conversation start from their subject to another of total inconnexion when the latent meaning in the concluding verses is perspicuously paraphrased it accounts the poet preference at that period of triﬂing to literary subjects these slight and often obscure allusions closely and what is called faithfully translated give wild and

reader will remember that in the course of these paraphrases the design has been avowed of stretching the pictures of horace upon wider canvass of ﬁlling up what are so often mere outlines if learned eyes ever glance over this ode it is hoped they will not frown upon the many circumstances and reﬂections which have been added upon presumption induced by the pleasing nature of the subject since the roman customs and manners are preserved with ﬁdelity those customs and manners resulting from their festal gay and picturesque religion can not surely be presented without proving interesting yet to create this interest stronger and more circumstantial description seems required than can be found in horace if the paraphraser may be allowed to judge of the poetic feelings of others by her own it was doubtless sufﬁcient his contemporary readers and those of some succeeding generations that he slightly alluded to events and ceremonies which were familiar to their recollection in our day more precision is demanded at least by those who have poetic taste without knowledge of the dead languages or intimacy with the national and domestic customs of that time and of that people also to strengthen this necessary interest in the mind of the reader it must be eligible to infuse more liberal portion of those sentiments and ideas which speak to the heart in every age and in every climate to scholars the fascinating music of the latin tones and measures and the elegance with which horace knew to select and to regulate them recompense the obscurity which is so frequent in his allusions and in the violence of his transitions from one subject to another between which the line of connexion is with difﬁculty traced what is called faithful translation of these odes can not therefore be interesting to unlearned lovers of verse how alive soever they may be to poetic beauty literal translation in the plainest prose will always shew the precise quantity of real poetic matter contained in any production independent of the music of its intonation and numbers and the elegance of its prose translations of horace odes evince that their merit does not consist in the plenitude of poetic matter or essence constituted by circumstances of startling interest by exalted sentiment impassioned complaint or appeal distinct and living imagery happy apposite allusion and sublime metaphor but in certain elegant verbal felicities and general charm of style produced by the force and sweetness of the latin language subservient to the ﬁne ear the lively and exquisite taste of horace these are the graces which we ﬁnd so apt to evaporate in translation while genuine poetic matter deﬁned above is capable of being transfused into any other language witho ut losing particle of its excellence provided the chemist who undertakes the operation has genius and skill the more pg 176 the project gutenberg ebook of original sonnets on various subjects and odes paraphrases from horace by anna seward https poetic matter in an author abounds the more close and faithful translator who has judgment may venture to render his to transfuse merely verbal felicities into another language is an attempt scarcely less fruitless than to clasp the rainbow kindred nothingness to poetic value ensues there is however considerable though not abounding quantity of poetic matter or essence in horace but it bears proportion to the profusion of those evanescent glories which will not bear the grasp of another language to give that essence in increased quantity and in the freedom of unimitative numbers is attempted in this selection dryden and pope translated upon that plan and hence their paraphrases have the spirit of original poems ere this note closes its author desires to observe that painters can not take striking likeness of face in which there is predominant feature and the poet can only make his image or description distinct animated and forcible by bringing forward some characteristic trait of the object he is presenting when horace says in this ode how pleasing is it to see the sheep hastening home the observation is not pictur esque and therefore does not strongly impress the imagination but when he to see the weary oxen dragging with languid neck the inverted ploughshar he gives perhaps the most poetic feature in this ode had he only said to see the oxen returning from their labor his oxen had been much without character his sheep and the sentence must have passed unimpressive over the mind of the reader it is the dragging with languid neck the inverted ploughshare that makes the sentence poetry and empowers it to arrest and charm the fancy had horace always written thus undeviating ﬁdelity had been the best aim of his translator and the sure way of rendering him delightful in every language 2 dacier observes that vines supported on the highest trees produce wines of the most exquisite ﬂavor 3 the feast of terminus one of the rural
