sappho one hundred lyrics by bliss carman https the poetr y of all the poets and all the lovers of poetry should be asked to name the most precious of the priceless things which time has wrung in tribute from the triumphs of human genius the answer which would rush to every tongue would be the lost poems of these we know to have been jewels of radiance so imperishable that the broken gleams of them still dazzle men s eyes whether shining from the two small brilliants and the handful of which alone remain to us or reﬂected merely from the adoration of those poets of old time who were so fortunate to witness their full glory about two thousand ﬁve hundred years sappho has held her place not only the supreme poet of her sex but the chief lyrist of all lyrists every one who reads acknowledges her fame concedes her supremacy but to all except poets and hellenists her name is vague and uncomprehended splendour rising secure above persistent mist of misconception in spite of all that is in these days being written about sappho it is perhaps not out of place now to inquire in few words into the substance of this supremacy which towers so unassailably secure from what appear to be such shadowy foundations first we have the witness of her conte mporaries sappho was at the height of her career about six centuries before christ at period when lyric poetry was peculiarly esteemed and cultivated at the centres of greek life among the molic peoples of the isles in particular it had been carried to high pitch of perfection and its forms had become the subject of assiduous study its technique was exact complex extremely elaborate minutely regulated yet the essential ﬁres of sincerity spontaneity imagination and passion were ﬂaming with undiminished heat behind the ﬁxed form s and restricted measures the very metropolis of this lyric realm was mitylene of lesbos where amid the myrtle groves and temples the sunlit silver of the fountains the hyacinth gardens by soft blue sea beauty and love in their young warmth could fuse the most rigid forms to ﬂuency here sappho was the ackno wledged queen of studied imitated served adored by little court of attendant s and disciples loved and hymned by alcæus and acclaimed by her fellowcraftsmen throughou t greece the wonder of her age that all the tributes of her contemporaries show reverence not less her personality than her genius is sufﬁcient answer to the calumnies with which the ribald jesters of that later period the corrupt and shameless writers of athenian comedy strove to deﬁle her fame it is sufﬁcient also to warrant our regarding the picturesque but scarcely digniﬁed story of her vain pursuit of phaon and her frenzied leap from the cliff of leucas nothing more than poetic myth reminiscent perhaps of the myth of aphrodite and who is indeed called phaon in some versions the story is further discredited by the fact that we ﬁnd mention of it in greek among those attic comedians who would have clutched at it so eagerly and given it so gross date more than two hundred years after sappho s death it is myth which has begotten some exquisite literature both in prose and verse from ovid s famou s epistle to addison s gracious fantasy and some impassioned and imperishable dithyram bs of swinburne but one need not accept the story fact in order to appreciate the beauties which ﬂowered out from its coloured unreality the applause of contemporaries however is not always justiﬁed by the verdict of times and does not always secure an immortality of renown the fame of sappho has the project gutenberg ebook of sappho one hundred lyrics by bliss carman https basis her work was in the world s possession not far short of thousand thousand years of changing tastes searching criticism and familiar use it had to endure the wear and tear of quotation the commonizing touch of the school and the and under this test its glory grew ever more and more conspicuous through those thousand years poets and critics vied with one another in proclaiming her verse the one unmat ched exemplar of lyric art such testimony even though not single fragment remained to us from which to judge her poetry ourselves might well convince us that the supremacy acknowledged by those who knew all the triumphs of the genius of old greece was beyond the assault of any modern rival we might safely accept the sustained judgment of thousand years of greece fortunately us however two small but incomparable odes and few scintillating fragments have survived quoted and handed down in the eulogies of critics and expositors in these the wisest minds the greatest poets and the most inspired teachers of modern days have found justiﬁcation the unanimous verdict of antiquity the tributes of addi son tennyson and others the throbbing paraphrases and ecstatic interpretations of swinburne are too well known to call special comment in this brief note but the concise summing up of her genius by in his remarkable essay on poetry is so convincing and illuminating that it seems to demand quotation here never before these songs were sung and never since did the human soul in the grip of ﬁery passion utter cry like hers and from the executive point of view in directness in lucidity in that high imperious verbal economy which only nature can teach the artist she has equal and none worthy to take the place of the poems of sappho so mysteriously lost to us seem to have consisted of at least nine books of odes together with epithalamia epigrams elegies and monodies of the several theories which have been advanced to account their disappearance the most plausible seems to be that which represents them having been burned at byzantium in the year 380 anno domini by command of gregory nazianzen in order that his own poems might be studied in their stead and the morals of the people thereby improved of the efﬁcacy of this act means of judging has come down to us in recent years there has arisen great body of literature upon the subject of sappho most of it the abstruse work of scholars writing scholars but the gist of it all together with the minutest surviving fragment of her verse has been made available to the general reader in english by henry wharton in whose altogether admirable little volume we ﬁnd all that is known and the most apposite of all that has been said up to the present day about love s priestess mad with pain and joy of song song s priestess mad with joy and pain of perhaps the most perilous and the most alluring venture in the whole ﬁeld of poetry is that which carman has undertaken in attempting to give us in english verse those lost poems of sappho of which fragments have survived the task is obviously not one of translation or of paraphrasing but of imaginative and at the same time interpretive constructi on it is if sculptor of were to set himself with reverence and trained craftsmanship and studious familiarity with the spirit technique and atmosphere of his subject to restore some statues of polyclitus or praxiteles of which he had but broken arm foot knee ﬁnger upon which to build carman s
