bound them with thongs to sticks and he taught his people to pry apart the forest and beat back the ravenous beasts and he bade them honeycomb the mountainside with caves to dwell therein with their women and the most beautiful women the king took his own that his wisdom might not perish from the earth and he led the young men to war and conquered all the warring tribes from the mountains to the sea and when ﬁre smote great tree out of heaven and raged through the forest till the third sun he seized burning brand and lit an altar to his god and there beside the burning ﬁre he sat and made laws and did justice and his people loved and feared him and the king grew old and seven journeys of the sun from morn to morn he moved not neither uttered word and the hearts of the people were troubled but none dared speak to the king despair neither wise men nor warriors dared cry out unto him now the youngest son of the king was lad still soft of ﬂesh who had never run to battle not sat in council nor stood before the king and his heart yearned his father and he bowed before his mother and said give thy blessing i have words within the king yea the sea sings to the night with waves will my words roll in singing unto his grief and his mother said go my son thou hast words of power and soothing and the king shall be healed so the youth went forth and bowed him toward the king seat

things have i done he said and they shall perish with my death is upon and i shall die and the tribes i have welded together shall be broken apart and the beasts shall win back their domain and the green jungle shall overgrow my mansions lo the ﬁre shall go out on the altar of the gods and my glory shall be crimson cloud that the night swallows up in darkness then the young man lifted up his voice and cried oh king be comforted thy deeds shall not pass cloud neither shall thy laws be strewn before the wind i will carve thy glory in rich and rounded i will string thy deeds together in jewelled beads of perfect words that thy sons shall wear on their hearts forever verily thy words are rich with song said the king but thou shalt die and who will utter them like twinkling foam is the speech of man mouth like foam from curling wave that vanishes in the sun nay let thy heart believe oh king my father said the youth the words of my mouth shall keep step with the ripple of waves and the beating of wings yea they shall mount with the huge paces of the sun in heaven that cease not my ceasing men shall sound them on suckling tongues still soft with milk they shall run into battle to the tune of thy deeds and kindle their ﬁre with the breath of thy wisdom and thy glory shall be ever living jewel of jasper from the the green jewel of jasper carven into god the rod of thy power oh king and of the power of thy sons forever the king sat silent till the of the sun then lifted he his head and stroked his beard and spake verily the sun goes down and my beard shines whiter than his and i shall die now therefore stand at my right hand son of my wise years child of my dreams stand at my right hand and ﬁt thy speech to music that men may hold in their hearts thy rounded words forever shalt thou keep thy place and utter thy true tale in the ears of the race and woe be unto them that hear thee not verily that generation shall pass cloud and its glory shall be tree that

herself only with limited number of subjects to be presented in predet ermined and conventional manner and form to such readers the word form means usually only repeated literary effect and they not understand that every form was in its ﬁrst and best use an originality employed not the purpose of following any rule but because it said truly what the artist wished to express i suppose much of the monotony of subject and treatment observable in modern verse is due to this belief that poetry is merely ﬁxed way of repeating certain meritorious though highly familiar concepts of not in the least the inﬁnite music of words meant to speak the little and the great tongues of the earth it is exhilarating to read the pages of pope and of byron whether you agree with them or not because here poetry

through them upon english poets and then through these last upon americans comes back to us in this and indirect way we have here an instance of what whitman calls perfect return we have denied poe we not give him his full meed of appreciation even today and yet we accept him through the disciples who have followed or have assimilated his tradition and now that young englishmen are beginning to feel the inﬂuence of whitman upon french poetry it may be that he too through the imitation of vers libr in america will begin to experience perfect return must we always accept american genius in this fashion have we true perspective that we applaud mediocrity at home and look abroad genius only to ﬁnd that it is of american origin this bit of marginalia extracted from of 1909 was relieved of the necessity of further elaboration by supplementary evidence received in one day from two correspondents one brief sentence from allen upward it is much to be wished that america should learn to honor her sons without waiting the literary cliques of london the other the following news note from paul scott mowrer in paris the date of léon bazalgette translation however is hardly so epochal it would seem since whitman has been known many years in france having been partly translated during the nineties mowrer writes it is signiﬁcant of american tardiness in the development of national literary tradition that the name of walt whitman is today greater inﬂuence with the young writers of the continent than with our own not since france discovered poe has literary europe been so moved by anything american the suggestion has even been made that is rapidly to supersede the dominant factor in modern thought léon bazalgette translated leaves of grass into french in school of followers of the whitman philosophy and style was an almost immediate consequence such of the leading reviews sympathize at all with the strong movement to break the shackles of classicism which have so long bound french prosody to the heroic couplet the sonnet and the alexandrine are publishing not only articles on movement but numbers of poems in the new ﬂexible chanting rhythms in this regard la nouvelle revue francaise la renaissance contemporaine and libre have been preëminently hospitable the new poems are not so much imitations of whitman inspirations from him those who have achieved most success in the mode thus far are perhaps georges duhamel leader of the whose plays are at present attracting national notice andré spire who writes with something of the apostolic fervor of his jewish ancestry henri franck who died recently shortly after the publication of his volume la danse devant charles vildrac with le livre philéas lebesgue the appearance in collected form of whose les servitudes is awaited with keen interest and ﬁnally jean richard bloch editor of libre whose prose example in his book of tales entitled levy is said to be directly rooted in whitmanism in germany too the rolling intonations of the singer of democracy have awakened echoes the moderne weltdichtung has announced itself with whitman guide and such apostles wilhelm schmidtbonn in lobegesang des lebens and ernst lissauer in der acker and der strom what is it about whitman that europe ﬁnds so inspiriting first his acceptance of the universe he found it his magniﬁcently shouted comradeship with all nature and all men such doctrine makes an instant though hardly logical appeal in nations where socialism is the political order of the day and next his disregard of literary tradition out of books more books and out of them still more with the fecundity of generations but in this process of literary propagation thought unfortunately instead of arising like child ever fresh and vigorous in the beginning grows pg 87 pg 88 pg 89 pg 90 the project gutenberg ebook of poetry magazine of verse edited by harriet monroe https and more attenuated paler more sickly the acclaim of whitman is nothing less than the inevitable revolt against the modern ﬂood of books write from nature directly from the people directly from the political meeting and the hayﬁeld and the is what the august american seems to his young disciples across the seas to be crying to them perhaps it is because america already holds commonplaces these fundamentals seeming so new to europe that the whitman schools have sprung up stronger on the eastern side of the atlantic than on the western it is not that america holds common places the fundamentals expressed in whitman that there have been more followers of the whitman method in europe than in america but that american poets approaching poetry usually through terms of feeling and apparently loath to apply an intellectual whip to themselv es or others have made deﬁnite analysis of the rhythmic units of whitman we have been content to accept the english conception of the barbaric yawp of whitman the curio us mingling of the concrete and the spiritual which is what certain modern painters perhaps under the whitman suggestion are trying to achieve was so novel to be disconcerting and the vehicle so original to appear unmusical the antiquated conception of english prosody is respon sible great deal of dead timber it is signiﬁcant fact that the english ﬁrst accepted the spirit of whitman the french his method the rhythmic measure of whitman has yet to be correctly estimated by english and american poets it has been sifted and weighed by the french poets and though whitman inﬂuence upon modern french poetry has been questioned by english critics the connection between his varied rhythmic units and modern vers libre is too obvious to be discounted there may be an innate necessity sufﬁcient to cause p of forms in poetic language but there is reason to believe that paris the great of all the arts would not be quick to adopt suggestion from without english poets certainly have not been loath to accept suggestions from paris at any rate this international accepta nce of the two greatest american poets and the realization of their international inﬂuence upon us may awaken us to new sense of responsibility it would be valuable lesson if only we could learn to turn the international eye in private upon ourselves if the american poet can learn to be less parochial to apply the intellectual whip to visualize his art to separate it and see it apart from himself we may learn then to appreciate the great poet when he is in our midst and not wait the approval of english or french critics tagore poem s the appearance of the poems of rabindranath tagore translated by himself from bengali into english is an event in the history of english poetry and of world poetry i not use these terms with the looseness of contemporary journalism questions of poetic art are serious not to be touched upon lightly or in spirit of bravura bengal is nation of ﬁfty million peop le the great age of bengali literature is this age in which we live and the ﬁrst bengali whom i heard singing the lyrics of tagore said simply one would say it is four y es we speak of it the age of rabindranath the six poems now published were chosen from hundred lyrics about to appear in book form they might just well have been any other six they not represent summit of attainment but an average these poems are cast in the original in metres perhaps the most ﬁnished and most subtle of any known to us if you reﬁne the art of the troubadours combine it with that of the pleiade and add to that the principle of the most advanced artists in vers libre you would get something like the system of bengali verse the sound of it when spoken is rather like good greek bengali is daughter of sanscrit which is kind of uncle or elder brother of the homeric idiom all this series of hundred poems are made to music tagore is not only the great poet of bengal he is also their great musician he teaches his songs and they are sung throughout bengal more or less the troubadours songs were sung through europe in the twelfth century and we feel here in london i think much the people of petrarch time must have felt about the

that greek was the lamp of our renaissance and its perfections have been the goal of our endeavor ever since i speak with all seriousness when i say that this beginning of our more intimate intercourse with bengal is the opening of another period one thing the content of this ﬁrst brief series of poems will destroy the popular conception of buddhism we in the occident are apt to regard it religion negative and the greek gave us humanism belief in mens sana in corpor sano belief in proportion and balance the greek shows us man the sport of the gods the sworn foe of fate and the natural forces the bengali brings to us the pledge of calm which we need overmuch in an age of steel and mechanics it brings quiet proclamation of the fellowship between man and the gods between man and nature it is all very well to object that this is not the ﬁrst time we have had this fellowship proclaimed but in the arts alone can we ﬁnd the inner heart of people there is deeper calm and deeper conviction in this eastern expression than we have yet attained it is by the arts alone that one people learns to meet another far distant people in friendship and respect i speak with all

everything from death and justice to the orchard of the moon but she has nothing arresting or important to say of any of these subjects and keen magic of phrase to give her warbling that intense vitality which would win her the undying fame prophesied by her loyal husband in his preface nevertheless her feeling is genuine her touch light and her tune quiet monotone of gentle soothing music

in poetry now so widely apparent there seemed reason why poetry one of the noblest of the arts should not take to itself visible organization well its sister arts of music and painting since it was certain that such organization contributed much to their advancement and appreciation poetry alone remained an isolated art save through the doubtful value of coteries dedicated to the study of some particular poet in the sense of fellowship of the creative sympathy of contact of the keener appreciation which must follow the wider knowled ge of an art poetry stood alone detached from these avenues open from the beginning to other arts the society was therefore founded with charter membership of about ﬁfty persons which included many of the poets doing signiﬁcant work together with critics and representatives of other arts the purpose from the outset being to include the appreciators of poetry well its producers it has grown to nearly two hundred members distributed from coast to coast and eventually it will probably resolve itself into branch societies with the chief organization now in new york such societies should have wide inﬂuence upon their respective communities in stimulating interest in the work of living poets to which the poetry society an or ganization is chieﬂy addressed since the passing of the poets the art of poetry like the art of painting has taken on new forms and become the vehicle of new message the poet of speaks through so different medium his themes are so diverse from those of the elder generation that he can not hope to ﬁnd his public in their lingering audience he must look to his contemporaries to those touched by the same issues and responsive to the same ideals to aid in creating this atmosphere the poet to be the nucleus of movement the wider knowledge of contemporaneous verse the poetry society of america took form and in its brief period has i think justiﬁed the idea of its promoters its meetings are held once month at the national arts club in new york with which it is afﬁliated and are given chieﬂy to the reading and discussion of poetry both of recently published volumes and of poems submi tted anonymously this feature has proved perhaps the most attractive and while criticism based upon one hearing of poem can not be taken authoritative it is often constructive and valuable the society is assembling an interesting collection of books twentieth century library of american poetry aside from its own collection it is taking steps to promote wider representation of modern poets in public libraries jessie

poet in exile ﬁnds that he has thus gained public and editorial suffrages in america and that the most effective way of increasing that public and those suffrages is to remain in exile and guard his foreign reputation meantime it is quite probable that serious poet will have grown weary of such open and unashamed colonialism that he will prefer to stay among people who are seriously interested in aesthetics and who know their own minds nothing is so hard to meet indifference blows are easier live man to endure than neglect the poet who cries out his message against stone wall will be silenced

her brief sojourn in her native country madame grouitch was student at the american school of archaeology in athens when she married the young servian diplomat who now represents his nation in london according to the speaker the servian national songs have kept alive the heroic spirit of the people during more than four centuries of turkish oppression through them each generation of the illiterate peasantry has fought once more the ancient wars and followed once more the ancient leaders even to the ﬁnal tragedy of the battle of kossovo where in 1377 they made their last brave stand against the mohamme dan invader whenever few people assemble festival some local bard perhaps an old shepherd or soldier blind beggar or reformed brigand will chant the old songs to the monotonous music of the gusle while the people dance the kolo there are thousands of songs in the servian epic says mme grouitch and each has many variants according to whether it is sung in bosnia herzegovina montenegro dalmatia servia bulgaria or macedonia all these political divisions are peopled by the servian race descended from the heroes whose deeds are the theme of such unwearied narration the bard is called the guslar from his instrument whose melancholy of fects the emotions and increases the pathos of the words the story is usually sad even when it proclaims the triumph of great deeds these songs invariably begin once it was so now it is told and they invariably end from the song fr om god health to you number of poems were read from mme mijatovich rather uninspired translation of the kossovo

continued to dwell hidden in the breast of the southern slav his body was enslaved but his soul was not his physical life was oppressed but his spiritual being remained free in the eighteenth century europe the servian national poetry and became conscious that the race survived well its ideals then serb and bulgar again appeared in current history and began to retrace the ancient boundaries all the conferences of all the powers can never diminish the hopes nor eclipse the glory of the serb race in the minds of the balkan peoples because the guslar who is their supreme national leader is forever telling them of that glory and urging them to concerted action against all outside foes it was the guslar who led the montenegrin serbs from one heroic victory to another so that war annals gladstone said more glorious than those of all the rest of the world it was the guslar who inspired kara geor ge and his heroic band of servian peasants to keep up their battle until free servia was born amid the roar of cannon at lule burgas and monastir i could hear the mighty voice of the guslar reminding serb and bulgar that their ﬁght was honored cross and golden liberty and they obeyed because it was the voice of their nation it is this irresistible national spirit which leads their armies and beside it the spirit of german training behind the turk is lifeless shadow the ottoman

presentation regarding rhythm to compose in sequence of the musical phrase not in sequence of metronome by these standards they judged all poetry and found most of it wanting they held also certain of
