horatius the battle of the lake regillus virginia the prophecy of lays of ancient rome by thomas babington macaulay https what is called the history of the kings and early consuls of rome is to great extent fabulous few scholars have since the time of beaufort ventured to deny it is certain that more than three hundred and sixty years after the date ordinarily assigned the foundation of the city the public records were with scarcely an exception destroyed by the gauls it is certain that the oldest annals of the commonwealth were compiled more than century and half after this destruction of the records it is certain therefore that the great latin writers of the augustan age did not possess those materials without which trustworthy account of the infancy of the republic could not possibly be framed those writers own indeed that the chronicles to which they had access were ﬁlled with battles that were never fought and consuls that were never inaugurated and we have abundant proof that in these chronicles events of the greatest importance such the issue of the war with porsena and the issue of the war with brennus were grossly misrepresented under these circumstances wise man will look with great suspicion on the legend which has come down to us he will perhaps be inclined to regard the princes who are said to have founded the civil and religious institutions of rome the sons of mars and the husband of egeria mere mythological personages of the same class with perseus and ixion he draws nearer to the conﬁnes of authentic history he will become less and less hard of belief he will admit that the most important parts of the narrative have some foundation in truth but he will distrust almost all the details not only because they seldom rest on any solid evidence but also because he will constantly detect in them even when they are within the limits of physical possibility that peculiar character more easily understood than deﬁned which distinguishes the creations of the imagination from the realities of the world in which we live the early history of rome is indeed far more poetical than anything else in latin literature the loves of the vestal and the god of war the cradle laid among the reeds of tiber the the wolf the shepherd cabin the recognition the fratricide the rape of the sabines the death of tarpeia the fall of hostus hostilius the struggle of mettus curtius through the marsh the women rushing with torn raiment and dishevelled hair between their fathers and their husbands the nightly meetings of and the nymph by the well in the sacred grove the ﬁght of the three romans and the three albans the purchase of the sibylline books the crime of tullia the simulated madness of brutus the ambiguous reply of the delphian oracle to the tarquins the wrongs of lucretia the heroic actions of horatius cocles of scaevola and of cloelia the battle of regillus won by the aid of castor and pollux the defense of cremera the touching story of coriolanus the still more touching story of virginia the wild legend about the draining of the alban lake the combat between valerius corvus and the gigantic gaul are among the many instances which will at once suggest themselves to every reader in the narrative of livy who was man of ﬁne imagination these stories retain much of their genuine character nor could even the tasteless dionysius distort and mutilate them into mere prose the poetry shines in spite of him through the dreary pedantry of his eleven books it is discernible in the most tedious and in the most superﬁcial modern works on the early times of rome it enlivens the dulness of the universal history and gives charm to the most meagre abridgements of goldsmith even in the age of plutarch there were discerning men who rejected the popular account of the foundation of rome because that accou nt appeared to them to have the air not of history but of romance or drama plutarch who was displeased at their incredulity had nothing better to say in reply to their arguments than that chance sometimes turns poet and produces trains of events not to be distinguished from the most elaborate plots which are constructed by art but though the existence of poetical element in the early history of the great city was detected so many ages ago the ﬁrst critic who distinctly saw from what source that poetical element had been derived was james perizonius one of the most acute and learned antiquaries of the seventeenth century his theory which in his own days attracted little or notice was revived in the present generation by niebuhr man who would have been the ﬁrst writer of his time if his talent communicating truths had borne any proportion to his talent investigating them that theory has been adopted by several eminent scholars of our own country particularly by the bishop of david by professor malde and by the lamented arnold it appears to be now generally received by men conversant with classical antiquity and indeed it rests on such strong proofs both internal and external that it will not be easily subverted popular exposition of this theory and of the evidence by which it lays of ancient rome by thomas babington macaulay https may not be without interes t even readers who are unacquainted with the ancient languages the latin literature which has come down to us is of later date than the commencement of the second punic war and consists almost exclusively of works fashioned on greek models the latin metres heroic elegiac lyric and dramatic are of greek origin the best latin epic poetry is the feeble echo of the iliad and odyssey the best latin eclogues are imitations of theocritus the plan of the most ﬁnished didactic poem in the latin tongue was taken from hesiod the latin tragedies are bad copies of the masterpieces of sophocles and euripides the latin philosophy was borrowed without alteration from the portico and the academy and the great latin orators constantly proposed to themselves patterns the speeches of demosthenes and l ysias but there was an earlier latin literature literature truly latin which has wholly perished which had indeed almost wholly perished long before those whom we are in the habit of regarding the greatest latin writers were born that literature abounded with metrical romanc es such are found in every country where there is much curiosity and intelligence but little reading and writing all human beings not utterly savage long some information about past times and are delighted by narratives which present pictures to the eye of the mind but it is only in very enlightened communities that books are readily accessible metrical composition therefore which in highly civilized nation is mere luxury is in nations imperfectly civilized almost necessary of life and is valued less on account of the pleasure which it gives to the ear than on account of the help which it gives to the memory man who can invent or embellish an interesting story and put it into form which others may easily retain in their recollection will always be highly esteemed by people eager amusement and information but destitute of libraries such is the origin of species of composition which scarcely ever fails to spring up and ﬂourish in every society at certain point in the progress towards reﬁnement tacitus informs us that songs were the only memorials of the past which the ancient germans possessed we learn from lucan and from ammianus marcellinus that the brave actions of the ancient gauls were commemorated in the verses of bards during many ages and through many revolution minstrelsy retaine d its inﬂuence over both the teutonic and the celtic race the vengeance exacted by the spouse of attila the murder of siegfried was celebrated in rhymes of which germany is still justly proud the exploits of athelstane were commemorated by the and those of canute by the danes in rude poems of which few fragments have come down to us the chants of the welsh harpers preserved through ages of darkness faint and doubtful memory of arthur in the highlands of scotland may still be gleaned some relics of the old songs about cuthullin and fingal the long struggle of the servians against the ottoman power was recorded in lays full of martial spirit we learn from herrera that when peruvian inca died men of skill were appointed to celebrate him in verses which all the people learned by heart and sang in public on days of festival the feats of kurroglou the great freebooter of turkistan recounted in ballads composed by himself are known in every village of northern persia captain beechey heard the bards of the sandwich islands recite the heroic achievements of tamehameha the most illustrious of their kings mungo park found in the heart of africa class of singing men the only annalists of their rude tribes and heard them tell the story of the victory which damel the negro prince of the jalof fs won over abdulkader the mussulman tyrant of foota torra this species of poetry attained high degree of excellence among the castilians before they began to copy tuscan patterns it attained still higher degree of excellence among the english and the lowland scotch during the fourteenth ﬁfteenth and sixteenth centuries but it reached its full perfection in ancient greece there can be doubt that the great homeric poems are generically ballads though widely distinguished from all other ballads and indeed from almost all other human composition by transcendent sublimity and beauty it is agreeable to general experience that at certain stage in the progress of society poetry should ﬂourish so is it also agreeable to general experience that at subsequent stage in the progress of society should be undervalued and neglected knowledge advances manners change great foreign models of composition are studied and imitated the phraseology of the old minstrels becomes obsolete their versiﬁcation which having receive d its laws only from the ear abounds in irregularities seem s licentious and uncouth their simplic ity appears beggarly when compared with the quaint forms and gaudy coloring of such artists cowley and gongora the ancient lays unjustly despised by the learned and polite linger time in the memory of the vulgar and are at length too often irretrievably lost we can not wonder that the ballads of rome should have altogether disappeared when we remember how very narrowly in spite of the lays of ancient rome by thomas babington macaulay https printing those of our own country and those of spain escaped the same fate there is indeed little doubt that oblivion covers many englis h songs equal to any that were published by bishop percy and many spanish songs good the best of those which have been so happily translated by lockhart eighty years ago england possessed only one tattered copy of childe waters and sir cauline and spain only one tattered copy of the noble poem of the cid the snuff of candle or mischievous dog might in moment have deprived the world forever of any of those ﬁne compositions sir walter scott who united to the ﬁre of great poet the minute curiosity and patient diligence of great antiquary was but just in time to save the precious relics of the minstrelsy of the border in germany the lay of the nibelungs had been long utterly forgotten when in the eighteenth century it was the ﬁrst time printed from manuscript in the old library of noble family in truth the only people who through their whole passage from simplicity to the highest civilization never moment ceased to love and admire their old ballads were the greeks that the early romans should have had and that this poetry should have perished is therefore not strange it would on the contrary have been strange if these things had not come to pass and we should be justiﬁed in pronouncing them highly probable even if we had direct evidence on the subject but we have direct evidence of unquestionable authority ennius who ﬂourished in the time of the second punic war was regarded in the augustan age the father of latin poetry he was in truth the father of the second school of latin poetry the only school of which the works have descended to us but from ennius himself we learn that there were poets who stood to him in the same relation in which the author of the romance of count alarcos stood to garcilaso or the author of the lytell geste of robyn hode to lord surrey ennius speaks of verses which the fauns and the bards were wont to chant in the old time when none had yet studied the graces of speech when none had yet climbed the peaks sacred to the goddesses of grecian song where cicero mournfully asks are those old verses now contemporary with ennius was quintus fabius pactor the earliest of the roman annalists his account of the infancy and youth of romulus and remus has been preserved by dionysius and contains very remarkable reference to the ancient latin poetry fabius says that in his time his countrymen were still in the habit of singing ballads about the twins even in the hut of faustulus these old lays appear to have run the children of rhea and mars were in port and in spirit not like unto swineherds or cowherds but such that men might well guess them to be of the blood of kings and gods cato the censor who also lived in the days of he second punic war mentioned this lost literature in his lost work on the antiquities of his country many ages he said before his time there were ballads in praise of illustrious men and these ballads it was the fashion the guests at banquets to sing in turn while the piper played would exclaims cicero that we still had the old ballads of which cato speaks valerius maximus gives us exactly similar information without mentioning his authority and observes that the ancient roman ballads were probably of more beneﬁt to the young than all the lectures of the athenian schools and that to the inﬂuence of the national poetry were to be ascribed the virtues of such men camillus and fabricus varro whose authority on all questions connected with the antiquities of his country is entitled to the greatest respect tells us that at banquets it was once the fashion boys to sing sometimes with and sometimes without instrumental music ancient ballads in praise of men of former times these young performers he observes were of unblemished character circumstanc which he probably mentioned because among the greeks and indeed in his time among the romans also the morals of singing boys were in high repute the testimony of horace though given incidentally conﬁrms the statements of cato valerius maximus and varro the poet predict s that under the peaceful administrati on of augustus the romans will over their full goblets sing to the pipe after the fashion of their fathers the deeds of brave captains and the ancient legends touching the origin of the city the proposition then that rome had is not merely in itself highly probable but is fully proved by direct evidence of the greatest weight this proposition being established it becomes easy to understand why the early history of the city is unlike almost everything else in latin literature native where almost everything else is borrowed imaginative where almost everything else is prosaic we can scarcely hesitate to pronounce that the magniﬁcent pathetic and truly national legends which present so striking contrast to all lays of ancient rome by thomas babington macaulay https them are broken and defaced fragments of that early poetry which even in the age of cato the censor had become antiquated and of which tully had never heard line that this poetry should have been suffered to perish will not appear strange when we consider how complete was the triumph of the greek genius over the public mind of italy it is probable that at an early period homer and herodotus furnished some hints to the latin minstrels but it was not till after the war with pyrrhus that the poetry of rome began to put off its old ausonian character the transformation was soon consummated the conquered says horace led captive the conquerors it was precisely at the time at which the roman people rose to unrivalled political ascendency that they stooped to pass under the intellectual yoke it was precisely at the time at which the sceptre departed from greece that the empire of her language and of her arts became universal and despotic the revolution indeed was not effected without struggle naevius seems to have been the last of the ancient line of poets ennius was the founder of new dynasty naevius celebrated the first punic war in saturnian verse the old national verse of italy ennius sang the second punic war in numbers borrowed from the iliad the elder poet in the epitaph which he wrote himself and which is ﬁne specimen of the early roman diction and versiﬁcation plaintively boasted that the latin language had died with him thus what to horace appeared to be the ﬁrst faint dawn of roman literature appeared to naevius to be its hopeless setting in truth one literature was setting and another dawning the victory of the foreign taste was decisive and indeed we can hardly blame the romans turning away with contempt from the rude lays which had delighted their fathers and giving their whole admiration to the immortal produ ctions of greece the national romanc es neglected by the great and the reﬁned whose education had been ﬁnished at rhodes or athens continued it may be supposed during some generations to delight the vulgar while virgil in hexameters of exquisite modulation described the sports of rustics those rustics were still singing their wild saturnian ballads it is not improbable that at the time when cicero lamented the irreparable loss of the poems mentioned by cato search among the nooks of the appenines active the search which sir walter scott made among the descendents of the mosstroopers of liddesdale might have brought to light many ﬁne remains of ancient minstrelsy such search was made the latin ballads perished forever yet discerning critics have thought that they could still perceive in the early history of rome numerous fragments of this lost poetry the traveller on classic ground sometimes ﬁnds built into the heavy wall of fort or convent pillar rich with acanthus leaves or frieze where the amazons and bacchanals seem to live the theatres and temples of the greek and the roman were degraded into the quarries of the turk and the goth even so did the ancient saturnian poetry become the quarry in which crowd of orators and annalists found the materials their prose it is not difﬁcult to trace the process by which the old songs were transmuted into the form which they now wear funeral panegyric and chronicle appear to have been the intermediate links which connected the lost ballads with the histories now extant from very early period it was the usage that an oration should be pronounced over the remains of noble roman the orator we learn from polybius was expected on such occasions to recapitulate all the services which the ancestors of the deceased had from the earliest time rendered to the commonwealth there can be little doubt that the speaker on whom this duty was imposed would make use of all the stories suited to his purpose which were to be found in the popular lays there can be little doubt that the family of an eminent man would preserve copy of the speech which had been pronounced over his corpse the compilers of the early chronicles would have recourse to these speeches and the great historians of later period would have recourse to the chronicles it may be worth while to select particular story and to trace its probable progress through these stages the description of the migration of the fabian house to cremera is one of the ﬁnest of the many ﬁne passages which lie thick in the earlier books of livy the consul clad in his military garb stands in the vestibule of his house marshalling his clan three hundred and six ﬁghting men all of the same proud patrician blood all worthy to be attended by the fasces and to command the legions sad and anxious retinue of friends accompanies the adventurers through the streets but the voice of lamentation is drowned by the shouts of admiring thousands the procession passes the capitol prayers and vows are poured forth but in vain the devoted band leaving janus on the right marches to its doom through the gate of evil luck after achieving high deeds of valor against overwhelming numbers all perish save one child the stock from which the great fabian race was destined again to spring the safety and glory of the commonwealth that this ﬁne romance the details of which are so full of poetical truth and so utterly destitute of all show of lays of ancient rome by thomas babington macaulay https came originally from some lay which had often been sung with great applause at banquets is in the highest degree probable nor is it difﬁcult to imagine mode in which the transmission might have taken place the celebrated quintu s fabius maximus who died about twenty years before the first punic war and more than forty years before ennius was born is said to have been interred with extraordinary pomp in the eulogy pronounced over his body all the great exploits of his ancestors were doubtless recounted and exaggerated if there were then extant songs which gave vivid and touching description of an event the saddest and the most glorious in the long history of the fabian house nothing could be more natural than that the panegyrist should borrow from such songs their ﬁnest touches in order to adorn his speech few generations later the songs would perhaps be forgotten or remembered only by shepherds and vinedressers but the speech would certainly be preserved in the archives of the fabian nobles fabius pictor would be well acquainted with document so interesting to his personal feelings and would insert large extracts from it in his rude chronicle that chronicle we know was the oldest to which livy had access livy would at glance distinguish the bold strokes of the forgotten poet from the dull and feeble narrative by which they were surrounded would retouch them with delicate and powerful pencil and would make them immortal that this might happen at rome can scarcely be doubted something very like this has happened in several countries and among others in our own perhaps the theory of perizonius can not be better illustrated than by showing that what he supposes to have taken place in ancient times has beyond all doubt taken place in modern times history says hume with the utmost gravity has preserved some instances of edgar amours from which from specimen we may form conjecture of the rest he then tells very agreeably the stories of elﬂeda and elfrida two stories which have most suspicious air of romance ad which indeed greatly resemble in their character some of the legends of early rome he cites his authority these two tales the chronicle of william of malmesbury who lived in the time of king stephen the great majority of readers suppose that the device by which elﬂeda was substituted her young mistress the artiﬁce by which athelwold obtained the hand of elfrida the detection of that artiﬁce the hunting party and the vengeance of the amorous king are things about which there is more doubt than about the execu tion of anne boleyn or the slitting of sir john coventry nose but when we turn to william of malmesbury we ﬁnd that hume in his eagerness to relate these pleasant fables has overlooked one very important circumstance william does indeed tell both the stories but he gives us distinct notice that he does not warrant their truth and that they rest on better authority than that of ballads such is the way in which these two tales have been handed down they originally appeared in poetical form they found their way from ballads into an old chronicle the ballads perished the chronicle remained great historian some centuries after the ballads had been altogether forgotten consulted the chronicle he was struck by the lively coloring of these ancient ﬁctions he transferred them to his pages and thus we ﬁnd inserted unquestionable facts in narrative which is likely to last long the english tongue the inventions of some minstrel whose works were probably never committed to writing whose name is buried in oblivion and whose dialect has become obsolete it must then be admitted to be possible or rather highly probable that the stories of romulus and remus and of the horatii and curiatti may have had similar origin castilian literature will furnish us with another parallel case mariana the classical historian of spain tells the story of the marriage which the king don alonso brought about between the heirs of carrion and the two daughters of the cid the cid bestowed princely dower on the but the young men were base and proud cowardly and cruel they were tried in danger and found wanting they ﬂed before the moors and once when lion broke out of his den they ran and crouched in an unseemly they knew that they were despise d and took counsel how they might be avenged they parted from their father with many signs of love and set forth on journey with doña elvira and doña sol in solitary place the bridegrooms seized their brides stripped them scour ged them and departed leaving them dead but one of the house of bivar suspecting foul play had follow ed the travellers in disguise the ladies were brought back safe to the house of their father complaint was made to the king it was adjudged by the cortes that the dower given by the cid should be returned and that the heirs of carrion together with one of their kindred should battle against three knights of the party of the cid the guilty youths would have declined the combat but all their shifts were in vain they were vanquished in the lists and forever disgraced while their injured wives were sought in marriage by great lays of ancient rome by thomas babington macaulay https spanish writers have labored to show by an examination of dates and circumstances that this story is untrue such confutation was surely not needed the narrative is on the face of it romance how it found its way into mariana history is quite clear he acknowledges his obligations to the ancient chronicles and had doubtless before him the cronica del famoso cavallero cid ruy diez campeador which had been printed early the year he little suspected that all the most striking passages in this chronicle were copied from poem of the twelfth century poem of which the language and versiﬁcation had long been obsolete but which glowed with common portion of the ﬁre of the iliad yet such is the fact more than century and half after the death of mariana this venerable ballad of which one imperfect copy on parchment four hundred years old had been preserved at bivar was the ﬁrst time printed then it was found that every interesting circumstance of the story of the heirs of carrion was derived by the eloquent jesuit from song of which he had never heard and which was composed by minstrel whose very name had been long forgotten such or nearly such appears to have been the process by which the lost of rome was transformed into history to reverse that process to transform some portions of early roman history back into the poetry out of which they were made is the object of this work in the following poems the author speaks not in his own person but in the persons of ancient minstrels who know only what roman citizen born three or four hundred years before the christian may be supposed to have known and who are in wise above the passio ns and prejudices of their age and nation to these imaginary poets must be ascribed some blunders which are so obvious that is unnecessary to point them out the real blunder would have been to represent these old poets deeply versed in general history and studious of chronological accuracy to them must also be attributed the illiberal sneers at the greeks the furious party spirit the contempt the arts of peace the love of war its own sake the ungenerous exultation over the vanquished which the reader will sometimes observe to portr ay roman of the age of camillus or curius superior to national antipathies mourning over the devastation and slaughter by which empire and triumphs were to be won looking on human suffering with the sympathy of howard or treating conquered enemies with the delicacy of the black prince would be to violate all dramatic propriety the old romans had some great virtues fortitude temperance veracity spirit to resist oppression respect legitimate authority ﬁdelity in the observing of contracts disin terestedness ardent patriotism but christian charity and chivalrous generosity were alike unknown to them it would have been obviously imprope r to mimic the manner of any particular age or country something has been borrowed however from our own old ballads and more from sir walter scott the great restorer of our to the iliad still greater obligations are due and those obligations have been contracted with the less hesitation because there is reason to believe that some of the old latin minstrels really had recourse to that inexhaustible store of poetical images it would have been easy to swell this little volume to very considerable bulk by appending notes ﬁlled with quotations but to learned reader such notes are not necessary an unlearned reader they would have little interest and the judgment passed both by the learned and by the unlearned on work of the imagination will always depend much more on the general charac ter and spirit of such work than on minute details horatius there can be little doubt that among those parts of early roman history which had poetical origin was the legend of horatius cocles we have several versions of the story and these versions differ from each other in points of small importance polybius there is reason to believe lays of ancient rome by thomas babington macaulay https tale recited over the remains of some consul or prætor descended from the old horatian patricians he introduces it specimen of the narratives with which the romans were in the habit of embellishing their funeral orator it is remarkable that according to him horatius defended the bridge alone and perished in the waters according to the chronicles which livy and dionysius followed horatius had two companions swam safe to shore and was loaded with honors and rewards these discrepancies are easily explained our own literature indeed will furnish an exact parallel to what may have taken place at rome it is highly probably that the memory of the war of porsena was preserved by compositions much resembling the two ballads which stand ﬁrst in the relics of ancient english poetry in both those ballads the english commanded by the percy ﬁght with the scots commanded by the douglas in one of the ballads the douglas is killed by nameless english archer and the percy by scottish spearman in the other the percy slays the douglas in single combat and is himself made prisoner in the former sir hugh montgomery is shot through the heart by northumbrian bowman in the latter he is taken and exchanged the percy yet both the ballads relate to the same event and that event which probably took place within the memory of persons who were alive when both the ballads were made one of the minstrels says old men that knowen the grounde well yenoughe call it the battell of otterburn at otterburn began this spurne upon monnyn day ther was the dougghte doglas slean the perse never went away the other poet sums up the event in the following lines thys fraye bygan at otterborne bytwene the nyghte and the day ther the doglas lost hys lyfe and the percy was lede away it is by means unlikely that there were two old roman lays about the defence of the bridge and that while the story which livy has transmitted to us was preferred by the multitude the other which ascribed the whole glory to horatius alone may have been the favorite with the horatian house the following ballad is supposed to have been made about hundred and twenty years after the war which it celebrates and just before the taking of rome by the gauls the author seems to have been an honest citizen proud of the military glory of his country sick of the disputes of factions and much given to pining after good old times which had never really existed the allusion however to the partial manner in which the public lands were allotted could proceed only from plebeian and the allusion to the fraudulent sale of spoils marks the date of the poem and shows that the poet shared in the general discontent with which the proceedings of camullus after the taking of veii were regarded the penultimate syllable of the name porsena has been shortened in spite of the authority of niebuhr who pronounces without assigning any ground his opinion that martial was guilty of decided blunder in the line hanc spectare manum porsena non potuit it is not easy to understand how any modern scholar whatever his attainments may be those of niebuhr were undoubtedly immense venture to pronounce that martial did not know the quantity of word which he must have uttered and heard uttered hundred times before he left school niebuhr seems also to have forgotten that martial has fellow culprits to keep him in countenance horace has committed the same decided blunder he give us pure iambic line minacis aut etrusca porsenæ dextram silius italicus has repeatedly offended in the same way when he says clusinum vulgus cum porsena magne jubebas modern writer may be content to err in such company niebuhr supposition that each of the three defenders of the bridge was the representative of one of the three patrician tribes is both ingenious and probable and has been adopted in the lays of ancient rome by thomas babington macaulay https horatius lay made about the year of the city ccclx i lars

through the loom with weeping and with laughter still is the story told how well horatius kept the bridge in the brave days of old the battle of the lake lays of ancient rome by thomas babington macaulay https following poem is supposed to have been produced about ninety years after the lay of horatius some persons mentioned in the lay of horatius make their appearance again and some appellations and epithets used in the lay of horatius have been purposely repeated in an age of it scarcely ever fails to happen that certain phrases come to be appropriated to certain men and things and are regularly applied to those men and things by every minstrel thus we ﬁnd both in the homeric poems and in hesiod several examples of common phrases in greek thus too in our own national songs douglas is almost always the doughty douglas england is merry england all the gold is red and all the ladies are gay the principal distinction between the lay of horatius and the lay of the lake regillus is that the former is meant to be purely roman while the latter though national in its gene ral spirit has slight tincture of greek learning and of greek superstition the story of the tarquins it has come down to us appears to have been compiled from the works of several popular poets and one at least of those poets appears to have visited the greek colonies in italy if not greece itself and to have had some acquaintance with the works of homer and herodotus many of the most striking adventures of the house of tarquin before lucretia makes her appearance have greek character the tarquins themselves are represented corinthian nobles of the great hous of the bacchiadæ driven from their country by the tyranny of that cypselus the tale of whose strange escape herodotus has related with incomparable simplicity and liveliness livy and dionysius tell us that when tarquin the proud was asked what was the best mode of governing conquered city he replied only by beating down with his staff all the tallest poppies in his garden this is exactly what herodotus in the passage to which reference has already been made relates of the counsel given to periander the son of cypselus the stratagem by which the town of gabii is brought under the power of the tarquins is again obviously copied from herodotus the embassy of the young tarquins to the oracle at delphi is just such story would be told by poet whose head was full of the greek mythology and the ambiguous answer returned by apollo is in the exact style of the prophecies which according to herodotus lured croesus to destruction then the character of the narrative changes from the ﬁrst mention of lucretia to the retreat of porsena nothing seems to be borrowed from foreign sources the villainy of sextus the suicide of his victim the revolution the death of the sons of brutus the defence of the bridge musius burning his hand cloelia swimming through tiber seem to be all strictly roman but when we have done with the tuscan wars and enter upon the war with the latines we are again struck by the greek air of the story the battle of the lake regillus is in all respects homeric battle except that the combatants ride astride on their horses instead of driving chariots the mass of ﬁghting men is hardly mentioned the leaders single each other out and engage hand to hand the great object of the warriors on both sides is in the iliad to obtain possession of the spoils and bodies of the slain and several circumstances are related which forcibly remind us of the great slaughter round the corpses of sarpedon and patroclus but there is one circumstance which deserves especial notice both the war of troy and the war of regillus were caused by the licentious passions of young princes who were therefore peculiarly bound not to be sparing of their own persons on the day of battle now the conduct of sextus at regillus described by livy so exactly resembles that of paris described at the beginning of the third book of the iliad that it is difﬁcult to believe the resemblance accidental paris appears before the trojan ranks defying the bravest greek to encounter him 3 lines from the iliad in greek probably those translated by pope to the van before the sons of fame whom troy sent forth the beauteous paris came livy introduces sextus in similar manner ferocem juvenem tarquinium ostentantem in prima exsulum acie menelaus rushes to meet paris roman noble eager vengeance spurs his horse towards sextus both the guilty princes are instantly terror 3 more lines in greek pope translation being menelaus approaching near the beauteous champion views with marks of fear smit with conscious sense retires behind and shuns the fate he well deserv to lays of ancient rome by thomas babington macaulay https tarquinius says livy retro in agmen suorum infenso cessit hosti if this be fortuitous coincidence it is also one of the most extraordinary in literature in the following poem therefore images and incidents have been borrowed not merely without scruple but on principle from the incomparable of homer the popular belief at rome from an early period seems to have been that the event of the great day of regillus was decided by supernatural agency castor and pollux it was said had fought armed and mounted at the head of the legions of the commonwealth and had afterwards carried the news of the victory with incredible speed to the city the well in the forum at which they had alighted was pointed out near the well rose their ancient temple great festival was kept to their honor on the ides of quintilis supposed to be the anniversary of the battle and on that day sumptuous sacriﬁces were offered to them at the public charge one spot on the margin of lake regillus was regarded during many ages with superstitious awe mark resembling in shape horse hoof was discernible in the volcanic rock and this mark was believed to have been made by one of the celestial char gers how the legend originated can not now be ascertained but we may easily imagine several ways in which it might have originated nor is it at all necessary to suppose with julius frontinus that two young men were dressed up by the dictator to personate the sons of leda it is probable that livy is correct when he says that the roman general in the hour of peril vowed temple to castor if so nothing could be more natural than that the multitude should ascribe the victory to the favor of the twin gods when such was the prevailing sentiment any man who chose to declare that in the midst of the confusion and slaughter he had seen two godlike forms on white horses scattering the latines would ﬁnd ready credence we know indeed that in modern times very similar story actually found credence among people much more civilized than the roman s of the ﬁfth century before christ chaplain of cortes writing about thirty years after the conquest of mexico in an age of printing presses libraries universities scholars logicians jurists and statesmen had the face to assert that in one engagement against the indians james had appeared on gray horse at the head of the castilian adventurers many of those adventurers were living when this lie was printed one of them honest bernal diaz wrote an account of the expedition he had the evidence of his own senses against the legend but he seems to have distrusted even the evidence of his own senses he says that he was in the battle and that he saw gray horse with man on his back but that the man was to his thinking francesco morla and not the apostle james nevertheless bernal adds it may be that the person on the gray horse was the glorious apostle james and that i sinner that i am was unworthy to see him the romans of the age of cincinatus were probably quite credulous the spanish subjects of charles the fifth it is therefore conceivable that the appearance of castor and pollux may be become an article of faith before the generation which had fought at regillus had passed away nor could anything be more natural than that the poets of the next age should embellish this story and make the celestia l horsemen bear the tidings of victory to rome many years after the temple of the twin gods had been built in the forum an important addition was made to the ceremonial by which the state annually testiﬁed its gratitude their protection quintus fabius and publius decius were elected censors at momentous crisis it had become absolutely necessary that the classiﬁcation of the citizens should be revised on that classiﬁcation depended the distribution of political power party spirit ran high and the republic seemed to be in danger of falling under the dominion either of narrow oligarchy or of an ignorant and headstrong rabble under such circumstances the most illustrious patrician and the most illustrious plebeian of the age were entrusted with the ofﬁce of arbitrating between the angry factions and they performed their arduous task to the satisfaction of all honest and reasonable men one of their reforms was the remodelling of the equestrian order and having effected this reform they determined to give to their work sanction derived from religion in the chivalrous societies of modern times which have much more than may at ﬁrst sight appear in common with with the equestrian order of rome has been usual to invoke the special protection of some saint and to observe his day with peculiar solemnity thus the companions of the garter wear the image of geor ge depending from their collars and meet on great occasions in geor ge chapel thus when louis the fourteenth instituted new order of chivalry the rewarding of military merit he commended it to the favor of his own gloriﬁed ancestor and patron and decreed that all the members of the fraternity should meet at the royal palace on the feast of louis shou ld attend the king to chapel should hear mass and should subsequently hold their great annual assembly there is lays of ancient rome by thomas babington macaulay https resemblance between this rule of the order of louis and the rule which fabius and decius made respecting the roman knights it was ordained that grand muster and inspection of the equestrian body should be part of the ceremonial performed on the anniversary of the battle of regillus in honor of castor and pollux the two equestrian gods all the knights clad in purple and crowned with olive were to meet at temple of mars in the suburbs thence they were to ride in state to the forum where the temple of the twins stood this pageant was during several centuries considered one of the most splendid sights of rome in the time of dionysius the cavalcade sometimes consisted of ﬁve thousand horsemen all persons of fair repute and easy fortune there can be doubt that the censors who instituted this august ceremony acted in concert with the pontif fs to whom by the constitution of rome the superintendence of the public worship belonged and it is probable that those high religious functionaries were usual fortunate enough to ﬁnd in their books or traditions some warrant the innovation the following poem is supposed to have been made this great occasion songs we know were chanted at religious festivals of rome from an early period indeed from so early period that some of the sacred verses were popularly ascribed to and were utterly unintelligible in the age of augustus in the second punic war great feast was held in honor of juno and song was sung in her praise this song was extant when livy wrote and though exceedingly rugged and uncouth seemed to him not wholly destitute of merit song we learn from horace was part of the established ritual at the great secular jubilee it is therefore likely that the censors and pontif fs when they had resolved to add grand procession of knights to the other solemnities annually performed on the ides of quintilis would call in the aid of poet such poet would naturally take his subject the battle of regillus the appearance of the twin gods and the institution of their festival he would ﬁnd abundant mater ials in the ballads of his predecessors and he would make free use of the scanty stock of greek learning which he had himself acquired he would probably introduce some wise and holy pontif f enjoining the magniﬁcent ceremonial which after long interval had at length been adopted if the poem succeeded many persons would commit it to memory parts of it would be sung to the pipe at banquets it would be peculia rly interesting to the great posthumian house which numbered among its many images that of the dictator aulus the hero of regillus the orator who in the following generation pronounced the funeral panegyric over the remains of lucius posthumius megellus thrice consul would borrow largely from the lay and thus some passages much disﬁgured would probably ﬁnd their way into the chronicles which were afterwards in the hands of dionysius and livy antiquaries differ widely to the situation of the ﬁeld of battle the opinion of those who suppose that the armies met near cornufelle between frascati and the mont porzio is at least plausible and has been followed in the poem to the details of the battle it has not been thought desirable to adhere minutely to the accounts which have come down to us those accounts indeed differ widely from each other and in all probability differ widely from the ancient poem from which they were originally derived it is unnecessary to point out the obvious imitations of the iliad which have been purposely introduced the battle of the lake regillus lay sung at the feast of castor and pollux on the ides of quintilis in the year of the city ccccli

who fought so well rome virginia collection consisting exclusively of would give an imperfect or rather an erroneous notion of the spirit of the old latin ballads the patricians during more than century after the expulsion of the kings held all the high military commands plebeian even though like lucius siccius he were distinguished by his valor and knowledge of war could serve only in subordinate posts minstrel therefore who wished to celebrate the early triumphs of his country could hardly take any but patricians his heroes the warriors who are mentioned in the two preceding lays horatius lartius herminius aulus posthumius æbutius elva sempronius atratinus valerius poplicola were all members of the dominant order and poet who was singing their praises whatever his own political opinions might be would naturally abstain from insulting the class to which they belonged and from reﬂectin g on the system which had placed such men at the head of the legions of the commonwealth but there was class of compositions in which the great families were by means so courteously treated parts of early roman history are richer with poetical coloring than those which relate to the long contest between the privileged houses and the commonality the population of rome was from very early period divided into hereditary castes which indeed readily united to repel foreign enemies but which regarded each other during many years with bitter animosity between those castes there was barrier hardly less strong than that which at venice parted the members of the great council from their countrymen in some respects indeed the line which separated an icilius or duilius from posthumius or fabius was even more deeply marked than that which separated the rower of gondola from contarini or morosini at venice the distinction was merely civil at rome it was both civil and religious among the grievances under which the plebeians suffered three were felt peculiarly severe they were excluded from the highest magistracies they were excluded from all share in the public lands and they were ground down to the dust by partial and barbarous legislation touching pecuniary contracts the ruling class in rome was moneyed class and it made and administered the laws with view solely to its own interest thus the relation between lender and borrower was mixed up with the relation between sovereign and subject the great men held large portion of the community in dependence by means of advances at enormous usury the law of debt framed by creditors and the protection of creditors was the host horrible that has ever been known among men the liberty and even the life of the insolvent were at the mercy of the patrician children often became slaves in consequence of the misfortunes of their parents the debtor was imprisoned not in public jail under the care of impartial public functionaries but in private workhouse belonging to the creditor frightful stories were told respecting these dungeons it was said that torture and brutal violation were common that tight stocks heav y chains scanty measures of food were used to punish wretches guilty of nothing but poverty and that brave soldiers whose breasts were covered with honorable scars were often marked still more deeply on the back by the scour ges of usurers the plebeians were however not wholly without constitutional rights from an early period they had been admitted to some share of political power they were enrolled each in his century and were allowed share considerable though not proportioned to their numerical strength in the disposal of those high dignities from which they were themselves excluded thus their position lays of ancient rome by thomas babington macaulay https resemblance to that of the irish catholics during the interval between the year 1792 and the year the plebeians had also the privilege of annually appointing ofﬁce rs named tribunes who had active share in the government of the commonwealth but who by degree acquired power formidable even to the ablest and most resolute consuls and dictators the person of the tribune was inviolable and though he could directly ef fect little he could obstruct everything during more than century after the institution of the tribuneship the commons struggled manfully the removal of the grievances under which they labored and in spite of many checks and reverses succeeded in wringing concession after concession from the stubborn aristocracy at length in the year of the city 378 both parties mustered their whole strength their last and most desperate conﬂict the popular and active tribune caius licinius proposed the three memorable laws which are called by his name and which were intended to redress the three great evils of which the plebeians complained he was supp orted with eminent ability and ﬁrmne ss by his colleague lucius sextius the struggle appears to have been the ﬁercest that every in any community terminated without an appeal to arms if such contest had raged in any greek city the streets would have run with blood but even in the paroxysms of faction the roman retained his gravity his respect law and his tenderness the lives of his fellow citizens year after year licinius and sextius were reëlected tribunes year after year if the narrative which has come down to us is to be trusted they continued to exert to the full extent their power of stopping the whole machine of government curule magistrates could be chosen military muster could be held we know too little of the state of rome in those days to be able to conjecture how during that long anarchy the peace was kept and ordinary justice administered between man and man the animosity of both parties rose to the greatest height the excitement we may well suppose would have been peculiarly intense at the annual election of tribunes on such occasions there can be little doubt that the great families did all that could be done by threats and caresses to break the union of the plebeians that union however proved indissoluble at length the good cause triumphed the licinian laws were carried lucius sextius was the ﬁrst plebeian consul caius licinius the third the results of this great change were singularly happy and glorious two centuries of prosperity harmony and victory followed the reconciliation of the orders men who remembered rome engaged in waging petty wars almost within sight of the capitol lived to see her the mistress of italy while the disabilities of the plebeians continued she was scarcely able to maintain her ground against the volscians and hernicans when those disabilities were removed she rapidly became more than match carthage and macedon during the great licinian contest the plebeian poets were doubtless not silent even in modern times songs have been by means without inﬂuence on public affairs and we may therefore infer that in society where printing was unknown and where books were rare pathetic or humorous must have produced effects such we can but faintly conceive it is certain that satirical poems were common at rome from very early period the rustics who lived at distance from the seat of government and took little part in the strife of factions gave vent to their petty local animosities in coarse fescennine verse the lampoons of the city were doubtless of higher order and their sting was early felt by the nobility in the twelve tables long before the time of the licinian laws severe punishment was denounced against the citizen who should compose or recite verses reﬂecting on another satire is indeed the only sort of composition in which the latin poets whose works have come down to us were not mere imitators of foreign models and it is therefore the only sort of composition in which they have never been rivalled it was not like their tragedy their comedy their epic and lyric poetry hothouse plant which in return assiduous and skilful culture gave only scanty and sickly fruits it was hardy and full of sap and in all the various juices which it yielded might be distinguished the ﬂavor of the ausonian soil satire said quinctilian with just pride is all our own satire sprang in truth naturally from the const itution of the roman government and from the spirit of the roman people and though at length subjected to metrical rules derived from greece retained to the last an essentially roman character lucilius was the earliest satirist whose works were held in esteem under the caesars but many years before lucilius was born nævius had been ﬂung into dungeon and guarded there with circumstances of unusual rigor on account of the bitter lines in which he had attacked the great caecilian family the genius and spirit of the roman satirists survived the liberty of their country and were not extinguished by the cruel despotism of the julian and flavian emperors the great poet who told the story of domitian turbot was the legitimate successor of those forgotten minstrels whose songs animated the factions of the infant lays of ancient rome by thomas babington macaulay https minstrels niebuhr has remark ed appear to have generally taken the popular side we can hardly be mistaken in supposing that at the great crisis of the civil conﬂict they employed themselves in versifying all the most powerful and virulent speeches of the tribunes and in heaping abuse on the leaders of the aristocracy every personal defect every domestic scandal every tradition dishonorable to noble house would be sought out brought into notice and exaggerated the illustrious head of the aristocratica l party marcus furius camillus might perhaps be in some measure protected by his venerable age and by the memory of his great services to the state but appius claudius crassus enjoyed such immunity he was descended from long line of ancestors distinguished by their haughty demeanor and by the inﬂexibility with which they had withstood all the demands of the plebeian order while the political conduct and the deportment of the claudian nobles drew upon them the ﬁercest public hatred they were accused of wanting if any credit is due to the early history of rome class of qualities which in military commonwealth is sufﬁcient to cover multitude of offences the chiefs of the family appear to have been eloquent versed in civil business and learned after the fashion of their age but in war they were not distinguished by skill or valor some of them if conscious where their weakness lay had when ﬁlling the highest magistracies taken internal administration their department of public business and left the military command to their colleagues one of them had been entrusted with an army and had failed ignominiously none of them had been honored with triumph none of them had achieved any martial exploit such those by which lucius quinctius cincinnatus titus quinctius capitolinus aulus cornelius cossus and above all the great camillus had extorted the reluctant esteem of the multitude during the licinian conﬂict appius claudius crassus signalized himself by the ability and severity with which he harangued against the two great agitators he would naturally therefore be the favorite mark of the plebeian satirists nor would they have been at loss to ﬁnd point on which he was open to attack his grandfather called like himself appius claudius had left name much detested that sextus tarquinius this elder appius had been consul more than seventy years before the introduction of the licinian laws by availing himself of singular crisis in public feeling he had obtained the consent of the commons to the abolition of the tribuneship and had been the chief of that council of ten to which the whole direction of the state had been committ ed in new months his administration had become universally odious it had been swept away by an irresistible outbreak of popular fury and its memory was still held in abhorrence by the whole city the immediate cause of the downfall of this execrable government was said to have been an attempt made by appius claudius upon the chastity of beautiful young girl of humble birth the story ran that the decemvir unable to succeed by bribes and solicitations resorted to an outrageo us act of tyranny vile dependent of the claudian house laid claim to the damsel his slave the cause was brought before the tribunal of appius the wicked magistrate in deﬁance of the clearest proofs gave judgment the claimant but the girl father brave soldier saved her from servitude and dishonor by stabbing her to the heart in the sight of the whole forum that blow was the signal general explosion camp and city rose at once the ten were pulled down the tribuneship was reëstablished and appius escaped the hands of the executioner only by voluntary death it can hardly be doubted that story so admirably adapted to the purposes both of the poet and of the demagogue would be eagerly seized upon by minstrels burning with hatred against the patrician order against the claudian house and especially against the grandson and namesake of the infamous decemvir in order that the reader may judge fairly of these fragments of the lay of virginia he must imagine himself plebeian who has just voted the reëlection of sextius and licinius all the power of the patricians has been exerted to throw out the two great champions of the commons every posthumius æmilius and cornelius has used his inﬂuence to the utmost debtors have been let out of the workhouses on condition of voting against the men of the people clients have been posted to hiss and interrupt the favorite candidates appius claudius crassus has spoken with more than his usual eloquence and asperity all has been in vain licinius and sextius have ﬁfth time carried all the tribes work is suspended the booths are closed the plebeians bear on their shoulders the two champions of liberty through the forum just at this moment it is announced that great poet zealous adherent of the tribunes has made new song which will cut the claudian nobles to the heart the crowd gathers round him and calls on him to

danced along she warbled gayly to herself lines of the good old song how sport the princes came spurring from the camp and found lucrece combing the fleece under the midnight lamp the maiden sang

whizzing through the air pebbles and bricks and potsherds all round the curule chair and upon appius claudius great fear and trembling came never was claudius yet brave against aught but shame though the great houses love us not we own to them right that the great houses all save one have borne them well in fight still caius of corioli his triumphs and his wrongs his vengeance and his mercy live in our songs beneath the yoke of furius oft have gaul and tuscan bowed and rome may bear the pride of him of whom herself is proud but evermore claudius shrinks from stricken field and changes color like maid at sight of sword and shield the claudian triumphs all were won within the city towers the claudian yoke was never pressed on any necks but ours cossus like wild cat springs ever at the face fabius rushes like boar against the shouting chase but the vile claudian litter raging with currish spite still yelps and snaps at those who run still runs from those who smite so now was seen of appius when stones began to fly he shook and crouched and wrung his hands and smote upon his thigh kind clients honest lictors stand by in this fray must i be torn in pieces home home the nearest way while yet he spake and looked around with bewildered stare four sturdy lictors put their necks beneath the curule chair and fourscore clients on the left and fourscore on the right arrayed themselves with swords and staves and loins girt up to fight but though without or staff or sword so furious was the throng that scarce the train with might and main could bring their lord along twelve times the crowd made at him five times they seized his gown small chance was his to rise again if once they got him down and sharper came the pelting and evermore the yell tribunes we will have tribunes rose with louder swell and the chair tossed tosses bark with tattered sail when raves the adriatic beneath an eastern gale when calabrian are lost in clouds of spume and the great has donned his veil of inky gloom one stone hit appius in the mouth and one beneath the ear and ere he reached mount palatine he swooned with pain and fear his cursed head that he was wont to hold so high with pride now like drunken man hung down and swayed from side to side and when his stout retainers had brought him to his door his face and neck were all one cake of filth and clotted gore appius claudius was that day so may his grandson be god send rome one such other sight and send there to see the pr ophecy of lays of ancient rome by thomas babington macaulay https can hardly be necessary to remind any reader that according to the popular tradition romulus after he had slain his granduncle amulius and restored his grandfather numito r determined to quit alba the hereditary domain of the sylvian princes and to found new city the gods it was added vouchsafed the clearest signs of the favor with which they regarded the enterprise and of the high destinies reserved the young colony this event was likely to be favorite theme of the old latin minstrels they would naturally attribute the project of romulus to some divine intimation of the power and prosperity which it was decreed that his city should attain they would probably introduce seers foretelling the victories of unborn consuls and dictators and the last great victory would generall y occupy the most conspicuous place in the prediction there is nothing strange in the supposition that the poet who was employed to celebrate the ﬁrst great triumph of the romans over the greeks might throw his song of exultation into this form the occasion was one likely to excite the strongest feelings of national pride great outrage had been followed by great retribution seven years before this time lucius posthumius megellus who sprang from one of the noblest houses of rome and had been thrice consul was sent ambassador to tarentum with charge to demand reparation grievous injuries the tarentines gave him audience in their theatre where he addressed them in such greek he could command which we may well believe was not exactly such cineas would have spoken an exquisite sense of the ridiculous belonged to the greek character and closely connected with this faculty was strong propensity to ﬂippancy and impertinence when posthumius placed an accent wrong his hearers burst into laugh when he remonstrated they hooted him and called him barbarian and at length hissed him off the stage if he had been bad actor the grave roman retired buffoon who from his constant drunkenness was nicknamed the came up with gestures of the grossest indecency and bespattered the senatorial gown with ﬁlth posthumius turned round to the multitude and held up the gown if appealing to the universal law of nations the sight only increased the insolence of the tarentines they clapped their hands and set up shout of laughter which shook the theatre men of tarentum said posthumius it will take not little blood to wash this gown rome in consequence of this insult declared war against the tarentines the tarentines sought allies beyond the ionian sea phyrrhus king of epirus came to their help with large army and the ﬁrst time the two great nations of antiquity were fairly matched against each other the fame of greece in arms well in arts was then at the height half century earlier the career of alexander had excited the admiration and terror of all nations from the ganges to the pillars of hercules royal houses founded by macedonian captains still reigned at antioch and alexandria that barbarian warriors led by barbarian chiefs should win pitched battle against greek valor guided by greek science seemed incredible it would now seem that the burmese or the siamese should in the open plain put to ﬂight an equal number of the best english troops the tarentines were convinced that their countrymen were irresistible in war and this conviction had emboldened them to treat with the grossest indignity one whom they regarded the representative of an inferior race of the greek generals then living pyrrhus was indisputably the ﬁrst among the troops who were trained in the greek discipline his epirotes ranked high his expedition to italy was in the history of the world he found there people who far inferior to the athenians and corinthians in the ﬁne arts in the speculative sciences and in all the reﬁnements of life were the best soldiers on the face of the earth their arms their gradations of rank their order of battle their method of intrenchment were all of latin origin and had all been gradually brought near to perfection not by the study of foreign models but by the genius and experience of many generations of great native commanders the ﬁrst words which broke from the king when his practised eye had surveyed the roman encampment were full of meaning these barbarians he said have nothing barbarous in their military arrangements he was at ﬁrst victorious his own talents were superior to those of the captains who were opposed to him and the romans were not prepared the onset of the elephants of the east which were then the ﬁrst time seen in mountains with long snakes hands but the victories of the epirotes were ﬁercely disputed dearly purchased and altogether unproﬁtable at length manius curius dentatus who had in his ﬁrst consulship won two triumphs was again placed at the head of the roman commonwealth and sent to conquer the invaders great battle was fought near beneventum pyrrhus was completely defeated he repassed the sea and the world learned lays of ancient rome by thomas babington macaulay https that people had been discovered who in fair ﬁghting were superior to the best troops that had been drilled on the system of parmenio and antigonus the conquerors had good right to exult in their success their glory was all their own they had not learned from their enemy how to conquer him it was with their own national arms and in their own national battle array that they had overcome weapons and tactics long believed to be invincible the pilum and the broadsword had vanquished the macedonian spear the legion had broken the macedonian phalanx even the elephants when the surprise produced by their ﬁrst appearance was over could cause disorder in the steady yet ﬂexible battalions of rome it is said by florus and may easily be believed that the triumph far surpassed in magniﬁcence any that rome had previously seen the only spoils which papirius cursor and fabius maximus could exhibit were ﬂocks and herds wagons of rude structure and heaps of spears and helmets but now the ﬁrst time the riches of asia and the arts of greece adorned roman pageant plate ﬁne stuffs costly furniture rare animals exquisite paintings and sculptures formed part of the procession at the banquet would be assembled crowd of warriors and statesmen among whom manius curius dentatus would take the highest room caius fabricius luscinus then after two consulships and two triumphs censor of the commonwealth would doubtless occupy place of honor at the board in situations less conspicuous probably lay some of those who were few years later the terror of carthage caius duilius the founder of the maritime greatness of his country marcus atilius regulus who owed to defeat renown far higher than that which he had derived from his victories and caius lutatius catalus who while suffering from grievous wound fought the great battle of the æates and brought the first punic war to triumphant close it is impossible to recount the names of these eminent citizens without reﬂecting that they were without exception plebeians and would but the ever memorable struggle maintained by caius licinius and lucius sextius have been doomed to hide in obscurity or to waste in civil broils the capacity and energy which prevailed against pyrrhus and hamilcar on such day we may suppose that the patriotic enthusiasm of latin poet would vent itself in reiterated shouts of io triumphe such were uttered by horace on far less exciting occasion and in boasts resembling those which virgil put into the mouth of anchises the superiority of some foreign nations and especially of the greeks in the lazy arts of peace would be admitted with disdainful candor but preëminence in all the qualities which ﬁt people to subdue and govern mankind would be claimed the romans the following lay belongs to the latest age of latin nævis and livius andronicus were probably among the children whose mothers held them up to see the chariot of curius go by the minstrel who sang on that day migh t possibly have lived to read the ﬁrst hexameters of ennius and to see the ﬁrst comedies of plautus his poem might be expected shows much wider acquaintance with the geography manners and productions of remote nations than would have been found in compositions of the age of camillus but he troubles himself little about dates and having heard travellers talk with admiration of the colossus of rhodes and of the structures and gardens with which the macedonian king of syria had embellished their residence on the banks of the orontes he has never thought of inquiring whether these things existed in the age of romulus the prophecy of capys lay sung at the banquet in the capitol on the day whereon manius curius dentatus second time consul triumphed over king pyrrhus
