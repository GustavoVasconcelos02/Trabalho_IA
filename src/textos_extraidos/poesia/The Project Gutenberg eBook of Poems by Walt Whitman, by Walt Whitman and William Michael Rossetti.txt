swinburne i found with much satisfaction that he also was an ardent not of course blind admirer of whitman satisfaction and degree almost of surprise his intense sense of poetic reﬁnement of form in his own works and his exacting acuteness critic might have seemed likely to carry him away from whitman in sympathy at least if not in actual latitude of perception those who ﬁnd the american poet utterly formless intolerably rough and ﬂoundering destitute of the b c of art and the like might not unproﬁtably ponder this very different estimate of him by the author of atalanta in calydon may we

print my estimate and admiration of the works of the american poet walt whitman 1 like stone dropped into pond an article of that sort may spread out its concentric circles of consequences one of these is the invitation which i have received to edit selection from whitman writings virtually the ﬁrst sample of his work ever published in england and offering the ﬁrst tolerably fair chance he has had of making his way with english readers on his own showing hitherto such the small percentage of them to whom it the project gutenberg ebook of poems by walt whitman by walt whitman and william michael rossetti https to come across the poems in some one of their american picked acquaintance with them only through the medium of newspaper extracts and criticisms mostly sneering and depreciatory and rather intercepting than forwarding the candid construction which people might be willing to put upon the poems alike in their beauties and their aberrations some english critics doubt have been more s fox of old in the dispatch the writer of the notice in the leader and of late two in the pall mall gazette and the london review 2 but these have been the exceptions among us the great majority of the reviewers presenting that happy and familiar critical scurrility and superciliousness footnote 1 see the chr onicle 6th july 1867 article walt whitman poems footnote 2 since this prefatory notice was written in 1868 another eulogistic review of whitman has by mr robert buchanan in the broadway it was my lot to set down so recently several of the considerations which seem to most essential and most obvious in regard to whitman writings i can scarcely now recur to the subject without either repeating something of what i then said or else leaving unstated some points of principal importance i shall therefore adopt the simplest of summarising the critical remarks in my former article after which i shall leave without further development ample is the amount of development most of them would claim the particular topics there glanced at and shall proceed to some other phases of the subject whitman republished in 1867 his complete poetical works in one sized volume consisting of the whole leaves of grass with sort of supplement thereto name d songs befor parting 3 and of the drum taps with its sequel it has been intimated that he does not expect to write any more poems unless it migh t be in expression of the religious side of man nature however one poem on the last american harvest sown and reaped by those who had been soldiers in the great war has already appeared since the volume in question and has been republished in england footnote 3 in copy of the book revised by whitman himself which we have seen this title is modiﬁed into songs of parting whitman poems present trace of rhyme save in couple or so of chanc instances parts of them indeed may be regarded warp of prose amid the weft of poetry such shakespeare furnishes the precedent in drama still there is very powerful and majestic rhythmical sense throughout lavish and persistent has been the abuse poured forth upon whitman by his own countrymen the tricklings of the british press give but moderate idea of it the poet is known to repay scorn with scorn emerson can however from the ﬁrst be claimed on whitman side nor it is understood after some inquiry has that great thinker since then retreated from this position in fundamen tals although his admiration may have entailed some worry upon him and reports of his recantation have been rife of other writers on whitman side expressing themselves with measured enthusiasm one may cite conway who wrote pamphlet named the good grey poet and the project gutenberg ebook of poems by walt whitman by walt whitman and william michael rossetti https author of walt whitman poet and person published quite recently in new york his admirers declare whitman to be beyond rivalry the poet of the epoch an estimate which startling it will sound at the ﬁrst may nevertheless be upheld on the grounds that whitman is beyond all his competitors man of the period one of audacious personal ascendant incapable of all compromise and an initiator in the scheme and form of his works certain faults are charged against him and far they are true shall frankly stand of them very serious faults firstly he speaks on occasion of gross things in gross crude and plain terms secondly he uses some words absurd or structed others which produce jarring effect in poetry or indeed in any lofty literature thirdly he sins from time to time by being obscure fragmentary and long strings of successive and detached items not however devoid of certain primitive effectiveness fourthly his assertion is boundless yet not always to be understood strictly or merely personal to himself but sometimes vicarious the poet speaking on behalf of all men and every man and woman these and any other faults appear most harshly on cursory reading whitman is poet who bears and needs to be read whole and then the volume and torrent of his power carry the disﬁgurements along with it and away the of whitman poems taken individually is absolutely miscellaneous he touches upon any and every subject but he has preﬁxed to his last edition an inscription in the following terms showing that the of the whole book are and en masse small is the theme of the following chant yet the that wondrous thing simple separate person that the use of the new world i sing man physiology complete from top to toe i sing not physiognomy alone nor brain alone is worthy the muse i say the form complete is worthier far the female equally with the male i sing nor cease at the theme of i speak the word of the modern the word en masse my days i sing and the interstice i knew of hapless war friend you are at last arriving hither to commence i feel through every leaf the pressure of your hand which i return and thus upon our journey linked together let us go the book then taken whole is the poem both of personality and of democracy and it may be added of american nationalism it is par excellence the modern poem it is distinguished also by this that in it the most literal view of things is continually merging into the most rhapsodic or passionately abstract picturesqueness it has but mostly of somewhat patriarchal kind not derivin g from the of the littérateur certain echo of the old hebrew poetry may even be caught in it though it is another most prominent and pervading quality of the book is the exuberant physique of the author the conceptions are throughout those of man in robust health and might alter much under different conditions further there is strong tone of parado x in whitman writings he is both realist and an optimist in extreme measure he contem plates evil in some sense not existing or if existing then being of much importance anything else not that he is materialist on the contrary he is most strenuous assertor of the soul and with the soul of the body its infallible associate and vehicle in the present frame of things neither does he drift the project gutenberg ebook of poems by walt whitman by walt whitman and william michael rossetti https or indifferentism the energy of his temperament and sympathy with national and other developments being an effectual bar to this the paradoxical element of the poems is such that one may sometimes ﬁnd them in conﬂict with what has preceded and would not be much surprised if they said at any moment the reverse of whatever they say this is mainly due to the multiplicity of the aspects of things and to the immense width of relation in which whitman stands to all sorts and all aspects of them but the greatest of this poet distinctions is his absolute and entire originality he may be termed formless by those who not without much reason to show themselves are wedded to the established forms and ratiﬁed reﬁne ments of poetic art but it seems reasonable to enlar ge the canon till it includes so great and startling genius rather than to draw it close and exclude him his work is practically certain to stand archetypal many future poetic great is his power an originator so fervid his initiative it forms incomparably the largest performance of our period in poetry victor hugo légende des siècles alone might be named with it largeness and even that with much less of new in conception and treatment whitman breaks with all precedent to what he himself perceives and knows he has personal relation of the intensest kind to anything in the way of prescription relation at all but he is saved from isolation by the depth of his americanism with the movement of his predominant nation he is moved his comprehension energy and tenderness are all extreme and all inspired by actualities and poetic genius those who without being ready to concede that faculty to whitman confess his iconoclastic boldness and his titanic power of temperament working in the sphere of poetry in ef fect confess his genius well such still further condensed was the critical summary which i gave of whitman position among poets it remains to say something little more precise of the particular qualities of his works and ﬁrst not to slur over defect s i shall extract some sentences from letter which friend most highly entitled to form and express an opinion on any poetic too who abundantly upholds the greatness of whitman addressed to with regard to the criticism above condensed his observations though severe on this individual point appear to not other than correct i think that you quite put strength enough into your blame on one side while you make at least enough of minor faults or eccentri cities to it seems always that whitman great ﬂaw is fault of debility not an excess of mean his bluster his own personal and national and arrogance i need not tell you i applaud and sympathise and rejoice in but the blatant ebullience of feeling and speech at times is feeble so great poet of so great people he is in part certainly the poet of democracy but not wholly because he tries so openly to be and asserts so violently that he is always if he was ﬁghting the case out on platform this is the only thing i really or greatly dislike or revolt from on the whole adds my correspondent my admiration and enjoyment of his greatness grow keener and warmer every time i think of him feeling i may be permitted to observe which is fully shared by myself and i suppose by all who consent in any adequate measure to recognise whitman and to yield themselves to his inﬂuence to continue besides originality and daring which have been already insisted upon width and intensity are leading characteristics of his both of and of comprehension intensity of ion into what the poet contemplates and expresses he scans and presents an enormous panorama unrolled before him from the project gutenberg ebook of poems by walt whitman by walt whitman and william michael rossetti https whatever most large or most minute or casual thing his eye glances upon that he enters into with depth of affection which identiﬁes him with it time be the object what it may there is singular interchange also of actuality and of ideal substratum and suggestion while he sees men with even abnormal exactness and sympathy men he sees them also trees walking and admits us to perceive that the whole show is in measure spectral and unsubstantial and the mask of larger and profounder reality beneath it of which it is giving perpetual intimations and auguries he is the poet indeed of literality but of passionate and signiﬁcant literality full of indirections well directness and of readings between the lines if he is the of yankees he is also truly an enthusiast any the most typical poet all his faculties and performance glow into white heat of brotherliness and there is poignancy both of tenderness and of beauty about his ﬁner works which discriminates them quite much their modernness audacity or any other exceptional point if the reader wishes to see the great and more intimate powers of whitman in their fullest expression he may consult the nocturn the death of lincoln than which it would be difﬁcult to ﬁnd anywhere purer more elevated more poetic more ideally abstract or at the same time more pathetically personal the thrilling chords of grief of beauty of triumph and of ﬁnal unfathomed satisfaction with all his singularities whitman is master of words and of sounds he has them at his and instinct with his of unsurpassable sympathy and intelligen ce between himself and his readers the entire book may be called the paean of the natural of the merely physical still less of the disjunctively intellectual or spiritual man but of him who being man ﬁrst and foremost is therein also spirit and an intellect there is singular and impressive intuition or revelation of swedenbor g that the whole of heaven is in the form of one man and the separate societies of heaven in the forms of the several parts of man in large sense the general drift of whitman writings even down to the passages which read most bluntly physical bear striking correspondence or analogy to this dogma he takes man and every organism and faculty of man the which all that we know discern and speculate of abstract and supersensual well of concrete and sensual has to be computed he knows of nothing nobler than that unit man but knowing that he can use it any multiple and any dynamical extension or recast let us next obtain some idea of what this most remarkable founder of american poetry rightly to be so called and the most sonorous poetic voice of the tangibilities of actual and prospective in his proper life and person walt whitman was born at the of west hills long island in the state of new york and about thirty miles distant from the capital on the 31st of may his father family english by origin had already been settled in this locality ﬁve generations his mother named louisa van velsor was of dutch extraction and came from cold spring queen county about three miles from west hills old lady she has been termed in her advanced age large family ensued from the marriage the father was farmer and afterwards carpenter and builder both parents adhered in religion to the great quaker iconoclast elias hicks walt was schoo led at brooklyn suburb of new york and began life at the age of thirteen working printer later on country teacher and then miscellaneous in new york from 1837 to 1848 he had burroughs too promiscuously expresses it sounded all experiences of life with all their passions the project gutenberg ebook of poems by walt whitman by walt whitman and william michael rossetti https abandonments in 1849 he began travelling and became at new orleans newspaper editor and at brooklyn two years afterwards printer he next followed his father business of carpenter and builder in 1862 after the of the great civil war in which his enthusiastic unionism and also his feelings attached him inseparably though not rancorously to the good cause of the north he undertook the nursing of the sick and wounded in the ﬁeld writing also correspondence in the new york times i am informed that it was through emerson intervention that he obtained the sanction of president lincoln this purpose of charity with authority to draw the ordinary army rations whitman stipulating at the same time that he would not receive any remuneration his services the ﬁrst immediate occasion of his going down to camp was on behalf of his brother olonel geor ge whitman of the 51st new york veterans who had been struck in the face by piece of shell at fredericksbur from the spring of 1863 this nursing both in the ﬁeld and more especially in hospital at washington became his one daily and nightly occupation and the strongest testimony is borne to his measureless and kindliness in the work and to the unbounded fascination kind of magnetic attraction and ascendency whic h he exercised over the patients often with the happiest sanitary results northerner or southerner the belligerents received the same tending from him it is said that by the end of the war he had personally ministered to upwards of sick and wounded in washing ton hospital he caught in the summer of 1864 the ﬁrst illness he had ever known caused by poison absorbed into the system in attending some of the worst cases of gangrene it disabled him six months he returned to the hospitals towards the beginning of 1865 and obtained also clerkship in the department of the interior it should be added that though he never actually joined the army combatant he made point of putting down his name on the lists the draft to take his chance it might happen serving the countr y in arms the reward of his devotedness came at the end of june 1865 in the form of dismissal from his clerkship by the minister harlan who learned that whitman was the author of the leaves of grass book whose outspokenness or the ofﬁcial chief considered it immorality raised holy horror in the ministerial breast the poet however soon obtained another modest but creditable post in the ofﬁce of the he still visits the hospitals on sundays and often on other days well the portrait of whitman reproduced in the present volume is taken from an engraving after daguerreotype given in the original leaves of grass he is much above the average size and noticeably model of physique and of health and by natural consequence fully and ﬁnely related to all physical facts by his bodily constitution to all mental and spiritual facts by his mind and his consciousness he is now however his years and might even according to the statement of one of his enthusiasts have passed being beyond the age the draft when the war was going on the same gentleman in confutation of any inferences which might be drawn from the leaves of grass by harlan or other holy willie afﬁrms that one more irreproachable in his relations to the other sex lives not upon this earth assertion which one must take one ﬁnds it having neither conﬁrmatory nor traversing evidence at hand whitman has light blue eyes ﬂorid complexion ﬂeecy beard now grey and quite peculiar sort of magnetism about him in relation to those with whom he comes in contact his ordinary appearance is masculine and cheerful he never shows depression of spirits and is sufﬁciently undemonstra and even somewhat silent in company he has always been carried by predilection towards the society of the common people but is not the less that open to reﬁned and artistic the project gutenberg ebook of poems by walt whitman by walt whitman and william michael rossetti https operatic and other good music and discerning in works of art to either praise or blame of what he writes he is totally indifferent not to say in fact very decisive opinion of his own concerning its calibre and destinies thoreau very congenial spirit said of whitman he is democracy and again after all he suggests somethin g little more than human lincoln broke out into the exclamation well he looks like man whitman responded to the instinctive appreciation of the president considering him it is said by burroughs by far the noblest and purest of the political characters of the time and if anything can cast in the eyes of posterity an added halo of brightness round the unsullied personal qualities and the great doings of lincoln it will assuredly be the written monument reared to him by whitman the best sketch that i know of whitman an accessible human individual is that given by conway 4 i borrow from it the following few details having occasion to visit new york soon after the appearance of walt whitman book i was urged by some friends to search him the day was excessively hot the thermometer at nearly and the sun blazed down only on sandy long island can the sun i saw stretched upon his back and gazing up straight at the terrible sun the man i was seeking with his grey clothing his grey shirt his hair his swart sunburnt face and bare neck he lay upon the the sun had burnt away its was so like the earth upon which he rested that he seemed almost enough part of it one to pass by without recognition i approached him gave my name and reason searching him out and asked him if he did not ﬁnd the sun rather hot at all too hot was his reply and he conﬁded to that this was one of his favourite places and attitudes composing he then walked with to his home and took along its narrow ways to his room small room of about ﬁfteen feet square with single window looking out on the barren solitudes of the island small cot with little hung over it from tack in the wall pine table with pen ink and paper on it an old representing bacchus hung on the wall and opposite similar one of silenus these constituted the visible environments of walt whitman there was not apparently single book in the the books he seemed to know and love best were the bible homer and shakespeare these he owned and probably had in his pockets while we were talking he had two studies where he read one was the top of an omnibus and the other small mass of sand then entirely uninhabited far out in the ocean called coney the only distinguished contemporary he had ever met was the rev henry ward beecher of brooklyn who had visited he confessed to having talent industry and that his forte was and writing poems he was poor but had discovered that he could on the whole live magniﬁcently on bread and on occasion did he laugh nor indeed did i ever see him smile footnote 4 in the fortnightly review 15th october 1866 the ﬁrst trace of whitman writer is in the pages of the democratic review in or about here he wrote some prose tales and stuff mostly so far i have seen of them yet not to be wholly confounded with the commonplace one of them is tragic incident which may be surmised to have fallen under his personal observation in his early experience teacher his ﬁrst poem of any sort was named blood money in denunciation of the fugitive slave law which severed him from the democratic party his ﬁrst considerable work was the leaves of grass he began it in 1853 and it underwent two or three the project gutenberg ebook of poems by walt whitman by walt whitman and william michael rossetti https prior to its publication at brooklyn in 1855 in quarto but with something perceptibly artistic about it the type of that edition was set up entirely by himself he was moved to undertake this formidable poetic work indicated in private letter of whitman from which conway has given sentence or two by his sense of the great materials which america could offer really american poetry and by his contempt the current work of his either the poetry of an elegantly weak sentimentalism at bottom nothing but maudlin puerilities or more or less musical verbiage arising out of life of depression and enervation their result or else that class of poetry plays of which the foundation is feudalism with its ideas of lords and ladies its imported standard of gentility and the manners of european in every line and verse thus incited to poetic whitman adds conway wrote on sheet of paper in large letters these words the work and ﬁxed it above his table where he could always see it whilst writing thenceforth every cloud that ﬂitted over him every distant sail every face and form encountered wrote line in his book the leaves of grass excited sort of notice until letter from emerson 5 appeared expressing deep sense of its power and magnitude he termed it the most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom that america has yet contributed footnote 5 burroughs to whom i have recourse most biogra phical facts concerning whitman is careful to note in order that misapprehension may arise on the subject that up to the time of his publishing the leaves of grass the author had not read either the essays or the poems of emerson the edition of about thousand copies sold off in less than year towards the end of 1856 second edition in 16mo appeared printed in new york also of about thousand copies its chief feature was an additional poem beginning woman waits it excited considerable storm another edition of about four to ﬁve thousand copies duodecimo came out at boston in including number of new pieces the drum taps consequent upon the war with their sequel which comprises the poem on lincoln followed in 1865 and in 1867 i have already noted complete edition of all the poems including supplement named songs befor parting the ﬁrst of all the leaves of grass in point of date was the long and powerful composition entitled walt whitman the most typical and memorable of all of his productions but shut out from the present selection reasons given further on the ﬁnal edition shows numerous and considerable variations from all its precursors evidencing once again that whitman is by mean s the writer panoplied in rude art and egotistic that many people suppose him to be even since this issue the book has been slightly revised by its author own hand with special view to possible english circulation the copy so revised has reached through the liberal and friendly hands of conway after my selection had already been decided on and the few departures from the last printed text which might on comparison be found in the present volume are due to my having had the advantage of following this revised copy in all other respects i have felt bound to reproduce the last edition without so much considering whether here and there i might personally prefer the readings of the earlier issues the selection here offered to the english reader contains little less than half the entire bulk of whitman poetry my choice has proceeded upon two simple rules ﬁrst to omit the project gutenberg ebook of poems by walt whitman by walt whitman and william michael rossetti https poem which could with any tolerable fairness be deemed offensive to the feelings of morals or propriety in this peculiarly nervous age and second to include every remaining poem which appeared to of conspicuous beauty or interest i have also inserted the very remarkable prose preface which whitman printed in the original edition of leaves of grass an edition that has become literary rarity this preface has not been reproduced in any later publication although its materials have to some extent been worked up into poems of subsequent date 6 from this prose composition contrary to what has been my rule with any of the poems it has appeared to permissible to omit two or three short phrases which would have shocked ordinary readers and the retention of which had i held it obligato ry would have entailed the exclusion of the preface itself whole footnote 6 compare instance the preface pp 38 39 with the poem to foiled revolter or revoltr ess p 133 few words must be added to the indecencies scattered through whitman writings indecencies or still better deforming may rightly be termed to call them immoralities would be going too far whitman ﬁnds himself and other men and women to be compound of soul and body he ﬁnds that body plays an extremely prominent and determining part in whatever he and other mundane dwellers have cognisance of he perceives this to be the necessary condition of things and therefore he fully and openly accepts it the right condition and he knows of reason why what is universally seen and known necessary and right should not also be allowed and proclaimed in speech that such view of the matter is entitled to great deal of weight and at any rate to candid consideration and construction appears to not to admit of doubt neither is it dubious that the contrary view the only view which british nineteenth century admits endurable amounts to the condemnation of nearly every great or eminent literary work of past time whatever the century it belongs to the country it comes from the department of writing it illustrates or the degree or sort of merit it possesses tenth second or ﬁrst century before eighth fourteenth ﬁfteenth sixteenth seventeenth or even eighteenth century is still the same book whose admits possible of an impropriety according to current notions can be depended upon to fail of containing such impropriety can if those notions are accepted the canon be placed with sense of securi ty in the hands of girls and youths or read aloud to women and this holds good just much of severely moral or plainly descriptive of avowedly playful knowing or licentious books my part i am far from thinking that earlier state of literature and the public feeling from which it sprang the wrong and our present condition the only right one equally far therefore am i from indignantly condemning whitman every startling allusion or expression which he has admitted into his book and which i from motives of policy have excluded from this selection except indeed that i think many of his tabooed passages are extremely raw and ugly on the ground of poetic or literary art whatever aspect they may bear in morals i have been rigid in exclusion because it appears to highly desirable that fair verdict on whitman should now be pronounced in england on poetic grounds alone and because it was clearly impossible that the book with its audacities of topic and of expression included should run the same chance of justice and of circulation through reﬁned minds and hands which may possibly be accorded to it after the rejection of all such peccant poems already intimated i have not in single instance excised any parts of poems to so would have been i conceive less wrongful towards the illustrious american than repugnant and indeed unendurable the project gutenberg ebook of poems by walt whitman by walt whitman and william michael rossetti https who aspire to bowdlerian honours the consequence is that the reader loses in toto several important poems and some extremely ﬁne the one previously alluded to of quite exceptional value and excellence entitled walt whitman i sacriﬁce them grudgingly and yet willingly because i believe this to be the only thing to with due regard to the one reasonable object which selection can of paving the way towards the issue and unprejudiced reception of complete edition of the poems in england the beneﬁt of misconstructionists let add in distinct terms that in respect of morals and propriety i neither admire nor approve the incriminated passages in whitman poems but on the contrary consider that most of them would be much better away and in respect of art i doubt whether even one of them deserves to be retained in the exact phraseology it at present exhibits this however does not amount to saying that whitman is vile man or corrupt or corrupting writer he is none of these the only division of his poems into sections made by whitman himself has been noted above leaves of grass songs befor parting supplementary to the preceding and drum taps with their sequel the peculiar title leaves of grass has become almost inseparable from the name of whitman it seems to express with some aptness the simplicity universality and spontaneity of the poems to which it is applied songs befor parting may indicate that these compositions close whitman poetic roll drum taps are of course songs of the civil war and their sequel is mainly on the same theme the chief poem in this last section being the one on the death of lincoln these titles all apply to fully arranged series of compositions the present volume is not in the same sense fully arranged series but selection and the relation of the poems inter appears to to depend on altered conditions which however narrowed they are it may be well frankly to recognise in practice i have therefore redistributed the poems latitude of action which i trust the author may not object to bringing together those whose seems to warrant it however far separated they may possibly be in the original volume at the same time i have retained some characteristic terms used by whitman himself and have named my sections chants democratic poems of democ racy drum taps war songs walt whitman personal poems leaves of grass unclassiﬁed poems songs of parting missives the ﬁrst three designations explain themselves the fourth leaves of grass is not so specially applicable to the particular poems of that section here i should have liked it to be but i could not consent to drop this typical name the songs of parting my ﬁfth section are compositions in which the poet express es his own sentiment regarding his works in which he forecasts their future or consigns them to the reader consideration it deserves mention that in the copy of whitman last american edition revised by his own hand previously noticed the series termed songs of parting has been recast and made to consist of poems of the same character those included in my section comparatively few of whitman poems have been endowed by himself with titles properly so called most of them are merely headed with the opening words of the poems i was looking long while to get betimes in boston town when lilacs last in the bloomed and so on it seems to that in selection such lengthy and circuitous method of identifying the poems is not desirable i should wish them to be remembered the project gutenberg ebook of poems by walt whitman by walt whitman and william michael rossetti https repeatable and signiﬁcant titles i have therefore supplied titles of my own to such pieces bear none in the original edition wherever real title appears in that edition i have retained it with these remarks i commend to the english reader the ensuing selection from writer whom i sincerely believe to be whatever his faults of the order of great poets and by means of pretty good ones i would urge the reader not to ask himself and not to return any answer to the questions whether or not this poet is like other or not the particular application of rules of art which is found to hold good in the works of those others and to constitute part of their excellence can be

illiterate person that humbles and mocks the power of the noblest expressive genius the poet sees certainty how one not great artist may be just sacred and perfect the greatest artist the power to destroy or remould is freely used by him but never the power of attack what is past is past if he does not expose superior models and prove himself by every step he takes he is not what is wanted the

or exclusiveness or the ignominy of nativity or colour or delusion of hell or the necessity of hell and man thenceforward shall be degraded ignorance or weakness or sin the greatest poet hardly knows

heaven and the orbs the forests mountains and rivers are not small themes but folks expect of the poet to indicate more than the beauty and dignity which always attach to dumb real objects expect him to indicate the path between reality and their souls men and women perceive the beauty well probably well he the passionate tenacity of hunters woodmen early risers cultivators of gardens and orchards and ﬁelds the love of healthy women the manly form seafaring persons drivers of horses the passion light and the open air all is an old varied sign of the unfailing perception of beauty and of residence of the poetic in outdoor people they can never be assisted by poets to perceive some may but they never can the poetic quality is not marshalled in rhyme or uniformity or abstract addresses to things nor in melancholy complaints or good precepts but is the life of these and much else and is in the soul the proﬁt of rhyme is that it drops seeds of sweeter and more luxuriant rhyme and of uniformity that it conveys itself into its own roots in the ground out of sight the rhyme and uniformity of perfect poems show the free growth of metrical laws and bud from them unerringly and loosely

he shall he shall go directly to the creation his trust shall master the trust of everything he touches and shall master all attachment the known universe has one complete lover and that is the greatest poet he consumes an eternal passion and is indifferent which chance happens and which possible contingency of fortune or misfortune and persuades daily and hourly his delicious pay what balks

the light or dark nor an acre of the earth or sea without any direction of the sky nor any trade or employment nor any turn of events this is the reason that about the proper expression of beauty there is precision and balance part does not need to be thrust above another the best singer is not the one who has the most lithe and powerful organ the pleasure of poems is not in them that take the handsomest measure and similes and sound without effort and without exposing in the least how it is done the greatest poet brings the spirit of any or all events and passions and scenes and persons some more and some less to bear on your individual character you hear or read to this well is to compete with the laws that pursue and follow time what is the purpose must surely be there and the clue of it must be there and the faintest indication is the indication of the best and then becomes the clearest indication past and present and future are not disjoined but joined the greatest poet forms

them again on their feet he says to the past rise and walk before that i may realise you he learns the places himself where the future becomes present the greatest poet does not only dazzle his rays

his last smile or frown by that ﬂash of the moment of parting the one that sees it shall be encouraged or terriﬁed afterward many years the greatest poet does not moralise or make applications of morals knows the soul the soul has that measureless pride which consists in never acknowledging any lessons but its own but it has sympathy measureless its pride and the one balances the other and neither can stretch too far while it stretches in company with the other the inmost secrets of art sleep with the twain the greatest poet has lain close betwixt both and they are vital in his style and thoughts the art of art the glory of expression and the sunshine of the light of letters is simplicity nothing is better than simplicity can make up excess or the lack of deﬁniteness to carry on the heave of impulse and pierce intellectual depth s and give all subjects their articulations are powers neither common nor very uncommon but to speak in literature with the perfect rectitude and insousiance of the movements of animals and the unimpeachableness of the sentiment of trees in the woods and grass by the roadside is the ﬂawless triumph of art if you have looked on him who has achieved it you have looked on one of the masters of the artists of all nations and times you shall not contemplate the ﬂight of the over the bay or the mettlesome action of the or the tall leaning of sunﬂowers on their stalk or the appearance of the sun journeying through heaven or the appearance of the moon afterward with any more satisfaction than you shall contemplate him the greatest poet has less marked style and is more the channel of thoughts and things without increase or diminution and is the free channel of himself he swears to his art will not be meddlesome i will not have in my writing any elegance or effect or originality to hang in the way between and the rest like curtains i will have nothing hang in the way not the richest curtains what i tell i tell precisely what it is let who may exalt or startle or fascinate or soothe i will have purposes health or heat or snow has and be regardless of observation what i experience or pourtray shall go from my composition without shred of my composition you shall stand by my side and look in the mirror with the old red blood and stainless gentility of great poets will be proved by their unconstraint heroic person walks at his

causality with perfect sense of the oneness of nature and the propriety of the same spirit applied to human these are called up of the ﬂoat of the brain of the world to be parts of the greatest poet from his birth caution seldom goes far enough it has been thought that the prudent citizen was the citizen who applied himself to solid gains and did well himself and his family and completed lawful life without debt or crime the greatest poet sees and admits these economies he sees the economies of food and sleep but has higher notions of prudence than to think he gives much when he gives few slight attentions at the latch of the gate the premises of the prudence of life are not the hospitality of it or the ripeness and harvest of it beyond the independence of little sum laid aside and of
