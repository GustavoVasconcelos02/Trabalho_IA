1889 introduction again on behalf of readers of this national l ibrar y i have to thank poet of our in this case the oxford professor of joining his voice to the voices of the past through which our better life is quickened the duties of not his own verse only but his ﬁne sense also of what is truest in the poets who have gone before the name of francis turner palgrave is familiar to us all many home has been made the richer his gathering of voices of the past into dainty golden treasury of english of this work of his own i may cite what was said of it in macmillan s magazine october 1882 by writer of high authority in english literature professor ward of owens college very eminent authority said professor ward has accorded to mr palgrave s historical insight praise by the side of which all words of mine must be valueless canon now bishop stubbs writes i not think that there is one of the visions which does not carry my thorough consent and sympathy all p the visions of england https then mr palgrave the help of many thousands more his own songs of the memories of the nation addressed to nation that has not yet forfeited the praise of milton milton said of the englishman if we look at his native towardliness in the roughcast without breeding some nation or other may haply be better composed to natural civility and right judgment than he but if he get the beneﬁt once of wise and nurture i suppose that wherever mention is made of countries manners or men the english people among the ﬁrst that shall be praised may deserve to be accounted right pious right honest and right hardy so much is shown by the various utterances in this national l ibrar y so much is shown in the present volume of it by poet s vision of the england that has been till now and is what she has been to the names of henr y hallam and francis p algra ve friends and fellow labourers in english hist ory ty years who differing often in judgment were at one throughout life in devoted love of justice truth and england in affectiona and reverent remembrance this book is inscribed and dedica ted pref ace the scheme which the author has here endeavoured to execute has not so far he knows the advantage of any near precedent in any literature he hopes that few explanatory words may be of fered without incurring censure egotism our history is so eminently rich and varied and at the same time by the fact of our insular position so stamped with unity that from days very remote it has supplied matter song this among celts and angles at ﬁrst was lyrical but poetry many centuries after the conquest mainly took the annalistic form and despite the ability often shown was hence predoomed to failure nation s history can not but present many dull or confused periods many men and things intractable by poetry though perhaps politically ef fective and important which can not be excluded from any narrative aiming at consecutiveness and by the natural laws of art these passages when rendered in verse in their ef fect become more prosaic than they would be in prose rendering my attempt has therefore been to revert to the earlier and more natural conditions of poetry and to of fer continuous narrative not poems on every critical moment or conspicuous man in our long annals single lyrical pictures of such leading or typical characters and scenes in english history and only such have seemed amenable to strictly poetical treatment poetry not history has hence been my ﬁrst and last aim or perhaps i might deﬁne it history poetry s sake at the same time i have striven to keep throughout closely to absolute historical truth in the design and colouring of the pieces the exigencies of poetry permit result aimed at being to unite the actual tone and spirit of the time concerned with the best estimate which has been reached by the research and genius of modern investigators our island story freed from the falsehood of extremes above all from the seducing demon of spirit i have thus here done my best to set forth and this line of endeavour has conducted and constrained especially when the seventeenth century is concerned to indeed by historians conspicuous research ability and fairness but often remote from the views popularized by the writers of our own day upon these points few justiﬁcatory notes have been 6 7 9 the visions of england https double aim has hence governed and limited both the selection and the treatment of my subjects the choice has necessarily fallen often not on simply picturesque incident or unfamiliar character but on the men and things that we think of ﬁrst when thinking of the long chronicle of england upon such represent and symbolize the main current of it themes however on which able or popular song is already extant notably in case of scotland have in general avoided in the rendering my desire has been always to rest the poetry of each vision on its own intrinsic interest to write with straightforward eye to the object alone not studious of ornament ornament s sake allowing the least possible overt intrusion of the writer s personality and in accordance with lyrical law seeking rule to ﬁx upon some factual picture each poem to deﬁne thus the scope of what this book attempts is in itself confession of presumptuousness writer s own sense of which is but feebly and imperfectly expressed in the words from vergil s letter to augustus preﬁxed my motto in truth so rich and so wide are the materials that to scheme lyrical series which should really paint the gesta anglorum in their fulness might almost ar gue lack of wit vitium mentis in much greater powers than mine criticism however severe can add to my own consciousness how far the execution of the work in regard to each of its aims falls below the plan yet i would allow myself the hope great the deﬁciencies may be that the love of truth and the love of england are mine by inheritance in degree sufﬁcient to exempt this book the labour of several years from inﬁdelity to either the intrinsic worth and weight of my subject may commend these songs both at home and in the many englands beyond sea to those who despite the inevitably more engrossing attractions of the present and the emphatic bias of modern culture towards the immediate and the tangible maintain that high and interest which identifying us with our magniﬁcent past and all its varied lessons of defeat and victory offers at the same time the guidance from above sole secure guarantee prosperous and healthy progress in the future the world has cycles in its course when all that once has been is acted er again and only the nation which at each moment of political or social evolution looks lovingly backward to its own respiciens prospiciens tennyson s own chosen device expresses solid reason to hope that its movement is true its course is upward it remains only to add that the book has been carefully revised and corrected and that nineteen pieces published in the

reasonable controversy such not to enter upon the queen s life elizabeth s captive is the more than almost of the leading scottish politicians united with hypocrisy more revolting still and enabled to

and temptations more severe or has suf fered more shamefully from false witness and fanatical hatred but the prejudices which have been hence aroused are so strong such great interests religious and political are involved in their maintenance that they will doubtless prevail in the popular mind until our literature receives an age of research and of the scientiﬁc spirit should at last be prepared to give us tolerably truthful history of the elizabethan period 1889 b 102 heroes both his side regard to the main issue at stake in the civil war and the view taken of it throughout this book let here once all remark that competent and impartial student of our history can deny fair cause to each side whatever errors may have been committed by charles and by the parliament or however fatal some ﬁfteen years to liberty and national happiness were the excesses and the tyranny into which the victorious party gradually and it were inevitably drifted one says ranke whom i must often quote because to this distinguished foreigner we owe the single though too brief narrative of this period in which history has been hitherto treated historically that is without judging of the events by the light either of their remote results or of modern political party will make any very heavy political charge against straf ford on the score of his government of ireland or of the partisan attitude which he had taken up in the intestine struggle in england in general thep the visions of england https which he contended were much to be found in the past history of england were those which he attacked hampden s conduct may claim analogous justiﬁcation if the parliament could appeal to those mediaeval precedents which admitted the right of the people through their representatives to control taxation and more or less direct national policy charles and straf ford with him might lawfully afﬁrm that they too were standing on the ancient ways on the royal supremacy undeniably exercised by henry ii or edward by henry viii and by elizabeth both parties could equally put forward the prosperity of england under these opposed modes of government patriotism honour conscience were watchwords which either might use with truth or abuse with proﬁt if the great struggle be patiently studied the moral praise and censure so freely given according to reader s personal bias will be found very rarely justiﬁed there was far very far less of tyranny or of liberty involved in the contest up to 1642 than partisans aver to the actual actors nor retrospectively criticized by us it is fair battle on both sides not contest between light and we looking back after two centuries are of course free to recognize that one ef fect of the tudor despotism had been to train englishmen towards ruling themselves may agree that the time had come lords and commons to take their part in the kingdom but proof i think it may be said can be shown that this great idea in any conscious sense governed the parliaments of james and charles it is we who our history since the deﬁnite establishment of the constitutional balance after 1688 and the many blessings the land has enjoyed perceive what in the seventeenth century was wholly hidden from commonwealth and from king and even if in accordance with the common belief we ascribe english freedom and prosperity and good government to the ﬁnal triumph of the popular side yet deeper consideration should suggest that such retrospective judgments are always inevitably made under our human entire ignorance what might have been the result had the opposite party prevailed who should say how often in case of these long and wide extended struggles and dynastic effects which we conﬁdently claim propter hoc are only post hoc in the last reality waiving however these somewhat remote and what many will judge over considerations this is certain that unless we can purify our judgment from reading into the history of the past the long results of time ascribing to the

savoy and the papacy on behalf of the persecuted waldenses will be far from supporting the credit with which partisanship has invested it holland was beyond question the natural ally on political and religious grounds of puritan england but mischievous war against her in was caused by the arrogant restrictions of the navigation act of the successful english demand in 1653 that the orange family

eternally hated in ireland it even now acts spell upon the irish mind and has powerful and living inﬂuence in sustaining the hatred both of england and protestantism the massacre of drogheda acquired

ﬁnding favour neither from royalists nor cromwellians macaulay with more justice remarks that he was good man he evinced by proofs more satisfactory than deep groans or long sermons by humility and suavity when he was at the height of human greatness and by cheerful resignation under cruel wrongs and he did nothing amiss during his short his fall may be traced to several causes to the fact that the puritan party proper who supported him the sober men mentioned by baxter that called his father better than traitorous hypocrite had not power to resist the fanatic cabal of army chiefs to the necessity he was under of protecting some confederates of oliver his own want of ability or ener gy to govern point fully recognized during oliver s supremacy and to his own honourable decision not to
