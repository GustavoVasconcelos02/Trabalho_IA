kinsfolk of geor ge herbert thus they appear in bond of spiritual union breton to the poet gascoigne and the elder of our fascinating trio is conspicuous an unswerving attachment to nature and rural scenes it is in the pastoral lyric where with tenderest devotion he pursues untrammelled light and fancy his fertile varied muse laden with the passionate exaggeration s of lorn swain is yet charged with richest imagery and thought full to overﬂowing with joyous abandonment and sweet with the perfume of many ﬂowers culled in distant ﬁelds wither though best remembered by exploits in the political arena is none the less poet of deep and purest feeling to be sure his best and earlier work has all of that delightful extravagance and amorous colouring peculiar to the age but there is reﬂected homely dignity and mobile felicitous vein in which the poet seems endowed with every attribute of melodist exquisite graceful and diverse he at times would soar to ﬂights of highest inspiration and bedeck the page with gems of rarest worth in the heptasyllabic couplet he is decidedly successful and lastly william browne than whom we have not more modest and retiring singer here makes his bow with slender portfolio of excerpts whatever else may transpire it is certain that labour such his bears the assurance of unsullied happiness and overﬂowing joy it is quaint simple unassuming without affectation full of pathos and gently sensitive he was man who knew guile and his sweet and artless nature is faithfully portrayed in the outpourings of an impressionable poetic soul to dance with
