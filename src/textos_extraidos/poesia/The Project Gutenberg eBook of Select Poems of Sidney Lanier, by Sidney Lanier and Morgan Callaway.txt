select poems of sidney lanier is issued in the hope of making his poetry known to wider circles than hitherto especially among the students of our and colleges to these to older people the poems will it is believed prove an inspiration from the both of literature and of life the biographical section of the introdu ction rests in the main upon ward admirable memorial preﬁxed to the poems of sidney lanier edited by his wife though few additional facts have been gleaned here and there most of the bibliography down to 1888 i am indebted to my hopkins comrade richard burton now of hartford who compiled one the memorial of sidney lanier published by president gilman of the johns hopkins university in obligations to other publications about lanie r are in every instance acknowledged in the appropriate place i say most of the bibliography down to 1888 because burton different purpose led him to exclude items that could not be omitted in bibliography that like mine tries to be complete to the selections made i wished to include the marshes of glynn and yet not to exclude sunrise but both could not be put in and i ﬁnally gave the preference to sunrise chieﬂy on the ground of its being lanier latest complete poem i believe all will admit that the poems selected fairly exemplify the genius of the poet the poems are arranged not in the complete edition but in their chronological order the only proper one i think book of course they are all given complete later opinion generally agrees that the marshes of glynn is lanier greatest poem and this edition has limitations of space it would be inappropriate to exclude it therefore it has been inserted more or less in chronological order in accordance with callaway plan with some comments alan light 1998 in the notes i have made rather copious quotations from poems familiar to english scholars because i hope that this book will go into the hands of many to whom they are not familiar and to whom the original texts are not easily accessible and yet if they at all attain their end the notes must lead one to wish to know more of english poetry of which lanier is but part among the friends that have helped by counsel or

section of my essay born at macon february 3 1842 sidney lanier came of family noted their love and cultivation of the ﬁne arts from the time of queen elizabeth to the restoration several of his paternal ancestors were connected with the english court musical composers and painters the father of the poet however robert lanier was most industrious lawyer who after lingering illness of three years recently answered adsum to the summons of the supreme tribunal the poet mother mary anderson virginian of scotch descent likewise sprang from family distinguished their love of oratory music and poetry the full title of works cited see bibliography october 20 1893 at macon with such an ancestry we are not surprised to learn that sidney earliest passion was music and that in boyhood he could although untutored play on almost every kind of instrument he preferred the violin in playing which he sometimes sank into deep trance but in deference to his father view gave it up the ﬂute his power over which we shall hear of farther on at ﬁrst strange to say he considered music unworthy of one sole attention but later he came to rank it his fullest expression of worship at fourteen sidney entered the sophomore class of oglethorpe college near macon and with year intermission graduated with ﬁrst honor in 1860 when just eighteen to professor james woodrow of oglethorpe now president of south carolina college lanier declared that he owed the strongest and most valuable stimulus of his youth on graduating he was given tutorship in his alma mater position that he held until the outbreak of the civil war the was now exchanged the in april 1861 lanie r entered the confederate army private in the macon volunteers of the second geor gia battalion an organization among the ﬁrst

and literature the father protested chieﬂy on business grounds and begged him to rejoin himself in the practice of the law thanking his father his thoughtfulness lanier justiﬁed his own course in these earnest words my dear father think how twenty years through poverty through pain through weariness through sickness through the uncongenial atmosphere of farcical college and of bare army and then of an exacting business life through all the discouragement of being wholly unacquainted with literary people and literary ways i say think how in spite of all these depressing circumstances and of thousand more which i could enumerate these two ﬁgures of music and poetry have steadily kept in my heart so that i could not banish them does it not seem to you to that i begin to have the right to enroll myself among the devotees of these two sublime arts after having followed them so long and so humbly and through so much bitterness 1 of course the father yielded and did all that his

florida and in 1877 his ﬁrst volume of poems which contained pages and consisted chieﬂy of pieces 2 previously published in the magazin es soon after settling in baltimore lanier made careful study of old and middle english the fruits of which he partially embodied in courses of lectures given to his private class and to the public the latter at the peabody institute in during these years too he had been steadily turning out poems of high order on his birthday february 3 in 1879 he received notice of his appointment lecturer on english literature at the johns hopkins university of baltimore the ensuing scholastic year with ﬁxed salary the ﬁrst since his marriage in the summer of 1879 he wrote his science of english verse which constituted the basis of his ﬁrst course of lectures at the johns hopkins university notwithstanding serious illness this same winter he lectured at three private schools and kept up his musical engagement at the peabody concerts the next winter he came near dying but still kept writing sunrise was written with fever temperature of 104 degrees and went through his twelve lectures at the hopkins afterwards embodied in the english novel how trying this must have been to him can be gathered from the following words of ward few of the earlier lectures he penned himself the rest he was obliged to dictate to his wife with the utmost care of himself going in closed carriage and sitting during his lecture his strength was so exhausted that the struggle breath in the carriage on his return seemed each time to threaten the end those who heard him listened in

that interest in lanier life and work did not cease with his death there is abundant evidence on october 22 1881 memorial meeting was held by the faculty and students of the johns hopkins university

demonstrations perhaps is the steadily growing study devoted to lanier works higginson 5 tells us instance that when he wrote his tribute in 1887 lanier science of english verse had been put upon the list of harvard books to be kept only fortnight and that according to the librarian it was out literally all the time moreover it would not be difﬁcult to cite various poems that have been more or less modeled upon lanier it is sufﬁcient perhaps to point out that the marsh theme almost unknown to poetry before lanier immortalized it is not infrequent ly the subject of poetic treatment now in the works of charles roberts 6 clint on scollard 7 and maurice thompson 8 it is noteworthy too that many of the younger poets of the day both in canada and the united states have sung lanier praise

the 1877 volume of poems lanier next original work was the science of english v erse which in was delivered to the students of the johns hopkins in the winter of 1879 and was published in according to competent critics the book gives searching an investigation of the scien ce of verse on its formal side is to be had in any language since the treatise is so evidently an one i regret that the technicality of the subject forbids my attempting in this connection even brief exposition of its principles i can say only that lanier treats verse in the terms of music that according to the promise of the preface he gives an account of the true relations of music and verse and that in so doing he has given us the best working theory english verse from caedmon to tennyson this is high estimate but it is by means so high that of the lamented professor edmund rowland sill who said of the science of english verse it is the only work that has ever made any approach to rational view of the subject nor are the standard ones overlooked in making this assertion this may be found in professor tolman article cited in the bibliography quoted by tolman lanier second course of lectures at the johns hopkins university delivered in the winter and spring of 1881 was published in 1883 under the title the english novel and the principles of its development according to the author statement the purpose of the book is ﬁrst to inquire what is the special relation of the novel to the modern man by virtue of which it has become paramount literary form and secondly to illustrate this abstract inquiry when completed by some concrete readings in the greatest of modern english novelists 4 addressing himself to the former lanier attempts to prove 1 that our time when compared with that of aeschylus shows an enormous growth in the personality of man 5 2 that what we moderns call physical scien ce music and the novel all had their origin at practically the same time about the middle of the seventeenth century 9 and 3 that the increase of personalities thus going on has brought about such complexities of relation that the older forms of expression were inadequate to them and that the resulting necessity has developed the wonderfully free and elastic form of the modern novel out of the more rigid greek drama through the transition form of the elizabethan drama 10 in fulﬁlment of his second purpose the author gives detailed study of several of the novels of geor ge eliot whom he takes to be the greatest modern english novelist even this brief synopsis of the book must indicate its broad and stimulating character in which respect it is worth y successor of the science of english verse despite the limitations induced by failing life which necessitated the cutting down of the course of lectures from twenty to twelve i know of the project gutenberg ebook of select poems of sidney lanier by sidney lanier and morgan callaway https books and i venture to assert that it can not safely be overlooked by any careful student of the subject lanier informs that the english novel will soon be issued in an amended form and with new studies in the development of personality which indicates precisely what mr lanier intended to attempt and relieves the book of its seeming incompleteness to scope spann among other prose works i may mention lanier early extravaganza three waterfalls bob happy account of pet worthy of being placed beside brown rab and his friends his books boys froissart king arthur mabinogion and percy which have had they deserve large sale and his posthumous from bacon to beethoven highly instructive essay on music iii lanier poetry its themes but it is chieﬂy poet that we wish to consider lanier and i turn to the posthumous edition of his poems gotten out by his wife at the outset let us ask how did the poet look at the world what problems engaged his attention and how were they solved careful investigation will show i believe that despite the brevity of his life and its consuming cares lanier studied the chief questions of our age and that in his poems he has offered us noteworthy solutions what instance is more characteristic of our age than its tendency to agnosti cism i pass by the manifestations of this spirit in the world of religion of which so much has been heard and give an illustration or two from the ﬁeld of history and politics picturesque pocahontas we are told is more to be believed in moreover the pilgrim fathers did not land at plymouth rock nor did jefferson write the declaration of independence which way we turn there is big often not information but negation of the good resulting from the inquisitive spirit we all know of the baneful inﬂuence of inquisitiveness that has become mere intellectual pastime or amateurish agnosticism we likew ise have some knowledge but the evil side of this tendency has seldom been put more forcibly i think than in this stanza from lanier acknowledgment age that half thou half half the substance of thine own half doubt and half perceiving that thou half at thy temple door heart in head out lo while thy heart within helping the choir w ithout thine eyes range up and down the the project gutenberg ebook of select poems of sidney lanier by sidney lanier and morgan callaway https blinking at science smit with desire to see and not to see hence crime on crime yea if the christ called thine now paced yon street thy halfness hot with his rebuke would swell legions of scribes would rise and run and beat his fair intolerable wholeness twice to hell acknowledgment ll more hurtful than agnosticism because affecting larger masses of people is the rapid growth of the mercantile spirit during the present century especially in america this evil the poet saw most clearly and felt most keenly every one may learn by reading the symphony his great poem in which the speakers are the various musical instruments the violins begin trade trade would thou wert dead the time needs heart is tired of head then all the stringed instruments join with the violins in giving the wail of the poor who stand wedged by the pressing of trade hand w weave in the mills and heave in the kilns we sieve under the hills and thieve much gold from the devil bank tills to relieve god what manner of ills the beasts they hunger and eat and die and so we and the world sty hush why nuzzle and cry swinehood hath remedy say many men and hasten by clamping the nose and blinking the eye but who said once in the lordly tone man shall not live by bread alone but all that cometh from the throne hath god said so but trade saith and the kilns and the mills say go there plenty that can if you ca we know move out if you think you underpaid the poor are proliﬁc

the project gutenberg ebook of select poems of sidney lanier by sidney lanier and morgan callaway https that trade more than trade must be does business mean die you live i then t rade is trade but sings lie is only war grown miserly if business is battle name it so the symphony ll the symphony ll of even wider sweep than mercantilism is the spirit of intolerance while the diffusion of knowledge and of grace has in measure repressed this spirit it lacks much of being subdued i not wonder that lanier ﬂed in tears from men ungodly quarrel about god and that in his poem entitled remonstrance he denounces intolerance with all the vehemence of prophet of old but lanier had an eye life beauties well its ills to him music was one of earth chief blessings of his early passion the violin and his substitution of the ﬂute therefor we have already learned according to competent critics he was possibly the greatest player 1 in the world fact all the more interesting when we remember that he himself tells us 2 he never had teacher with such talent music the poet has naturally strewn his pages with ﬁne tributes thereto in instance he tells us that while explorers say that they have found some nations that had god he knows of none that had music and then sums up the matter in this sentence music means harmony harmony means love and love means god 3 even more explicit is this declaration in letter of may 1873 to hayne i know that i told you that whatever turn i may have art is purely musical poetry being with mere tangent into which i shoot sometimes i could play passably on several instruments before i could write legibly and since then the very deepest of my life has been ﬁlled with music which i have studied and cultivated far more than poetry 4 we have already seen incidentally that in his symphony the speakers are musical instruments and it is in this poem that occurs his felicitous deﬁnition music is love in search of word 5 in t beethoven he describes the ef fect of music upon himself i know not how i care not why thy music brings this broil at ease and melts my passion mortal cry in satisfying symphonies y ea it gives all my sins fits life to love like rhyme to rhyme and tunes the task each day begins by the last of time 6 it was this profound knowledge of music of course that enabled lanier to write his work on the science of english verse and gave him technical skill in versiﬁcation akin to that the project gutenberg ebook of select poems of sidney lanier by sidney lanier and morgan callaway https 1 see ward memorial pp xx xxxi 2 hayne poet

sunset 14 and even in the marshes 15 which burst into bloom this worshiper again lanier love of nature was less insistent than wordsworth we all remember the latter lines t the meanest ﬂower that blows can give thoughts that often lie too deep tears 16 and beside them one may put this line of lanier the little green leaves would not let alone in my sleep 17 because the context shows he was shaken with happiness the gates of sleep stood wide 18 and how naive and tender was this he speaks of the clover 19 and the clouds 20 cousins and of the leaves 21 sisters and in so doing reminds us of the earliest italian poetry especially of the canticle of the sun by francis of assisi who brothers the wind the ﬁre and the sun and sisters the water the stars and the moon notice the tenderness in these lines of corn the leaves that wave against my cheek caress like women hands the embracing boughs express subtlety of mighty tenderness the into little noises start that sound anon like beatings

roots the sends in the sod i will heartily lay on the greatness of god oh like to the greatness of god is the greatness within the range of the marshes the liberal marshes of glynn 24 but to lanier

some of which however i pass by not calling special comment of lanier felicitous choice of words we have already had incidental illustration but it is desirable perhaps to group here few of his

have ye uttered bird 4 and the description of yon trim shakspere on the tree 5 and of midnight death and truth unlocking time 6 moreover it should be observed that lanier frequently uses signiﬁcant compounds habit acquired doubt from his study of old english in which in german such compounds abound 1 see lowell in bibliography 2 from the flats ll cited by gates line 24 was changed to bright

is good occasionally his sentences are too long in my springs to bayard taylor and sunrise in which we have sentences longer than the opening one in paradise lost and what is of more moment not so well balanced and hence affording fewer breathing spaces that this detracts from clearnes s and euphony both every reader will admit to come to the ﬁgures of speech one must be struck at once with the delicacy and the vigor of lanier imagination the poet fancy personiﬁes what at ﬁrst blush seems to us incapable of personiﬁcation thus at one time 1 he likens men to clover and the things to the browsing ox which makes way with the clover while at another he addresses an old red hill of geor gia thou gashed and hairy lear whom the divine cordelia of the year pitying spring will vainly strive to cheer 2 like other southern poets 3 lanier sometimes fails to check his imagination and in consequence leaves his readers in brilliant maze in his description of the stars in june dreams 4 and in the psalm of the west 5 while i not like maze brilliant though it be and sweet i must say that i prefer the embarrassment of riches to the project gutenberg ebook of select poems of sidney lanier by

forked galaxy the marsh brags ten looped on his breast they lie 7 later the ﬂows from marsh to sea we are parenthetically treated to these two lines run home little streams w ith your lapfuls of stars

about equal skill three features however specially characterize his verse the careful distribution of and the frequent use of alliteration and of phonetic syzygy 1 by which last is meant combination or succession of identical or similar consonants whether initially medially or ﬁnally instance the succes sion of m in tennyson the moan of doves in immemorial elms and murmuring of innumerable bees all of these phenomena are illustrated in lanier song of the chattahoochee which has often been compared to tennyson the brook and which alone proves the author master in versiﬁcation to be sure lanier occasionally gives us an improper rhym thwart heart 2 but so does every poet doubt too his love of music sometim es led him not to strain form effects but to indulge too much therein or in the words of stedman to essay in language feats that only the gamut can render possible 3 but professor the project gutenberg ebook of select poems of sidney lanier by sidney lanier and morgan callaway https puts it lanier was poet well an artist and if at times his artistic temperament seemed to eclipse his poetic thought grant that to the poet mind the very manner of expression may indicate the thought that lies beneath while to the duller ear the thought must come in completed form 4 moreover we shall see later this extraordinary musical endowment gave lanier unique position among english poets 1 see the science of english verse 306 ff 2 in the foam ll 6 see too kent study of lanier poems which gives an exhaustive treatment of lanier versiﬁcation 3 stedman poets of america 449 4 kent 60 after what has been said the qualities of style may be brieﬂy handled we have already seen lanier sometimes fails in clearness or more precisely in simplicity this comes partly from infelicitous partly perhaps from lanier extraordinary musical endowment but chieﬂy i think from of imagination but this occasional defect has been unduly exaggerated thus gosse 1 declares that lanier is never simple never easy never in one single lyric natural and spontaneous more than one stanza statement so clearly hyperbolic hardly to call notice matter of fact lanier has written numerous poems that offer little or difﬁculty to the reader of average intelligence life and song my springs the symphony the the song of the chattahoochee the waving of the corn the revenge of hamish rem onstrance ballad of trees and the master etc more than this lanier at times manifests the simplicity that is granted only to genius of the highest order thus an english critic 2 who by the way declares that lanier volume has more of genius than all the poems of poe or longfellow or lowell the humorous poems excepted and who considers lanier the most original of all american poets and more original than any england has produced the last thirty years says that nothing can be more perfect than the whole sweet round of littles that lar ge life compound 3 lines in my springs and that the touch of wonder in the last two lines i marvel that god made you mine when he frowns is then ye shine 4 is simple and exquisite any touch of tenderness in our literature i frankly admit that several of lanier best poems corn the marshes of glynn and sunrise are not simple but the same thing is true of milton paradise lost and of browning the ring and the book and yet this fact does not exclude these two works from the list of great poems gosse however declares that corn sunrise and the marshes of glynn simulate poetic expression with extraordinary skill but of the real thing of the genuine traditional article not trace what these poems show then gosse answers i ﬁnd painful effort strain and rage the most prominent qualities in everything he wrote which strikes the reverse of the facts in one of his letters 5 to judge bleckley lanier wrote this sentence my head and my heart are both so full of poems which the dreadful struggle bread does not give time to put on paper that i am often driven to headache and heartache purely want of an hour or two to hold pen if then he committed an error and i am far from considering him faultless it was not that he beat and spurred on pegasus but that he failed to rein him in the project gutenberg ebook of select poems of sidney lanier by sidney lanier and morgan callaway https repeat that i prefer the embarrassment of riches to the embarrassment of poverty finally just milton tells us that the music of the spheres is not to be heard by the gross unpur ged ear so i believe that many intelligent ears and eyes are at ﬁrst too gross to hear and see what lanier puts before them whereas bit of patient listening and looking reveals delights hitherto undreamed of 1 see bibliography 2 the spectator london see bibliograph y 3 my springs ll 4 my springs ll 5 it is to be hoped that these letters may yet be published i quote from one dated november 15 1874 if not always simple lanier is often forcible in the extreme in the symphony the revenge of hamish remonstrance and sunrise of course it is open to any one to see in these poems the rage attributed to lanier by gosse but i prefer to consider it divine wrath in all but the last and in it wonder unutterable which yet is so uttered that ears become eyes i allude to the stanzas describing the break of dawn and the rising of the sun sunrise ll of the poet marvelous euphony the song of the chattahoochee speaks clearly enough we have seen in our treatment of versiﬁcation it is here question not of too little but of too much but despite an occasional too great yielding to his passion music his extraordinary endowment in this direction gave lanier unique position among english poets i quote again from professor kent but if his sense of beauty made him peer of our great poets it was the heavenly gift of music that distinguished him from them milton it is true whom he most resembles in this respect had knowledge of music but not the same passion it milton music was more recrea tion an accompaniment of reverie lanier was ﬁery zeal yearning love chosen and adequate form of expression of his soul deepest feeling combined with this passion music was his technical knowledge of the art and these combined formed at once the foundation and the framework of his poetry he seems literally to have sung his poems they are essentially musical tuneful and melodious surchar ged with music he overﬂows in melliﬂuous numbers here then lanier stands out differentiated in the choir of poets and here we ﬁnd that distinctive quality which is the very ﬂavor of his writing p 62 while most of lanier poems are in serious strain several disclose mean sense of humor i refer to his dialect poems such jones private argyment uncle jim baptist revival hymn and the power of prayer especially the last written in conjunction with his brother clif ford lanier there are passages in the poems less pathetic than the poet life in discussin g his love of nature we have seen that he was pantheist in the best sense of the term so delicate was his sensibility that we not wonder when we hear him declaring and i am one with all the kinsmen things that my father fathered saying felicitous the roman

now time to say word about lanier theory of art especially the art of poetry his views upon the formal side of poetry have already been noticed in the consideration of his science of english verse and hence receive further comment here that lanier keenly appreciated the responsibility resting upon the artist appears from individuality where he tells us awful is art because is free 1 and each artist

fertile 2 in corn 3 too the tall types the sublime 1 clover ll 2 the bee ll 3 corn 52 f but it is in his prose works that lanier has treated the matter most at length and to these i turn in the ﬁrst place he insists that to be an artist one must know great deal statement that would appear superﬂuous but its frequent overlooking by artists hence he is right in warning young writers you need not dream of winning the attention of sober people with your poetry unless that poetry and your soul behind it are informed and saturated with at least the largest ﬁnal conceptions of current science that lanier strove to follow this precept we have abundant evidence in his life and in his works and i think that if we remember his environments we must wonder at the vastness the accuracy and the variety of his knowledge additionally illustrative of the last i may add that lanier invented some improvements the ﬂute and made discovery in the physics of music that the professor of physics in the university of virginia thought considerable gates 29 see w est 23 in the second place lanier thinks that poet knowledge of his art should be scientiﬁc it was this that led him to write the science of english verse the motto of which is but the best conceptions can not be save where science and genius are in the english novel he declares that not single verse was ever written by instinct alone since the world began and fortiﬁes his statement by ben jonson tribute to shakespeare good poet made well born and such wert thou but lanier clearly saw that formal laws and amount of scientiﬁc know ledge could alone make poet appears from the motto above quoted from the closing chapter of the science of english verse which tells us that the educated love of beauty is the artist only law and from this other motto from sir philip sidney poet industrie can make if his owne genius bee not carried unto it the english novel 33 the project gutenberg ebook of select poems of sidney lanier by sidney lanier and morgan callaway https the third place lanier holds that moral intention on the part of an artist does not interfere with the naturalness or intrin sic beauty of his work that in art the controlling consideration is rather moral than artistic beauty but that moral beauty and artistic beauty so far from being distinct or opposed are conver gent and mutually helpful this thesis he upholds in the following eloquent and cogent passage permit to recall to you in the ﬁrst place that the requirement has been from time immemorial that wherever there is contest between artistic and moral beauty unless the moral side prevail all is lost let any sculptor hew us out the most ravishing combination of tender curves and spheric softness that ever stood woman yet if the lip have certain fulness that hints of the ﬂesh if the brow be insincere if in the minutest particular the physical beauty suggest moral ugliness that sculptor unless he be portraying moral ugliness moral purpose may well give over his marble time whose judgments are inexorably moral will not accept his work indeed we may say that he who has not yet perceived how artistic beauty and moral beauty are conver gent lines which run back into common ideal origin and who therefore is not aﬁre with moral beauty just with artistic beauty that he in short who has not come to that stage of quiet and eternal frenzy in which the beauty of holiness and the holiness of beauty mean one thing burn one ﬁre shine one light within him he is not yet the great artist by copious quotations lanier then shows that many ﬁne and beautiful souls appear after while to lose all sense of distinction between these terms beauty truth love wisdom goodness and the like and concludes thus and if this be true can not one say with authority to the young artist whether working in stone in color in tones or in character of the novel so far from dreading that your moral purpose will interfere with your beautiful creation go forward in the clear conviction that unless you are suffused soul and body one might say with that moral purpose which ﬁnds its largest expression in love that is the love of all things in their proper relation unless you are suffused with this love not dare to meddle with beauty unless you are suffused with beauty not meddle with love unless you are suffused with truth not dare to meddle with goodness in word unless you are suffused with beauty truth wisdom goodness and love abandon the hope that the ages will accept you an artist the english novel 272 the english novel of the

in purity i will not recall his gentle yet heroic life amid drawbacks almost unparalleled it is even sadder than it is beautiful it is my deliberate judgment that while the poet says in his life and song singer has ever wholly lived his minstrelsy lanier came so near it that we may fairly say in the closing lines of the poem his song was only living aloud his work singing with his hand and my part i am grateful his noble private life his distinguished public work the symphony 302 and yet i will not close with this picture of the man my purpose is rather to present the poet hampered though he was by fewness of years by feebleness of body by shortness of bread and most of all perhaps by of imagination lanier was yet to my mind indisputably great poet in technique he was akin to tennyson in the love of beauty and in lyric sweetness to keats and shelley in the love of nature to wordsworth and in spirituality to ruskin the gist of whose teaching is that we are souls temp orarily having bodies to milton of england and to browning subtlest assertor of the soul in song to be sure lanier genius is not equal to that of any one of the poets mentioned but i venture to believe that it is of the same order and therefore deserving of lasting remembrance mr thayer puts it stronger master of melodious metre only tennyson and he not often has equalled lanier mr browne editor of the dial chicago compares the two poets in another aspect the symphony of lanier may recall some parts of maud but the younger poet treatment is much his own the elder is his own the comparison of lanier with tennyson will indeed only deepen the impression of his originality which is his most striking quality it may be doubted if any english poet of our time except tennyson has cast his work in an ampler mould or wrought with more of freedom or stamped his product with the impress of stronger personality his thought his his expression his form his treatment are his alone and through them all he

https the ﬁrst of his letters to the hon logan bleckley of georgia dated october 9 1874 lanier tells us how he came to write corn i enclose of poem in which i have endeavored to carry some very prosaic matters up to loftier plane i have been struck with alarm in seeing the numbers of deserted old homesteads and gullied hills in the older counties of geor gia and though they are dreadfully commonplace i have thought they are surely mournful enough to be poetic in the introductory note to jones private argyment i have incidentally stated the theme of corn instead of adding more detailed statement of my own here i give judge bleckley analysis of the poem which occurs in his reply to the letter after giving various minute criticism lanier had requested his unreserved judgment judge bleckley continues now the general impression which your ode has made upon it presents four pictures three of them landscapes and one portrait you paint the wood s and hill these are your landscapes and your portrait is the likeness of an anxious unthrifty who always spends his crop before he has made it borrows on heavy interest to carry himself over from year to year wears out his land meets at last with utter ruin and migrates to the west your second landscape is turned into vegetable person and you give its portrait with many touches of marvel and mystery in vegetable life your third landscape takes an instant the form and tragic state of king lear you thus make it seize on our sympathies if it were real person and you then restore it to the inanimate and contemplate its possible beneﬁcence in the distant future comparison of the ﬁrst draft of corn sent judge bleckley with the ﬁnal form shows that lanier made many minute change s in the poem especially in the earlier part still this earlier draft agrees substantially with the later and was so ﬁne in conception and execution to call forth this commendation of judge bleckley which despite the shortcomings of corn may with greater justice be applied to the poem in its present form an artist you seem to be italian in the ﬁrst two pictures and dutch or flemish in the latter two in your italian vein you paint with the utmost delicacy and ﬁnish the drawing is scrupulously correct and the color soft and harmonious when you paint in dutch or flemish you are clear and strong but sometimes hard there is less idealization and more of the realistic element your solids predominate over your ﬂuids already stated lanier has two other poems that indirectly treat the theme of corn namely thar more in the man and jones private argyment moreover he has the waving of the corn which though charming is neither so elaborate nor artistic corn among poems on corn by other writers may be mentioned the following

marvellous marshes of glynn baltimore notes the marshes of glynn although callaway noted in his preface the importance of this poem he did not include it lack of space this would seem to indicate that when he published these selected poems in 1895 the marshes of glynn had not yet achieved its later prominence the greatest of sidney lanier poems now seems to be the opinion the setting of the poem is the salt marshes surrounding the coastal city of brunswick geor gia which is in glynn county an area well deserving of the fame lanier has given it and it was intended one installment in series of hymns of the marshes of which four poems were completed the text is taken from the 1916 edition of poems of sidney lanier the project gutenberg ebook of select poems of sidney lanier by sidney lanier and morgan callaway https hayes ward wrote of this poem how naturally his large faith in god ﬁnds expression in his marshes of glynn edwin mims in his biography of sidney lanier concludes by quoting this poem he writes his best poems move to the cadence of tune sometimes in the marshes of glynn and in the best parts of sunrise there is cosmic rhythm that is like unto the rhythmic beating of the heart of god of which poe and lanier have written eloquently and later continues indeed if one had to rely upon one poem to keep alive the fame of lanier he could single out the marshes of glynn with assurance that there is something so individual and original about it and that at the same time there is such roll and range of verse in it that it will surely live not only in american poetry but in english here the imagination has taken the place of fancy the effort to great things ends in victory and the melody of the poem corresponds to the exalted thought it has all the strong points of sunrise with but few of its limitations there is something of whitman virile imagination and emerson high spirituality combined with the haunting melody of poe best work written in 1878 when lanier was in the full exercise of all his powers it is the best expression of his genius and one of the few great american poems the background of the poem of sunrise is the forest the coast and the marshes near brunswick geor gia early in life lanier had been thrilled by this wonderful natural scenery and later visits had the more powerfully impressed his imagination he is the poet of the marshes surely bryant is of the forests or wordsworth of the mountains the poet represents himself having spent the day in the forest and coming at sunset into full view of the length and the breadth and the sweep of the marshes the glooms of the oaks and the emerald twilights of the dim sweet woods of the dear dark woods have been refuge from the riotous sun more than that in the wildwood privacies and closets of lone desire he has known the passionate pleasure of prayer and the joy of elevated thought his spirit is grown to lordly great compass within he is ready what wordsworth calls hour callaway also
