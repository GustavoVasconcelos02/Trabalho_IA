gutenber we had heard of this etext years but it was not until 1991 that we actually managed to track it down to speciﬁc location and then it took months to convince people to let us have copy then more months them actually to the copying and get it to us then another month to convert to something we could massage with our favorite 486 in after that it was only matter of days to get it into this shape you will see below the original was of course in caps only and so were all the other etexts of the 60 s and early 70 s don t let anyone fool you into thinking any etext with both upper and lower case is an original all those original project gutenber g etexts were also in upper case and were translated or rewritten many times to get them into their current condition they have been worked on by many people throughout the world in the course of our searches professor raben and his etext we were never able to determine where copies were or which of variety of editions he may have used source we did get little information here and there but even after we received copy of the etext we were unwilling to release it without ﬁrst determining that it was in fact public domain and ﬁnding raben to verify this and get his permission interested enough in totally unrelated action to our searches him the professor subscribed to the project gutenber g listserver and we happened by accident to notice his name we don t really look at every subscription request the computers usually hand le them the etext was then properly identiﬁe d copyright analyzed and the curren t edition prepared to give you an estimation of the difference in the original and what we have today the original was probably entered on cards commonly known at the time ibm cards not fold spindle or mutilate and probably took in excess of of them single card could hold 80 characters hence 80 characters is an accepted standard so many computer margins and the entire original edition we received in all caps was over chars in length including line enumeration symbols caps and the punctuation marks since they were not available keyboard characters at the time probably the keyboards operated at baud rates of around 113 meaning the typists had to type slowly the keyboard to keep up this is the second version of paradise lost released by project gutenber the ﬁrst was released our october 1991 paradise lost
