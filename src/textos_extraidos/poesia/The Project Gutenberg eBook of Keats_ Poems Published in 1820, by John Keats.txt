shelley keats was the last born and the ﬁrst to die the length of his life was not that of wordsworth who was born years before him and outlived him by yet before his tragic death at keats had produced body of poetry of such extraordinary power and promise that the world has iv v the project gutenberg ebook of keats poems published in 1820 by john keats https been tempted in its regret what he might have done had he lived to lose sight of the superlative merit of what he actually accomplished the three years of his poetic career during which he published three small volumes of poetry show development at the same time rapid and steady and gradual but complete abandonment of almost every fault and weakness it would probably be impossible in the history of literature to ﬁnd such another instance of the of poet mind the last of these three volumes which is here reprinted was published in 1820 when it good success among the literary people and moderate sale it contains the ﬂower of his poetic production and is perhaps altogether one of the most marvellous volumes ever issued from the press but in spite of the maturity of keats work when he was he had been in sense precocious child born in 1795 in the city of london the son of keeper he was brought up amid surroundings and inﬂuences by means calculated to awaken poetic genius he was the eldest of boys one of whom died in infancy and girl younger than all and he and his brothers geor ge and tom were educated at private school at enﬁeld here john was at ﬁrst distinguished more ﬁghting than study whilst his bright brave generous nature made him popular with masters and boys soon after he had begun to go to school his father died and when he was ﬁfteen the children lost their mother too keats was passionately devoted to his mother during her last illness he would sit up all night with her give her her medicine and even cook her food himself at her death he was brokenhearted the children were now put under the care of two guardians one of whom abbey taking the sole responsibility immediately removed john from school and apprenticed him ﬁve years to sur geon at edmonton whilst thus employed keats spent all his leisure time in reading which he had developed great enthusiasm during his last two years at school there he had devoured every book that came in his way especially rejoicing in stories of the gods and goddesses of ancient greece at edmonton he was able to continue his studies by borrowing books from his friend charles cowden clarke the son of his schoolmaster and he often went over to enﬁeld to change his books and to discuss those which he had been reading on one of these occasions cowden clarke introduced him to spenser to whom so many poets have owed their ﬁrst inspiration that he has been called poets poet and it was then apparently that keats was ﬁrst prompted to write when he was nineteen year before his apprenticeship came to an end he quarrelled with his master left him and continued his training in london student at thomas hospital and guy gradually however during the months that followed though he was an industrious and able medical student keats came to realize that poetry was his true vocation and soon he was of age in spite of the opposition of his guardian he decided to abandon the medical profession and devote his life to literature if abbey was unsympathetic keats was not without encouragement from others his brothers always believed in him and his exceptionally lovable nature had won him many friends amongst these friends two men older than himself each famous in his own sphere had special inﬂuence upon him one of them leigh hunt was something of poet himself and pleasant his encouragement did much to stimula keats genius but his direct inﬂuence on his poetry was wholly bad leigh hunt was not deep nature his poetry is often trivial and sentimental and his easy conversational style is intolerable when applied to great theme to this man inﬂuence well to the surroundings of his youth are doubtless due the occasional ﬂaws of taste in keats early work vi vii viii the project gutenberg ebook of keats poems published in 1820 by john keats https other haydon was an artist of mediocre creative talent but great aims and amazing belief in himself he had ﬁne critical faculty which was shown in his appreciation of the elgin marbles in opposition to the most respected authorities of his day mainly through his insistence they were secured the nation which thus owes him boundless debt of gratitude he helped to guide and direct keats taste by his enthusiastic exposition of these masterpieces of greek sculpture in 1817 keats published his ﬁrst volume of poems including and poetry and the lines i stood tiptoe upon little hill with much that is of the highest poetic value many memorable lines and touches of his unique insight into nature the volume yet showed considerable immaturity it contained indeed if we except one perfect sonnet rather series of experiments than any complete and ﬁnished work there were abundant faults those who liked to look them though there were abundant beauties too and the critics and the public chose rather to concentrate their attention on the former the volume was therefore anything but success but keats was not discouraged he saw many of his own faults more clearly than did his critics and felt his power to outgrow them immediately after this keats went to the isle of wight and thence to margate that he might study and write undisturbed on may 10th he wrote to i never quite despair and i read i shall i think never read any other book much we have seen keats inﬂuenced by spenser and by leigh hunt now though his love spenser continued shakespeare had become the dominant inﬂuence gradually he came too under the inﬂuence of wordsworth philosophy of poetry and life and later his reading of milton affected his style to some extent but shakespeare inﬂuence was the widest deepest and most lasting though it is the hardest to deﬁne his study of other poets left traces upon his work in turns of phrase or turns of thought shakespeare permeated his whole being and his inﬂuence is to be detected not in resemblance of style shakespeare can have imitators but in broadening view of life and increased humanity poet could have owed his education more completely to the english poets than did john keats his knowledge of latin was knew greek and even the classical stories which he loved and constantly used came to him almost entirely through the medium of elizabethan translations and allusions in this connexion it is interesting to read his ﬁrst ﬁne sonnet in which he celebrates his introduction to the greatest of greek poets in the translation of the rugged and forcible elizabethan geor ge chapman on ﬁrst looking into chapman homer much have i travelled in the realms of gold and many goodly states and kingdoms seen round many western islands have i been which bards in fealty to apollo hold oft of one wide expanse had i been told that homer ruled his demesne yet did i never breathe its pure serene till i heard chapman speak out loud and bold

darien of the work upon which he was now engaged the of endymion we may give his own account to his little sister fanny in letter dated september 10th 1817 ix x xi xii the project gutenberg ebook of keats poems published in 1820 by john keats https you might like to know what i am writing about i will tell you many years ago there was young handsome shepherd who fed his ﬂocks on mountain side called was very contemplative sort of person and lived solitary among the trees and plains little thinking that such beautiful creature the moon was growing mad in love with so it was and when he was asleep she used to come down from heaven and admire him excessive ly long time and at last could not refrain from carrying him away in her arms to the top of that high mountain latmus while he was i dare say you have read this and all the other beautiful tales which have come down from the ancient times of that beautiful greece on his return to london he and his brother tom always delicate and now quite an invalid took lodgings at hampstead here keats remained some time harassed by the illness of his brother and of several of his friends and in june he was still further depressed by the departure of his brother geor ge to try his luck in america in april 1818 endymion was ﬁnished keats was by means satisﬁed with it but preferred to publish it it was feeling it to be good i had power to make it by i will write independently he says to his i have written independently without judgment i may write independently and with judgment hereafter in endymion i leaped headlong into the sea and thereby have become better acquainted with the soundings the quicksands and the rocks than if i had stayed upon the green shore and piped silly pipe and took tea and comfortable advice he published it with preface modestly explaining to the public his own sense of its imperfection nevertheless storm of abuse broke upon him from the critics who fastened upon all the faults of the diffuseness of the story its occasional sentimentality and the sometimes fantastic coinage of words and ignored the extraordinary beauties of which it is full directly after the publication of endymion and before the appearance of these reviews keats started with friend charles brown walking tour in scotland they ﬁrst visited the english lakes and thence walked to dumfries where they saw the house of burns and his grave they entered next the country of meg merrilies and from kirkcudbrightshire crossed over to ireland few days on their return they went north far argyleshire whence they sailed to staffa and saw fingal cave which keats wrote solemnity and grandeur far surpasses the ﬁnest cathedral they then crossed scotland through inverness and keats returned home by boat from cromarty his letters home are at ﬁrst full of interest and enjoyment but sore throat contracted in most wretched walk of miles across the isle of mull proved very troublesome and ﬁnally cut short his holiday this was the beginning of the end there was consumption in the family tom was dying of it and the cold wet and exertion of his scotch tour seems to have developed the fatal tendency in keats himself from this time forward he was never well and good was done to either his health or spirits by the task which now awaited him of tending on his dying brother the last two or three months of 1818 until tom death in december he scarcely left the bedside and it was well him that his friend charles armitage brown was at hand to help and comfort him after the long strain brown persuaded keats at once to leave the house with its sad associations and to come and live with him before long poetry absorbed keats again and the ﬁrst few months of 1819 were the most fruitful of his life besides working at hyperion which he had begun during tom illness he wrote the eve of agnes the eve of mark la belle dame sans merci and nearly all his famous odes troubles however beset him his friend haydon was in difﬁculties and tormen ting him poor he was to lend him money the state of his throat gave serious cause alarm and above all he was consumed by an unsatisfying passion the daughter of neighbour brawne she had rented brown house whilst they were in scotland and had now moved to street near by miss fanny brawne returned his love but she seems xiii xiv xv the project gutenberg ebook of keats poems published in 1820 by john keats https to have understood his nature or his needs and fond of pleasure she did not apparently allow the thought of her invalid lover to interfere much with her enjoyment of life she would not however abandon her engagement and she probably gave him all which it was in her nature to give made him on the other hand morbidly dissatisﬁed and suspicious and result of his illness and her limitations his love throughout brought him restlessness and torment rather than peace and comfort towards the end of july he went to shanklin and there in collaboration with brown wrote play otho the great brown tells us how they used to sit one on either side of table he sketching out the scenes and handing each one the outline was ﬁnished to keats to write keats never knew what was coming it was quite impossibl that the characters should be adequately conceived or that the drama should be united whole nevertheless there is much that is beautiful and promising in it it should not be forgotten that keats ambition was in his own words writing of few ﬁne plays and with the increasing humanity and grasp which his poetry shows there is reason to suppose that had he lived he would not have fulﬁlled it at shanklin moreover he had begun to write lamia and he continued it at winchester here he stayed until the middle of october excepting few days which he spent in london to arrange about the sending of some money to his brother in america geor ge had been unsuccessful in his commerci al enterprises and keats in view of his family determined temporarily to abandon poetry and by reviewing or journalism to support himself and earn money to help his brother then when he could afford it he would return to poetry accordingly he came back to london but his health was breaking down and with it his resolution he tried to hyperion which he felt had been written too much under the inﬂuence of milton and in artist humour the same independence of spirit which he had shown in the publication of endymion urged him now to abandon work the style of which he did not feel to be absolutely his own the he wrote in the form of vision calling it the fall of hyperion and in so doing he added much to his conception of the meaning of the story in poem does he show more of the profoundly philosophic spirit which characterizes many of his letters but it was too late his power was failing and in spite of the beauty and interest of some of his additions the alterations are mostly the worse whilst the fall of hyperion occupied his evenings his mornings were spent over satirical the cap and bells in the metre of the faerie queene this metre however was to the subject satire was not natural to him and the poem has little intrinsic merit neither this nor the of hyperion was ﬁnished when in february 1820 he had an attack of illness in which the ﬁrst deﬁnite symptom of consumption appeared brown tells how he came home on the evening of thursday february 3rd in state of high fever chilled from having ridden outside the coach on bitterly cold day mildly and instantly yielded to my request that he should go to bed on entering the cold sheets before his head was on the pillow he slightly coughed and i heard him that is blood from my mouth i went towards him he was examining single drop of blood upon the sheet bring the candle brown and let see this blood after regarding it steadfastly he looked up in my face with calmness of expression that i can never forget and said i know the colour of that blood is arterial blood i can not be deceived in that colour that drop of blood is my death warrant must die he lived another year but it was one long dying he himself called it his life keats was one of the most charming of letter he had that rare quality of entering sympathetically into the mind of the friend to whom he was writing so that his letters reveal to us much of the character of the recipient well of the writer in the long which he wrote to his brother and sister in america he is probably xvi xvii xviii xix the project gutenberg ebook of keats poems published in 1820 by john keats https fully himself there he is with the people who knew him best and on whose understanding and sympathy he could rely but in none is the beauty of his character more fully revealed than in those to his little sister fanny now seventeen years old and living with their guardian abbey he had always been very anxious that they should intimately acquainted in order he says i may not only you grow up love you my only sister but conﬁde in you my dearest friend in his most harassing times he continued to write to her directing her reading sympathizing in her childish troubles and constantly thinking of little presents to please her her health was to him matter of paramount concern and in his last letters to her we ﬁnd him reiterating warnings to take care of y must be careful always to wear warm clothing not only in frost but in thaw careful to let fretting injure your health i have suffered is the greatest of health and hope we should be content to live and so you will ﬁnd you grow older the constant recurrence of this thought becomes in the light of his own suf ferings almost unbearably pathetic during the ﬁrst months of his illness keats saw through the press his last volume of poetry of which this is reprint the praise which it received from reviewers and public was in marked contrast to the scornful reception of his earlier works and would have augured well the future but keats was past caring much poetic fame he dragged on through the summer with rallies and relapses tormented above all by the thought that death would separate him from the woman he loved only brown of all his friends knew what he was suf fering and it seems that he only knew fully after they were parted the doctors warned keats that winter in england would kill him so in september 1820 he left london naples accompanied by young artist joseph severn one of his many devoted friends shelley who knew him slightly invited him to stay at pisa but keats refused he had never cared shelley though shelley seems to have liked him and in his invalid state he naturally shrank from being burden to mere acquaintance it was they left england off the coast of dorsetshire that keats wrote his last beautiful sonnet on blank leaf of his folio copy of shakespeare facing lover complaint bright star would i were steadfast thou not in lone splendour hung aloft the night and watching with eternal lids apart like nature patient sleepless eremite

ripening breast to feel ever its soft fall and swell awake ever in sweet unrest still still to hear her tender taken breath and so live else swoon to death the friends reached rome and there keats after brief rally rapidly became worse severn nursed him with desperate devotion and of keats sweet considerateness and patience he could never say enough indeed such was the force and lovableness of keats personality that though severn lived years longer it was the rest of his life chief occupation to write and draw his memories of his friend on february 23rd 1821 came the end which keats had begun to long he died peacefully in severn arms on the 26th he was buried in the beautiful little protestant cemetery of which shelley said that it one in love with death to think that one should be buried in so sweet place great indignation was felt at the time by those who attributed his death in part at least to the cruel treatment which he had received from the critics shelley in adonais withered xx xxi xxii the project gutenberg ebook of keats poems published in 1820 by john keats https with his scorn and byron in don juan had his gibe both at the poet and at his enemies but we know now how mistaken they were keats in normal state of mind and body was never unduly depressed by harsh or unfair criticism or blame he wrote but momentary effect on the man whose love of beauty in the abstract makes him severe critic on his own works and this attitude he consistently maintained throughout his poetic career doubt the sense that his genius was unappreciated added something to the torment of mind which he suffered in rome and on his he asked that on his tombstone should be inscribed the words lies one whose name was writ in water but it was apparently not said in bitterness and the rest of the inscription expresses rather the natural anger of his friends at the treatment he had received than the mental attitude of the poet himself fully to understand him we must read his poetry with the commentary of his letters which reveal in his character elements of humour clear wisdom frankness strength sympathy and tolerance so doing we shall enter into the mind and heart of the friend who speaking many described keats one genius i did not and not more fully admire than i entirely loved the man footnotes many of the words which the reviewers thought to be coined were good elizabethan this grave contains all that was mortal of young english poet who on his death bed in the bitterness of his heart at the malicious power of his enemies desired these words to be engraven

introduction to hyperion 245 introduction to lamia lamia like endymion is written in the heroic couplet but the difference in style is very marked the inﬂuence of dryden his translations from boccaccio and chaucer is clearly traceable in the metre style and construction of the later poem like dryden keats now makes frequent use of the alexandrine or line and of the triplet he has also restrained the exuberance of his language and gained force whilst in imaginative power and felicity of diction he surpasses anything of which dryden was capable the ﬂaws in his style are mainly due to carelessness in the rimes and some questionable coining of words he also occasionally lapses into the vulgarity and triviality which marred certain of his early poems 198 120 130 199 200 201 the project gutenberg ebook of keats poems published in 1820 by john keats https best he gained from his study of dryden fables debt perhaps to chaucer rather than to dryden was notable advance in constructive power in lamia he shows very much greater sense of proportion and power of selection than in his earlier work there is it were more light and shade thus we ﬁnd that whenever the occasion demands it his style rises to supreme force and beauty the metamorphosis of the serpent the entry of lamia and lycius into corinth the building by lamia of the fairy hall and her ﬁnal withering under the eye of are the most important points in the story and the passages in which they are described are also the most striking in the poem the allegorical meaning of the story seems to be that it is fatal to attempt to separate the sensuous and emotional life from the life of reason philosophy alone is cold and destructive but the pleasures of the senses alone are unreal and unsatisfying the man who attempts such divorce between the two parts of his nature will fail miserably did lycius who unable permanently to exclude reason was compelled to face the death of his illusions and could not himself survive them of the poem keats himself says writing to his brother in september 1819 i have been reading over part of short poem i have composed lately called lamia and i am certain there is that sort of ﬁre in it that must take hold of people some way give them either pleasant or unpleasant they want is sensation of some sort but to the greatest of keats critics charles lamb the poem appealed somewhat differently he writes exuberantly rich in imagery and painting than isabella is the story of lamia it is of gorgeous stuff ever romance was composed of and after enumerating the most

inspired by classic story though the inspiration in each case came to him through elizabethan writers here on the other hand mediaeval legend is his inspiration the broods have driven and satyr from the prosperous woods akin to the greeks he was in spirit in his instinctive personiﬁcation of the lovely manifestations of nature his style and method were really more naturally suited to the portrayal of mediaeval scenes where he found the richness and warmth of colour in which his soul delighted the story of isabella he took from boccaccio an italian writer of the fourteenth century whose decamer on collection of one hundred stories has been of plots english writers by boccaccio the tale is very shortly and simply told being evidently interesting to him mainly its plot keats was attracted to it not so much by the action by the passion involved so that his enlar gement of it means little elaboration of incident but very much more dwelling on the psychological aspect that is to say he does not care so much what happens what the personages of the poem think and feel thus we see that the main incident of the story the murder of lorenzo is passed over in was lorenzo slain and buried in the next line in that forest did his great love cease bringing us back at once from the physical reality of the murder to the thought of his love which is to keats the central fact of the story in the delineation of isabella her ﬁrst tender passion of love her agony of apprehension giving way to dull despair her sudden wakening to brief period of frenzied action described in stanzas of incomparable dramatic force and the which followed when she forgot the stars the moon the sun and she got the blue above the trees and she got the dells where waters run and she got the chilly autumn breeze she had knowledge when the day was done and the new morn she saw 210 211 the project gutenberg ebook of keats poems published in 1820 by john keats https in the piteous death lone and the delineation of all this keats shows supreme power and insight in the conception too of the tragic loneliness of lorenzo ghost we feel that nothing could be changed added or taken away not quite equally happy are the descriptions of the cruel brothers and of lorenzo the young lover there is tendency to exaggerate both their inhumanity and his gentleness purposes of contrast which weakens where it would give strength the eve of agnes founded on popular mediaeval legend not being tragedy like isabella can not be expected to rival it in depth and intensity but in every other poetic quality it equals where it does not surpass the former poem to be specially noted is the skilful use which keats here makes of the cruel cold without and the warm love within the palsied age of the bedes man and angela and the eager youth of porphyro and madeline the noise and revel and the hush of madeline bedroom and colvin has pointed out in the moonlight which chill and sepulchral when it strikes elsewher to madeline is halo of glory an angelic light mysterious charm is given to the poem by the way in which keats endows inanimate things with sort of life the knights and ladies of stone arouse the bedesman shuddering sympathy when he thinks of the cold they must be enduring carven angels from the roof of the chapel and the scutcheon in madeline window blush with blood of queens and kings keats characteristic method of way in which by his masterly choice of signiﬁcant detail he gives us the whole feeling of the situation is here seen in its perfection in stanza 1 each line is picture and each picture contributes to the whole effect of painful chill the silence of the sheep the old man breath visible in the frosty air are things which many people would not notice but it is such little things that make the whole scene real to us there is another method of description quite beautiful in its way which coleridge adopted with magic effect in christabel this is to use the power of suggestion to say very little but that little of kind to awaken the reader imagination and make him complete the picture example we are told of her gentle limbs did she undress and lay down in her loveliness compare this with stanza xxvi of the eve of agnes that keats was master of both ways of obtaining romantic effect is shown by his la belle dame sans merci considered by some people

him somehow to stand and suggest he did not think of the nightingale an individual bird but of its song which had been beautiful centuries and would continue to be beautiful long after his generation had passed away and the thought of this undying loveliness he contrasted bitterly with our feverishly sad and short life when by the power of imagination he had left the world behind him and was absorbed in the vision of beauty roused by the bird song he longed death rather than return to disillusionment so in the grecian urn he contrasts unsatisfying human life with art which is everlastingly beautiful the ﬁgures on the vase lack one thing on the other hand they are happy in not being subject to trouble change or death the thought is sad yet keats closes this ode triumphantly not in the nightingale on note of disappointment the beauty of this greek sculpture truly felt teaches us that beauty at any rate is real and lasting and that utter belief in beauty is the one thing needful in life in the ode on melancholy keats in more bitter mood ﬁnds the presence in ﬂeeting world of eternal beauty the source of the deepest melancholy to encourage your melancholy mood he tells us not look on the things counted sad but on the most beautiful which are only manifestations of the everlasting principle of beauty it is then when man most deeply loves the beautiful when he uses his capacities of joy to the utmost that the full bitterness of the contrast between the real and the ideal comes home to him and crushes him if he did not feel so much he would not suffer so much if he loved beauty less he would care less that he could not hold it long but in the ode to autumn keats attains to the serenity he has been seeking in this unparalleled description of richly beautiful autumn day he conveys to us all the peace and comfort which his spirit receives he does not philosophize upon the spectacle or draw moral from it but he shows us how in nature beauty is ever presen to the momentary regret spring he replies with praise of the present hour concluding with an exquisite description of the sounds of music beautiful that of spring hitherto he has lamented the insecurity of man hold upon the beautiful though he has never doubted the reality of beauty and the worth of its worship to man now under the inﬂuence of nature he intuitively knows that beauty once seen and grasped is man possession ever he is in much the same position that wordsworth was when he declared that 230 231 the project gutenberg ebook of keats poems published in 1820 by john keats https never

tranquil and continual joy in her song and one morning he took his chair from the breakfast table to the under plum where he sat two or three hours when he came into the house i perceived he had some

244 the project gutenberg ebook of keats poems published in 1820 by john keats https poem deals with the overthrow of the primaeval order of gods by jupiter son of saturn the old king there are many versions of the fable in greek mythology and there are many sources from which it may have come to keats at school he is said to have known the classical dictionary by heart but his inspiration is more likely to have been due to his later reading of the elizabet han poets and their translations of classic story one thing is certain that he did not conﬁne himself to any one authority nor did he consider it necessary to be circumscri bed by authorities at all he used rather than followed the greek fable dealing freely with it and giving it his own interpretation the situation when the poem opens is follows king of the gods has been driven from olympus down into deep dell by his son jupiter who has seized and used his father weapon the thunderbolt similar fate has overtaken nearly all his brethren who are called by keats titans and giants indiscriminately though in greek mythology the two races are quite distinct these titans are the children of tellus and coelus the earth and sky thus representing it were the ﬁrst birth of form and persona lity from formless nature before the separation of earth and sky chaos confusion of the elements of all things had reigned supreme one only of the titans hyperion the god still keeps his kingdom and he is about to be superseded by young apollo the god of light and song in the second book we hear oceanus and clymene his daughter tell how both were defeated not by battle or violence but by the irresistible beauty of their dispossessors and from this oceanus deduces eternal law that ﬁrst in beauty should be ﬁrst in might he recalls the fact that saturn himself was not the ﬁrst ruler but received his kingdom from his parents the earth and sky and he prophesies that progress will continue in the overthrow of jove by yet brighter and better order enceladus is however furious at what he considers cowardly acceptance of their fate and urges his brethren to resist in book i we saw hyperion though still god distressed by portents and now in book iii we see the rise to divinity of his successor the young apollo the poem breaks off short at the moment of apollo metamorphosis and how keats intended to complete it we can never know it is certain that he originally meant to write an epic in ten books and the publisher remark at the beginning of the 1820 volume would lead us to think that he was in the same mind when he wrote the poem this statement however must be altogether discounted keats in his copy of the poems crossed it right out and wrote above i had part in this i was ill at the time moreover the last sentence from to he bracketed writing below is lie this together with other evidence external and internal has led sélincourt to the conclusion that keats had modiﬁed his plan and when he was writing the poem intended to conclude it in four books of the probable contents of the unwritten books sélincourt writes i conceive that apollo now conscious of his divinity would have gone to olympus heard from the lips of jove of his supremacy and been called upon by the rebel three to secure the kingdom that awaited him he would have gone forth to meet hyperion who struck by the power of supreme beauty would have found resistance impossible critics have inclined to take granted the supposition that an actual battle was contemplated by keats but i not believe that such was at least his ﬁnal intention in the ﬁrst place he had the example of milton whom he was studying very closely to warn him of its dangers in the second if hyperion had been meant to ﬁght he would hardly be represented already before the battle shorn of much of his strength thus making the victory of apollo depend upon his enemy unnatural weakness and not upon his own strength one may add that combat would have been completely alien to the whole idea of the poem keats conceived it and in fact it is universally interpreted from the speech of oceanus in the second book the resistance of enceladus and the giants themselves rebels against an order 245 246 the project gutenberg ebook of keats poems published in 1820 by john keats https established would have been dealt with summarily and the poem would have closed with description of the new age which had been inaugurated by the triumph of the olympians and in particular of apollo the god of light and song the central idea then of the poem is that the new age triumphs over the old by virtue of its acknowledged intellectual supremacy makes physical force feel its power and yield dignity and moral conquest lies the conquered in the capacity to recognize the truth and look upon the inevitable undismayed keats broke the poem off because it was too and it is easy to see what he meant not only does the treatment of the subject recall that of paradise lost the council of the fallen gods bearing special resemblance to that of the fallen angels in book ii of milton epic but in its style and syntax the inﬂuence of milton is everywhere apparent it is to be seen in the restraint and concentration of the language which is in marked contrast to the wordiness of keats early work well in the constant use of classical constructions miltonic inversions and repetitions and in occasional reminiscences of actual lines and phrases in paradise lost in hyperion we see too the inﬂuence of the study of greek sculpture upon keats mind and art this study had taught him that the highest beauty is not incompat ible with deﬁniteness of form and clearness of detail to his romantic appreciation of mystery was now added an equal sense of the impo rtance of simplicity form and proportion these being from its nature inevitable characteristics of the art of sculpture so we see that again and again the ﬁgures described in hyperion are like great massive and motionless such are the pictures of saturn and thea in book i and of each of the group of titans at the opening of book ii striking too is keats very greek identiﬁcation of the gods with the powers of nature which they represent it is this attitude of mind which has led some elley and landor among declare keats in spite of his ignorance of the language the most truly greek of all english poets very beautiful instances of this are the sunset and sunrise in book i when the departure of the and his return to earth are so described that the pictures we see are of an evening and morning sky an angry sunset and grey and misty dawn but neither miltonic nor greek is keats marvellous treatment of nature he feels and makes us feel the magic of its mystery in such picture that of the tall oaks by the earnest stars or of the dismal cirque of druid stones upon forlorn moor when the chill rain begins at shut of eve in dull november and their chancel vault the heaven itself is blinded throughout night
