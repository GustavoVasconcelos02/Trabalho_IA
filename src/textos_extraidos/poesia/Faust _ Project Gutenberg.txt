time although more than score of english translations of the first part and three or four of the second part were in existence the experiment had not yet been made the prose version of hayward seemed to have been accepted the standard in default of anything more satisfactory the english critics generally sustaining the translator in his views concerning the secondary importance of form in poetry practically discouraged any further attempt and one familiar with rhythmical expression through the needs of his own nature had devoted the necessary love and patience to an adequate reproduction of the great work of goethe s life brooks was the ﬁrst to undertake the task and the publication of his translation of the first part in 1856 induced time to give up my own design previous english version exhibited such abnegation of the translator s own tastes and habits of thought such reverent desire to present the original in its purest form the care and conscience with which the work had been performed were so apparent that i now state with reluctance what then seemed to to be its only deﬁciencies lack of the lyrical ﬁre and ﬂuency of the original in some passages and an occasional lowering of the tone through the use of words which are literal but not equivalent the plan of translation adopted by brooks was so entirely my own that when further residence in germany and more careful study of both parts of faust had satisﬁed that the ﬁeld was still open the means furnished by the poetical afﬁnity of the two languages had not yet been exhausted remained but to follow him in all essential particulars his example conﬁrmed in the belief that there were few difﬁculties in the way of nearly literal yet thoroughly rhythmical version of faust which might not be overcome by loving labor comparison of seventeen english translations in the arbitra ry metres adopted by the translators sufﬁciently showed the danger of allowing license in this respect the white light of goethe s thought was thereby passed through the tinted glass of other minds and assumed the coloring of each moreover the plea of selecting different metres in the hope of producing similar effect is unreasonable where the identical metres are possible the value of form in poetical work is the ﬁrst question to be considered poet ever understood this question more thoroughly than goethe himself or expressed more positive opinion in regard to it the alternative modes of translation which he presents reported by riemer quoted by austin in her characteristics of goethe and accepted by hayward are quite independent of his views concerning the value of form which we ﬁnd given elsewhere in the clearest and most emphatic manner b poetry is not simply fashion of expression it is the form of expression absolutely required by certain class of ideas poetry indeed may be distinguished from prose by the single circumstance that it is the utterance of whatever in man can not be perfectly uttered in any other than rhythmical form it is useless to say that the naked meaning is independent of the form on the contrary the form contributes essentially to the fullness of the meaning in poetry which endures through its own inherent vitality there is forced union of these two elements they are intimately blended and with the same mysterious beauty the sexes in the ancient hermaphroditus to attempt to represent poetry in prose is very much like attempting to translate music into speech c there are two maxims of translation says he the one requires that the author of foreign nation be brought to us in such manner that we may regard him our own the other on the contrary demands of us that we transport ourselves over to him and adopt his situation his mode of speaking and his peculiarities the advantages of both are sufﬁciently known to all instructed persons from masterly is it necessary however that there should always be this alternative where the languages are kindred and equally capable of all varieties of metrical expression may not both these faust project gutenberg https maxims be observed in the same translation goethe it is true was of the opinion that faust ought to be given in french in the manner of clement marot but this was undoubtedly because he felt the inadequacy of modern french to express the naive simple realism of many passages the same objection does not apply to english there are few archaic expressions in faust but more than are still frequently the english of our day you are right said goethe there are great and mysterious agencies included in the various forms of poetry if the substance of my roman elegies were to be expressed in the tone and measure of byron s don juan it would really have an atrocious the rhythm said goethe is an unconscious result of the poetic mood if one should stop to consider it mechanically when about to write poem one would become bewildered and accomplish nothing of real poetical all that is poetic in character should be rythmically treated such is my conviction and if even sort of poetic prose should be gradually introduced it would only show that the distinction between prose and poetry had been completely lost sight to schiller tycho mommsen in his excellent essay die kunst des deutschen uebersetzers aus neueren sprachen goes so far to say the metrical or rhymed modelling of poetical work is so essentially the germ of its being that rather than by giving it up we might hope to construct similar work of art before the eyes of our countrymen by giving up or changing the substance the immeasurable result which has followed works wherein the form has been the homer of voss and the shakespeare of tieck and an incontrovertible evidence of the vitality of the goethe s poems exercise great sway over not only by their meaning but also by their rhythm it is language which stimulates to beethoven the various theories of translation from the greek and latin poets have been admirably stated by dryden in his preface to the translations from ovid s epistles and i not wish to continue the endless discussion our literature needs examples not opinions recent expression however carries with it so much authority that i feel bound to present some considerations which the accomplished scholar seems to have overlooked lewes d justly says the effect of poetry is compound of music and suggestion this music and this suggestion are intermingled in words which to alter is to alter the effect words in poetry are not in prose simple representatives of objects and ideas they are parts of an organic whole are tones in the harm he thereupon illustrates the effect of translation by changing certain english stanzas into others equivalent in meanin g but lacking their felicity of words their grace and melody i can not accept this illustration valid because lewes purposely omits the very quality which an honest translator should exhaust his skill in endeavoring to reproduce he turns away from the one best word or phrase in the english lines he quotes whereas the translator seeks precisely that one best word or phrase having all the resources of his language at command to represent what is said in another language more than this his task is not simply mechanical he must feel and be guided by secondary inspiration surrendering himself to the full possession of the spirit which shall speak through him he receives also portion of the same creative power lewes reaches this conclusion if therefore we reﬂect what poem faust is and that it contains almost every variety of style and metre it will be tolerably evident that one unacquainted with the original can form an adequate idea of it from translation which is certainly correct of any translation wherein something of the rhythmical variety and beauty of the original is not retained that very much of the rhythmical character may be retained in english was long ago shown by carlyle f in the passages which he translated both literally and rhythmically from the helena part second in fact we b c faust project gutenberg https so many instances of the possibility of reciprocally transferring the ﬁnest qualities of english and german poetry that there is sufﬁcient excuse an unmetrical translation of faust i refer especially to such subtile and melodious lyrics the castle by the sea of uhland and the silent land of salis translated by longfellow goethe s minstrel and coptic song by hedge heine s two grenadiers by furness and many of heine s songs by mr leland and also to the german trans lations of english lyrics by freiligrath and strodtmann g life of goethe book lewes gives the following advice the english reader would perhaps best succeed who should ﬁrst read anster s brilliant paraphrase and then carefully go through hayward s prose this is singularly at variance with the view he has just expressed anster s version is an almost incredible dilution of the original written in other metres while hayward s entirely omits the element of poetry foreign review when freiligrath can thus give us walter scott kommt wie der wind kommt wenn wälder erzittern kommt wie die brandung wenn flotten zersplittern schnell heran schnell herab schneller kommt al häuptling und bub und knapp herr und vasalle or strodtmann thus reproduce tennyson es fällt der strahl auf burg und thal und schneeige gipfel reich an sagen viel lichter wehn auf blauen seen bergab die wasserstürze jagen blas hüfthorn blas in wiederhall erschallend blas echos hallend hallend hallend must be dull ear which would be satisﬁed with the omission of rhythm and rhyme i have more serious objection however to urge against hayward s prose translation where all the restraints of verse are ﬂung aside we should expect at least accurate reproduction of the sense spirit and tone of the original the genius of our language will permit so far from having given us such reproduction hayward not only occasionally mistakes the exact meaning of the german text h but wherever two phrases may be used to express the meaning with equal ﬁdelity he very frequent ly selects that which has the less grace strength or beauty i on his second page the line mein lied ertönt der unbekannten menge my song sounds to the unknown multitude is translated my sorrow voices itself to the strange other english translators i notice have followed hayward in mistaking lied leid d f g h faust project gutenberg https take but one out of numerous instances the sake of illustration the close of the soldier s song part scene ii is kühn is mühen herrlich der lohn und die soldaten ziehen literally bold is the endeavor splendid the pay and the soldiers march away this hayward translates bold the adventure noble the and the soldiers are off there are few things which may not be said in english in twofold manner poetic and the other prosaic in german equally word which in ordinary use has bare prosaic character may receive fairer and ﬁner quality from its place in verse the prose translator should certainly be able to feel the manifestation of this law in both languages and should so choose his words to meet their reciprocal requirements man however who is not keenly sensible to the power and beauty and value of rhythm is likely to overlook these delicate yet most necessary distinctions the author s thought is stripped of last grace in passing through his mind and frequently presents very much the same resemblance to the original an unhewn shaft to the ﬂuted column hayward unconsciously illustrates his lack of reﬁned appreciation of verse in giving he says sort of rhythmical arrangement to the lyrical parts his object being to convey some notion of the variety of versiﬁcation which forms one great charm of the literal translation is always possible in the unrhymed passages but even here hayward s ear did not dictate to him the necessity of preserving the original rhythm while therefore i heartily recognize his lofty appreciation of faust i honor him the patient and conscientious labor he has bestowed upon his translation can not but feel that he has himself illustrated the unsoundness of his argument nevertheless the circumstance that his prose translation of faust has received so much acceptance proves those qualities of the original work which can not be destroyed by test so violent from the cold bare outline thus produced the reader unacquainted with the german language would scarcely guess what glow of color what richness of changeful life what ﬂuent grace and energy of movement have been lost in the process we must of course gratefully receive such an outline where nearer approach to the form of the original is impossible but until the latter has been demonstrated we are wrong to remain content with the cheaper substitute it seems to that in all discussions upon this subject the capacities of the english language have received but scanty justice the intellectual tendencies of our race have always been somewhat conservative and its standards of literary taste or belief once set up are not varied without struggle the english ear is suspicious of new metres and unaccustomed forms of expression there are critical detectives on the track of every i faust project gutenberg https and violation of the accepted canons is followed by summons to judgment thus the tendency is to contract rather than to expand the acknowledged excellences of the language j i can not resist the temptation of quoting the following passage from jacob grimm one of all the modern languages has acquired greater force and strength than the english through the derangement and relinquishment of its ancient laws of sound the unteachable nevertheless learnable profusion of its has conferred upon it an intrinsic power of expression such other human tongue ever possessed its entire thoroughly intellectual and wonderfully successful foundation and perfected development issued from marvelous union of the two noblest tongues of europe the germanic and the romanic their mutual relation in the english language is well known since the former furnished chieﬂy the material basis while the latter added the intellectual conceptions the english language by and through which the greatest and most eminent poet of modern contrasted with ancient classical of course i can refer only to shakespeare was begotten and nourished has just claim to be called language of the world and it appears to be destined like the english race to higher and broader sway in all quarters of the earth in richness in compact adjustment of parts and in pure intelligence none of the living languages can be compared with it even our german which is divided even we are divided and which must cast off many imperfections before it can boldly enter on its den ursprung der sprache the difﬁculties in the way of nearly literal translation of faust in the original metres have been exaggerated because certain afﬁnities between the two languages have not been properly considered with all the splendor of versiﬁcation in the work it contains but few metres of which the english tongue is not equally capable hood has familiarized us with dactylic triple rhymes and they are remarkably abundant and skillful in lowell s fable the critics even the unrhymed iambic hexameter of the helena occurs now and then in milton s samson agonistes it is true that the metrical foot into which the german language most naturally falls is the trochaic while in english it is the iambic it is true that german is rich involved and tolerant of new combinations while english is simple direct and rather shy of compounds but precisely these differences are so modiﬁed in the german of faust that there is mutual approach of the two languages in faust the iambic measure predominates the style is compact the many licenses which the author allows himself are all directed towards shorter mode of construction on the other hand english metre compels the use of inversions admits many verbal liberties prohibited to prose and so inclines towards various ﬂexible features of its sister tongue that many lines of faust may be repeated in english without the slightest change of meaning measure or rhyme there are words it is true with so delicate bloom upon them that it can in wise be preserved but even such words will always lose less when they carry with them their rhythmical atmosphere the ﬂow of goethe s verse is sometimes so similar to that of the corresponding english metre that not only its harmonies and caesural pauses but even its punctuation may be easily retained i am satisﬁed that the difference between translation of faust in prose or metre is chieﬂy one of labor of that labor which is successful in proportion it is joyously performed my own task has been cheered by the discovery that the more closely i reproduced the language of the original the more of its rhythmical chara cter was transferred at the same time if now and then there was an inevitable alternative of meaning or music i gave the preference to the former by the term original metres i not mean rigid unyielding adherence to every foot line and rhyme of the german original although this has very nearly been accomplished since the greater part of the work is written in an irregular measure the lines varying from three to six feet and the rhymes arranged according to the author s will i not consider that an occasional change in the number of feet or order of rhyme is any violation of the metrical plan the single slight liberty i have taken with the lyrical passages is in margaret s song the king of thule which by omitting the alternate feminine rhymes yet retaining the j faust project gutenberg https i was enabled to make the translation strictly literal if in two or three instances i have left line unrhymed i have balanced the omission by giving rhymes to other lines which stand unrhymed in the original text the same reason i make apology the imperfect rhymes which are frequently translation well necessity with all its supreme qualities faust is far from being technically perfect work k at present everything runs in technical grooves and the critical gentlemen begin to wrangle whether in rhyme an s should correspond with an s and not with sz if i were young and reckless enough i would purposely offend all such technical caprices i would use alliteration assonance false rhyme just according to my own will or at the same time i would attend to the main thing and endeavor to say so many good things that every one would be attracted to read and remember in the feminine and dactylic rhymes which have been the most part omitted by all metrical translators except brooks are indispensable the characteristic tone of many passages would be nearly lost without them they give spirit and grace to the dialogue point to the aphoristic portions especi ally in the second part and an music to the lyrical passages the english language though not so rich the german in such rhymes is less deﬁcient than is generally supposed the difﬁculty to be overcome is one of construction rather than of the vocabulary the present participle can only be used to limited extent on account of its weak termination and the want of an accusative form to the noun also restricts the arrangement of words in english verse i can not hope to have been always successful but i have at least labored long and patiently bearing constantly in mind not only the meaning of the original and the mechanical structure of the lines but also that subtile and haunting music which seems to govern rhythm instead of being governed by it k faust project gutenberg https goethe i erhabener geist
