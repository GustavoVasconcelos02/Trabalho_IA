subscribers onl y dear m r s mithers by every right i ought to choose you to edit and bring out sir richard burton translation of catullus because you collaborated with him on this work by correspondence of many months before he died if i have hesitated so long to its production it was because his notes which are mostly like pencilled cobwebs strewn all over his latin edition were headed never shew work to women or fools the reason of this remark was that in all his writings his ﬁrst copy his ﬁrst thought was always the best and the most powerful like many painter who will go on improving and touching up his picture till he has destroyed the likeness and the startling realistic nature of his subject so would sir richard go on weakening his ﬁrst copy by improvements and then appeal to to say which was the best i was almost invariably obliged in conscience to induce him to stick to the ﬁrst thought which had grasped the whole meaning like ﬂash these notes were made in most curious way he used to bring his latin catullus down to table with him and he used to come and sit by but the moment he got person on the other side who did not interest him he used to whisper to talk that i may my catullus and between the courses he wrote what i now give you the public is taught that the atys was unique in subject and metre that it was the greatest and most remarkable poem in latin literature famous the ﬁery vehemence of the greek dithyramb that it was the only specimen in latin of the galliambic measure so called because sung by the i suspect that the now learns that there are half dozen others which you can doubtl ess name to my mind the gems of the whole translati on are the epithalamium or epos of the marriage of vinia and manlius and the parcae in that of peleus and thetis sir richard laid great stress on the following in his notes headed compare with catullus the sweet and tender little villanelle by edmund gosse the viol and xix cent with the ist little mistress mine i have been your sparrow true dig my grave i must die waste tear and heave sigh life should still be blithe you little mistress mine in your garden let lie underneath the pointed

bosom too dig my grave i must die let our garden friends that ﬂy be the mourners ﬁt and few little mistress mine dig my grave i must die sir richard seriously began his catullus on 18th 1890 at hamman in north africa he had ﬁnished the ﬁrst rough copy on march 31st 1890 at trieste he made second copy beginning may 23rd 1890 at trieste which was ﬁnished july 21st 1890 at zurich he then writes margin work incomplete but soon i receive smithers prose i will ﬁll in the words i now leave in stars in order that we may not use the same expressions and i will then make third fair and complete copy but alas then he was surprised by death i am afraid that sir richard readers may be disappointed to ﬁnd that unlike grant allen there is excursus on the origin of and therefore that perhaps through ignorance i have omitted something sir richard did write in the sixties and seventies on the ogham runes and el mushajjar the arabic alphabet had theories and opinions to its origin but he did not i know connect them in any way however remote with catullus i therefore venture to think you will quite agree with that they have business here but should appear in connection with my future work labours and wisdom of sir richard burton all these three and half years i have hesitated what to but after seeing other men translations his incomplete work is in my humble estimation too good to be consigned to oblivion so that i will longer defer to send you copy and to ask you to bring it through the press supplying the latin text and adding thereto your own prose which we never saw yours truly isabel b urton july 1 1th forew ord scholar lively remembered to that catullus translated word word is an anachronism and that literal english rendering in the nineteenth century could be true to the poet letter but false to his spirit i was compelled to admit that something of this is true but it is not the whole truth consulting modern taste means really mere imitation of the ancient past in modern material it is presenting the toga citizen rough haughty and careless of any approbation not his own in the costume of shirt coat clothes white and diamond ring moreover of these transmogriﬁcations we have already enough and to spare but we have not far i know any version of catullus which can transport the english reader from the teachings of our century to that preceding the christian discovery is mostly my mania i have hit upon ging to indulge it by presenting to the public of certain classics in the nude roman poetry like the arab and of the same date richard b urton trieste 1890 vii viii ix the carmina of caius valerius catullus https the foreword just given is an unﬁnished pencilling on the margin of sir richard latin text of catullus i reproduce below portion of his foreword to previous translation from the latin on which we collaborated and which was issued in the summer of french publisher lately remarked to that rule versions in verse are enjoyable to the writer they are unenjoyed by the reader who vehemently doubts their truth and trustworthiness these pages hold in view one object sole and simple namely to prove that translation metrical and literal may be true and may be trustworthy i told the public camoens life and lusiads ii it has ever been my ambition to reverse the late matthew arnold peremptory dictum in verse translation original work is any longer recognisable and here i may be allowed to borrow from my supplemental arabian nights vol appendix pp book known to few and never to be reprinted my vision of the ideal translation which should not be relegated to the limbus of intentions my estimate of translator ofﬁce has never been of the low level generally assigned to it even in the days when englishmen were in the habit of translating every work interesting or important published out of england and of thus giving continental and cosmopolitan ﬂavour to their literature we can not at this period expect much from of letters who must produce monthly volume pittance of of him we need not speak but the translator at his best works when reproducing the matter and the manner of his original upon two distinct lines his prime and primary object is to please his reader edifying him and gratifying his taste the second is to produce an hones t and faithful copy adding naught to the sense or abating aught of its especial cachet he has however or should have another aim wherein is displayed the acme of hermeneutic art every language can proﬁtably lend something to and take somewhat from its neighbours epithet metaphor naïf idiom turn of phrase and the translator of original mind who notes the innumerable shades of tone manner and complexion will not neglect the frequent opportunities of enriching his mother with novel and alien ornaments which shall justly be accounted barbarisms until formally naturalized and adopted nor will any modern versionist relegate to is the malpractice of his banal brotherhood the striking and often startling phases of the foreign author phraseology and dull the text with and commonplace english equivalents thus doing the clean reverse of what he should it was this beau idéal of translator success which made eustache deschamps write of his contemporary and brother bard grand t ranslateur noble geoffr oy chaucier here ﬁrste ﬁnder of our fair langage is styled socrates in philosophy seneca in morals an angel in conduct and great translator seeming which has scandalized not little sundry inditers of and the title is bathos it is given simply because chaucer translated using the term in its best and highest sense into his pure simple and strong english tongue with all its linguistic peculiarities the thoughts and fancies of his foreign models the very letter and spirit of petrarch and boccaccio the humble literary status of translation in modern england and the of the average english translator public taste or rather caprice is mainly to be blamed the general reader the man not in the street but the man who makes up the educated mass greatly relishes novelty in the way of plot or story or catastrophe while he has natural dislike to novelties of style and diction demanding certain dilution of the unfamiliar with the familiar hence our translations in verse especially when rhymed become the most part deﬂorations or excerpts adaptations or periphrases more or less meritorious and the translator was justly enough dubbed traitor by critics of the x xi xii the carmina of caius valerius catullus https sort and he amply deserves the injurious name when ignorance of his original language perforce makes him pander to popular prescription but the good time which has long been coming seems now to have come the home reader will longer put up with the careless caricatures of classical chefs re which satisﬁed his predecessor our youngers in most points our seniors now expect the translation not only to interpret the sense of the original but also when the text lends itself to such treatment to render it verbatim et literatim nothing being increased or diminished curtailed or expanded moreover in the choicer passages they so far require an echo of the original music that its melody and harmony should be suggested to their mind welcomed also are the mannerisms of the translator model far these aid in preserving under the disguise of another dialect the individuality of the foreigner and his peculiar costume that this high ideal of translation is at length becoming popular now appears in our literature the villon society when advertizing the novels of matteo bandello bishop of agen justly remarks of the translator john payne that his previous works have proved him to possess special qualiﬁcations the delicate and difﬁcult task of transferring into his own language at once the savour and the substance the matter and the manner of works of the highest individuality conceived and executed in foreign language in my version of hexameters and pentameters i have not shirked the metre although it is strangely out of favour in english literature while we read it and enjoy it in german there is little valid reason our aversion the rhythm has been made familiar to our ears by long courses of greek and latin and the rarity of spondaic feet is assuredly to be supplied by art and artiﬁce and now it is time farewelling my friends may longer alas address them with the ingenuous ancient in the imperative plaudite richard b urton july introduction the present translation was jointly unde rtaken by the late sir richard burton and myself in 1890 some months before his sudden and lamented death we had previously put into english and privately printed body of verse from the latin and our aim was to follow it with literal and unexpur gated renderin gs of catullus juvenal and ausonius from the same tongue sir richard laid great stress on the necessity of thoroughly annotating each translation from an erotic and especially paederastic point of view but subsequent circumstances caused to abandon that intention the latin text of catullus printed in this volume is that of mueller 1885 which sir richard burton chose the basis our translation and to that text i have mainly adhered on some few occasions however i have slightly deviated from it and although i have consulted owen and postgate in such cases i have usually followed robinson ellis bearing in mind my duty to the reader well to the author i have aimed at producing readable translation and yet literal version castrating passages the dissimilarity in idiom of the two languages latin and english permit and i claim this volume that it is the ﬁrst literal and complete english translation yet issued of catullus the translations into english verse which i have consulted are the adventur es of catullus and the history of his amours with lesbia done from the french 1707 nott lamb fleay privately printed 1864 shaw cranstoun martin xiii xiv xv xvi the carmina of caius valerius catullus https allen and ellis of these none has been helpful to save professor robinson ellis poems and fragments of catullus trans lated in the metres of the original most excellent and scholarly version to which i owe great indebtedness many felicitous expression i have also used nott freely in my annotations the only english prose translation of which i have any knowledge is the one in bohn edition of catullus and this in addition to being bowdlerized is in host of passages more paraphrase than literal translation i have not thought it needful in any case to point out my deviations from mueller text and i have cleared the volume of all the load of mythological and historical notes which are usually appended to translation of classic contenting myself with referring the reader to bohn edition of the poet of the boldness of sir richard burton experiment of metrical and linear translation there can be question and on the whole he has succeeded in proving his contention to its possibility though it must be confessed that it is at times at the cost of obscurity or of inversions of sentences which certain ly are compelled to lay claim to poet license it must however be borne in mind that in letter to just before his death he expressed his intention of going entirely through the work afresh on receiving my prose adding that it needed power of polishing to has fallen the task of editing sir richard share in this volume from copy literally swarming with copyist errors with respect to the occasional lacunae which appear i can merely state that lady burton has repeatedly assured that she has furnished with faithful copy of her husband translation and that the words omitted which are here indicated by full points not asterisks were not ﬁlled in by him because he was ﬁrst awaiting my translation with the view of our not using similar expressions however lady burton has without any reason consistently refused even glance at his and in our previous work from the latin i did not ﬁnd sir richard trouble himself in the least concerning our using like expressions the frontispiece to this volume is reproduced from

the morning after the nuptials and was held to be sufﬁcient proof of their happy consummation the ancients says pezay had faith in another equally absurd test of virginity they measured the circumference of the neck with thread then the girl under trial took the two ends of the magic thread in her teeth and if it was found to be so long that its bight could be passed over her head it was

against mamurra cx the word dare has here an erotic sense tota corpor prostituit some commentators think that this alludes to such women not only submit to prostitution but are in every way subservient to the lascivious caprices of depraved appetites vossius inclines to such an interpretation cxii multus some commentators read moltus in an obscene sense molendo vossius understands by descender in sese the same act is alluded to in c hence the force of the word multus meaning cum feminâ which he jeeringly applies to naso though he would ironically exclaim et feminâ solus es aut sine femin he writes the epigram thus multus homo est naso neque secum multus homo qui descendit naso multus es et pathicus the end end of the project gutenberg ebook the carmina of caius valerius ca
