canterbury tales printed in the present volume is an entirely new one owing nothing to the numerous printed editions which have preceded it the only exceptions to this statement are to be found in the case of such portions have been formerly edited the clarendon press by morris and myself the reasons the necessity of formation of an absolutely new text will appear on perusal of the text itself compared with any of its predecessors on the other hand it owes everything to the labours of furnivall the chaucer society but which satisfactory results could have been obtained except at the cost of more time and toil than i could well devote to the subject in other words my work is entirely founded upon the splendid edition published by that society supplemented by the very valuable reprint of the celebrated harleian manuscript in the same series these seven texts are all exact reproductions of seven important and are in two respects more important to the student than the mss themselves that is to say they can be studied simultaneously instead of separately and they can be consulted and at any moment being always accessible the importance of such opportunities is obvious t he m

the really second of the the best example is the ellesmere of the the best example is the harleian 7334 of the the corpus and lansdowne mss the is that exhibited by caxton and thynne in the early printed editions they may be called the ellesmere harleian corpus and caxton types respectively these types differ to the arrangement of the tales and even mss of similar type differ slightly in this respect among themselves they also frequently differ to certain characteristic readings although many of the variations of reading are peculiar to one or two mss only hl contains the best copy of the tale of gamelyn which see 645 this tale is not found in mss of the moreover group g here precedes group c and large part of group b whereas in the ellesmere it follows them in the monk s tale the lines numbered b containing the tales called the modern instances immediately follow b 3564 in this edition whereas in the ellesmere these lines come at the end of the tale the various readings of this are often peculiar and it is difﬁcult to appraise them i take them to be of two kinds i readings which are better than those of the and should certainly be preferred such halfe in 8 cloysterlees in 179 not ful in 196 and the like and 2 readings due to terrible blundering on the part of the scribe such ﬂeyng ﬂikeringe in 1962 greene kene in 1966 and the like it is in fact most dangerous to

in copied from caxton s 2nd edition after this the canterbury tales were invariably issued with the rest of chaucer s works until after some account of these editions is given in the preface to the

discourse notes and glossary by thomas tyrwhitt london 8vo 5 work of high literary value to which i am greatly indebted many necessary notes repr inted in 1798 in 4to 2 by the university of oxford and again at london in 1822 in post 8vo 5 vols by pickering in 1830 8vo 5 vols and by moxon in 1845 in 1 vol imp 8vo the last of these adds poor texts of the rest of chaucer s works from old editions with which tyrwhitt had nothing to in tyrwhitt s text the number of grammatical errors is very large and he frequently introduces words into the text without authority some account of the later editions of chaucer s works see the introduction to the legend of good women in vol iii i may note by the way that the editions by wright bell and morris are all founded on harl 7334 very unsafe in some respects see viii above it is necessary to add here few words of warning wright s edition though it has many merits turns out in practice to be dangerously untrustworthy he frequently inserts words borrowed from tyrwhitt s edition which he heartily condemns being full of errors in grammar without the least indication that they are not in the this becomes the more serious when we ﬁnd upon examination that tyrwhitt had likewise authority some of such insertions but simply introduced them by guess to ﬁll up line in way that pleased him example 628 runs thus in all the seven mss of his visage children were it is quite correct is trisyllabic tyrwhitt did not know this and counted the syllables two only neglecting the ﬁnal the line seemed then too short so he inserted sore before aferd thus ruining the scansion wright follows suit and inserts sore though it is not in his giving notice at all of what he has done bell follows suit and the word is even preserved in morris but the latter prints the word in italics to shew that it is not in the nor is it in the i shall not adduce more instances but shall content myself with saying that until the publications of the chaucer society appeared reader had the means of knowing what the best texts were really like all who have been accustomed to former complete editions have necessarily imbibed hundreds of false impressions and have necessarily accepted numberless theories to the scansion of lines which they will in course of due time be prepared to abandon in the course of my work it has been made clear to that chaucer s text has been manipulated and sophisticated frequently in most cunning and plausible ways to far greater extent than i could have believed to be possible this is not pleasant subject and i only mention it the use of scholars such variations fortunately seldom affect the sense but they vitiate the scansion the grammar and the etymology in many cases of course it will be understood that i am saying more than i can fully substantiate it is absolutely appalling to read such statement the following in bell s edition vol 60 all deviations either from wright s edition or from the original are pointed out in the footnotes the ultimate satisfaction of the reader the instances in which this is really done are very rare indeed in spite of the lar ge number of such deviations of tyrwhitt s text it is sufﬁcient to remark that it was hardly possible at that date better text to have been produced the rules of middle english grammar had not been formulated so that we are not surprised to ﬁnd that he constantly makes the past tense of weak verb monosyllabic when it should be dissyllabic and treats the past participle dissyllabic when it should be monosyllabic which makes wild work with the scansion it is also to be regretted that he based his text upon the faulty editions though he took great deal of pains in collating them with various mss on the other hand his literary notes are full of learning and research and the number of admirable illustrations by which he has efﬁciently elucidated the text is very great his reputation one of the xvi xvii the project gutenberg ebook of chaucer s works volume 4 of 7 the canterbury tales https of our literary critics is thoroughly established and needs comment wright s notes are likewise excellent and resulted from wide reading i have also found some most useful hints in the notes to bell s edition of all such sources of information i have been only too glad to avail myself is more fully shewn in the succeeding volume p lan of the p resent dition the text of the present edition of the canterbury tales is founded upon that of the ellesmere it has been collated throughout with that of the other six mss published by the chaucer society of these seven the harleian 7334 hl was printed separately the other six were printed in the valuable edition to which i constantly have occasion to refer in parallel columns the six mss are ellesmere hn hengwrt cm

fering from in using these terms earliest i not refer to the age of the but to the type of text which they exhibit in the list of mss given above hl is 1 are 40 41 and 28 and are 24 42 and 10 respectively of all the is the best in nearly every respect it not only gives good lines and good sense but is also usually grammatically accurate and thoroughly well spelt the publication of it has been very great boon to all chaucer students which furnivall will be ever gratefully remembered we must not omit at the same time to recognise the liberality and generosity of the owner of the who so freely permitted such full use of it to be made the same remark applies equally to the owners of the hengwrt and the petworth mss the names of the earl of ellesmere wm wynne of peniarth and lord lecon ﬁeld have deservedly become familiar household words to many student of chaucer this splendid has also the great merit of being complete requiring supplement from any other source except in the few cases where line or two has been missed example it does not contain 252 found in hn only nor also not in hn or cm nor b 1 190 also not in hn or cm nor b 1995 very rare indeed it is slightly imperfect in b 2510 2514 2525 2526 2746 it drops b c c not in hn cm pt g and has few defects in the parson s tale in i 190 273 in the tale of melibeus the french original shews that all the mss have lost b which have to be supplied by translation none of the seven mss have b these lines are genuine but were probably meant to be cancelled they only occur to my knowledge in four 7 11 25 and 29 though found also in the old editions on the other hand preserves lines rarely found elsewhere such are f twelve genuine lines none of which are in tyrwhitt and only the ﬁrst two are in wright observe also the stanza in the footnote to 424 with which compare b 3083 on the text of the ellesmere has only been corrected in cases where careful collation suggests desirable improvement every instance of this character is invariably recorded in the footnotes thus in 8 the grammar and scansion require not half though curiously enough this correct form appears in hl only among all the seven mss in very difﬁcult cases other mss besides the seven have been collated but i have seldom gained much by it the chief additional mss thus used are cambridge dd 4 24 29 above slo or sl sloane 1685 8 roy or rl

sufﬁciently indicated i have paid especial attention to the sufﬁxes required by grammar to the scansion and to the pronunciation and i suppose that this is the ﬁrst complete edition in which the spelling has been tested by phonetic considerations with view to making the spelling little clearer and more consistent i have ventured to adopt certain methods which i here explain in certain words of variable spelling in such whan or whanne than or thanne i have adopted that form which the scansion requires but the is usually right usually has hise his with plural in 1 i use his always except in prose has hir here her their i use hir only except at the end of line uses the endings or or i use only and in general i use i to represent short i and y to represent long i in king wyf such is the usual habit of the scribe but he often changes i into y before m and n to make his writing clearer such precaution is needless in modern printing thus in 42 i replace the scribe s bigynne by biginne and in 78 i replace his pilgrymage by pilgrimage this makes the text easier to read like reason where equivalent spellings occur i select the simpler writing couthe in pt kowthe sote soote sege seege and so on in words such our or oure your or youre hir or hire neuer or neuer i usually give the simpler forms without the ﬁnal when the is obviously silent consonantal u in neuer i write v in never this is usual in all editions but i could not bring myself to use j i consonant the anachronism is too great never neuer is common in the ﬁfteenth century but j does not occur even in the ﬁrst folio of shakespeare i therefore usually keep the capital i of the mss and of the elizabethan printers in ioye where initial and the small i in enioinen elsewhere those who dislike such conservatism may be comforted by the reﬂection that the sound rarely occurs the word eye has to be altered to yë at the end of line to preserve the rimes the scribes usually write eye in the middle of line but when they come to it at the end of one they are fairly puzzled in 10 the scribe of hn writes iye and that of ln writes yhe and the variations on this theme are most curious the spelling ye is however common in 1096 i print it yë to distinguish it from ye the pl pronoun these minute variations are i trust legitimate and i have not recorded them they cause trouble to the editor but afford ease to the reader which seems sufﬁcient justiﬁcation adopting them but the scrupulous critic need not fear that the has been departed from in any case where it could make any phonetic difference without due notice thus in 9 where i have changed foweles into fowles being more usual form the fact that foweles is the ellesmere spelling is duly recorded in the footnotes and so in other cases the footnotes not record various readings where is correct it stands they have purposely been made concise possible it would have been easy to multiply them fourfold without giving much information of value this is not unfrequently done but the gain is slight with so good the basis of the text it did not seem desirable the following methods shortening the footnotes have been adopted sometimes only the readings of some of the mss are given thus at 9 1 i omit the readings of cp and of cm fact neither of these mss contain the line but it was not worth while to take up space by saying so at 10 1 i again omit the readings of cp and of the same reason also of which is poor though here it agrees with hl having yhe also of which has eyghe spelling not here to be thought of at 12 i just note that has pilgrimage by mistake of course this means that it should have had pilgrimages in the plural in other and required by the rime xix xx the project gutenberg ebook of chaucer s works volume 4 of 7 the canterbury
