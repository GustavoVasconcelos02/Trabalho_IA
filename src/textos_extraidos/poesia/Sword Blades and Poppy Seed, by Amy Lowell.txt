tremblaient tendresse tout le grand songe terrestre vivait en moi pour vivre en eux je gravais aux métaux pieux mes dieux henri régnier les médailles preface one expects man to make chair without ﬁrst learning how but there is popular impression that the poet is born not made and that his verses burst from his overﬂowing heart of themselves matter of fact the poet must learn his trade in the same manner and with the same painstaking care the his heart may overﬂow with high thoughts and sparkling fancies but if he can not convey them to his reader by means of the written word he has claim to be considered poet workman may be pardoned therefore spending few moments to explain and describe the technique of his trade work of beauty which can not stand an intimate examination is poor and thing in the ﬁrst place i wish to state my ﬁrm belief that poetry should not try to teach that it should exist simply because it is created beauty even if sometimes the beauty of gothic grotesque we not ask the trees to teach us moral lessons and only the salvation army feels it necessary to pin texts upon them we know that these texts are ridiculous but many of us not yet see that to write an obvious moral all over work of art picture statue or poem is not only ridiculous but timid and vulgar we distrust beauty we only half understand and rush in with our impertinent suggestions how far we are from admitting the universe the universe which ﬂings down its continents and seas and leaves them without comment art is much function of the universe an equinoctial gale or the law of gravitation and we insist upon considering it merely little of great importance unless it be studded with nails from which pretty and uplifting sentiments may be hung the purely technical side i must state my immense debt to the french and perhaps above all to the parnassian school although some of the writers who have inﬂuenced most not belong to it and untiring workmen they have spared pains to produce poetry ﬁner than that of any other country in our time poetry so full of beauty and feeling that the study of it is at once an inspiration and despair to the artist the of our day has tendency to think that ﬁne idea excuses slovenly workmanship these clear frenchmen are reproof to our laziness before the works of parnassians like leconte lisle and heredia or those of henri régnier albert samain francis jammes rem y gourmont and paul fort of the more modern school we stand rebuked they order this matter better in france it is because in france poetry is so living and vigorous thing that so many metrical experiments come from there only vigorous tree has the vitality to put forth new branches the poet with originality and power is always seeking to give his readers the same poignant feeling which he has himself to this he must constantly ﬁnd new and striking images delightful and unexpected forms take the word dayb reak instance what remarkable picture it must once have conjured up the great round sun like the yolk of some mighty egg breaking sword blades and poppy seed by amy lowell https and splintered clouds but we have said daybreak so often that we not see the picture any more it has become only another word dawn the poet must be constantly seeking new pictures to make his readers feel the vitality of his thought many of the poems in this volume are written in what the french call vers libre nomenclature more suited to french use and to french versiﬁcation than to ours i prefer to call them poems in unrhymed cadence that conveys their exact meaning to an english ear they are built upon organic rhythm or the rhythm of the speaking voice with its necessity breathing rather than upon strict metrical system they differ from ordinary prose rhythms by being more curved and containing more stress the stress and exceedingly marked curve of any regular metre is easily perceived these poems built upon cadence are more subtle but the laws they follow are not less ﬁxed merely chopping prose lines into lengths does not produce cadence it is constructed upon mathematical and absolute laws of balance and time in the preface to his poems henley speaks of those unrhyming rhythms in which i had tried to quintessentialize i believe one scarce can in rhyme the desire to quintessentiali ze to an emotion until it burns seems to be an integral part of the modern temper and certainly unrhymed cadence is unique in its power of expressing this three of these poems are written in form which so far i know has never before been attempted in english paul fort is its inventor and the results it has yield ed to him are most beautiful and satisfactory perhaps it is more suited to the french language than to english but i found it the only medium in which these particular poems could be written it is ﬂuid and changing form now prose now verse and permitting great variety of treatment but the reader will see that i have not entirely abandoned the more classic english metres i can not see why because certain manners suit certain emotions and subjects it should be considered imperative an author to employ others schools are those who can conﬁne themselves within them perhaps it is weakness in that i can not in conclusion i would say that these remarks are in answer to many questions asked by people who have happened to read some of these poems in periodicals they are not the purpose of forestalling criticism nor of courting it and they deal i said in the beginn ing solely with the question of technique the more important part of the book the poems must

flashed nuzzling crumbs under which ladies threw the last of fads eggshell trays where gay beaux knelt hand on heart and daintily spelt their love in flowers brittle and bright artificial and fragile

and edges and underneath shot the gleam of saw with bristling teeth my head grew dizzy i seemed to hear from somewhere near the clash of arms and the squeal of balls and the echoless thud when dead man falls smoky cloud had veiled the room shot through with lurid glares the gloom pounded with shouts and dying groans with the drip of blood on cold hard stones sabres and lances in streaks of light

breath and quench in wreath of engulfing death this fight god or this devil game tale of starvation there once was man whom the gods did love and disagreeable man was he he loathed his neighbours and his neighbours hated him and he cursed eternally he damned the sun and he damned the stars and he blasted the winds in the sky he sent to hell every green growing thing and he raved at the birds they fly his oaths were many and his range was wide he swore in fancy ways but his meaning was plain that created thing was other than hurt to his gaze he dwelt all alone underneath leaning hill and windows toward the hill there were none and on the other side they were thick to keep out every spark of the sun when he went to market he walked all the way blaspheming at the path he trod he cursed at those he bought of and swore at those he sold to by all the names he knew of god his heart was soured in his weary old hide and his hopes had curdled in his breast his friend had been untrue and his love had thrown him over the chinking she liked best the rats had devoured the contents of his the deer had trampled on his corn his brook had shrivelled in summer drought and his sheep had died unshorn his hens would lay and his cow broke loose and his old horse perished of colic in the loft his were nibbled into holes by little glutton mice on frolic so he slowly lost all he ever had and the blood in his body dried shrunken and mean he still lived on and cursed that future which had lied one day he was digging spade or two his aching back could lift when he saw something glisten at the bottom of the trench and to get it out he made great shift so he dug and he delved with care and pain and the veins in his forehead stood taut at the end of an hour when every bone cracked he gathered up what he had sought dim old vase of crusted glass prismed while it lay buried deep shifting reds and greens like pigeon neck at the touch of the sun began to sword blades and poppy seed by

to bear it up and belly the gurgling wine its neck was slender and its mouth was wide and its lip was curled and fine the old man saw it in the sun bright stare and the colours started up through the crust and he who had cursed at the yellow sun held the flask to it and wiped away the dust and he bore the flask to the brightest spot where the shadow of the hill fell clear and he turned the flask and he looked at the flask and the sun shone without his sneer then he carried it home and put it on shelf but it was only grey in the gloom so he fetched pail and bit of cloth and he went outside with broom and he washed his windows just to let the sun lie upon his vase and when evening came he moved it down and put it on table near the place where candle fluttered in draught from the door the old man forgot to swear watching its shadow grown mammoth size dancing in the kitchen there he forgot to revile the sun next morning when he found his vase afire in its light and he carried it out of the house that day and kept it close beside him until night and so it happened from day to day the old man fed his life on the beauty of his vase on its perfect shape and his soul forgot its former strife and the came and begged to see the flagon which was dug from the ground and the old man never thought of an oath in his joy at showing what he had found one day the master of the village school passed him he stooped at toil hoeing and at his side was the vase on the soil my friend said the schoolmaster pompous and kind that valuable thing you have there but it might get broken out of doors it should meet with the utmost care what are you doing with it out here why sir said the poor old man i like to have it about you see to be with it all i can you will smash it said the schoolmaster

and its subtle swift hues which his own hard work had sword blades and poppy seed by amy lowell https he would carry it round with him everywhere it gave him joy to fragile vase should not stand in who would dare to say so who then his heart was rested and his fears gave way and he bent to his hoe again clod rolled down and his foot slipped back and he lurched with cry of pain the blade of the hoe crashed into glass and the vase fell to iridescent sherds the old man body heaved with slow dry sobs he did not curse he had words he gathered the fragments one by one and his fingers were cut and torn then he made hole in the very place whence the beautiful vase had been borne he covered the hole and he patted it down then he hobbled to his house and shut the door he tore up his coat and nailed it at the windows that beam of light should cross the floor he sat down in front of the empty hearth and he neither ate nor drank in three days they found him dead and cold and they said what

brown line the nuns were walking to breathe the fine bright april air they must go in soon and work at their tasks all the afternoon but this time is theirs they walk in pairs first comes the abbess preoccupied and slow woman often tried with her temper in bond then the oldest nun then younger and younger until the last one has laugh on her sword blades and poppy seed by amy lowell https and fairly skips they wind about the gravel walks and all the long line buzzes and talks they step in time to the ringing bell with scarcely shadow the sun is well in the core of sky domed silverly sister marguerite said the pears will soon bud sister angelique said she must get her spud and free the earth round the jasmine roots sister veronique said oh look at those shoots there crocus up with purple cup but sister clotilde said nothing at all she looked up and down the old grey wall to see if lizard were basking there she looked across the garden to where sycamore flanked the garden door she was restless although her little feet danced and quite unsatisfied it chanced her morning work had hung in her mind and would not take form she could not find the beautifulness the virgin dress should it be of pink or damasked blue or perhaps lilac with gold shotted through should it be banded with yellow and white roses or sparked like frosty night or crimson sheen over some sort of green but clotilde eyes saw nothing new in all the garden single hue so lovely or so marvellous that its use would not seem impious so on she walked and the others talked sister elisabeth edged away from what her companion had to say sister marthe saw the world in little she weighed every grain and recorded each tittle she did plain stitching and worked in the kitchen sister radegonde knows the apples wo last i told her so this friday past i must speak to her before compline her words were like dust motes in slanting sunshine the other nun sighed with her pleasure quite dried suddenly sister berthe cried out the snowdrops are blooming they turned about the little white cups bent over the ground and in among the light stems wound crested snake with his eyes awake his body was green with metal brightness like an emerald set in kind of whiteness and all down his curling length were disks evil vermilion asterisks they paled and flooded wounds his crest was amber glittered with blue and opaque so the sun came shining sword blades and poppy seed by amy lowell https it seemed crown with fiery points when he quivered all down his scaly joints from every slot the sparkles shot the nuns huddled tightly together fear catching their senses but clotilde must peer more closely at the beautiful snake she seemed entranced and eased could she make colours so rare the dress were there the abbess shook off her lethargy sisters we will walk on said she sidling away from the snowdrop bed the line curved forwards the abbess ahead only clotilde was the last to yield when the recreation hour was done each went in to her task alone in the library with its great north light clotilde wrought at an exquisite wreath of flowers her book of hours she twined the little crocus blooms with snowdrops and daffodils the glooms of laurel leaves were interwoven with and cloven fritillaries whose colour varies they framed the picture she had made and in courtyard with lozenged floor the virgin watched and through the arched door the angel came like springing flame his wings were dipped in violet fire his limbs were strung to holy desire he lowered his head and passed under the arch and the air seemed beating solemn march the virgin waited with eyes dilated her face was quiet and innocent and beautiful with her strange assent silver thread about her head her halo was poised but in the stead of her gown there remained the vellum unstained clotilde painted the flowers patiently lingering over each tint and dye she could spend great pains now she had seen that curious unimagined green colour so strange it had seemed to change she thought it had altered while she gazed at first it had been simple green then glazed all over with twisting flames each spot molten colour trembling and hot and every eye seemed to liquefy she had made plan and her spirits danced after all she had only glanced at that wonderful snake and she must know just what hues made the creature throw those splashes and sprays of prismed sword blades and poppy seed by amy lowell https when evening prayers were sung and said the nuns lit their tapers and went to bed and soon in the convent there was light the moon did not rise until late that night only the shine of the lamp at the shrine clotilde lay still in her trembling sheets her heart shook her body with its beats she could not see till the moon should rise so she whispered prayers and kept her eyes on the till light should be there the faintest shadow of branch fell on the floor clotilde grown staunch with solemn purpose softly rose and fluttered down between the rows of sleeping nuns she almost runs she must go out through the little side door lest the nuns who were always praying before the virgin altar should hear her pass she pushed the bolts and over the grass the red moon brim mounted its rim her shadow crept up the convent wall she swiftly left it over all the garden lay the level glow of moon coming up very big and slow the gravel glistened she stopped and listened it was still and the moonlight was getting clearer she laughed little but she felt queerer than ever before the snowdrop bed was reached and she bent down her head on the striped ground the snake was wound moment clotilde paused in alarm then she rolled up her sleeve and stretched out her arm she thought she heard steps she must be quick she darted her hand out and seized the thick wriggling slime only just in time the old gardener came muttering down the path and his shadow fell like broad black swath and covered clotilde and the angry snake he bit her but what difference did that make the virgin should dress in his loveliness the gardener was covering his plants the night was chilly and nothing daunts your lover of growing things he spied something to and turned aside and the moonlight streamed on clotilde and gleamed his business finished the gardener rose he shook and swore the moonlight shows girl with serpent she grasping him laughing while quietly her eyes are weeping is he sleeping he thinks it is some holy vision brushes that aside and with decision hits the snake with his sword blades and poppy seed by amy lowell https crushes his spine and then with quick urgent command takes her hand the gardener sucks the poison and spits cursing and praying befits poor old man half out of his wits whatever possessed you sister it hatched of devil and very evil it one of them horrid basilisks you read about they say man risks his life to touch it but i guess i sucked it out by now lucky i chucked it away from you i guess you oh francois this beautiful beast was sent to to the least worthy in all our convent so i could finish my picture of the most high and holy queen in her dress of green he is dead now but his colours wo fade at once and by noon i shall have made the virgin robe oh francois see how kindly the moon shines down on i ca die yet the task was set you wo die now i sucked it away grumbled old francois so have your play if the virgin is set on snake colours so strong francois say things like that it is wrong so clotilde vented her creed he repented he ca more harm sister said he paint much you like and gingerly he picked up the snake with his stick clotilde thanked him and begged that he would shield her secret though itching to talk in the kitchen the gardener promised not very pleased and clotilde with the strain of adventure eased walked quickly home while the moon made her beautiful sparkle and soon in her bed she lay and waited day at dawn first warning clotilde was up and all that morning except when she went to the chapel to pray she painted and when the april day was hot with sun clotilde had done done she drooped though her heart beat loud at the beauty before her and her spirit bowed to the virgin her thought had made lady in excellence arrayed and christ blessed mould from long fasting clotilde felt weary and faint but her eyes were starred like those of saint enmeshed in heaven beatitude sudden clamour hurled its rude force to break her vision sword blades and poppy seed by amy lowell https the door nearly leapt from its hinges pushed by the multitude of nuns they hushed when they saw clotilde in perfect quiet smiling little perplexed at the riot and all the hive buzzed she alive old francois had told he had found the strain of silence too great and preferred the pain of conscience outraged the news had spread and all were convinced clotilde must be dead francois to spite them had not seen fit to right them the abbess unwontedly trembling and mild put her arms round clotilde and wept my child has the holy mother showed you this grace to spare you while you imaged her face how could we have guessed our convent so blessed miracle but oh my lamb to have you die and i who am hollow living shell the grave is empty of holy mary i crave to be taken dear mother instead of this other she dropped on her knees and silently prayed with anguished hands and tears delayed to painful slowness the minutes drew to fractions then the west wind blew the sound of bell on gusty swell it came skipping over the slates of the roof and the bright seemed reproof to grief in the eye of so fair day the abbess comforted ceased to pray and the sun lit the flowers in clotilde book of hours it glistened the green of the virgin dress and made the red spots in flushed excess pulse and start and the violet wings of the angel were colour which shines and sings the book seemed choir of rainbow fire the abbess crossed herself and each nun did the same then one by one they filed to the chapel that incensed prayers might plead the life of this sister of theirs clotilde the inspired she only felt tired the old chronicles say she did not die until heavy with years and that is why there hangs in the convent church basket of osiered silver holy casket and treasured therein dried the exeter sword blades and poppy seed by amy lowell https panels of claret and blue

vexed of all his customers the old prelate was the most important his state descended to his watches and rings and he gave his mistresses many things to make them forget his age and smile when he paid visits and they could while the time away with diamond locket exceedingly well so they picked his pocket and he paid in jewels his slobbering kisses this watch was made to buy him blisses from an austrian countess on her way home and she meant to start next day paul worked by the pointed of tallow candle and became so absorbed that his old clock made him wince striking the hour moment since its echo only half apprehended lingered about the room he ended screwing the little rubies in setting the wheels to lock and spin curling the infinitesimal springs fixing the filigree hands chippings of precious stones lay strewn about the table before him was rout of splashes and sparks of coloured light there was yellow gold in sheets and quite heap of emeralds and steel here was gem there was wheel and glasses lay like limpid lakes shining and still and there were flakes of silver and shavings of pearl and little wires all awhirl with the light of the candle he took the watch and wound its hands about to match the time then glanced up to take the hour from the hanging clock good merciful power how came that shadow on the wall woman was in the room his tall chiffonier stood gaunt behind his chair his old cloak hung from peg the door was closed just moment he must have dozed he looked again and saw it plain the silhouette made stain on the opposite wall and it never wavered even when the candle quavered under his panting breath what made that beautiful dreadful thing that shade of something so lovely so exquisite cast from substance which the sight had not been tutored to perceive paul brushed his eyes across his sleeve the shadow on the wall gleamed black and never moved at all paul watches were like amulets wrought into patterns and rosettes the cases were all set with stones and wreathing lines and shining zones he knew the beauty in curve and the shadow tortured every nerve with its perfect rhythm of outline cutting the whitewashed wall so fine was the neck he knew he could have sword blades and poppy seed by amy lowell https it about with the fingers of one hand the chin rose to mouth he guessed but could not see the lips were pressed loosely together the edges close and the proud and delicate line of the nose melted into brow and there broke into undulant waves of hair the lady was edged with the stamp of race singular vision in such place he moved the candle to the tall chiffonier the shadow stayed on the wall he threw his cloak upon chair and still the lady face was there from every corner of the room he saw in the patch of light the gloom that was the lady her violet bloom was almost brighter than that which came from his candle he set the filigree hands he laid the watch in the case which he had made he put on his rabbit cloak and snuffed his candle out the room seemed stuffed with darkness softly he crossed the floor and let himself out through the door the sun was flashing from every pin and wheel when paul let himself in the whitewashed walls were hot with light the room was the core of chrysolite burning and shimmering with fiery might the sun was so bright that shadow could fall from the furniture upon the wall paul sighed he looked at the empty space where glare usurped the lady place he settled himself to his work but his mind wandered and he would wake to find his hand suspended his eyes grown dim and nothing advanced beyond the rim of his dreaming the cardinal sent to pay his watch which had purchased so fine day but paul could hardly touch the gold it seemed the price of his shadow sold with the first twilight he struck match and watched the little blue stars hatch into an egg of perfect flame he lit his candle and almost in shame at his eagerness lifted his eyes the shadow was there and its precise outline etched the cold white wall the young man swore by god you paul there something the matter with your brain go home now and sleep off the strain the next day was storm the rain whispered and scratched at the grey and shadowless morning filled the little shop the watches chilled were dead and sparkless coals the gems lay on the table like shoals of stranded shells their colours faded mere heaps of stone dull and degraded paul head was heavy his hands obeyed orders his fancy strayed his work became simple round of watches repaired and watches wound the slanting ribbons of the rain broke themselves on the but paul saw the silver lines in vain only when the candle was lit and on the wall just opposite he watched again the coming of it could he trace line the joy of his soul and over his hands regain sword blades and poppy seed by amy lowell https paul lingered late in his shop that night and the designs which his delight sketched on paper seemed to be tribute offered wistfully to the beautiful shadow of her who came and hovered over his candle flame in the morning he selected all his perfect jacinths one large opal hung like milky rainbow moon in the centre and blown in loose festoon the red stones quivered on silver threads to the outer edge where single fine band of the line completed on the other side the creamy porcelain of the face bore diamond hours and lace of cotton or silk could ever be tossed into being more airily than the filmy golden hands the time seemed to tick away in rhyme when at dusk the shadow grew upon the wall paul work was through holding the watch he spoke to her lady beautiful shadow stir into one brief sign of being turn your eyes this way and seeing this watch made from those sweet curves where your hair from your forehead swerves accept the gift which i have wrought with your fairness in my thought grant this and i shall be honoured overwhelmingly the shadow rested black and still and the wind sighed over the paul put the despised watch away and laid out before him his array of stones and metals and when the morning struck the stones to their best adorning he chose the brightest and this new watch was so light and thin it seemed to catch the sunlight nothingness and its gleam topazes ran in foamy stream over the cover the hands were studded with garnets and seemed red roses budded the face was of crystal and engraved upon it the figures flashed and waved with zircons and beryls and amethysts it took week to make and his trysts at night with the shadow were his alone paul swore not to speak till his task was done the night that the jewel was worthy to give paul watched the long hours of daylight live to the faintest streak then lit his light and sharp against the wall pure white the outline of the shadow started into form his words so long imprisoned swelled to tumbling speech like one compelled he told the lady all his love and holding out the watch above his head he knelt imploring some littlest sign the shadow was dumb weeks passed paul worked in fevered haste and everything he made he placed before his lady the shadow kept its perfect passiveness paul wept he wooed her with the work of his hands he waited those dear commands she never gave word motion eased the ache of his devotion his days passed in strain of sword blades and poppy seed by amy lowell https his nights burnt up in seething coil seasons shot by uncognisant he worked the shadow came to haunt even his days sometimes quite plain he saw on the wall the blackberry stain of his lady picture sun was bright enough to dazzle that from his sight there were moments when he groaned to see his life spilled out so uselessly begging boons the shade refused his finest workmanship abused the iridescent bubbles he blew into lovely existence poor and few in the shadowed eyes then he would curse himself and her the universe and more the beauty he could not make and give her her comfort sake he would beat his weary empty hands upon the table would hold up strands of silver and gold and ask her why she scorned the best which he could buy he would pray to some saint that she would cure him of the taint of failure he would clutch the wall with his bleeding fingers if she should fall he could catch and hold her and make her live with sobs he would ask her to forgive all he had done and broken spent he would call himself impertinent presumptuous tradesman nothing driven to madness by the sight of heaven at other times he would take the things he had made and winding them on strings hang garlands before her and burn perfumes chanting strangely while the fumes wreathed and blotted the shadow face with cloudy nacreous lace there were days when he wooed lover sighed in tenderness spoke to his bride urged her to patience said his skill should break the spell man sworn will could compass life even that he knew by christ blood he would prove it true the edge of the shadow never blurred the lips of the shadow never stirred he would climb on chairs to reach her lips and pat her hair with his but instead of young warm flesh returning his warmth the wall was cold and burning like stinging ice and his passion chilled lay in his heart like some dead thing killed at the moment of birth then deadly sick he would lie in swoon hours while thick phantasmagoria crowded his brain and his body shrieked in the clutch of pain the crisis passed he would wake and smile with vacant joy and quite confused not being certain why he was suffering curtain fallen over the tortured mind beguiled his sorrow like little child he would play with his watches and gems with glee calling the shadow to look and see how the spots on the ceiling danced prettily when he flashed his stones mother the green has slid so cunningly in between the blue and the yellow oh please look down then with pitiful puzzled frown he would get up slowly from his play and walk round the room feeling his way from table to chair from chair to door stepping over the cracks in the sword blades and poppy seed by amy lowell https till reaching the table again her face would bring recollection and solace could balm his hurt till unconsciousness stifled him and his great distress one morning he threw the street door wide on coming in and his vigorous stride made the tools on his table rattle and jump in his hands he carried clump of laurel blossoms whose stalks were pliant with sap husband talks to the wife he left an hour ago paul spoke to the shadow dear you know the calendar calls it spring and i woke this morning gathering asphodels in my dreams you so i rushed out to see what flowers blew their souls across the dusty scrolls and made the approach to the market square garden with smells and sunny air i feel so well and happy i think i shall take holiday and we will have little treat i am going to bring you something to eat he looked at the shadow anxiously it was quite grave and silent he shut the outer door and came and leant against the dearest he said we live apart although i bear you in my heart we look out each from different world at any moment we may be hurled asunder they follow their orbits we obey their laws entirely now you must come or i go there unless we are willing to live the flare of lighted instant and have it gone bee in the laurels began to drone loosened

give you myself in whatever star may happen you beloved of is it not ordered cleverly the shadow bloomed like plum and clear hung in the sunlight it did not hear paul slipped away the dusk began to dim the little shop he ran to the nearest inn and chose with care much his thin purse could bear monks watch over the baking of the sacred wafer and through the making of the holy wine whisper secret prayers that god will bless this labour of theirs so paul in sober ecstasy purchased the best which he could buy returning he brushed his tools aside and laid across the table wide napkin he put glass and plate on either side in duplicate over the lady excellent with loveliness the laurels bent in the centre the pastry stood and beside it the wine flask red blood was the wine which should bring the lustihood of human life to his lady veins when all was ready all which sword blades and poppy seed by amy lowell https to simple meal was there with eyes lit by the joy of his great emprise he reverently bade her come and forsake him her distant home he put meat on her plate and filled her glass and waited what should come to pass the shadow lay quietly on the wall from the street outside came watchman call cloudy night rain beginning to fall and still he waited the clock slow tick knocked on the silence paul turned sick he filled his own glass full of wine from his pocket he took paper the twine was knotted and he searched knife from his jumbled tools the cord of life snapped he cut the little string he knew that he must the thing he feared he shook powder into the wine and holding it up so the candle shine sparked ruby through its heart he drank it dear never apart again you have said it was mine to it is done and i am come to you paul jannes let the empty fall and held out his arms the insentient wall stared down at him with its cold white glare unstained the shadow was not there paul clutched and tore at his tightening throat he felt the veins in his body bloat and the hot blood run like fire and stones along the sides of his cracking bones but he laughed he staggered towards the door and he laughed aloud he sank on the floor the coroner took the body away and the watches were sold that saturday the auctioneer said one could seldom buy such watches and the prices were high the forsaken holy mother of god merciful mary hear i am very weary i have come from
