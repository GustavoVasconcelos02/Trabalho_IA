reproduce approximately in modern measures the venerable epic beowulf appr oximately i repeat very close reproduction of verse would to large extent be prose to modern ear the text and glossary have been closely followed occasionally deviation has been made but always what seemed good and sufﬁcient reason the translat or does not aim to be an editor once in while however he has added conjecture of his own to the emendations quoted from the criticisms of other students of the poem this work is addressed to two classes of readers from both of these alike the translator begs sympathy and the saxon scholar he hopes to please by adhering faithfully to the original the student of english literature he aims to interest by giving him in modern garb the most ancient epic of our race this is bold and venturesome undertaking and yet there must be some students of the teutonic past willing to follow even daring guide if they may read in modern phrases of the sorrows of hrothgar of the prowess of beowulf and of the feelings that stirred the hearts of our forefathers in their primeval homes in order to please the larger class of readers regular cadence has been used measure which while retaining the essential characteristics of the original permits the reader to see ahead of him in reading perhaps every scholar has his own theory to how beowulf should be translated some have given us prose versions of what we believe to be great poem is it any reﬂection on our honored kemble and arnold to say that their translations fail to show layman that beowulf is justly called our ﬁrst epic of those translators who have used verse several have written from what would seem mistaken point of view is it proper instance that the grave and solemn speeches of beowulf and hrothgar be put in ballad measures tripping lightly and airily along or again is it ﬁtting that the rough martial music of verse be interpreted to us in the smooth measures of modern blank verse we hear what has been beautifully called the clanging tread of warrior in mail of all english translations of beowulf that of professor garnett alone gives any adequate idea of the chief characteristics of this great teutonic epic the measure used in the present translation is believed to be near reproduction of the original modern english affords the cadences closely resemble those used by browning in some of his most striking poems the four stresses of the verse are retained and much thesis and anacrusis is allowed is consistent with regular cadence alliteration has been used to large extent but it was thought that modern ears would hardly tolerate it on every line has been used occasionally internal rhyme sporadically both have some warrant in poetry see 1 53 1 54 internal rhyme 2 21 6 40 vii viii
