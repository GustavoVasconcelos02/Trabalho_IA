aristotle https i propose to treat of poetry in itself and of its various kinds noting the essential quality of each to inquire into the structure of the plot requisite to good poem into the numb er and nature of the parts of which poem is composed and similarly into whatever else falls within the same inquiry following then the order of nature let us begin with the principles which come ﬁrst epic poetry and tragedy comedy also and dithyrambic poetry and the music of the ﬂute and of the lyre in most of their forms are all in their general conception modes of imitation they differ however from one another in three respects medium the objects the manner or mode of imitation being in each case distinct there are persons who by conscious art or mere habit imitate and represent various objects through the medium of colour and form or again by the voice so in the arts above mentioned taken whole the imitation is produced by rhythm language or either singly or combined thus in the music of the ﬂute and of the lyre and rhythm alone are employed also in other arts such that of the shepherd pipe which are essentially similar to these in dancing rhythm alone is used without even dancing imitates character emotion and action by rhythmical movement there is another art which imitates by means of language alone and that either in prose or which verse again may either combine different metres or consist of but one this has hitherto been without name there is common term we could apply to the mimes of sophron and xenarchus and the socratic dialogues on the one hand and on the other to poetic imitations in iambic elegiac or any similar metre people indeed add the word or to the name of the metre and speak of elegiac poets or epic that is hexameter poets if it were not the imitation that makes the poet but the verse that entitles them all indiscriminately to the name even when treatise on medicine or natural science is brought out in verse the name of poet is by custom given to the author and yet homer and empedocles have nothing in common but the metre so that it would be right to call the one poet the other physicist rather than poet on the same principle even if writer in his poetic imitation were to combine all metres chaeremo n did in his centaur which is medley composed of metres of all kinds we should bring him too under the general term poet so much then these distinctions there are again some arts which employ all the means above mentioned namely rhythm tune and metre such are dithyrambic and nomic poetry and also tragedy and comedy but between them the difference is that in the ﬁrst two cases these means are all employed in combination in the latter now one means is employed now another such then are the dif ferences of the arts with respect to the medium of imitation ii since the objects of imitation are men in action and these men must be eithe r of higher or lower type moral character mainly answers to these divisions goodness and badness being the distinguishing marks of moral differences it follows that we must represent men either better than in real life or worse or they are it is the same in painting polygnotus depicted men nobler than they are pauson less noble dionysius drew them true to life now it is evident that each of the modes of imitation above mentioned will exhibit these differences and become distinct kind in imitating objects that are thus distinct such diversities may be found even in dancing and so again in language whether prose or verse unaccompanied by music homer example makes men better than they are cleophon they are hegemon the thasian the inventor of parodies and nicochare s the author of the deiliad worse than they are the same thing holds good of dithyrambs and nomes here too one may portray different types timotheus and philoxenus differed in representing their the poetics of aristotle by aristotle https same distinction marks off traged y from comedy comedy aims at representing men worse tragedy better than in actual life iii there is still third manner in which each of these objects may be imitated the medium being the same and the objects the same the poet may imitate by which case he can either take another personality homer does or speak in his own person or he may present all his characters living and moving before us these then we said at the beginn ing are the three differences which distinguish artistic imitation medium the objects and the manner so that from one point of view sophocles is an imitator of the same kind both imitate higher types of character from another point of view of the same kind both imitate persons acting and doing hence some say the name of is given to such poems representing action the same reason the dorians claim the invention both of tragedy and comedy the claim to comedy is put forward by the megarians only by those of greece proper who allege that it originated under their democracy but also by the megarians of sicily the poet epicharmus who is much earlier than chionides and magnes belonged to that country tragedy too is claimed by certain dorians of the peloponnese in each case they appeal to the evidence of language the outlying villages they say are by them called kappa omega mu alpha iota by the athenians delta eta mu iota and they assume that comedians were so named not from kappa omega mu zeta epsilon iota nu revel but because they wandered from village to village kappa alpha tau alpha kappa omega mu alpha sigma being excluded contemptuously from the city they add also that the dorian word is delta rho alpha nu and the athenian pi rho alpha tau tau epsilon iota nu this may sufﬁce to the number and nature of the various modes of imitation iv poetry in general seems to have sprung from two causes each of them lying deep in our nature first the instinct of imitation is implanted in man from childhood one difference between him and other animals being that he is the most imitative of living creatures and through imitation learns his earliest lessons and less universal is the pleasure felt in things imitated we have evidence of this in the facts of experience objects which in themselves we view with pain we delight to contemplate when reproduced with minute ﬁdelity such the forms of the most ignoble animals and of dead bodies the cause of this again is that to learn gives the liveliest pleasure not only to philosophers but to men in general whose capacity however of learning is more limited thus the reason why men enjoy seeing likeness is that in contemplating it they ﬁnd themselves learning or inferring and saying perhaps that is he if you happen not to have seen the original the pleasure will be due not to the imitation such but to the execution the colouring or some such other cause imitation then is one instinct of our nature next there is the instinct and rhythm metres being manifestly sections of rhythm persons therefore starting with this natural gift developed by degrees their special aptitudes till their rude improvisations gave birth to poetry poetry now diver ged in two directions according to the individual character of the writers the graver spirits imitated noble actions and the actions of good men the more trivial sort imitated the actions of meaner persons at ﬁrst composing satires the former did hymns to the gods and the praises of famous men poem of the satirical kind can not indeed be put down to any author earlier than homer though many such writers probably there were but from homer onward instances the poetics of aristotle by aristotle https cited own margites example and other similar compositions the appropriate metre was also here introduced hence the measure is still called the iambic or lampooning measure being that in which people lampooned one another thus the older poets were distinguished writers of heroic or of lampooning verse in the serious style homer is among poets he alone combi ned dramatic form with excellence of imitation so he too ﬁrst laid down the main lines of comedy by dramatising the ludicrous instead of writing personal satire his margites bears the same relation to comedy that the iliad and odyssey to tragedy but when tragedy and comedy came to light the two classes of poets still followed their natural bent the lampooners became writers of comedy and the epic poets were succeeded by tragedians since the drama was lar ger and higher form of art whether tragedy has yet perfected its proper types or not and whether it is to be judged in itself or in relation also to the audience raises another question be that it may also at ﬁrst mere improvisation the one originated with the authors of the dithyramb the other with those of the phallic songs which are still in use in many of our cities tragedy advanced by slow degrees each new element that showed itself was in turn developed having passed through many changes it found its natural form and there it stopped aeschylus ﬁrst introduced second actor he diminished the importance of the chorus and assigned the leading part to the dialogue sophocles raised the number of actors to three and added moreover it was not till late that the short plot was discarded one of greater compass and the grotesque diction of the earlier satyric form the stately manner of tragedy the iambic measure then replaced the trochaic tetrameter which was originally employed when the poetry was of the satyric order and had greater afﬁnities with dancing once dialogue had come in nature herself discovered the appropriate measure the iambic is of all measures the most colloquial we see it in the fact that conversational speech runs into iambic lines more frequently than into any other kind of verse rarely into hexameters and only when we drop the colloquial intonation the additions to the numbe r of or acts and the other accessories of which tradition tells must be taken already described to discuss them in detail would doubtless be large undertaking v comedy is we have said an imitatio n of characters of lower type not however in the full sense of the word bad the ludicrous being merely subdivision of the ugly it consists in some defect or ugliness which is not painful or destructive to take an obvious example the comic mask is ugly and distorted but does not imply pain the successive changes through which tragedy passed and the authors of these changes are well known whereas comedy has had history because it was not at ﬁrst treated seriously it was late before the archon granted comic chorus to poet the performers were till then voluntary comedy had already taken deﬁnite shape when comic poets distinctively so called are heard of who furnished it with masks or prologues or increased the number of actors and other similar details remain unknown the plot it came originally from sicily but of athenian writers crates was the ﬁrst who abandoning the or lampooning form generalised his themes and plots epic poetry agrees with tragedy in so far it is an imitation in verse of characters of higher type they differ in that epic poetry admits but one kind of metre and is narrative in form they differ again in their length tragedy endeavours far possible to conﬁne itself to single revolution of the sun or but slightly to exceed this limit whereas the epic action has limits of time this then is second point of difference though at ﬁrst the same freed om was admitted in tragedy in epic poetry of their constituent parts some are common to both some peculiar to tragedy whoever therefore knows what is good or bad tragedy knows also about epic poetry all the eleme nts of an epic poem are found in tragedy but the elements of tragedy are not all found in the epic the poetics of aristotle by aristotle https of the poetry which imitates in hexameter verse and of comedy we will speak hereafter let us now discuss tragedy resuming its formal deﬁnition resulting from what has been already said tragedy then is an imitation of an action that is serious complete and of certain magnitude in language embellished with each kind of artistic ornament the several kinds being found in separate parts of the play in the form of action not of narrative through pity and fear effecting the proper purgation of these emotions by uage embellished i mean language into which rhythm and song enter by several kinds in separate parts i mean that some parts are rendered through the medium of verse alone others again with the aid of song now tragic imitation implies persons acting it necessarily follows in the ﬁrst place that spectacular equipment will be part of tragedy next song and diction these are the medium of imitation by i mean the mere metrical arrangement of the words it is term whose sense every one understands again tragedy is the imitation of an action and an action implies personal agents who necessarily possess certain distinctive qualities both of character and thought it is by these that we qualify actions themselves and and the two natural causes from which actions spring and on actions again all success or failure depends hence the plot is the imitation of the action by plot i here mean the arrangement of the incid ents by character i mean that in virtue of which we ascribe certain qualities to the agents thought is required wherever statement is proved or it may be general truth enunciated every tragedy therefore must have six parts which parts determine its plot character diction thought spectacle song two of the parts constitute the medium of imitation one the manner and three the objects of imitation and these complete the list these elements have been employed we may say by the poets to man in fact every play contains spectacular elements well character plot diction song and thought but most important of all is the structure of the incidents tragedy is an imitation not of men but of an action and of life and life consists in action and its end is mode of action not quality now character determines men qualities but it is by their actions that they are happy or the reverse dramatic action therefore is not with view to the representation of character character comes in subsidiary to the actions hence the incidents and the plot are the end of tragedy and the end is the chief thing of all again without action there can not be tragedy there may be without character the tragedies of most of our modern poets fail in the rendering of character and of poets in general this is often true it is the same in painting and here lies the difference between zeuxis and polygnotus polygnotus delineates character well the style of zeuxis is devo id of ethical quality again if you string together set of speeches expressive of character and well ﬁnished in point of diction and thought you will not produce the essential tragic effect nearly so well with play which however deﬁcient in these respects yet has plot and artistically constructed incidents besides which the most powerful elements of emotional interest in tragedy peripeteia or reversal of the situation and recognition parts of the plot further proof is that novices in the art attain to ﬁnish of diction and precis ion of portraiture before they can construct the plot it is the same with almost all the early poets the plot then is the ﬁrst principle and it were the soul of tragedy character holds the second place similar fact is seen in painting the most beautiful colours laid on confusedly will not give much pleasure the chalk outline of portrait thus tragedy is the imitation of an action and of the agents mainly with view to the action third in order is thought is the faculty of saying what is possible and pertinent in given circumstances in the case of oratory this is the function of the political art and of the art of rhetoric and so indeed the older poets make their characters speak the language of civic life the poets of our time the language of the rhetoricians character is that which reveals moral purpose showing what kind of things man chooses or avoids speeches therefore which not make this manifest or the poetics of aristotle by aristotle https the speaker does not choose or avoid anything whatever are not expressive of character thought on the other hand is found where something is proved to be or not to be or general maxim is enunciated fourth among the elements enumerated comes diction by which i mean has been already said the expression of the meaning in words and its essence is the same both in verse and prose of the remaining elements song holds the chief place among the embellishments the spectacle has indeed an emotional attraction of its own but of all the parts it is the least artistic and connected least with the art of poetry the power of tragedy we may be sure is felt even apart from representation and actors besides the production of spectac ular effects depends more on the art of the stage machinist than on that of the poet vii these principles being established let us now discuss the proper structure of the plot since this is the ﬁrst and most important thing in tragedy now according to our deﬁnition tragedy is an imitation of an action that is complete and whole and of certain magnitude there may be whole that is wanting in magnitude whole is that which has beginning middle and an end beginning is that which does not itself follow anything by causal necessity but after which something naturally is or comes to be an end on the contrary is that which itself naturally follows some other thing either by necessity or rule but has nothing following it middle is that which follows something some other thing follows it well constructed plot therefore must neither begin nor end at haphazard but conform to these principles again beautiful object whether it be living organism or any whole composed of parts must not only have an orderly arrangement of parts but must also be of certain magnitude beauty depends on magnitude and order hence very small animal organism can not be beautiful the view of it is confused the object being seen in an almost imperceptible moment of time nor again can one of vast size be beautiful the eye can not take it all in at once the unity and sense of the whole is lost the spectator instance if there were one thousand miles long therefore in the case of animate bodies and organisms certain magnitude is necessary and magnitude which may be easily embraced in one view so in the plot certain length is necessary and length which can be easily embraced by the memory the limit of length in relation to dramatic competition and sensuous presentment is part of artistic theory had it been the rule hundred tragedies to compete together the performance would have been regulated by the water indeed we are told was formerly done but the limit ﬁxed by the nature of the drama itself is this the greater the length the more beautiful will the piece be by reason of its size provided that the whole be perspicuous and to deﬁne the matter roughly we may say that the proper magnitude is comprised within such limits that the sequence of events according to the law of probability or necessity will admit of change from bad fortune to good or from good fortune to bad viii unity of plot does not some persons think consist in the unity of the hero inﬁnitely various are the incidents in one man life which can not be reduced to unity and so too there are many actions of one man out of which we can not make one action hence the error it appears of all poets who have composed heracleid theseid or other poems of the kind they imagine that heracles was one man the story of heracles must also be unity but homer in all else he is of surpassing merit here from art or natural to have happily the poetics of aristotle by aristotle https truth in composing the odyssey he did not include all the adventures of his wound on parnassus or his feigned madness at the mustering of the between which there was necessary or probable connection but he made the odyssey and likewise the iliad to centre round an action that in our sense of the word is one therefore in the other imitative arts the imitation is one when the object imitated is one so the plot being an imitation of an action must imitate one action and that whole the structural union of the parts being such that if any one of them is displaced or removed the whole will be disjointed and disturbed thing whose presence or absence makes visible dif ference is not an or ganic part of the whole ix it is moreover evident from what has been said that it is not the function of the poet to relate what has happened but what may happen is possible according to the law of probability or necessity the poet and the historian differ not by writing in verse or in prose the work of herodotus might be put into verse and it would still be species of history with metre less than without it the true difference is that one relates what has happened the other what may happen poetry therefore is more philosophical and higher thing than history poetry tends to express the universal history the particular by the universal i mean how person of certain type will on occasion speak or act according to the law of probability or necessity and it is this universality at which poetry aims in the names she attaches to the personages the particular what alcibiades did or suffered in comedy this is already apparent here the poet ﬁrst constructs the plot on the lines of probability and then inserts characteristic names the lampooners who write about particular individuals but tragedians still keep to real names the reason being that what is possible is credible what has not happened we not at once feel sure to be possible but what has happened is manifestly possible otherwise it would not have happened still there are even some tragedies in which there are only one or two well known names the rest being ﬁctitious in others none are well known in agath on antheus where incidents and names alike are ﬁctitious and yet they give none the less pleasur we must not therefore at all costs keep to the received legends which are the usual subjects of tragedy indeed it would be absurd to attempt it even subjects that are known are known only to few and yet give pleasure to all it clearly follows that the poet or should be the maker of plots rather than of verses since he is poet because he imitates and what he imitates are actions and even if he chances to take an historical subject he is none the less poet there is reason why some events that have actually happened should not conform to the law of the probable and possible and in virtue of that quality in them he is their poet or maker of all plots and actions the epeisodic are the worst i call plot in which the episodes or acts succeed one another without probable or necessary sequence bad poets compose such pieces by their own fault good poets to please the players they write show pieces competition they stretch the plot beyond its capacity and are often forced to break the natural continuity but again tragedy is an imitation not only of complete action but of event s inspiring fear or pity such an effect is best produced when the events come on us by surpri and the effect is heightened when at the same time they follow cause and effect the tragic wonder will thee be greater than if they happened of themselves or by accident even coincidences are most striking when they have an air of design we may instance the statue of mitys at argos which fell upon his murderer while he was spectator at festival and killed him such events seem not to be due to mere chance plots therefore constructed on these principles are necessarily the best the poetics of aristotle by aristotle https are either simple or complex the actions in real life of which the plots are an imitation obviously show similar distinction an action which is one and continuous in the sense above deﬁned i call simple when the change of fortune takes place without reversal of the situation and without recognition complex action is one in which the change is accompanied by such reversal or by recognition or by both these last should arise from the internal structure of the plot so that what follows should be the necessary or probable result of the preceding action it makes all the difference whether any given event is case of propter hoc or post hoc xi reversal of the situation is change by which the action veers round to its opposite subject always to our rule of probability or necessity thus in the oedipus the messenger comes to cheer oedipus and free him from his alarms about his mother but by revealing who he is he produces the opposite effect again in the lynceus lynceus is being led away to his death and danaus goes with him meaning to slay him but the outcome of the preceding incidents is that danaus is killed and lynceus saved recognition the name indicates is change from ignorance to knowledge producing love or hate between the persons destined by the poet good or bad fortune the best form of recognition is coincident with reversal of the situation in the oedipus there are indeed other forms even inanimate things of the most trivial kind may in sense be objects of recognition again we may recognise or discover whether person has done thing or not but the recognition which is most intimately connected with the plot and action is we have said the recognition of persons this recognition combined with reversal will produce either pity or fear and actions producing these effects are those which by our deﬁnition tragedy represents moreover it is upon such situations that the issues of good or bad fortune will depend recognition then being between persons it may happen that one person only is recognised by the other the latter is already it may be necessary that the recognition should be on both sides thus iphigenia is revealed to orestes by the sending of the letter but another act of recognition is required to make orestes known to iphigenia two parts then of the of the situation and upon surprises third part is the scene of suffering the scene of suffering is destructive or painful action such death on the stage bodily agony wounds and the like xii the parts of tragedy which must be treated elements of the whole have been already mentioned we now come to the quantitative parts and the separate parts into which tragedy is divided namely prologue episode exode choric song this last being divided into parode and stasimon these are common to all plays peculiar to some are the songs of actors from the stage and the commoi the prologue is that entire part of tragedy which precedes the parode of the chorus the episode is that entire part of tragedy which is between complete choric songs the exode is that entire part of tragedy which has choric song after it of the choric part the parode is the ﬁrst undivided utterance of the chorus the stasimon is choric ode without anapaests or trochaic tetrameters the commos is joint lamentation of chorus and actors the parts of tragedy which must be treated elements of the whole have been already mentioned the quantitative parts the separate parts into which it is here enumerated the poetics of aristotle by aristotle https the sequel to what has already been said we must proceed to consider what the poet should aim at and what he should avoid in constructing his plots and by what means the speciﬁc effect of tragedy will be produced perfect tragedy should we have seen be arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan it should moreover imitate actions which excite pity and fear this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation it follows plainly in the ﬁrst place that the change of fortune presented must not be the spectacle of virtuous man brought from prosperity to adversity this moves neither pity nor fear it merely shocks us nor again that of bad man passing from adversity to prosperity nothing can be more alien to the spirit of tragedy it possesses single tragic quality it neither satisﬁes the moral sense nor calls forth pity or fear nor again should the downfall of the utter villain be exhibited plot of this kind would doubtless satisfy the moral sense but it would inspire neither pity nor fear pity is aroused by unmerited misfortune fear by the misfortune of man like ourselves such an event therefore will be neither pitiful nor terrible there remains then the character between these two extremes of man who is not eminently good and just whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity but by some error or frailty he must be one who is highly renowned and prosperous personage like oedipus thyestes or other illustrious men of such families well constructed plot should therefore be single in its issue rather than double some maintain the change of fortune should be not from bad to good but reversely from good to bad it should come about the result not of vice but of some great error or frailty in character either such we have described or better rather than worse the practice of the stage bears out our view at ﬁrst the poets recounted any legend that came in their way now the best tragedies are founded on the story of few houses on the fortunes of alcmaeon oedipus orestes meleager thyestes telephus and those others who have done or suffered something terrible tragedy then to be perfect according to the rules of art should be of this construction hence they are in error who censure euripides just because he follow s this principle in his plays many of which end unhappily it is we have said the right ending the best proof is that on the stage and in dramatic competition such plays if well worked out are the most tragic in effect and euripides faulty though he may be in the general management of his subject yet is felt to be the most tragic of the poets in the second rank comes the kind of tragedy which some place ﬁrst like the odyssey it has double thread of plot and also an opposite catastrophe the good and the bad it is accounted the best because of the weakness of the spectators the poet is guided in what he writes by the wishes of his audience the pleasure however thence derived is not the true tragic pleasure it is proper rather to comedy where those who in the piece are the deadliest enemi orestes and the stage friends at the close and one slays or is slain xiv fear and pity may be aroused by spectacular means but they may also result from the inner structure of the piece which is the bette r way and indicates superior poet the plot ought to be so constructed that even without the aid of the eye he who hears the tale told will thrill with horror and melt to pity at what takes place this is the impression we should receive from hearing the story of the oedipus but to produce this effect by the mere spectacle is less artistic method and dependent on extraneous aids those who employ spectacular means to creat sense not of the poetics of aristotle by aristotle https but only of the monstrous are strangers to the purpose of tragedy we must not demand of tragedy any and every kind of pleasure but only that which is proper to it and since the pleasure which the poet should afford is that which comes from pity and fear through imitation it is evident that this quality must be impressed upon the incidents let us then determine what are the circumstances which strike us terrible or pitiful actions capable of this effect must happen between persons who are either friends or enemies or indifferent to one another if an enemy kills an enemy there is nothing to excite pity either in the act or the intention so far the suffering in itself is pitiful so again with indifferent persons but when the tragic incident occurs between those who are near or dear to one example brother kills or intends to kill brother son his father mother her son son his mother or any other deed of the kind is are the situations to be looked by the poet he may not indeed destroy the framework of the received fact instance that clytemnestra was slain by orestes and eriphyle by alcmaeon but he ought to show invention of his own and skilfully handle the tradition al material let us explain more clearly what is meant by skilful handling the action may be done consciously and with knowledge of the persons in the manner of the older poets it is thus too that euripides makes medea slay her children or again the deed of horror may be done but done in ignorance and the tie of kinship or friendship be discovered afterwards the oedipus of sophocles is an example here indeed the incident is outside the drama proper but cases occur where it falls within the action of the play one may cite the alcmae on of astydamas or telegonus in the wounded odysseus again there is third case to be about to act with knowledge of the persons and then not to act the fourth case is when some one is about to an irreparable deed through ignorance and makes the discovery before it is done these are the only possible ways the deed must either be done or not done that wittingly or unwittingly but of all these ways to be about to act knowing the persons and then not to act is the worst it is shocking without being tragic disaster follows it is therefore never or very rarely found in poetry one instance however is in the antigone where haemon threatens to kill creon the next and better way is that the deed should be perpetrated still better that it shou ld be perpetrated in ignorance and the discovery made afterwards there is then nothing to shock us while the discovery produces startling effect the last case is the best when in the cresphontes merope is about to slay her son but recognising who he is spares his life so in the iphigenia the sister recognises the brother just in time again in the helle the son recognises the mother when on the point of giving her up this then is why few families only has been already observed furnish the subjects of tragedy it was not art but happy chance that led the poets in search of subjects to impress the tragic quality upon their plots they are compelled therefore to have recourse to those houses whose history contains moving incidents like these enough has now been said concerning the structure of the incidents and the right kind of plot xv in respect of character there are four things to be aimed at first and most important it must be good now any speech or action that manifests moral purpose of any kind will be expressive of character the character will be good if the purpose is good this rule is relative to each class even woman may be good and also slave though the woman may be said to be an inferior being and the slave quite worthless the second thing to aim at is propriety there is type of manly valour but valour in woman or unscrupulous cleverness is inappropriate thirdly character must be true to life this is distinct thing from goodness and propriety here described the fourth point is consistency though the subject of the imitation who suggested the type be inconsistent still he must be consistently inconsistent an example of motiveless degradation of character we have menelaus in the orestes of character indecorous and inappropriate the lament of odysseus in the scylla and the speech of melanippe of inconsistency the iphigenia at aulis iphigenia the suppliant in way resembles her later the poetics of aristotle by aristotle https in the structure of the plot so too in the portraiture of character the poet should always aim either at the necessary or the probable thus person of given character should speak or act in given way by the rule either of necessity or of probability just this event should follow that by necessary or probable sequence it is therefore evident that the unravelling of the plot less than the complication must arise out of the plot itself it must not be brought about by the ex in the medea or in the return of the greeks in the iliad the ex machina should be employed only events external to the drama antecedent or subsequent events which lie beyond the range of human knowledge and which require to be reported or foretold to the gods we ascribe the power of seeing all things within the action there must be nothing irrational if the irrational can not be excluded it should be outside the scope of the tragedy such is the irrational element in the oedipus of sophocles again since tragedy is an imitation of persons who are above the common level the example of good should be followed they while reproducing the distinctive form of the original make likeness which is true to life and yet more beautiful so too the poet in representing men who are irascible or indolent or have other defects of character should preserve the type and yet ennoble it in this way achilles is portrayed by agathon and homer these then are rules the poet should observe nor should he neglect those appeals to the senses which though not among the essentials are the concomitants of poetry here too there is much room error but of this enough has been said in our published treatises xvi what recognition is has been already explained we will now enumerate its kinds first the least artistic form which from poverty of wit is most commonly employed recognition by signs of these some are congenital spear which the race bear on their bodies or the stars introduced by carcinus in his thyestes others are acquired after birth and of these some are bodily marks scars some external tokens necklaces or the little ark in the tyro by which the discovery is effected even these admit of more or less skilful treatment thus in the recognition of odysseus by his scar the discovery is made in one way by the nurse in another by the swineherds the use of tokens the express purpose of indeed any formal proof with or without less artistic mode of recognition better kind is that which comes about by turn of incident in the bath scene in the odyssey next come the recognitions invented at will by the poet and on that account wanting in art example orestes in the iphigenia reveals the fact that he is orestes she indeed makes herself known by the letter but he by speak ing himself and saying what the poet not what the plot requires this therefore is nearly allied to the fault above mentioned orestes might well have brought tokens with him another similar instance is the of the shuttle in the tereus of sophocles the third kind depends on memory when the sight of some object awakens feeling in the cyprians of dicaeogenes where the hero breaks into tears on seeing the picture or again in the of alcinous where odysseus hearing the minstrel play the lyre recalls the past and weeps and hence the recognition the fourth kind is by process of reasoning thus in the choephori one resembling has come one resembles but orestes therefore orestes has come such too is the discovery made by iphigenia in the play of polyidus the sophist it was natural reﬂection orestes to make i too must die at the altar like my sister so again in the tydeus of theodecte s the father says i came to ﬁnd my son and i lose my own life so too in the phineidae the women on seeing the place inferred their fate we are doomed to die here we were cast forth again there is composite kind of recognition involving false inference on the part of one of the characters in the odysseus disguised messenger said that one else was able to bend the bow hence b the disguised odysseus imagined that would recognise the bow which in fact he had not seen the poetics of aristotle by aristotle https to bring about recognition by this means that the expectation would recognise the bow is false inference but of all recognitions the best is that which arises from the incidents themselves where the startling discovery is made by natural means such is that in the oedipus of sophocles and in the iphigenia it was natural that iphigenia should wish to dispatch letter these recognitions alone dispense with the artiﬁcial aid of tokens or amulets next come the recognitions by process of reasoning xvii in constructing the plot and working it out with the proper diction the poet should place the scene far possible before his eyes in this way seeing everything with the utmost vividness if he were spectator of the action he will discover what is in keeping with it and be most unlikely to overlook inconsistencies the need of such rule is shown by the fault found in carcinus amphiaraus was on his way from the temple this fact escaped the observation of one who did not see the situation on the stage however the piece failed the audience being offended at the oversight again the poet should work out his play to the best of his power with appropriate gestures those who feel emotion are most convincing through natural sympathy with the characters they represent and one who is agitated storms one who is angry rages with the most reality hence poetry implies either happy gift of nature or strain of madness in the one case man can take the mould of any character in the other he is lifted out of his proper self the story whether the poet takes it ready made or constructs it himself he should ﬁrst sketch its general outline and then ﬁll in the episodes and amplify in detail the general plan may be illustrated by the iphigenia young girl is sacriﬁced she disappears mysteriously from the eyes of those who sacriﬁced her she is transported to another country where the custom is to offer up all strangers to the goddess to this ministry she is appointed some time later her own brother chances to arrive the fact that the oracle some reason ordered him to go there is outside the general plan of the play the purpose again of his coming is outside the action proper however he comes he is seized and when on the point of being sacriﬁced reveals who he is the mode of recognition may be either that of euripides or of polyidus in whose play he exclaims very naturally it was not my sister only but i too who was doomed to be sacriﬁced and by that remark he is saved after this the names being once given it remains to ﬁll in the episodes we must see that they are relevant to the action in the case of orestes example there is the madn ess which led to his capture and his deliverance by means of the puriﬁcatory rite in the drama the episodes are short but it is these that give extension to epic poetry thus the story of the odyssey can be stated brieﬂy certain man is absent from home many years he is jealously watched by poseidon and left desolate meanwhile his home is in wretched are wasting his substance and plotting against his son at length he himself arrives he makes certain persons acquainted with him he attacks the suitors with his own hand and is himself preserved while he destroys them this is the essence of the plot the rest is episode xviii every tragedy falls into two parts and unravelling or denouement incidents extraneous to the action are frequently combined with portion of the action proper to form the complication the rest is the unravelli ng by the complication i mean all that extends from the beginning of the action to the part which marks the to good or bad fortune the poetics of aristotle by aristotle https is that which extends from the beginning of the change to the end thus in the lynceus of theodectes the complication consists of the incidents presupposed in the drama the seizure of the child and then again the unravelling extends from the accusation of murder to the end there are four kinds of tragedy the complex depending entirely on reversal of the situation and recognition the pathetic where the motive is passion the tragedies on ajax and ixion the ethical where the motives are ethical the phthiotides and the peleus the fourth kind is the simple we here exclude the purely spectacular element exempliﬁed by the phorcides the prometheus and scenes laid in hades the poet should endeavour if possible to combine all poetic elements or failing that the greatest number and those the most important the more so in face of the cavilling criticism of the day whereas there have hitherto been good poets each in his own branch the critics now expect one man to surpass all others in their several lines of excellence in speaking of tragedy the same or different the best test to take is the plot identity exists where the complication and unravelling are the same many poets tie the knot well but unravel it both arts however should always be mastered again the poet should remember what has been often said and not make an epic structure into an epic structure i mean one with multiplicity of if instance you were to make tragedy out of the entire story of the iliad in the epic poem owing to its length each part assumes its proper magnitude in the drama the result is far from answering to the poet expectation the proof is that the poets who have dramatised the whole story of the fall of troy instead of selecting portions like euripides or who have taken the whole tale of niobe and not part of her story like aeschylus either fail utterly or meet with poor success on the stage even agathon has been known to fail from this one defect in his reversals of the situation however he shows marvellous skill in the effort to hit the popular taste produce tragic effect that satisﬁes the moral sense this effect is produced when the clever rogue like sisyphus is outwitted or the brave villain defeated such an event is probable in agathon sense of the word is probable he says many things should happen contrary to probability the chorus too should be regarded one of the actors it should be an integral part of the whole and share in the action in the manner not of euripides but of sophocles the later poets their choral songs pertain little to the subject of the piece to that of any other tragedy they are therefore sung mere interludes practice ﬁrst begun by agathon yet what difference is there between introducing such choral interludes and transferring speech or even whole act from one play to another xix it remains to speak of diction and thought the other parts of tragedy having been already discussed concerning thought we may assume what is said in the rhetoric to which inquiry the subject more strictly belongs under thought is included every effect which has to be produced by speech the subdivisions being and refutation the excitation of the feelings such pity fear anger and the like the suggestion of importance or its opposite now it is evident that the dramatic incidents must be treated from the same points of view the dramatic speeches when the object is to evoke the sense of pity fear importance or probability the only difference is that the incidents should speak themselves without verbal exposition while the effects aimed at in speech should be produced by the speaker and result of the speech what were the business of speaker if the thought were revealed quite apart from what he says next regards diction one branch of the inquiry treats of the modes of utterance but this province of knowledge belongs to the art of delivery and to the masters of that science it includes instance is command prayer statement threat question an answer and so forth to know or not to know these things involves serious censure upon the poet art who can admit the fault imputed to homer by protagoras in the words goddess of the wrath he gives command under the idea that he utters prayer to tell some one to the poetics of aristotle by aristotle https not to it is he says command we may therefore pass this over an inquiry that belongs to another art not to poetry xx language in general includes the following parts syllable connecting word noun verb inﬂexion or case sentence or phrase letter is an indivisible sound yet not every such sound but only one which can form part of group of sounds even brutes utter indivisible sounds none of which i call letter the sound i mean may be either vowel owel or mute vowel is that which without impact of tongue or lip has an audible sound that which with such impact has an audible sound s and mute that which with such impact has by itself sound but joined to vowel sound becomes audible g and these are distinguished according to the form assumed by the mouth and the place where they are produced according they are aspirated or smooth long or short they are acute grave or of an intermediate tone which inquiry belongs in detail to the writers on metre syllable is sound composed of mute and vowel gr without is syllable also with but the investigation of these differences belongs also to metrical science connecting word is t sound which neither causes nor hinders the union of many sounds into one signiﬁcant sound it may be placed at either end or in the middle of sentence or sound which out of several sounds each of them signiﬁcant is capable of forming one signiﬁcant sound alpha mu theta iota pi epsilon rho iota and the like or sound which marks the beginning end or division of sente nce such however that it can not correctly stand by itself at the beginning of sentence mu epsilon nu eta tau omicron iota delta epsilon noun is composite signiﬁcant sound not marking time of which part is in itself signiﬁcant in double or compound words we not employ the separate parts if each were in itself signiﬁcant thus in theodorus the delta omega rho omicron nu or is not in itself signiﬁcant verb is composite signiﬁcant sound marking time in which in the noun part is in itself signiﬁcant or does not express the idea of but walks or has walked does connote time present or past inﬂexion belongs both to the noun and verb and expresses either the relation or the like or that of number whether one or many or or the modes or tones in actual delivery question or command he go and are verbal inﬂexions of this kind sentence or phrase is composite signiﬁcant sound some at least of whose parts are in themselves signiﬁcant not every such group of words consists of verbs and deﬁnition of man it may dispense even with the verb still it will always have some signiﬁcant part walking or son of cleon sentence or phrase may form unity in two ways signifying one thing or consisting of several parts linked together thus the iliad is one by the linking togethe r of parts the deﬁnition of man by the unity of the thing signiﬁed the poetics of aristotle by aristotle https are of two kinds simple and double by simple i mean those composed of elements such gamma eta by double or compound those composed either of signiﬁcant and element though within the whole word element is signiﬁcant or of elements that are both signiﬁcant word may likewise be triple quadruple or multiple in form like so many massilian expressions who prayed to father zeus every word is either current or strange or metaphorical or ornamental or or lengthened or contracted or altered by current or proper word i mean one which is in general use among people by strange word one which is in use in another country plainly therefore the same word may be at once strange and current but not in relation to the same people the word sigma iota gamma upsilon nu omicron nu is to the cyprians current term but to us strange one metaphor is the application of an alien name by transference either from genus to species or from species to genus or from species to species or by analogy that is proportion thus from genus to species lies my ship lying at anchor is species of lying from species to genus ten thousand noble deeds hath odysseus wrought ten thousand is species of large number and is here used large number generally from species to species blade of bronze drew away the life and the water with the vessel of unyielding bronze here alpha rho upsilon rho alpha iota draw away is used tau alpha mu epsilon iota nu cleave and tau alpha mu epsilon iota nu again alpha rho upsilon alpha iota being species of taking away analogy or proportion is when the second term is to the ﬁrst the fourth to the third we may then use the fourth the second or the second the fourth sometimes too we qualify the metaphor by adding the term to which the proper word is relative thus the cup is to dionysus the shield to ares the cup may therefore be called shield of dionysus and the shield cup of ares or again old age is to life so is evening to day evening may therefore be called old age of the day and old age evening of life or in the phrase of empedocles setting sun some of the terms of the proportion there is at times word in existence still the metaphor may be used instance to scatter seed is called sowing but the action of the sun in scattering his rays is nameless still this process bears to the sun the same relation sowing to the seed hence the expression of the poet the light there is another way in which this kind of metaphor may be employed we may apply an alien term and then deny of that term one of its proper attributes if we were to call the shield not cup of ares but wineless cup an ornamental word word is one which has never been even in local use but is adopted by the poet himself some such words there appear to be epsilon rho nu upsilon gamma epsilon sigma kappa epsilon rho alpha tau alpha and alpha rho eta tau eta rho iota epsilon rho epsilon upsilon sigma word is lengthened when its own vowel is exchanged

lambda iota kappa omicron mu mu iota pi epsilon pi epsilon rho iota ﬁve end in upsilon neuter nouns end in these two latter vowels also in nu and sigma the poetics of aristotle by aristotle https the perfection of style is to be clear without being mean the clearest style is that which uses only current or proper words at the same time it is mean the poetry of cleophon and of sthenelus that diction on the other hand is lofty and raised above the commonplace which employs unusual words by unusual i mean strange or rare words metaphorical lengthened anything in short that differs from the normal idiom yet style wholly composed of such words is either riddle or jargon riddle if it consists of metaphors jargon if it consists of strange or rare words the essence of riddle is to express true facts under impossible combinations now this can not be done by any arrangement of ordinary words but by the use of metaphor it can such is the riddle man i saw who on anoth er man had glued the bronze by aid of ﬁre and others of the same kind diction that is made up of strange or rare terms is jargon certain infusion therefore of these elements is necessary to style the strange or rare word the metaphorical the ornamental and the other kinds above mentioned will raise it above the commonplace and mean while the use of proper words will make it perspicuous but nothing contributes more to produce clearness of diction that is remote from commonness than the lengthening contraction and alteration of words by deviating in exceptional cases from the normal idiom the language will gain distinction while at the same time the partial conformity with usage will give perspicuity the critics therefore are in error who censure these licenses of speech and hold the author up to ridicule thus eucleides the elder declared that it would be an easy matter to be poet if you might lengthen syllables at will he caricatured the practice in the very form of his diction in the verse epsilon pi iota chi alpha rho eta nu epsilon iota delta omicron nu mu alpha rho alpha theta omega nu alpha delta epsilon beta alpha delta iota zeta omicron nu tau alpha or omicron upsilon kappa alpha nu gamma epsilon rho alpha mu epsilon nu omicron sigma tau omicron nu epsilon kappa epsilon iota nu omicron upsilon lambda lambda epsilon beta omicron rho omicron nu to employ such license at all obtrusively is doubt grotesque but in any mode of poetic diction there must be moderatio even metaphors strange or rare words or any similar forms of speech would produce the like effect if used without propriety and with the express purpose of being ludicrous how great difference is made by the appropriate use of lengthening may be seen in epic poetry by the insertion of ordinary forms in the verse so again if we take strange or rare word metaphor or any similar mode of expression and replace it by the current or proper term the truth of our observa tion will be manifest example aeschylus and euripides each composed the same iambic line but the alteration of single word by euripides who employed the rarer term instead of the ordinary one makes one verse appear beautiful and the other trivial aeschylus in his philoctetes says phi alpha gamma epsilon delta alpha iota nu alpha delta eta mu omicron upsilon sigma alpha rho kappa alpha sigma epsilon rho theta iota epsilon iota pi omicron delta

gamma iota gamma upsilon sigma tau epsilon kappa alpha iota omicron upsilon tau iota delta alpha nu omicron sigma kappa alpha iota alpha epsilon iota kappa eta sigma the difference will be felt if we substitute the common words nu upsilon nu delta epsilon mu epsilon omega nu mu iota kappa rho omicron sigma tau epsilon kappa alpha iota alpha rho theta epsilon nu iota kappa omicron sigma kappa alpha iota alpha epsilon iota delta gamma sigma or if the line delt iota phi rho omicron nu alpha epsilon iota kappa epsilon lambda iota omicron nu kappa alpha tau alpha theta epsilon iota sigma omicron lambda iota gamma eta nu tau epsilon tau rho alpha pi epsilon iota sigma omicron lambda iota gamma eta nu tau epsilon tau rho alpha pi epsilon zeta alpha nu we read delta iota phi rho omicron nu mu omicron chi theta eta rho omicron nu kappa alpha tau alpha theta epsilon iota sigma mu iota kappa rho alpha nu tau epsilon tau rho alpha pi epsilon zeta alpha nu or eta iota omicron nu epsilon sigma beta omicron omicron omega rho iota nu eta iota omicron nu epsilon sigma kappa rho alpha zeta omicron upsilon rho iota nu again ariphrades ridiculed the tragedians using phrases which one would employ in ordinary speech example delta omega mu alpha tau omega nu alpha pi omicron instead of alpha pi omicron delta omega mu alpha tau omega nu rho epsilon theta epsilon nu the poetics of aristotle by aristotle https omega delta epsilon nu iota nu alpha chi iota lambda lambda epsilon omega sigma pi epsilon rho iota instead of pi epsilon rho iota chi iota lambda lambda epsilon omega sigma and the like it is precisely because such phrases are not part of the current idiom that they give distinction to the style this however he failed to see it is great matter to observe propriety in these several modes of expression also in compound words strange or rare words and so forth but the greatest thing by far is to have command of metaphor this alone can not be impart ed by another it is the mark of genius to make good metaphors implies an eye resemblances of the various kinds of words the compound are best adapted to dithyrambs rare words to heroic poetry metaphors to iambic in heroic poetry indeed all these varieties are serviceable but in iambic verse which reproduces far may be familiar speech the most appropriate words are those which are found even in prose these are current or proper the metaphorical the ornamental concerning tragedy and imitation by means of action this may sufﬁce xxiii to that poetic imitation which is narrative in form and employs single metre the plot manifestly ought in tragedy to be constructed on dramatic principles it should have its subject single action whole and complete with beginning middle and an end it will thus resemble living organism in all its unity and produce the pleasure proper to it it will differ in structure from historical compositions which of necessity present not single action but single period and all that happened within that period to one person or to many little connected together the events may be the at salamis and the battle with the carthag inians in sicily took place at the same time but did not tend to any one result so in the sequence of events one thing sometimes follows another and yet single result is thereby produced such is the practice we may say of most poets here again then has been already observed the transcendent excellence of homer is manifest he never attempts to make the whole war of troy the subject of his poem though that war had beginning and an end it would have been too vast theme and not easily embraced in single view if again he had kept it within moderate limits it must have been complicated by the variety of the incidents it is he detaches single portion and admits episodes many events from the general story of the the catalogue of the ships and diversifying the poem all other poets take single hero single period or an action single indeed but with multiplicity of parts thus did the author of the cypria and of the little iliad this reason the iliad and the odyssey each furnish the subject of one tragedy or at most of two while the cypria supplies materials many and the little iliad award of the arms the philoctetes the neoptolemus the eurypylus the mendicant odysseus the laconian women the fall of ilium the departure of the fleet xxiv again epic poetry must have many kinds tragedy it must be simple or complex or or the parts also with the exception of song and spectacle are the same it requires reversals of the situation recognitions and scenes of suffering moreover the thoughts and the diction must be artistic in all these respects homer is our earliest and sufﬁcient model indeed each of his poems has twofold character the iliad is at once simple and and the odyssey complex recognition scenes run through it and at the same time moreover in diction and thought they are the poetics of aristotle by aristotle https poetry differs from tragedy in the scale on which it is constructed and in its metre regards scale or length we have already laid down an adequate limit beginning and the end must be capable of being brought within single view this condition will be satisﬁed by poems on smaller scale than the old epics and answering in length to the group of tragedies presented at single sitting epic poetry has however enlar ging its dimen sions and we can see the reason in tragedy we can not imitate several lines of actions carried on at one and the same time we must conﬁne ourselves to the action on the stage and the part taken by the players but in epic poetry owing to the narrative form many events simultaneously transact ed can be presented and these if relevant to the subject add mass and dignity to the poem the epic has here an advantage and one that conduces to grandeur of effect to diverting the mind of the hearer and relieving the story with varying episodes sameness of incident soon produces satiety and makes tragedies fail on the stage the metre the heroic measure has proved its ﬁtness by the test of experience if narrative poem in any other metre or in many metres were now composed it would be found incongruous of all measures the heroic is the stateliest and the most massive and hence it most readily admits rare words and metaphors which is another point in which the narrative form of imitation stands alone on the other hand the iambic and the trochaic tetrameter are stirring measures the latter being akin to dancing the former expressive of action still more absurd would it be to mix together different metres was done by chaeremon hence one has ever composed poem on great scale in any other than heroic verse nature herself we have said teaches the choice of the proper measure homer admirable in all respects has the special merit of being the only poet who rightly appreciates the part he should take himself the poet should speak little possible in his own person it is not this that makes him an imitator other poets appear themselves upon the scene throughout and imitate but little and rarely homer after few prefatory words at once brings in man or woman or other personage none of them wanting in characteristic qualities but each with character of his own the element of the wonderful is required in tragedy the irrational on which the wonderful depends its chief effects has wider scope in epic poetry because there the person acting is not seen thus the pursuit of hector would be ludicrous if placed upon the greeks standing still and not joining in the pursuit and achilles waving them back but in the epic poem the absurdity passes unnoticed now the wonderful is pleasing may be inferred from the fact that every one tells story with some addition of his own knowing that his hearers like it it is homer who has chieﬂy taught other poets the art of telling lies skilfully the secret of it lies in fallacy assuming that if one thing is or becomes second is or becomes men imagine that if the second is the ﬁrst likewise is or becomes but this is false inference hence where the ﬁrst thing is untrue it is quite unnecessary provided the second be true to add that the ﬁrst is or has become the mind knowing the second to be true falsely infers the truth of the ﬁrst there is an example of this in the bath scene of the odyssey accordingly the poet should prefer probable impossibilities to improbable possibilities the tragic plot must not be composed of irrational parts everything irrational should if possible be excluded or at all events it should lie outside the action of the play in the oedipus the hero ignorance to the manner of laius death not within the drama in the electra the messenger account of the pythian games or in the mysians the man who has come from tegea to mysia and is still speechless the plea that otherwise the plot would have been ruined is ridiculous such plot should not in the ﬁrst instance be constructed but once the irrational has been introduced and an air of likelihood imparted to it we must accept it in spite of the absurdity take even the irrational incidents in the odyssey where odyss eus is left upon the shore of ithaca how intolerable even these might have been would be apparent if an inferior poet were to treat the subject it is the absurdity is veiled by the poetic charm with which the poet invests it the diction should be elaborated in the pauses of the action where there is expression of character or thought conversely character and thought are merely obscure d by diction that is over the poetics of aristotle by aristotle https with respect to critical difﬁculties and their solutions the number and nature of the sources from which they may be drawn may be thus exhibited the poet being an imitator like painter or any other artist must of necessity imitate one of three objects they were or are things they are said or thought to be or things they ought to be the vehicle of expression is language current terms or it may be rare words or metaphors there are also many modiﬁcations of language which we concede to the poets add to this that the standard of correctness is not the same in poetry and politics any more than in poetry and any other art within the art of poetry itself there are two kinds of faults those which touch its essence and those which are accidental if poet has chosen to imitate something but has imitated it incorrectly through want of capacity the error is inherent in the poetry but if the failure is due to wrong choice if he has represented horse throwing out both his off legs at once or introduced technical inaccuracies in medicine example or in any other art the error is not essential to the poetry these are the points of view from which we should consider and answer the objections raised by the critics first to matters which concern the poet own art if he describes the impossi ble he is guilty of an error but the error may be justiﬁed if the end of the art be thereby attained the end being that already mentioned if that is the effect of this or any other part of the poem is thus rendered more striking case in point is the pursuit of hector if however the end might have been well or better attained without violating the special rules of the poetic art the error is not justiﬁed every kind of error should if possible be avoided again does the error touch the essentials of the poetic art or some accident of it example not to know that hind has horns is less serious matter than to paint it inartistically further if it be objected that the descrip tion is not true to fact the poet may perhaps reply the objects are they ought to be just sophocles said that he drew men they ought to be euripides they are in this way the objection may be met if however the representation be of neither kind the poet may answer s is how men say the thing is this applies to tales about the gods it may well be that these stories are not higher than fact nor yet true to fact they are very possibly what xenophanes says of them but anyhow is what is said again description may be better than the fact it was the fact in the passage about the arms upon their stood the spears this was the custom then it now is among the illyrians again in examining whether what has been said or done by some one is poetically right or not we must not look merely to the particula r act or saying and ask whether it is poetically good or bad we must also consider by whom it is said or done to whom when by what means or what end whether instance it be to secure greater good or avert greater evil other difﬁculties may be resolved by due regard to the usage of language we may note rare word in omicron upsilon rho eta alpha sigma mu epsilon nu pi rho omega tau omicron nu where the poet perhaps employs omicron upsilon rho eta alpha sigma not in the sense of mules but of sentinels so again of dolon indeed he was to look upon it is not meant that his body was but that his face was ugly the cretans use the word epsilon upsilon epsilon iota delta epsilon sigma to denote fair face again zeta omega rho omicron tau epsilon rho omicron nu delta epsilon kappa epsilon rho alpha iota epsilon the drink livelier does not mean mix it stronger hard drinkers but it quicker sometimes an expression is metaphorical all gods and men were sleeping through the night at the same time the poet says indeed he turned his gaze to the trojan plain he marvelled at the sound of ﬂutes and pipes is here used metaphorically all being species of many so in the verse she hath part omicron iota eta is metaphorical the best known may be called the only one again the solution may depend upon accent or breathing thus hippias of thasos solved the difﬁculties in the lines delta iota delta omicron mu epsilon nu delta iota delta omicron mu epsilon nu delta epsilon omicron iota and tau omicron mu epsilon nu omicron the poetics of aristotle by aristotle https omicron upsilon kappa alpha tau alpha pi upsilon theta epsilon tau alpha iota omicron mu beta rho omega or again the question may be solved by punctuation in empedocles sudden things became mortal that before had learnt to be immortal and things unmixed before mixed or again by ambiguity of meaning pi alpha rho omega chi eta kappa epsilon nu delta epsilon pi lambda epsilon omega nu upsilon xi where the word pi lambd epsilon omega is ambiguous or by the usage of language thus any mixed drink is called omicron iota nu omicron sigma hence ganymede is said pour the wine to zeus though the gods not drink wine so too workers in iron are called chi alpha lambda kappa epsilon alpha sigma or workers in bronze this however may also be taken metaphor again when word seems to involve some inconsistency of meaning we should consider how many senses it may bear in the particular passage example was stayed the spear of should ask in how many ways we may take checked there the true mode of interpretation is the precise opposite of what glaucon mentions critics he says jump at certain groundless conclusions they pass adverse judgment and then proceed to reason on it and assuming that the poet has said whatever they happen to think ﬁnd fault if thing is inconsistent with their own fancy the question about icarius has been treated in this fashion the critics imagine he was lacedaemonian they think it strange therefore that telemachus should not have met him when he went to lacedaemon but the cephalle nian story may perhaps be the true one they allege that odysseus took wife from among themselves and that her father was icadius not icarius it is merely mistake then that gives plausibility to the objection in general the impossible must be justiﬁed by reference to artistic requirements or to the higher reality or to received opinion with respect to the requirements of art probable impossibility is to be preferred to thing improbable and yet possible again it may be impossible that there should be men such zeuxis painted we say the impossible is the higher thing the ideal type must surpass the reality to justify the irrational we appeal to what is commonly said to be in addition to which we urge that the irrational sometimes does not violate reason just is probable that thing may happen contrary to probability things that sound contradictory should be examined by the same rules in dialectical refutation whether the same thing is meant in the same relation and in the same sense we should therefore solve the question by reference to what the poet says himself or to what is tacitly assumed by person of intelligence the element of the irrational and similarly depravity of character are justly censured when there is inner necessity introducing them such is the irrational element in the introduction of aegeus by euripides and the badness of menelaus in the orestes thus there are ﬁve sources from which critical objections are drawn things are censured either impossible or irrational or morally hurtful or contradictory or contrary to artistic correctness the answers should be sought under the twelve heads above mentioned xxvi the question may be raised whether the epic or tragic mode of imitation is the higher if the more reﬁned art is the higher and the more reﬁned in every case is that which appeals to the better sort of audience the art which imitates anything and everything is manifestly most unreﬁned the audience is supposed to be too dull to comprehend unless something of their own is thrown in by the performers who therefore indulge in restless movements bad twist and twirl if they have to represent or hustle the coryphaeus when they perform the tragedy it is said has this same defect we may compare the opinion that the older actors entertained of their successors mynniscus used to call callippides on account of the extravagance of his action and the same view was held of pindarus tragic art then whole stands to epic in the the poetics of aristotle by aristotle https the younger to the elder actors so we are told that epic poetry is addressed to cultivated audience who not need gesture tragedy to an inferior public being then unreﬁned it is evidently the lower of the two now in the ﬁrst place this censure attaches not to the poetic but to the histrionic art gesticulation may be equally overdone in epic recitation by or in lyrical competition by mnasitheus the opuntian next all action is not to be condemned any more than all but only that of bad performers such was the fault found in callippides also in others of our own day who are censured representing degraded women again tragedy like epic poetry produces its effect even without action it reveals its power by mere reading if then in all other respects it is superior this fault we say is not inherent in it and superior it is because it has all the epic may even use the epic the music and spectacular effects important accessories and these produce the most vivid of pleasures further it has vividness of impression in reading well in representation moreover the art attains its end within narrower limits the concentrated effect is more pleasurable than one which is spread over long time and so diluted what example would be the effect of the oedipus of sophocles if it were cast into form long the iliad once more the epic imitation has less unity is shown by this that any epic poem will furnish subjects several tragedies thus if the story adopted by the poet has strict unity it must either be concisely told and appear truncated or if it conform to the epic canon of length it must seem weak and watery such length implies some loss of unity if i mean the poem is constructed out of several actions like the iliad and the odyssey which have many such parts each with certain magnitude of its own yet these poems are perfect possible in struc ture each is in the highest degree attain able an imitation of single action if then tragedy is superior to epic poetry in all these respects and moreover fulﬁls its speciﬁc function better an art each art ought to produce not any chance pleasure but the pleasure proper to it already stated it plainly follows that tragedy is the higher art attaining its end more perfectly thus much may sufﬁce concerning tragic and epic poetry in general their several kinds and parts with the number of each and their differences the causes that make poem good or bad the objections of the critics and the answers to these objections end of the project gutenberg ebook the poetics of arist
