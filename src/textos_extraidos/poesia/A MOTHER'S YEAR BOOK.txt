lovingly offered tribute to the memory of the almost perfect mother whose love cradled my own childhood so sweetly to make all motherhood forever more dear to it seems to be true that the years of woman life that sink deepest into her heart and are fraught with her keenest joy and pain are the years when her little children are clinging about her skirts then it is that she is truly wealthy with small cares and small hands clinging to her knees but then too she is often too busy with the passing of the full days and the long nights so often punctuated by the restless clinging of rosy ﬁngers and all the dear demands of babyhood to realize fully how blest are the days through which she is living it is especially the busy mother that i have gathered this little collectio n of beautiful thoughts about childhood and motherhood from some of the world best thinkers i hope it may bring to some of them much pleasure in the reading it has to in the preparation the selections from the

the author of each selection used so that proper credit could be given with each this has not been always possible and i have chosen not to leave out beautiful selection on that account geor ge macdonald says he who drops beautiful thought into the heart of friend gives the angels and emerson says that next to the originator of beautiful thought is the one who ﬁrst quotes it so i not think
