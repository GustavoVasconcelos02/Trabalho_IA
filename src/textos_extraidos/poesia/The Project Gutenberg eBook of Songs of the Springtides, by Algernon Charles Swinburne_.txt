somewhat that drew men own to mar their sight even of all eyes drawn toward him and his mouth was the very rose of all men youth one rose of all the in the world but round his brows the curls were snakes that curled and like his tongue serpent and his voice speaks death and bids rejoice yet then he spake word seeming dumb dumb thing mild and hurtless nor at ﬁrst from his bowed eyes seemed any light to come nor his meek lips blood or tears to thirst but one blind and mute in mild sweet wise pleading pity of piteous lips and eyes he strayed with faint bare feet helpless and ﬂowerlike sweet nor might man see not having word hereof that this of all gods was the great god love and seeing him lovely and like little child that wellnigh wept wonder that it smiled and was so feeble and fearful with soft speech the youth bespake him softly but there fell from the sweet lips sweet word audible that ear or thought might reach sound to make the dim cold silence glad breath to thaw the hard harsh air with heat only the saddest smile of all things sweet only the sweetest smile of all things sad and so they went together one green way till april dying made free the world may and on his
