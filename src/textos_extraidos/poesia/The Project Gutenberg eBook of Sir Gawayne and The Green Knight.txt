to the project gutenberg ebook of sir gawayne and the green knight https knight of the round table has been so highly honoured by the old sir gawayne the son of loth and nephew to the renowned arthur they delighted to describe him gawayne the good man matchless on mould the most gracious that under god lived the hardiest of hand the most fortunate in arms and the most polite in hall whose knowledge knighthood kindly works doings doughtiness and deeds of arms were known in all lands when arthur beheld the dead body of his kinsman lying on the ground bathed in blood he is said to have exclaimed righteo us god this blood were worthy to be preserved and enshrined in gold our author too loves to speak of his hero in similar terms of praise calling him the knight faultless in his ﬁve wits void of every offence and adorned with every earthly virtue he represents him one whose trust was in the ﬁve wounds and in whom the ﬁve virtues which distinguished the true knight were more ﬁrmly established than in any other on earth the author of the present story who we know from his religious poems had an utter horror of moral impurity could have chosen better subject romance in which amusement and moral instruction were to be combined in the following tale he shows how the true knight though tempted sorely not once alone but twice nay thrice breaks not his vow of chastity but turns aside the tempter shafts with the shield of purity and arm of faith and so passes scatheless through the perilous deﬁle of trial and opportunity seeming safe but while our author has borrowed many of the details of his story from the roman perceval by chrestien troyes he has made the narrative more attractive by the introduction of several original and highly interesting passages which throw light on the manners and amusements of our ancestors the following elaborate descriptions are well deserving of especial notice the mode of completely arming knight ll ii the hunting and breaking the deer ll 1 iii the hunting and unlacing the wild boar ll iv fox hunt ll the following is an outline of the story of gawayne adventures more or less in the words of the writer himself arthur the greatest of britain kings holds the christmas festival at camelot surrounded by the celebrated knights of the round table noble lords the most renowned under heaven and ladies the loveliest that ever had life ll this noble company celebrate the new year by religious service by the bestowal of gifts and the most joyous mirth lords and ladies take their seats at the guenever the gaily dressed sits at the daïs the high table or table of state where too sat gawayne and ywain together with other worthies of the round table ll 15 arthur in mood joyful child his blood young and his brain wild declares that he will not eat nor sit long at the table until some adventurous thing some uncouth tale some great marvel or some encounter of arms has occurred to mark the return of the new year ll the ﬁrst course was announced with cracking of trumpets with the noise of nakers and noble the project gutenberg ebook of sir gawayne and the green knight https each two had dishes twelve good beer and bright wine both scarcely was the ﬁrst course served when another noise than that of music was heard there rushes in at the knight of gigantic greatest on measure high he was clothed entirely in green and rode upon green foal ll fair wavy hair fell about the shoulders of the green knight and great beard like bush hung upon his breast ll the knight carried helmet shield or spear but in one hand holly bough and in the other an axe huge and unmeet the edge of which was keen sharp razor ll thus arrayed the green knight enters the hall without saluting any one the ﬁrst word that he uttered was where is the govenour of this gang gladly would i see him and with himself speak reason to the knights he cast his eye looking the most renowned much did the noble assembly marvel to see man and horse of such hue green the grass even greener they seemed than green enamel on bright gold many marvels had they seen but none such this they were afraid to answer but sat in dead silence if overpowered by sleep not all from fear but some courtesy ll then arthur before the high daïs salutes the green knight bids him welcome and entreats him to stay awhile at his court the knight says that his errand is not to abide in any dwelling but to seek the most valiant of the heroes of the round table that he may put his courage to the proof and thus satisfy himself to the fame of arthur court i come he says in peace ye may see by this branch that i bear here had i come with hostile intentions i should not have left my hauberk helmet shield sharp spear and other weapons behind but because i desire war weeds are softer if thou be so bold all men say thou wilt grant the request i am about to make sir courteous knight replies arthur if thou cravest battle only here failest thou not to ﬁght nay says the green knight i seek ﬁghting here about on this bench are only beardless children were i arrayed in arms on high steed man here would be match ll but it is now christmas time and this is the new year and i see around many brave ones any be so bold in his blood that dare strike stroke another i shall give him this rich axe to with it whatever he pleases i shall abide the ﬁrst blow just i sit and will stand him stroke stiff on this ﬂoor provided that i deal him another in return and yet give i him respite twelvemonth and day now haste and let see tite soon dare any ought say if he astounded them at ﬁrst much more so did he after this speech and fear held them all silent the knight righting himself in his saddle rolls ﬁercely his red eyes about bends his bristly green brows and strokes his beard awaiting reply but ﬁnding none that would carp with him he exclaims what is this arthur house the fame of which has spread through so many realms forsooth the renown of the round table is overturned by the word of one man speech all tremble dread without blow being struck ll with this he laughed so loud that arthur blushed very shame and waxed wroth the wind i know man he says that is aghast at thy great words give now thy axe and i will grant thee thy request arthur seizes the axe grasps the handle and sternly brandishes the project gutenberg ebook of sir gawayne and the green knight https while the green knight with stern cheer and dry countenance stroking his beard and drawing down his coat awaits the blow ll sir gawayne the nephew of the king beseeches his uncle to let him undertake the encounter and at the earnest entreaty of his nobles arthur consents to give gawayne the game ll sir gawayne then takes possession of the axe but before the blow is dealt the green knight asks the name of his opponent in good faith answers the good knight gawayne i am called that bids thee to this buffet whatever may befall after and at this time twelvemonth will take from thee another with whatever weapon thou wilt and with wight else alive by gog quoth the green knight it pleases well that i shall receive at thy ﬁst that which i have sought thou hast truly rehearsed the terms of the covenant thou shalt ﬁrst pledg thy word that thou wilt seek thyself wheresoever on earth thou belie vest i may be found and fetch thee such wages thou dealest before this company of doughty ones where should i seek thee replies gawayne where is thy place i know not thee thy court or thy name i wot not where thou dwellest but teach thereto tell how thou art called and i shall endeavour to ﬁnd thee that i swear thee truth and by my sure troth that is enough in new year says the groom in green if i tell thee when i have received the tap when thou hast smitten then smartly i will teach thee of my house my home and my own name so that thou mayest follow my track and fulﬁl the covenant between us if i spend speech then speedest thou the better then mayest thou remain in thy own land and seek further but cease thy talking1 ll take now thy grim tool to thee and let us see how thou knockest gladly sir sooth quoth gawayne and his axe he brandishes 1 this i think is the true explanation of slokes the green knight adjusts himself on the ground bends slightly his head lays his long lovely locks over his crown and lays bare his neck the blow gawayne then gripped the axe and raising it on high let it fall quickly upon the knight neck and severed the head from the body the fair head fell from the neck to the earth and many turned it aside with their feet it rolled forth the blood burst from the body yet the knight never faltered nor fell but boldly he started forth on stiff shanks and ﬁercely rushed forward seized his head and lifted it up quickly then he runs to his horse the bridle he catches steps into his stirrups and strides aloft his head by the hair he holds in his hands and sits ﬁrmly in his saddle if mishap had ailed him though headless he was ll he turned his ugly trunk ugly body that bled holding the head in his hand he directed the face toward the dearest on the dais the head lifted up its eyelids and looked abroad and thus much spoke with its mouth ye may now hear loke gawayne thou be prompt to go thou hast promised and seek till thou ﬁnd according to thy promise made in the hearing of these knights get thee to the green chapel i charge thee to fetch such dint thou hast dealt to be returned on new year morn the knight of the green chapel i am known to many wherefore if thou seekest thou canst not fail to ﬁnd therefore come or recreant be called with ﬁerce start the reins he turns rushes out of the his head in his hand so that the ﬁre of the ﬂint ﬂew from the hoofs of his foal to what kingdom he belonged knew none there nor knew they from whence he had come what then the king and gawayne the project gutenberg ebook of sir gawayne and the green knight https that green one they laugh and grin though arthur wondered much at the marvel he let one see that he was at all troubled about it but full loudly thus spake to his comely queen with courteous speech dear dame be never dismayed well happens such craft at christmas time i may now proceed to meat i can not deny that i have witnessed wondrous adventure this day ll he looked upon sir gawayne and said now sir hang up thine axe enough has it hewn so the weapon was hung up on high that all might look upon it and by true title thereof tell the wonder then all the knights hastened to their seats at the table so did the king and our good knight and they were there served with all dainties with all manner of meat and minstrelsy though words were wanting when they ﬁrst to seat went now are their hands full of stern work and the marvel affords them good subject conversation but year passes full quickly and never returns beginning is seldom like the end wherefore this christmas passed away and the year after and each season in turn followed after another ll thus winter winds round again and then gawayne thinks of his wearisome journey ll on day arthur entertains right nobly the lords and ladies of his court in honour of his nephew whom all courteous knights and lovely ladies were in great grief nevertheless they spoke only of mirth and though joyless themselves made many joke to cheer the good sir gawayne ll early on the morrow sir gawayne with great ceremony is arrayed in his armour ll and thus completely equipped his adventure he ﬁrst hears mass and afterwards takes leave of arthur the knights of the round table and the lords and ladies of the court who kiss him and commend him to christ he bids them all good day he thought evermore ll very much was the warm water that pour ed from eyes that day now rides our knight through the realms of england with companion but his foal and one to hold converse with save god alone from camelot in somersetshire he proceeds through gloucestershire and the adjoining counties into montgomeryshire and thence through north wales to holyhead adjoining the isle of anglesea ll from which he passes into the very narrow peninsula of wirral in cheshire where dwelt but few that loved god or man gawayne enquires after the green knight of the green chapel but all the inhabitants declare that they have never seen any man of such hues of green the knight thence pursues his journey by strange paths over hill and moor encountering on his way not only serpents wolves bulls bears and boars but wood satyrs and giants but worse than all those however was the sharp winter when the cold clear water shed from the clouds and froze ere it might fall to the earth nearly slain with the sleet he slept in his armour more nights than enough in naked rocks ll thus in peril and plight the knight travels on until and to mary he makes his moan that she may direct him to some abode on the morn he arrives at an immense forest wondrously wild surrounded by high hills on every side where he found hoary oaks full huge hundred together the hazel and the hawthorn intermingle d were all overgrown with moss and upon their boughs sat many sad birds that piteously piped pain of the project gutenberg ebook of sir gawayne and the green knight https gawayne besought the lord and mary to guide him to some habitation where he might hear mass ll scarcely had he crossed himself thrice when he perceived dwelling in the wood set upon hill it was the loveliest castle he had ever beheld it was pitched on prairie with park all about it enclosing many tree more than two miles it shone the sun through the bright oaks ll gawayne urges on his steed gringolet and ﬁnds himself at the chief gate he called aloud and soon there appeared porter on the wall who demanded his errand good sir quoth gawayne wouldst thou go to the high lord of this house and crave lodging yea by peter replied the porter well i know that thou art welcome to dwell here long thou likest the drawbridge is soon let down and the gates opened wide to receive the knight many noble ones hasten to bid him welcome ll they take away his helmet sword and shield and many proud one presses forward to him honour they bring him into the hall where ﬁre was brightly burning upon the hearth then the lord of the land1 comes from his chamber and welcomes sir gawayne telling him that he is to consider the place his own our knight is next conducted to bright bower where was noble of pure silk with golden hems and tarsic tapestries upon the walls and the ﬂoors ll here the knight doffed his armour and put on rich robes which so well became him that all declared that more comely knight christ had never made ll 1 gawayne is now in the castle of the green knight who divested of his elvish or supernatural character appears to our knight merely bold one with beaver beard table is soon raised and gawayne having washed proceeds to meat many dishes are set before sews of various kinds ﬁsh of all kinds some baked in bread others broiled on the embers some boiled and others seasoned with spices the knight expresses himself well pleased and calls it most noble and princely feast after dinner in reply to numerous questions he tells his host that he is gawayne one of the knights of the round table when this was made known great was the joy in the hall each one said softly to his companion now we shall see courteous behaviour and learn the terms of noble discourse since we have amongst us ﬁne father of nurture truly god has highly favoured us in sending us such noble guest sir gawayne ll at the end of the christmas festival gawayne desires to take his departure from the castle but his host persuades him to stay promising to direct him to the green chapel about two miles from the castle that he may be there by the appointed time ll covenant is made between them the terms of which were that the lord of the castle should go out early to the chase that gawayne meanwhile should lie in his loft at his ease then rise at his usual hour and afterwards sit at table with his hostess and that at the end of the day they should make an exchange of whatever they might obtain in the interim whatever i win in the wood says the lord shall be yours and what thou gettest shall be mine ll 1125 the project gutenberg ebook of sir gawayne and the green knight https early before daybreak the folk uprise saddle their horses and truss their mails the noble lord of the land array ed riding eats hastily sop and having heard mass proceeds with hundred hunters to hunt the wild deer ll 177 all this time gawayne lies in his gay bed his nap is disturbed by little noise at the door which is softly opene he heaves up his head out of the clothes and peeping through the curtains beholds most lovely lady the wife of his host she came towards the bed and the knight laid himself down quickly pretending to be asleep the lady stole to the bed cast up the curtains crept within sat her softly on the and waited some time till the knight should awake after lurking awhile under the clothes considering what it all meant gawayne unlocked his eyelids and put on look of surprise at the same time making the sign of the cross if afraid of some hidden danger ll good morrow sir said that fair lady ye are careless sleeper to let one enter thus i shall bind you in your bed of that be ye sure good morrow quoth gawayne i shall act according to your will with great pleasure but permit to rise that i may the more comfortably converse with you nay beau sir said that sweet one ye shall not rise from your bed since i have caught my knight i shall hold talk with him i ween well that ye are sir gawayne that all the world worships whose honour and courtesy are so greatly praised now ye are here and we are alone my lord and his men being afar off other men too are in bed so are my maidens and the door is safely closed i shall use my time well while it lasts ye are welcome to my person to with it ye please and i will be your servant ll gawayne behaves most discreetly the remembrance of his forthcoming adventure at the green chapel prevents him from thinking of love ll 1289 at last the lady takes leave of the knight by catching him in her arms and kissing him ll the day passes away merrily and at dusk the lord of the castle returns from the chase he presents the venison to gawayne according to the previous covenant between them our knight gives his host kiss the only piece of good fortune that had fallen to him during the day it is good says the other and would be much better if ye would tell where ye won such bliss ll that was not in our covenant replies gawayne so try more after much laughing on both sides they proceed to supper and afterwards while the choice wine is being carried round gawayne and his host renew their agreement late at night they take leave of each other and hasten to their beds by the time that the cock had crowed and cackled thrice the lord was up and after meat and mass were over the hunters make the woods where they give chase to wild boar who had grown old and mischievous ll while the sportsmen are hunting this wild swine our lovely knight lies in his bed he is not forgotten by the lady who pays him an early visit seeking to make further trial of his virtues she sits softly by his side and tells him that he has forgotten what she taught him the day before ll i taught you of kissing says she that becomes every courteous knight gawayne says that he must not take that which is forbidden him the lady replies that he is strong enough to enforce his own wishes our knight answers that every gift not given with good will is worthless his fair visitor then enquires how it is that he who is so skilled in the true sport of love and so renowned knight has never talked to her of love ll 1524 you ought she says to show and teach young thing like some tokens of crafts i come hither and sit here alone to learn of you some game teach of your wit while my lord is from home gawayne replies that he can not undertake the task of expounding the project gutenberg ebook of sir gawayne and the green knight https tales of arms to one who has far more wisdom than he possesses thus did our knight avoid all appearance of evil though sorely pressed to what was wrong ll the lady having bestowed two kisses upon sir gawayne takes her leave of him ll at the end of the day the lord of the castle returns home with the shields and head of the wild boar he shows them to his guest who declares that such brawn of beast nor such sides of swine he never before has seen gawayne takes possession of the spoil according to covenant and in return he bestows two kisses upon his host who declares that his guest has indeed been rich with such chaf fer ll after much persuasion gawayne consents to stop at the castle another day ll early on the morrow the lord and his men hasten to the woods and come upon the track of fox the hunting of which affords them plenty of employment and sport ll meanwhile our good knight sleeps soundly within his comely curtains he is again visited by the lady of the castle so gaily was she attired and so faultless of her features that great joy warmed the heart of sir gaw ayne with soft and pleasant smiles they smite into mirth and are soon engaged in conversation had not mary thought of her knight he would have been in great peril ll so sorely does the fair one press him with her love that he fears lest he should become traitor to his host the lady enquires whether he has mistress to whom he has plighted his troth the knight swears by st john that he neither has nor desires one this answer causes the dame to sigh sorrow and telling him that she must depart she asks some gift if it were only glove by which she might think on the knight and lessen her grief ll gawayne assures her that he has nothing worthy of her acceptance that he is on an uncouth errand and therefore has men with mails containing precious things which he is truly sorry quoth that lovesome one though i had nought of yours yet should ye have of mine thus saying she offers him rich ring of red gold with shining stone standing aloft that shone like the beams of the bright sun the knight refused the gift he had nothing to give in return since ye refuse my ring says the lady because it seems too rich and ye would not be beholden to i shall give you my girdle that is less valuable ll 1835 but gawayne replies that he will not accept gold or reward of any kind though ever in hot and in cold he will be her true servant ye refuse it asks the lady becaus it seems simple and of little value whoso knew the virtues that are knit therein would estimate it more highly he who is girded with this green lace can not be wounded or slain by any man under heaven the knight thinks awhile and it strikes him that this would be jewel the jeopardy that he had to under go at the green chapel so he not only accepts the lace but promises to keep the possession of it secret ll by that time the lady had kissed him thrice and she then takes her leave and leaves him there gawayne rises dresses himself in noble array and conceals the love lace where he might ﬁnd it again he then hies to mass shrives him of his misdeeds and obtains absolution on his return to the hall he solaces the ladies with comely carols and all kinds of joy ll the dark night came and then the lord of the castle having slain the fox returns to his dear home where he ﬁnds ﬁre brightly turning and his guest amusing the project gutenberg ebook of sir gawayne and the green knight https ll gawayne in fulﬁlment of his agreement kisses his host by christ quoth the other knight ye have caught much bliss i have hunted all this day and nought have i got but the skin of this foul fox the devil have the goods and that is full poor to pay such precious things ll after the usual evening entertainment gawayne retires to rest the next morning being new year day is cold and stormy snow falls and the dales are full of drift our knight in his bed locks his eyelids but full little he sleeps by each cock that crows he know s the hour and before he calls his chamberlain who quickly brings him his armour ll 2014 while gawayne clothed himself in his rich weeds he forgot not the lace the lady gift but with it doubly girded his loins he wore it not its rich ornaments but to save himself when it behoved him to suffer and safeguard against sword or knife ll having thanked his host and all the renowned assembly the great kindness he had experienced at their hands he steps into stirrups and strides aloft ll the drawbridge is let down and the broad gates unbarred and borne open upon both sides and the knight after commending the castle to christ passes thereout and goes on his way accompanied by his guide that should teach him to turn to that place where he should receive the blow they climb over cliffs where each hill had hat and until the next morn when they ﬁnd themselves on full high hill covered with snow the servant bids his master remain awhile saying i have brought you hither at this time and now ye are not far from that noted place that ye have so often enquired after the place that ye press to is esteemed full perilous and there dwells man in that waste the worst upon earth he is stiff and stern and loves to strike and greater is he than any

he is man immoderate and mercy uses be it churl or chaplain that by the chapel rides monk or or any man else it is pleasant to him to kill them to go alive himself wherefore i tell thee truly ye there ye be killed though ye had twenty lives to spend he has dwelt there long of yore and on ﬁeld much sorrow has wrought against his sore dints ye may not defend you ll 17 therefore good sir gawayne let the man alone and god sake go by some other path and then i shall hie home again i swear to you by 1 he only in part keeps to his covenant he holds back the god and all his saints that i will never say that ever ye attempted to ﬂee from any man gawayne thanks his guide his kindness but declares that to the green chapel he will go though the owner thereof be stern knave god can devise means to save his servants mary quoth the other since it pleases thee to lose thy life i will not hinder thee have thy helmet on thy head thy spear in thy hand and ride down this path by yon till thou be brought to the bottom of the valley then look little on the plain on thy left hand and thou shalt see in that slade the chapel itself and the burly knight that guards it ll 2148 now farewell gawayne the noble all the gold upon ground the project gutenberg ebook of sir gawayne and the green knight https not go with thee nor bear thee fellowship through this wood foot farther thus having spoken he gallops away and leaves the knight alone gawayne now pursues his journey rides through the dale and looks about he sees signs of but only high and steep banks and the very shadows of the high woods seemed wild and distorted chapel however could he discover after while he sees round hill by the side of stream thither he goes alights and fastens his horse to the branch of tree he walks about the hill debating with himself what it might be it had hole in the one end and on each side and everywhere overgrown with grass but whether it was only an old cave or crevice of an old crag he could not tell ll now indeed quoth gawayne desert is here this oratory is ugly with herbs overgrown it is ﬁtting place the man in green to here his devotions after the devil manner now i feel it is the ﬁend the devil in my ﬁve wits that has covenanted with that he may destroy this is chapel of betide it it is the most cursed kirk that ever i came in with his helmet on his head and spear in his hand he roams up to the rock and then he hears from that high hill beyond the brook wondrous wild noise lo it clattered in the cliff if one upon grindstone were grinding scythe it whirred like the water at mill and rushed and echoed terrible to hear though my life i forgo says gawayne noise shall cause to fear then he cried aloud who dwells in this place discourse with to hold now is good gawayne going right here if any brave wight will hie him hither either now or never ll abide quoth one on the bank above over his head and thou shalt have all in haste that i promised thee once soon there comes out of hole in the crag with fell weapon danish axe quite new the man in the green clothed at ﬁrst his legs locks and beard but now he is on foot and walks on the earth when he reaches the stream he hops over and boldly strides about he meets sir gawayne who tells him that he is quite ready to fulﬁl his part of the compact gawayne quoth that gome man may god preserve thee truly thou art welcome to my place thou hast timed thy travel true man should thou knowest the covenants made between us at this time that on new year day i should return thee thy blow we are now in this valley by ourselves and can we please ll have therefore thy helmet off thy head and here thy pay let us have more talk than when thou didst strike of f my head with single blow nay by god quoth gawayne i shall not begrudge thee thy will any harm that may happen but will stand still while thou strikest then he stoops little and shows his bare neck unmoved by any fear the green knight takes up his grim tool and with all his force raises it aloft if he meant utterly to destroy him the axe came gliding down gawayne shrank little with the shoulders from the sharp iron the other withheld his weapon and then reproved the prince with many proud words thou art not gawayne that is so good esteemed that never feared host by hill nor by vale now thou ﬂeest fear before thou feelest harm ll 2272 such cowardice of that knight did i never hear i never ﬂinched nor ﬂed when thou didst aim at in king arthur house my head ﬂew to my feet and yet i never ﬂed wherefore i deserve to be called the better man the project gutenberg

stand thee stroke and start more until thine axe has hit here my troth have at thee then said the other and heaves the axe aloft and looks savagely if he were mad he aims at the other mightily but withholds his hand ere it might hurt gawayne readily abides the blow without ﬂinching with any member and stood still stone or tree ﬁxed in rocky ground with hundred roots then merrily the other did speak since now thou hast thy heart whole it behoves to strike so take care of thy neck gawayne answers with great wroth thrash on thou ﬁerce man thou threatenest too long i believe thy own heart fails thee forsooth quoth the other since thou speakest so boldly i will longer delay ll then contracting both lips and brow he made ready to strike and let fall his axe on the bare neck of sir gawayne though he hammered ﬁercely he only severed the hide causing the blood to ﬂow when gawayne saw his blood on the snow he quickly seized his helmet and placed it on his head then he drew out his bright sword and thus angrily spoke cease man of thy blow bid more i have received stroke in this place without opposition but if thou givest any more readily shall i requite thee of that be thou sure our covenant stipulates one stroke and therefore now cease the green knight resting on his axe looks on sir gawayne bold and fearless he there stood and then with loud voice thus addresses the knight bold knight be not so wroth man here has wronged thee ll 2339 i promised thee stroke and thou hast it so hold thee well pleased i could have dealt much worse with thee and caused thee much sorrow two blows i aimed at thee twice thou kissedst my fair wife but i struck thee not because thou restoredst them to according to agreement at the third time thou failedst and therefore i have given thee that

most faultless man that ever on foot went still sir thou wert wanting in good faith but it proceeded from immorality thou being only desirous of saving thy life the less i blame thee gawayne stood confounded the blood rushed into his face and he shrank within himself very shame cur sed he cried be cowardice and covetousness both in you are villany and vice that virtue destroy then he takes off the girdle and throws it to the knight in green cursing his cowardice and covetousness the green knight laughing thus spoke thou hast confessed so clean and acknowledged thy faults that i hold thee

knight and so with many embraces and kind wishes they one to his castle the other to arthur court after passing through many wild ways our knight recovers from the wound in his neck and at last comes safe and sound to the court of king arthur great then was the joy of all the king and queen kiss their brave knight and make many enquiries about his journe he tells them of his adventures hiding the chance of the chapel the cheer of the knight the love of the lady and lastly of the lace groaning grief and shame he shows them the cut in his neck which he had received his unfaithfulness ll the king and his courtiers comfort the laugh loudly at his adventures and unanimously agree that those lords and ladies that belonged to the round table and each knight of the brotherhood should ever after wear bright green belt gawayne sake and he upon whom it was conferred honoured it evermore after thus in arthur time this adventure befell whereof the brutus books bear witness ll i need not say that the brutus books we possess not contain the legend here set forth though it is not much more improbable than some of the statements contained in them if the reader desires to know the relation in which this and the like stories stand to the original arthur legends he will ﬁnd it discussed in sir madden preface to his edition of syr gawayne which also contains sketch of the very different views taken of sir gawayne by the dif ferent romance writers into this and other literary questions i not enter here i have nothing to add to sir madden statements but in the text of the poem i have differed from him in some few readings which will be found noticed in the notes and glossary the manuscript is fast fading i am glad that the existence of the early english text society has enabled us to secure wider diffusion of its contents before the original shall be longer legible we want nothing but an increased supply of members to enable us to give to large circle of readers many an equally

society any of his works which it may determine to introduction knight of the round table has been so highly honoured by the old sir gawayne the son of loth and nephew to the renowned arthur they delighted to describe him gawayne the good man matchless on mould the most gracious that under god lived the hardiest of hand the most fortunate in arms and the most polite in hall whose knowledge knighthood kindly works doings doughtiness and deeds of arms were known in all lands when arthur beheld the dead body of his kinsman lying on the ground bathed in blood he is said to have exclaimed righteo us god this blood were worthy to be preserved and enshrined in gold our author too loves to speak of his hero in similar terms of praise calling him the knight faultless in his ﬁve wits void of every offence and adorned with every earthly virtue he represents him one whose trust was in the ﬁve wounds and in whom the ﬁve virtues which distinguished the true knight were more ﬁrmly established than in any other on earth the author of the present story who we know from his religious poems had an utter horror of moral impurity could have chosen better subject romance in which amusement and moral instruction were to be combined in the following tale he shows how the true knight though tempted sorely not once alone but twice nay thrice breaks not his vow of chastity but turns aside the tempter shafts with the shield of purity the project gutenberg ebook of sir gawayne and the green knight https of faith and so passes scatheless through the perilous deﬁle of trial and opportunity seeming safe but while our author has borrowed many of the details of his story from the roman perceval by chrestien troyes he has made the narrative more attractive by the introduction of several original and highly interesting passages which throw light on the manners and amusements of our ancestors the following elaborate descriptions are well deserving of especial notice the mode of completely arming knight ll ii the hunting and breaking the deer ll 1 iii the hunting and unlacing the wild boar ll iv fox hunt ll the following is an outline of the story of gawayne adventures more or less in the words of the writer himself arthur the greatest of britain kings holds the christmas festival at camelot surrounded by the celebrated knights of the round table noble lords the most renowned under heaven and ladies the loveliest that ever had life ll this noble company celebrate the new year by religious service by the bestowal of gifts and the most joyous mirth lords and ladies take their seats at the guenever the gaily dressed sits at the daïs the high table or table of state where too sat gawayne and ywain together with other worthies of the round table ll 15 arthur in mood joyful child his blood young and his brain wild declares that he will not eat nor sit long at the table until some adventurous thing some uncouth tale some great marvel or some encounter of arms has occurred to mark the return of the new year ll the ﬁrst course was announced with cracking of trumpets with the noise of nakers and noble pipes each two had dishes twelve good beer and bright wine both scarcely was the ﬁrst course served when another noise than that of music was heard there rushes in at the knight of gigantic greatest on measure high he was clothed entirely in green and rode upon green foal ll fair wavy hair fell about the shoulders of the green knight and great beard like bush hung upon his breast ll the knight carried helmet shield or spear but in one hand holly bough and in the other an axe huge and unmeet the edge of which was keen sharp razor ll thus arrayed the green knight enters the hall without saluting any one the ﬁrst word that he uttered was where is the govenour of this gang gladly would i see him and with himself speak reason to the knights he cast his eye looking the most renowned much did the noble assembly marvel to see man and horse of such hue green the grass even greener they seemed than green enamel on bright gold many marvels had they seen but none such this they were afraid to answer but sat in dead silence if overpowered by sleep not all from fear but some courtesy ll the project gutenberg ebook of sir gawayne and the green knight https arthur before the high daïs salutes the green knight bids him welcome and entreats him to stay awhile at his court the knight says that his errand is not to abide in any dwelling but to seek the most valiant of the heroes of the round table that he may put his courage to the proof and thus satisfy himself to the fame of arthur court i come he says in peace ye may see by this branch that i bear here had i come with hostile intentions i should not have left my hauberk helmet shield sharp spear and other weapons behind but because i desire war weeds are softer if thou be so bold all men say thou wilt grant the request i am about to make sir courteous knight replies arthur if thou cravest battle only here failest thou not to ﬁght nay says the green knight i seek ﬁghting here about on this bench are only beardless children were i arrayed in arms on high steed man here would be match ll but it is now christmas time and this is the new year and i see around many brave ones any be so bold in his blood that dare strike stroke another i shall give him this rich axe to with it whatever he pleases i shall abide the ﬁrst blow just i sit and will stand him stroke stiff on this ﬂoor provided that i deal him another in return and yet give i him respite twelvemonth and day now haste and let see tite soon dare any ought say if he astounded them at ﬁrst much more so did he after this speech and fear held them all silent the knight righting himself in his saddle rolls ﬁercely his red eyes about bends his bristly green brows and strokes his beard awaiting reply but ﬁnding none that would carp with him he exclaims what is this arthur house the fame of which has spread through so many realms forsooth the renown of the round table is overturned by the word of one man speech all tremble dread without blow being struck ll with this he laughed so loud that arthur blushed very shame and waxed wroth the wind i know man he says that is aghast at thy great words give now thy axe and i will grant thee thy request arthur seizes the axe grasps the handle and sternly brandishes it about while the green knight with stern cheer and dry countenance stroking his beard and drawing down his coat awaits the blow ll sir gawayne the nephew of the king beseeches his uncle to let him undertake the encounter and at the earnest entreaty of his nobles arthur consents to give gawayne the game ll sir gawayne then takes possession of the axe but before the blow is dealt the green knight asks the name of his opponent in good faith answers the good knight gawayne i am called that bids thee to this buffet whatever may befall after and at this time twelvemonth will take from thee another with whatever weapon thou wilt and with wight else alive by gog quoth the green knight it pleases well that i shall receive at thy ﬁst that which i have sought thou hast truly rehearsed the terms of the covenant thou shalt ﬁrst pledg thy word that thou wilt seek thyself wheresoever on earth thou belie vest i may be found and fetch thee such wages thou dealest before this company of doughty ones where should i seek thee replies gawayne where is thy place i know not thee thy court or thy name i wot not where thou dwellest but teach thereto tell how thou art called and i shall endeavour to ﬁnd thee that i swear thee truth and by my sure troth that is enough in new year says the groom in green if i tell thee when i have received the tap when thou hast smitten then smartly i

then speedest thou the better then mayest thou remain in thy own land and seek further but cease thy talking1 ll take now thy grim tool to thee and let us see how thou knockest gladly sir sooth quoth gawayne and his axe he brandishes 1 this i think is the true explanation of slokes the green knight adjusts himself on the ground bends slightly his head lays his long lovely locks over his crown and lays bare his neck the blow gawayne then gripped the axe and raising it on high let it fall quickly upon the knight neck and severed the head from the body the fair head fell from the neck to the earth and many turned it aside with their feet it rolled forth the blood burst from the body yet the knight never faltered nor fell but boldly he started forth on stiff shanks and ﬁercely rushed forward seized his head and lifted it up quickly then he runs to his horse the bridle he catches steps into his stirrups and strides aloft his head by the hair he holds in his hands and sits ﬁrmly in his saddle if mishap had ailed him though headless he was ll he turned his ugly trunk ugly body that bled holding the head in his hand he directed the face toward the dearest on the dais the head lifted up its eyelids and looked abroad and thus much spoke with its mouth ye may now hear loke gawayne thou be prompt to go thou hast promised and seek till thou ﬁnd according to thy promise made in the hearing of these knights get thee to the green chapel i charge thee to fetch such dint thou hast dealt to be returned on new year morn the knight of the green chapel i am known to many wherefore if thou seekest thou canst not fail to ﬁnd therefore come or recreant be called with ﬁerce start the reins he turns rushes out of the his head in his hand so that the ﬁre of the ﬂint ﬂew from the hoofs of his foal to what kingdom he belonged knew none there nor knew they from whence he had come what then the king and gawayne there at that green one they laugh and grin though arthur wondered much at the marvel he let one see that he was at all troubled about it but full loudly thus spake to his comely queen with courteous speech dear dame be never dismayed well happens such craft at christmas time i may now proceed to meat i can not deny that i have witnessed wondrous adventure this day ll he looked upon sir gawayne and said now sir hang up thine axe enough has it hewn so the weapon was hung up on high that all might look upon it and by true title thereof tell the wonder then all the knights hastened to their seats at the table so did the king and our good knight and they were there served with all dainties with all manner of meat and minstrelsy though words were wanting when they ﬁrst to seat went now are their hands full of stern work and the marvel affords them good subject conversation but year passes full quickly and never returns beginning is seldom like the end wherefore this christmas passed away and the year after and each season in turn followed after another ll thus winter winds round again and then gawayne thinks of his the project gutenberg ebook of sir gawayne and the green knight https ll on day arthur entertains right nobly the lords and ladies of his court in honour of his nephew whom all courteous knights and lovely ladies were in great grief nevertheless they spoke only of mirth and though joyless themselves made many joke to cheer the good sir gawayne ll early on the morrow sir gawayne with great ceremony is arrayed in his armour ll and thus completely equipped his adventure he ﬁrst hears mass and afterwards takes leave of arthur the knights of the round table and the lords and ladies of the court who kiss him and commend him to christ he bids them all good day he thought evermore ll very much was the warm water that pour ed from eyes that day now rides our knight through the realms of england with companion but his foal and one to hold converse with save god alone from camelot in somersetshire he proceeds through gloucestershire and the adjoining counties into montgomeryshire and thence through north wales to holyhead adjoining the isle of anglesea ll from which he passes into the very narrow peninsula of wirral in cheshire where dwelt but few that loved god or man gawayne enquires after the green knight of the green chapel but all the inhabitants declare that they have never seen any man of such hues of green the knight thence pursues his journey by strange paths over hill and moor encountering on his way not only serpents wolves bulls bears and boars but wood satyrs and giants but worse than all those however was the sharp winter when the cold clear water shed from the clouds and froze ere it might fall to the earth nearly slain with the sleet he slept in his armour more nights than enough in naked rocks ll thus in peril and plight the knight travels on until and to mary he makes his moan that she may direct him to some abode on the morn he arrives at an immense forest wondrously wild surrounded by high hills on every side where he found hoary oaks full huge hundred together the hazel and the hawthorn intermingle d were all overgrown with moss and upon their boughs sat many sad birds that piteously piped pain of the cold gawayne besought the lord and mary to guide him to some habitation where he might hear mass ll scarcely had he crossed himself thrice when he perceived dwelling in the wood set upon hill it was the loveliest castle he had ever beheld it was pitched on prairie with park all about it enclosing many tree more than two miles it shone the sun through the bright oaks ll gawayne urges on his steed gringolet and ﬁnds himself at the chief gate he called aloud and soon there appeared porter on the wall who demanded his errand good sir quoth gawayne wouldst thou go to the high lord of this house and crave lodging yea by peter replied the porter well i know that thou art welcome to dwell here long thou likest the drawbridge is soon let down and the gates opened wide to receive the knight many noble ones hasten to bid him welcome ll they take away his helmet sword and shield and many proud one presses forward to him honour they bring him into the hall where ﬁre was brightly burning upon the hearth then the lord of the land1 comes from his the project gutenberg ebook of sir gawayne and the green knight https welcomes sir gawayne telling him that he is to consider the place his own our knight is next conducted to bright bower where was noble of pure silk with golden hems and tarsic tapestries upon the walls and the ﬂoors ll here the knight doffed his armour and put on rich robes which so well became him that all declared that more comely knight christ had never made ll 1 gawayne is now in the castle of the green knight who divested of his elvish or supernatural character appears to our knight merely bold one with beaver beard table is soon raised and gawayne having washed proceeds to meat many dishes are set before sews of various kinds ﬁsh of all kinds some baked in bread others broiled on the embers some boiled and others seasoned with spices the knight expresses himself well pleased and calls it most noble and princely feast after dinner in reply to numerous questions he tells his host that he is gawayne one of the knights of the round table when this was made known great was the joy in the hall each one said softly to his companion now we shall see courteous behaviour and learn the terms of noble discourse since we have amongst us ﬁne father of nurture truly god has highly favoured us in sending us such noble guest sir gawayne ll at the end of the christmas festival gawayne desires to take his departure from the castle but his host persuades him to stay promising to direct him to the green chapel about two miles from the castle that he may be there by the appointed time ll covenant is made between them the terms of which were that the lord of the castle should go out early to the chase that gawayne meanwhile should lie in his loft at his ease then rise at his usual hour and afterwards sit at table with his hostess and that at the end of the day they should make an exchange of whatever they might obtain in the interim whatever i win in the wood says the lord shall be yours and what thou gettest shall be mine ll 1125 full early before daybreak the folk uprise saddle their horses and truss their mails the noble lord of the land array ed riding eats hastily sop and having heard mass proceeds with hundred hunters to hunt the wild deer ll 177 all this time gawayne lies in his gay bed his nap is disturbed by little noise at the door which is softly opene he heaves up his head out of the clothes and peeping through the curtains beholds most lovely lady the wife of his host she came towards the bed and the knight laid himself down quickly pretending to be asleep the lady stole to the bed cast up the curtains crept within sat her softly on the and waited some time till the knight should awake after lurking awhile under the clothes considering what it all meant gawayne unlocked his eyelids and put on look of surprise at the same time making the sign of the cross if afraid of some hidden danger ll good morrow sir said that fair lady ye are careless sleeper to let one enter thus i shall bind you in your bed of that be ye sure good morrow quoth gawayne i shall act according to your will with great pleasure but permit to rise that i may the more comfortably converse with you nay beau sir said that sweet one ye shall not rise from your bed since i have caught my knight i shall hold talk with him i ween well that ye are sir gawayne that all the world worships whose honour and courtesy are so greatly praised now ye the project gutenberg ebook of sir gawayne and the green knight https and we are alone my lord and his men being afar off other men too are in bed so are my maidens and the door is safely closed i shall use my time well while it lasts ye are welcome to my person to with it ye please and i will be your servant ll gawayne behaves most discreetly the remembrance of his forthcoming adventure at the green chapel prevents him from thinking of love ll 1289 at last the lady takes leave of the knight by catching him in her arms and kissing him ll the day passes away merrily and at dusk the lord of the castle returns from the chase he presents the venison to gawayne according to the previous covenant between them our knight gives his host kiss the only piece of good fortune that had fallen to him during the day it is good says the other and would be much better if ye would tell where ye won such bliss ll that was not in our covenant replies gawayne so try more after much laughing on both sides they proceed to supper and afterwards while the choice wine is being carried round gawayne and his host renew their agreement late at night they take leave of each other and hasten to their beds by the time that the cock had crowed and cackled thrice the lord was up and after meat and mass were over the hunters make the woods where they give chase to wild boar who had grown old and mischievous ll while the sportsmen are hunting this wild swine our lovely knight lies in his bed he is not forgotten by the lady who pays him an early visit seeking to make further trial of his virtues she sits softly by his side and tells him that he has forgotten what she taught him the day before ll i taught you of kissing says she that becomes every courteous knight gawayne says that he must not take that which is forbidden him the lady replies that he is strong enough to enforce his own wishes our knight answers that every gift not given with good will is worthless his fair visitor then enquires how it is that he who is so skilled in the true sport of love and so renowned knight has never talked to her of love ll 1524 you ought she says to show and teach young thing like some tokens of crafts i come hither and sit here alone to learn of you some game teach of your wit while my lord is from home gawayne replies that he can not undertake the task of expounding and tales of arms to one who has far more wisdom than he possesses thus did our knight avoid all appearance of evil though sorely pressed to what was wrong ll the lady having bestowed two kisses upon sir gawayne takes her leave of him ll at the end of the day the lord of the castle returns home with the shields and head of the wild boar he shows them to his guest who declares that such brawn of beast nor such sides of swine he never before has seen gawayne takes possession of the spoil according to covenant and in return he bestows two kisses upon his host who declares that his guest has indeed been rich with such chaf fer ll after much persuasion gawayne consents to stop at the castle another day ll early on the morrow the lord and his men hasten to the woods and come upon the track of fox the hunting of which affords them plenty of employment and sport ll meanwhile our good knight sleeps soundly within his comely curtains he is again visited by the lady of the castle so gaily was she attired and so faultless of her features that great joy warmed the heart of sir gaw ayne with soft and pleasant smiles they smite into mirth and are soon engaged in conversation had not mary thought of her knight he would have been in great peril ll so sorely does the fair one press him with her love that he fears lest he the project gutenberg ebook of sir gawayne and the green knight https traitor to his host the lady enquires whether he has mistress to whom he has plighted his troth the knight swears by st john that he neither has nor desires one this answer causes the dame to sigh sorrow and telling him that she must depart she asks some gift if it were only glove by which she might think on the knight and lessen her grief ll gawayne assures her that he has nothing worthy of her acceptance that he is on an uncouth errand and therefore has men with mails containing precious things which he is truly sorry quoth that lovesome one though i had nought of yours yet should ye have of mine thus saying she offers him rich ring of red gold with shining stone standing aloft that shone like the beams of the bright sun the knight refused the gift he had nothing to give in return since ye refuse my ring says the lady because it seems too rich and ye would not be beholden to i shall give you my girdle that is less valuable ll 1835 but gawayne replies that he will not accept gold or reward of any kind though ever in hot and in cold he will be her true servant ye refuse it asks the lady becaus it seems simple and of little value whoso knew the virtues that are knit therein would estimate it more highly he who is girded with this green lace can not be wounded or slain by any man under heaven the knight thinks awhile and it strikes him that this would be jewel the jeopardy that he had to under go at the green chapel so he not only accepts the lace but promises to keep the possession of it secret ll by that time the lady had kissed him thrice and she then takes her leave and leaves him there gawayne rises dresses himself in noble array and conceals the love lace where he might ﬁnd it again he then hies to mass shrives him of his misdeeds and obtains absolution on his return to the hall he solaces the ladies with comely carols and all kinds of joy ll the dark night came and then the lord of the castle having slain the fox returns to his dear home where he ﬁnds ﬁre brightly turning and his guest amusing the ladies ll gawayne in fulﬁlment of his agreement kisses his host by christ quoth the other knight ye have caught much bliss i have hunted all this day and nought have i got but the skin of this foul fox the devil have the goods and that is full poor to pay such precious things ll after the usual evening entertainment gawayne retires to rest the next morning being new year day is cold and stormy snow falls and the dales are full of drift our knight in his bed locks his eyelids but full little he sleeps by each cock that crows he know s the hour and before he calls his chamberlain who quickly brings him his armour ll 2014 while gawayne clothed himself in his rich weeds he forgot not the lace the lady gift but with it doubly girded his loins he wore it not its rich ornaments but to save himself when it behoved him to suffer and safeguard against sword or knife ll having thanked his host and all the renowned assembly the great kindness he had experienced at their hands he steps into stirrups and strides aloft ll the project gutenberg ebook of sir gawayne and the green knight https drawbridge is let down and the broad gates unbarred and borne open upon both sides and the knight after commending the castle to christ passes thereout and goes on his way accompanied by his guide that should teach him to turn to that place where he should receive the blow they climb over cliffs where each hill had hat and until the next morn when they ﬁnd themselves on full high hill covered with snow the servant bids his master remain awhile saying i have brought you hither at this time and now ye are not far from that noted place that ye have so often enquired after the place that ye press to is esteemed full perilous and there dwells man in that waste the worst upon earth he is stiff and stern and loves to strike and greater is he than any man upon and his body is bigger than the best four in arthur house he keeps the green chapel there passes none by that place however proud in arms that he does not him to death with dint of his hand he is man immoderate and mercy uses be it churl or chaplain that by the chapel rides monk or or any man else it is pleasant to him to kill them to go alive himself wherefore i tell thee truly ye there ye be killed though ye had twenty lives to spend he has dwelt there long of yore and on ﬁeld much sorrow has wrought against his sore dints ye may not defend you ll 17 therefore good sir gawayne let the man alone and god sake go by some other path and then i shall hie home again i swear to you by 1 he only in part keeps to his covenant he holds back the god and all his saints that i will never say that ever ye attempted to ﬂee from any man gawayne thanks his guide his kindness but declares that to the green chapel he will go though the owner thereof be stern knave god can devise means to save his servants mary quoth the other since it pleases thee to lose thy life i will not hinder thee have thy helmet on thy head thy spear in thy hand and ride down this path by yon till thou be brought to the bottom of the valley then look little on the plain on thy left hand and thou shalt see in that slade the chapel itself and the burly knight that guards it ll 2148 now farewell gawayne the noble all the gold upon ground i would not go with thee nor bear thee fellowship through this wood foot farther thus having spoken he gallops away and leaves the knight alone gawayne now pursues his journey rides through the dale and looks about he sees signs of but only high and steep banks and the very shadows of the high woods seemed wild and distorted chapel however could he discover after while he sees round hill by the side of stream thither he goes alights and fastens his horse to the branch of tree he walks about the hill debating with himself what it might be it had hole in the one end and on each side and everywhere overgrown with grass but whether it was only an old cave or crevice of an old crag he could not tell ll now indeed quoth gawayne desert is here this oratory is ugly with herbs overgrown it is ﬁtting place the man in green to here his devotions after the devil manner now i feel it is the ﬁend the devil in my ﬁve wits that has covenanted with that he may destroy this is chapel of betide it it is the most cursed kirk that ever i came in with his helmet on his head and spear in his hand he roams up to the rock and then he hears from that high hill beyond the brook the project gutenberg ebook of sir gawayne and the green knight https noise lo it clattered in the cliff if one upon grindstone were grinding scythe it whirred like the water at mill and rushed and echoed terrible to hear though my life i forgo says gawayne noise shall cause to fear then he cried aloud who dwells in this place discourse with to hold now is good gawayne going right here if any brave wight will hie him hither either now or never ll abide quoth one on the bank above over his head and thou shalt have all in haste that i promised thee once soon there comes out of hole in the crag with fell weapon danish axe quite new the man in the green clothed at ﬁrst his legs locks and beard but now he is on foot and walks on the earth when he reaches the stream he hops over and boldly strides about he meets sir gawayne who tells him that he is quite ready to fulﬁl his part of the compact gawayne quoth that gome man may god preserve thee truly thou art welcome to my place thou hast timed thy travel true man should thou knowest the covenants made between us at this time that on new year day i should return thee thy blow we are now in this valley by ourselves and can we please ll have therefore thy helmet off thy head and here thy pay let us have more talk than when thou didst strike of f my head with single blow nay by god quoth gawayne i shall not begrudge thee thy will any harm that may happen but will stand still while thou strikest then he stoops little and shows his bare neck unmoved by any fear the green knight takes up his grim tool and with all his force raises it aloft if he meant utterly to destroy him the axe came gliding down gawayne shrank little with the shoulders from the sharp iron the other withheld his weapon and then reproved the prince with many proud words thou art not gawayne that is so good esteemed that never feared host by hill nor by vale now thou ﬂeest fear before thou feelest harm ll 2272 such cowardice of that knight did i never hear i never ﬂinched nor ﬂed when thou didst aim at in king arthur house my head ﬂew to my feet and yet i never ﬂed wherefore i deserve to be called the better man quoth gawayne i shunted once but will so more though my head fall on the stones but hasten and bring to the point deal my destiny and it out of hand i shall stand thee stroke and start more until thine axe has hit here my troth have at thee then said the other and heaves the axe aloft and looks savagely if he were mad he aims at the other mightily but withholds his hand ere it might hurt gawayne readily abides the blow without ﬂinching with any member and stood still stone or tree ﬁxed in rocky ground with hundred roots then merrily the other did speak since now thou hast thy heart whole it behoves to strike so take care of thy neck gawayne answers with great wroth thrash on thou ﬁerce man thou threatenest too long i believe thy own heart fails thee forsooth quoth the other since thou speakest so boldly i will longer delay ll then contracting both lips and brow he made ready to strike and let fall his axe on the bare neck of sir gawayne though he hammered ﬁercely he only severed the hide causing the blood to ﬂow when gawayne saw his blood on the snow he quickly seized his helmet and placed it on his head then he drew out his bright sword and thus the project gutenberg ebook of sir gawayne and the green knight https cease man of thy blow bid more i have received stroke in this place without opposition but if thou givest any more readily shall i requite thee of that be thou sure our covenant stipulates one stroke and therefore now cease the green knight resting on his axe looks on sir gawayne bold and fearless he there stood and then with loud voice thus addresses the knight bold knight be not so wroth man here has wronged thee ll 2339 i promised thee stroke and thou hast it so hold thee well pleased i could have dealt much worse with thee and caused thee much sorrow two blows i aimed at thee twice thou kissedst my fair wife but i struck thee not because thou restoredst them to according to agreement at the third time thou failedst and therefore i have given thee that tap that woven girdle given thee by my own wife belongs to i know well thy kisses thy conduct also and the wooing of my wife i wrought it myself i sent her to try thee and truly methinks thou art the most faultless man that ever on foot went still sir thou wert wanting in good faith but it proceeded from immorality thou being only desirous of saving thy life the less i blame thee gawayne stood confounded the blood rushed into his face and he shrank within himself very shame cur sed he cried be cowardice and covetousness both in you are villany and vice that virtue destroy then he takes off the girdle and throws it to the knight in green cursing his cowardice and covetousness the green knight laughing thus spoke thou hast confessed so clean and acknowledged thy faults that i hold thee pure thou hadst never forfeited since thou wast ﬁrst born i give thee sir the girdle token of thy adventure at the green chapel come now to my castle and we shall enjoy together the festivities of the new year ll nay forsooth quoth the knight but your kindness may god requite you commend to that courteous one your comely wife who with her crafts has beguiled but it is uncommon thing man to come to sorrow through women wiles so was adam beguiled with one and solomon with many samson was destroyed by delilah and david suffered much through bathsheba were indeed great bliss man to love them well and believe them not since the greatest upon earth were so beguiled methinks i should be excused but god reward you your girdle which i will ever wear in remembrance of my fault and when pride shall exalt look to this shall lessen it ll but since ye are the lord of yonder land from whom i have received so much honour tell truly your right name and i shall ask more questions quoth the other i am called bernlak hautdesert through might of morgain la fay who dwells in my house much has she learnt of merlin who knows all your knights at home she brought to your hall to essay the prowess of the round table she wrought this wonder to bereave you of your wits hoping to have grieved guenever and affrighted her to death by means of the man that spoke with his head in his hand before the high table she is even thine aunt arthur half sister wherefore come to thine aunt all my household love thee gawayne refuses to accompany the green knight and so with many embraces and kind wishes they one to his castle the other to arthur the project gutenberg ebook of sir gawayne and the green knight https passing through many wild ways our knight recovers from the wound in his neck and at last comes safe and sound to the court of king arthur great then was the joy of all the king and queen kiss their brave knight and make many enquiries about his journe he tells them of his adventures hiding the chance of the chapel the cheer of the knight the love of the lady and lastly of the lace groaning grief and shame he shows them the cut in his neck which he had received his unfaithfulness ll the king and his courtiers comfort the laugh loudly at his adventures and unanimously agree that those lords and ladies that belonged to the round table and each knight of the brotherhood should ever after wear bright green belt gawayne sake and he upon whom it was conferred honoured it evermore after thus in arthur time this adventure befell whereof the brutus books bear witness ll i need not say that the brutus books we possess not contain the legend here set forth though it is not much more improbable than some of the statements contained in them if the reader desires to know the relation in which this and the like stories stand to the original arthur legends he will ﬁnd it discussed in sir madden preface to his edition of syr gawayne which also contains sketch of the very different views taken of sir gawayne by the dif ferent romance writers into this and other literary questions i not enter here i have nothing to add to sir madden statements but in the text of the poem i have differed from him in some few readings which will be found noticed in the notes and glossary the manuscript is fast fading i am glad that the existence of the early english
