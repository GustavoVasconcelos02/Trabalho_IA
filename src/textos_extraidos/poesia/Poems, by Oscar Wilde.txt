soul unpainted with its mighty questionings but they are few and all romance has ﬂown and men can prophesy about the sun and lecture on his alone through waste void the soulless atoms run how from

river like ﬂame of blue keen an arrow ﬂies the water while the brown linnets in the greenwood sing year ago seems little time since last i saw that lordly southern clime where ﬂower and fruit to purple radiance blow and like bright lamps the fabled apples glow full spring it by rich ﬂowering vines dark and noble i rode at will the moist glad air was sweet the white road rang beneath my horse s feet and musing on ravenna s ancient name i watched the day till marked with wounds of ﬂame the turquoise sky to burnished gold was turned how my heart with boyish passion burned when far away across the sedge and mere i saw that holy city rising clear crowned with her crown of towers and on i galloped racing with the setting sun and ere the crimson after was passed i stood within ravenna s walls at last ii how strangely still sound of life or joy startles the air laughing pipes on his reed nor ever through the day comes the glad sound of children at their play sad and sweet and silent
