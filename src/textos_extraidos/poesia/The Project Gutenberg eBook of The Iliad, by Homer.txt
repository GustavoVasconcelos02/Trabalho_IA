verse or in rhyme is question in the decision of which man can ﬁnd difﬁculty who has ever duly considered what translation ought to be or who is in any degree practically acquainted with those very different kinds of versiﬁcation i will venture to assert that just translation of any ancient poet in rhyme is impossible human ingenuity can be equal to the task of closing every couplet with sounds homotonous expressing at the same time the full sense and only the full sense of his original the translator s ingenuity indeed in this case becomes itself snare and the readier he is at invention and expedient the more likely he is to be betrayed into the widest departures from the guide whom he professes to follow hence it has happened that although the public have long been in possession of an english homer by poet whose writings have done immortal honor to his country the demand of new one and especially in blank verse has been repeatedly and loudly made by some of the best judges and ablest writers of the present day i have contest with my predecessor none is supposable between performers on different instruments pope has surmounted all difﬁculties in his version of homer that it was possible to surmount in rhyme but he was fettered and his fetters were his choice accustomed always to rhyme he had formed to himself an ear which probably could not be much gratiﬁed by verse that wanted it and determined to encounter even impossibilities rather than abandon mode of writing in which he had excelled every body the sake of another to which unexercised in it he was he must have felt strong objections i number myself among the warmest admirers of pope an original writer and i allow him all the merit he can justly claim the translator of this chief of poets he has given us the tale of troy divine in smooth verse generally in correct and elegant language and in diction often highly poetical but his deviations are so many occasioned chieﬂy by the cause already mentioned that much he has done and valuable his work is on some accounts it was yet in the humble province of translator that i thought it possible even to fellow him with some advantage that he has sometimes altogether suppressed the sense of his author and has not seldom intermingled his own ideas with it is remark which on this occasion nothing but necessity should have extorted from but we differ sometimes so widely in our matter that unless this remark invidious it seems be premised i know not how to obviate suspicion on the one hand of careless oversight or of factitious embellishment on the other on this head therefore the english reader is to be admonished that the matter found in whether he like it or not is found also in homer and that the matter not found in how much soever he may admire it is found only in pope i have omitted nothing i have invented nothing there is indisputably wide difference between the case of an original writer in rhyme and translator in an original work the author is free if the rhyme be of difﬁcult attainment and he can not ﬁnd it in one direction he is at liberty to seek it in another the matter that will not accommodate itself to his occasions he may the project gutenberg ebook of the iliad by homer https such will but in translation such option is allowable the sense of the author is required and we not surrender it willingly even to the plea of necessity fidelity is indeed of the very essence of translation and the term itself implies it which reason if we suppress the sense of our original and force into its place our own we may call our work an imitation if we please or perhaps paraphrase but it is longer the same author only in different dress and therefore it is not translation should painter professing to draw the likeness of beautiful woman give her more or fewer features than belong to her and general cast of countenance of his own invention he might be said to have produced jeu d esprit curiosity perhaps in its way but by means the lady in question it will however be necessary to speak little more largely to this subject on which discordant opinions prevail even among good judges the free and the close translation have each their advocates but inconveniences belong to both the form er can hardly be true to the original author s style and manner and the latter is apt to be servile the one loses his peculiarities and the other his spirit were it possible therefore to ﬁnd an exact medium manner so close that it should let slip nothing of the text nor mingle any thing extraneous with it and at the same time so free to have an air of originality this seems precisely the mode in which an author might be best rendered i can assure my readers from my own experience that to discover this very delicate line is difﬁcult and to proceed by it when found through the whole length of poet voluminous homer nearly impossible i can only pretend to have endeavored it it is an opinion commonly received but like many others indebted its prevalence to mere want of examination that translator should imagine to himself the style which his author would probably have used had the language into which he is rendered been his own direction which wants nothing but practicability to recommend it suppose six persons equally qualiﬁed the task employed to translate the same ancient into their own language with this rule to guide them in the event it would be found that each had fallen on manner different from that of all the rest and by probable inference it would follow that none had fallen on the right on the whole therefore has been said the translation which partakes equally of ﬁdelity and liberality that is close but not so close to be servile free but not so free to be licentious promises fairest and my ambition will be sufﬁciently gratiﬁed if such of my readers are able and will take the pains to compare in this respect with homer shall judge that i have in any measure attained point so difﬁcult to energy and harmony two grand requisites in translation of this most energetic and most harmonious of all poets it is neither my purpose nor my wish should i be found deﬁcient in either or in both to shelter myself under an unﬁlial imputation of blame to my mother tongue our language is indeed less musical than the greek and there is language with which i am at all acquainted that is not but it is musical enough the purposes of melodious verse and if it seem to fail on whatsoever occasion in energy the blame is due not to itself but to the unskilful manager of it so long milton s works whether his prose or his verse shall exist so long there will be abundant proof that subject however important however sublime can demand greater force of expression than is within the compass of the english the project gutenberg ebook of the iliad by homer https have fear of judges familiar with original homer they need not be told that translation of him is an arduous enterprise and such entitled to some favor from these therefore i shall expect and shall not be disappointed considerable candor and allowance especially they will be candid and i believe that there are many such who have occasionally tried their own strength in this bow of ulysses they have not found it supple and pliable and with are perhaps ready to acknowledge that they could not always even approach with it the mark of their ambition but i would willingly were it possible obviate uncandid criticism because to answer it is lost labor and to receive it in silence has the appearance of stately reserve and to those therefore who shall be inclined to tell hereafter that my diction is often plain and unelevated i reply beforehand that i know it it would be absurd were it otherwise and that homer himself stands in the same predicament in fact it is one of his numberless excellences and point in which his judgment never fails him that he is grand and lofty always in the right place and knows infallibly how to rise and fall with his subject big words on small matters may serve pretty exact deﬁnition of the burlesque an instance of which they will ﬁnd in the battle of the frogs and mice but none in the iliad by others i expect to be told that my numbers though here and there tolerably smooth are not always such but have now and then an ugly hitch in their gait ungraceful in itself and inconvenient to the reader to this charge also i plead guilty but beg leave in alleviation of judgment to add that my limping lines are not numerous compared with those that limp not the truth is that not one of them all escaped but such they are they were all made such with wilful intention in poems of great length there is blemish more to be feared than sameness of numbers and every art is useful by which it may be avoided line rough in itself has yet its recommendations it saves the ear the pain of an irksome monotony and seems even to add greater smoothness to others milton whose ear and taste were exquisite has exempliﬁed in his paradise lost the effect of this practice frequently having mentioned milton i can not but add an observation on the similitude of his manner to that of homer it is such that person familiar with both can read either without being reminded of the other and it is in those breaks and pauses to which the numbers of the english poet are so much indebted both their dignity and variety that he chieﬂy copies the grecian but these are graces to which rhyme is not competent so broken it loses all its music of which any person may convince himself by reading page only of any of our poets anterior to denham waller and dryden translator of homer therefore seems directed by homer himself to the use of blank verse to that alone in which he can be rendered with any tolerable representation of his manner in this particular remark which i am naturally led to make by desire to conciliate if possible some who rather unreasonably partial to rhyme demand it on all occasions and seem persuaded that poetry in our language is vain attempt without it verse that claims to be verse in right of its metre only they judge to be such rather by courtesy than by kind on an apprehension that it costs the writer little trouble that he has only to give his lines their prescribed number of syllables and so far the mechanical part is concerned all is well were this true they would have reason on their side the author is certainly best entitled to applause who succeeds against the greatest difﬁculty and in verse that calls the most artiﬁcial management in the project gutenberg ebook of the iliad by homer https but the case is not they suppose to rhyme in our language demands great exertion of ingenuity but is always easy to person exercised in the practice witness the multitudes who rhyme but have other poetical pretensions let it be considered too how merciful we are apt to be to unclassical and indifferent language the sake of rhyme and we shall soon see that the labor lies principally on the other side many ornaments of easy purchase are required to atone the absence of this single recommendation it is not sufﬁcient that the lines of blank verse be smooth in themselves they must also be harmonious in the combination whereas the chief concern of the rhymist is to beware that his couplets and his sense be commensurate lest the regularity of his numbers should be too frequently at least interrupted trivial difﬁculty this compared with those which attend the poet unaccompanied by his bells he in order that he may be musical must exhibit all the variations he proceeds of which ten syllables are susceptible between the ﬁrst syllable and the last there is place at which he must not occasionally pause and the place of the pause must be perpetually shifted to effect this variety his attention must be given at one and the same time to the pauses he has already made in the period before him well to that which he is about to make and to those which shall succeed it on lighter terms than these is it possible that blank verse can be written which will not in the course of long work fatigue the ear past all endurance if it be easier therefore to throw ﬁve balls into the air and to catch them in succession than to sport in that manner with one only then may blank verse be more easily fabricated than rhyme and if to these labors we add others equally requisit style in general more elaborate than rhyme requires farther removed from the vernacular idiom both in the language itself and in the arrangement of it we shall not long doubt which of these two very different species of verse threatens the composer with most expense of study and contrivance i feel it unpleasant to appeal to my own experience but having other voucher at hand am constrained to it i afﬁrm so i have found i have dealt pretty largely in both kinds and have frequently written more verses in day with tags than i could ever write without them to what has been here said which whether it have been said by others or not i can not tell having never read any modern book on the subject i shall only add that to be poetical without rhyme is an argument of sound and classical constitution in any language word or two on the subject of the following translation and i have done my chief boast is that i have adhere d closely to my original convinced that every departure from him would be punished with the forfeiture of some grace or beauty which i could substitute equivalent the epithets that would consent to an english form i have preserved epithets others that would not i have melted into the context there are none i believe which i have not translated in one way or other though the reader will not ﬁnd them repeated so often most of them are in homer reason that need not be mentioned few persons of any consideration are introduced either in the iliad or odyssey by their own name only but their patronymic is given also to this ceremonial i have generally attended because it is circumstance of my author s manner homer never allots less than whole line to the introduction of speaker not even when the speech itself is longer than the line that leads it practice to which since he never departs from the project gutenberg ebook of the iliad by homer https must have been determined by some cogent reason he probably deemed it formality necessary to the majesty of his narration in this article therefore i have scrupulously adhered to my pattern considering these introductory lines heralds in procession important persons because employed to usher in persons more important than themselves it has been my point every where to be little verbose possible though at the same time my constant determination not to sacriﬁce my author s full meaning to an af fected brevity in the affair of style i have endeavored neither to creep nor to bluster author is so likely to betray his translator into both these faults homer though himself never guilty of either i have cautiously avoided all terms of new invention with an abundance of which persons of more ingenuity than judgment have not enriched our language but incumbered it i have also every where used an unabbreviated fullness of phrase most suited to the nature of the work and above all have studied perspicuity not only because verse is good little that wants it but because homer is the most perspicuous of all poets in all difﬁcult places i have consulted the best commentators and where they have differed or have given is often the case variety of solutions i have ever exercised my best judgment and selected that which appears at least to myself the most probable interpretation on this ground and on account of the ﬁdelity which i have already boasted i may venture i believe to recommend my work promising some usefulness to young students of the original the passages which will be least noticed and possibly not at all except by those who shall wish to ﬁnd at fault are those which have cost abundantly the most labor it is difﬁcult to kill sheep with dignity in modern language to ﬂay and to prepare it the table detailing every circumstance of the process difﬁcult also without sinking below the level of poetry to harness mules to wagon particularizing every article of their furniture straps rings staples and even the tying of the knots that kept all together homer who writes always to the eye with all his sublimity and grandeur has the minuteness of flemish painter but in what degree i have succeeded in my version either of these passages and such these or of others more buoyant and ground and especially of the most sublime is now submitted to the decision of the reader to whom i am ready enough to confess that i have not at all consulted their approbation who account nothing grand that is not turgid or elegant that is not bedizened with metaphor i purposely decline all declamation on the merits of homer because translator s praises of his author are liable to suspicion of dotage and because it were impossible to improve on those which this author has received already he has been the wonder of all countries that his works have ever reached even deiﬁed by the greatest names of antiquity and in some places actually worshipped and to say truth were it possible that mere man could entitle himself by of any kind to divine honors homer s astonishing powers seem to have given him the best pretensions i can not conclude without due acknowledgments to the best critic in homer i have ever met with the learned and ingenious fuseli unknown he was to when i entered on this arduous undertaking indeed to this moment i have never seen him he yet voluntarily and generously offered himself my revisor to his classical taste and just discernment i have been indebted the project gutenberg ebook of the iliad by homer https of many blemishes in my own work and of beauties which would otherwise have escaped in the original but his necessary avocations would not suffer him to accompany farther than to the latter books of the iliad circumstance which i fear my readers well myself will regret with too much reason 1 i have obligations likewise to many friends whose names were it proper to mention them here would great honor they have encouraged by their approbation have assisted with valuable books and have eased of almost the whole labor of transcribing and now i have only to regret that my pleasant work is ended to the illustrious greek i owe the smooth and easy ﬂight of many thousand hours he has been my companion at home and abroad in the study in the garden and in the ﬁeld and measure of success let my labors succeed they may will ever compensate to the loss of the innocent luxury that i have enjoyed translator of homer footnote some of the few notes subjoined to my translation of the odyssey are by fuseli who had short opportunity to peruse the mss while the iliad was printing they are marked with his the project gutenberg ebook of the iliad by homer https ace prep ared by cowper second edition soon after my publication of this work i began to prepare it second edition by an accurate revisal of the ﬁrst it seemed to that here and there perhaps slight alteration might satisfy the demands of some whom i was desirous to please and i comforted myself with the reﬂection that if i still failed to conciliate all i should yet have cause to account myself in singular degree unfortunate to please an unqualiﬁed judge an author must sacriﬁce too much and the attempt to please an uncandid one were altogether hopeless in one or other of these classes may be ranged all such objectors would deprive blank verse of one of its principal advantages the variety of its pauses together with all such deny the good effect on the whole of line now and then less harmonious than its fellows with respect to the pauses it has been afﬁrmed with an unaccountable rashness that homer himself has given an example of verse without them had this been true it would by means have concluded against the use of them in an english version of homer because in one language and in one species of metre that may be musical which in another would be found disgusting but the assertion is totally unfounded the pauses in homer s verse are so frequent and various that to name another poet if pauses are fault more faulty than he were perhaps impossible it may even be questioned if single passage of ten lines ﬂowing with uninterrupted smoothness could be singled out from all the thousands that he has left us he frequently pauses at the ﬁrst word of the line when it consists of three or more syllables not seldom when of two and sometimes even when of one only in this practice he was followed was observed in my preface to the ﬁrst edition by the author of the paradise lost an example inimitable indeed but which writer of english heroic verse without rhyme can neglect with impunity similar to this is the objection which proscribes absolutely the occasional use of line irregularly constructed when horace censured lucilius his lines incomposite pede currentes he did not mean to say that he was chargeable with such in some instances or even in many then the censure would have been equally applicable to himself but he designed by that expression to characterize all his writings the censur therefore was just lucilius wrote at time when the roman verse had not yet received its polish and instead of introducing artfully his rugged lines and to serve particular purpose had probably seldom and never but by accident composed smooth one such has been the versiﬁcation of the earliest poets in every country children lisp at ﬁrst and stammer but in time their speech becomes ﬂuent and if they are well taught harmonious homer himself is not invariably regular in the construction of his verse had he been so eustathius an excellent critic and warm admirer of homer had never afﬁrmed that some of his lines want head some tail and others middle some begin with word that is neither dactyl nor spondee some conclude with dactyl and in the intermediate part he sometimes deviates equally from the the project gutenberg ebook of the iliad by homer https i confess that instances of this sort are rare but they are surely though few sufﬁcient to warra nt sparing use of similar license in the present day unwilling however to seem obstinate in both these particulars i conformed myself in some measure to these objections though unconvinced myself of their propriety several of the rudest and most unshapely lines i composed anew and several of the pauses least in use i displaced the sake of an easier this was the state of the work after the revisal given it about seven years since between that revisal and the present considerable time intervened and the effect of long discontinuance was that i became more dissatisﬁed with it myself than the most difﬁcult to be pleased of all my judges not the sake of few uneven lines or unwonted pauses but reasons far more substantial the diction seemed to in many passages either not sufﬁciently elevated or deﬁcient in the grace of ease and in others i found the sense of the original either not adequately expressed or misapprehended many elisions still remained unsoftened the compound epithets i found not always happily combined and the same sometimes too frequently repeated there is end of passages in homer which must creep unless they are lifted yet in such all embellis hment is out of the question the hero puts on his clothes or refreshes himself with food and wine or he yokes his steed takes journey and in the evening preparation is made his repose to give relief to subjects prosaic these without seeming unreasonably tumid is extremely difﬁcult pope much abridges some of them and others he omits but neither of these liberties was compat ible with the nature of my undertaking these therefore and many similar to these have been somewhat to their advantage i hope but not even now entirely to my satisfaction the lines have more natural movement the pauses are fewer and less stately the expression easy i could make it without meanness and these were all the improvements that i could give them the elisions i believe are all cured with only one exception an alternative proposes itself to modern versiﬁer from which there is escape which occurs perpetually and which choose he may presents him always with an evil i mean in the instance of the particle the when this particle precedes vowel shall he melt it into the substantive or leave the hiatus open both practices are offensive to delicate ear the particle absorbed occasions harshness and the open vowel vacuity equally inconvenient sometimes therefore to leave it open and sometimes to ingraft it into its adjunct seems most advisable this course pope has taken whose authority recommended it to though of the two evils i have most frequently chosen the elision the least compound epithets have obtained so long in the poetical language of our country that i employed them without fear or scruple to have abstained from them in blank verse translation of homer who abounds with them and from whom our poets probably ﬁrst adopted them would have been strange indeed but though the genius of our language favors the formation of such words almost much that of the greek it happens sometimes that grecian compound either can not be rendered in english at all or at best but awkwardly this reason and because i found that some readers much disliked them i have expunged many retaining according to my best judgment the most eligible only and making less frequent the repetitions even of the project gutenberg ebook of the iliad by homer https know not that i can add any thing material on the subject of this last revisal unless it be proper to give the reason why the iliad though greatly altered has under gone much fewer alterations than the odyssey the true reason i believe is this the iliad demanded my utmost possible exertions it seemed to meet like an ascent almost perpendicular which could not be surm ounted at less cost than of all the labor that i could bestow on it the odyssey on the contrary seemed to resemble an open and level country through which i might travel at my ease the latter therefore betrayed into some negligence which though little conscious of it at the time on an accurate search i found had left many disagreeable ef fects behind it i now leave the work to its fate another may labor hereafter in an attempt of the same kind with more success but more industriously i believe none ever the project gutenberg ebook of the iliad by homer https ace by johnson chaplain to the bishop of peterborough i have other pretensions to the honorable name of editor on this occasion than faithful transcriber of the manuscript and diligent corrector of the press which are doubtless two of the very humblest employments in that most extensive province i have wanted the ability to attempt any thing higher and fortunately the reader i have also wanted the presumption what however i can i will instead of critical remark i will furnish him with anecdote he shall trace from beginning to end the progress of the following work and in proportion i have the happiness to engage his attention i shall merit the name of fortunate editor it was in the darkest season of most calamitous depression of his spirits that i was summoned to the house of my inestimable friend the translator in the month of january he had happily completed revisal of his homer and was thinking of the preface to his new edition when all his satisfaction in the one and whatever he had projected the other in moment vanished from his mind he had fallen into deplorable illness and though the foremost wish of my heart was to lessen the intenseness of his misery i was utterly unable to af ford him any aid i had however pleasing though melancholy opportunity of tracing his recent footsteps in the field of troy and in the palace of ithaca he had materially altered both the iliad and odyssey and so far my ability allowed to judge they were each of them greatly improved he had also at the request of his bookseller interspersed the two poems with copious notes the most part translations of the ancient scholia and gleaned at the cost of many valuable hours from the pages of barnes clarke and villoisson it has been constant subject of regret to the admirers of the task that the exercise of such marvelous original powers should have been so long suspended by the drudgery of translation and in this view their quarrel with the illustrious greek will be doubtless extended to his commentators 1 during two long years from this most anxious period the translation continued it was and though in the hope of its being able to divert his melancholy i had attempted more than once to introduce it to its author i was every time painfully obliged to desist but in the summer of when he had resided with in norfolk twelve miserable months the introduction long wished took place to my inexpressible aston ishment and joy i surprised him one morning with the iliad in his hand and with an excess of delight which i am still more unable to describe i the next day discovered that he had been ere i to mention one of the happiest moments of my life it might be that which introduced to the following lines mistaken meanings corrected admonente wakeﬁeld the project gutenberg ebook of the

was this i received copy of the iliad and odyssey of pope then recently published by the editor above mentioned with illustrative and critical notes of his own it commend ed cowper s translation in the preface and occasionally pointed out its merits in the notes i was careful to place it in his way though it was more from habit of experiment which i had contracted than from hopes of success but what fortunate circumstance was the arrival of this work and by what name worthy of its inﬂuence shall i call it in the mouth of an indifferent person it might be chance but in mine whom it rendered so peculiarly happy common gratitude requires that it should be providence i watched him with an indescribable interest in his progress i had the satisfaction to ﬁnd that after few mornings given to promiscuous correction and to frequent perusal of the mentioned notes he was evidently settling on the sixteenth book this he went regularly through and the fruits of an application so happily resumed were one day with another about sixty new lines but with the end of the sixteenth book he had closed the corrections of the year an excursion to the coast which immediately followed though it promised an accession of strength to the body could not fail to interfere with the pursuits of the mind it was therefore with much less surprise than regret that i saw him relinquish the tale of troy divine such was the prelude to the last revisal which in the month of january cowper was persuaded to undertake and to faithful copy i trust of which i have at this time the honor to conduct the reader but it may not be amiss to observe that with regard to the earlier books of the iliad it was less revisal of the altered text than of the text it stands in the ﬁrst edition though the interleaved copy was always at hand and in the multitude of its altered places could hardly fail to offer some things worthy to be preserved but which the ravages of illness and the lapse of time might have utterly effaced from his mind i could not often persuade the translator to consult it i was theref ore induced in the course of transcribing to compare the two revisals i went along and to plead the continuance of the ﬁrst correction when it the project gutenberg ebook of the iliad by homer https better than the last this however but seldom occurred and the practice at length was completely left off by his consenting to receive into the number of the books which were daily laid open before him the interleaved copy to which i allude at the end of the ﬁrst six books of the iliad the arrival of spring brought the usual interruptions of exercise and air which increased the summer advanced to degree so unfavorable to the progress of homer that in the requisite attention to their salutary claims the revisal was at one time altogether at stand only four books were added in the course of nine months but opportunity returning the winter set in there were added in less than seven weeks four more and thus ended the year the spring that succeeded was happier spring so it led to happier summer we had longer air and exercise alone but exercise and homer hand in hand he even followed us thrice to the sea and whether our walks were they were always within hearing of his magic song about the middle of this busy summer the revisal of the iliad was brought to close and on the very next

sufferings of my excellent relation its progress in our private hours was singularly medicinal to his mind may its presentment to the public prove not less conducive to the honor of the departed author who has every claim to my veneration copious life of the poet is already in the press from the pen of his intimate friend hayley it is unnecessary to enter on such extensive commendation of his character my own intimacy with him might suggest but i hope the reader will kindly allow the privilege of indulging in some degree the feelings of my heart by applying to him in the close of this preface an expressive verse borrowed from homer which he inscr ibed himself with some little variation on bust of his grecian favorite footnote very few signatures had at this time been afﬁxed to the

s edition it is incumbent upon the present editor to state the reasons which have induced him between two editions of cowper s homer differing so materially from each other that they might almost be deemed dif ferent versions to prefer the ﬁrst whoever has perused the translator s letters must have perceived that he had considered with ordinary care the scheme of his versiﬁcation and that when he resolved upon altering it in second edition it was in deference to the opinion of others it seems to the editor that cowper s own judgment is entitled to more respect than that of any or all his critics and that the version which he composed when his facultie s were most active and his spirits least subject to depression in the happiest part of his life not to be superseded by revisal or rather reconstruction which was undertaken three years before his death not like the ﬁrst translation pleasant work an innocent luxury the cheerful and delightful occupation of hope and ardor and ambition hopeless employment task to which he gave all his miserable days and often many hours of the night seeking to beguile the sense of utter wretchedness by altering if the sake of alteration the editor has been conﬁrmed in this opinion by the concurrence of every person with whom he has communicated on the subject among others he takes the liberty of mentioning cary whose authority upon such question is of especial weight the translator of dante being the only one of our countrymen who has ever executed translation of equal magnitude and not less difﬁculty with the same perfect ﬁdelity and admirable skill in support of this determination the case of tasso may be cited curiously in point the great italian poet altered his jerusalem like cowper against his own judgment in submission

which there seems to have been many in and about troy these temples were schools of art and prove the dorians to have been both intellectual and powerful homer was an ionian and therefore not deeply acquainted with the nature of the dorian god but to mind like his the god of people so cultivated and associated with what was most grand in art must have been an imposing being and we ﬁnd him so represented throughout the iliad he appears and acts with splendor and effect but always against the greeks from mere partiality to hector it would perhaps be too much to say that in this partiality to hector we detect the spirit of the dorian worship the only paganism of antiquity that tended to perfect the apollo being the expression of the moral harmony of the universe and the great spirit of the dorian culture being to make perfect man an incarnation of the κοσμος this homer could only have known intuitively in making apollo author of the plague he was confounded with helios which was

their misery and exhorts them to shun it thus he endeavors to work by the art of general application by religion by interest and the insinuation of danger homer is frequently eloquent in his silence

it is manifest that the idea placed in combination with certain events gave birth to the story so far relates to the god we have not yet the means of ascertaining whether it is to be regarded

solitude can alone conquer them but to leave him this gloriﬁcation entirely unmixed with sorrow the grecian sense of moderation forbids the deepest anguish must mingle with his consciousness of fame

wedded to the mortal peleus saved zeus by calling up the giant briareus or ægæon to his rescue why it was ægæon is explained by the fact that this was great who formed the subject of fables at poseidonian corinth where even the himself was called ægæon who moreover was worshipped at several places in eubœa the seat of poseidon ægæus and whom the theogony calls the of poseidon and most of

the earliest times of which we have any record down to the introduction of christianity and even after that period it was observed by the chris tians during the middle ages its origin seems to have been the same that of sacriﬁces viz the belief that the gods were susceptible of inﬂuence in their conduct towards men these gifts were sometimes very costly but often nothing more than locks of hair cut from the head of the votary diomede had knowingly wounded and insulted the deities he therefore met glaucus with superstitious fear that he might be some deity in human shape this feeling brought

argument with great strength we see says he brother forgive the murder of his brother father that of his son but achilles will not forgive the injury offered him by taking away one captive woman the character of achilles is well sustained in all his speeches to ulysses he returns ﬂat denial and threatens to leave the trojan shore in the morning to phœnix his answer is more gentle after ajax has

mortal but from the project gutenberg ebook of the iliad by homer https whole passage is inimitably just and beautiful we see ajax slowly retreating between two armies and even with look repulse the one and protect the other every line resembles ajax the character of stubborn and undaunted warrior is perfectly maintained he compares him ﬁrst to the lion his undaunted spirit in ﬁghting and then to the ass his stubborn slowness in retreating in the latter comparison there are many points of resemblance that enliven the image the havoc he makes in the ﬁeld is represented by the tearing and trampling down the harvests and we see the bulk strength and obstinancy of the hero when the trojans in respect to him are compared to the troops of boys that impotently endeavor to drive him away it must be borne in mind that among the people of the east an ass was beast upon which kings and princes might ride with dignity though the resentment of achilles would not permit him to be an actor in the ﬁeld yet his love of war inclines him to be spectator the poet did not intend to draw the character of perfect man in achilles he makes him delighted with the destruction of the greeks because it gratiﬁed his revenge that resentment which is the subject of the poem still presides over every other feeling even the love of his country he begins now to pity his countrymen yet he seems gratiﬁed by
