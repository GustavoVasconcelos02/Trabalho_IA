necessary to human existence from these contraries spring what the religious call good and evil good is the passive that obeys reason evil is the active springing from energy good is heaven evil is hell the voice of the devil all bibles or sacred codes have been the cause of the following errors that man has two real existing principles body and soul that energy called evil is alone from the body and that reason called good is alone from the soul that god will torment man in eternity following his energies but the following contraries to these are true man has body distinct from his soul that called body is portion of soul discerned by the ﬁve senses the chief inlets of soul in this age energy is the only life and is from the body and reason is the bound or outward circumference of energy energy is eternal delight those who restrain desire so because theirs is weak enough to be restrained and the restrainer or reason usurps its place and governs the unwilling and being restrained it by degrees becomes passive till it is only the shadow of desire the history of this is written in paradise lost and the governor or reason is called messiah and the original archangel or possessor of the command of the heavenly host is called the devil or satan and his children are called sin and death but in the book of job milton s messiah is called satan this history has been adopted by both parties it indeed appeared to reason if desire was cast out but the devil s account is that the messiah fell and formed heaven of what he stole from the abyss this is shown in the gospel where he prays to the father to send the comforter or desire that reason may have ideas to build on the jehovah 7 8 9 10 the project gutenberg ebook of the marriage of heaven and hell by

holy ghost vacuum reason milton wrote in fetters when he wrote of angels and god and at liberty when of devils and hell is because he was true poet and of the devil s party without knowing it memorable fancy i was walking among the ﬁres of hell delighted with the enjoyments of genius which to angels look like torment and insanity i collected some of their proverbs thinking that the sayings used in nation mark its character so the proverbs of hell show the nature of infernal wisdom better than any description of buildings or garments when i came home on the abyss of the ﬁve senses where steep frowns over the present world i saw mighty devil folded in black clouds hovering on the sides of the rock with corroding ﬁres he wrote the following sentence now perceived by the minds of men and read by them on earth how you know but every bird that cuts the airy way is an immense world of delight closed by your senses ﬁve proverbs of hell in learn in harvest teach in winter enjoy drive

in its cradle than nurse unacted desires where man is not nature is barren truth can never be told so to be understood and not to be believed enough or too much the ancient poets animated all sensible objects with gods or geniuses calling them by the names and adorning them with properties of woods rivers mountains lakes cities nations and whatever their enlarged and numerous senses could perceive and particularly they studied the genius of each city and country placing it under its mental deity till system 18 19 20 the project gutenberg ebook of the marriage of heaven and hell by william blake https formed which some took advantage of and enslaved the vulgar by attempting to realize or abstract the mental deities from their objects thus began priesthood choosing forms of worship from poetic tales and at length they pronounced that the gods had ordered such things thus men forgot that all deities reside in the human breast memorable fancy the prophets isaiah and ezekiel dined with and i asked them how they dared so roundly to assert that god spoke to them and whether they did not think at the time that they would be misunderstood and so be the cause of imposition isaiah answered i saw god nor heard any in ﬁnite organical perception but my senses discovered the inﬁnite in everything and i was then persuaded and remained conﬁrmed that the voice of honest indignation is the voice of god i cared not consequences but then i asked does ﬁrm persuasion that thing is so make it so he replied all poets believe that it does and in ages of imagination this ﬁrm persuasion removed mountains but many are not capable of ﬁrm persuasion of then ezekiel said the philosophy of the east taught the ﬁrst principles of human perception some nations held one principle the origin and some another we of israel taught that the poetic genius you now call it was the ﬁrst principle and all the others merely derivative which was the cause of our despising the priests and philosophers of other countries and prophesying that all gods would at last be proved to originate in ours and to be the tributaries of the poetic genius it was this that our great poet king david desired so fervently and invokes so pathetically saying by this he conquers enemies and governs kingdoms and we so loved our god that we cursed in his name all the deities of surrounding nations and asserted that they had rebelled from these opinions the vulgar came to think that all nations would at last be subject to the jews this said he like all ﬁrm persuasions is come to pass all nations believe the jews code and worship the jews god and what greater subjection can be i heard this with some wonder and must confess my own conviction after dinner i asked isaiah to favour the world with his lost works he said none of equal value was lost ezekiel said the same of his i also asked isaiah what made him go naked and barefoot three years he answered the same that made our friend diogenes the 21 22 23 24 the project gutenberg ebook of the marriage of heaven and hell by william blake https then asked ezekiel why he ate dung and lay so long on his right and left side he answered the desire of raising other men into perception of the inﬁnite this the north american tribes practise and is he honest who resists his genius or conscience only the sake of present ease or gratiﬁcation the ancient tradition that the world will be consumed in ﬁre at the end of six thousand years is true i have heard from hell the cherub with his ﬂaming sword is hereby commanded to leave his guard at the tree of life and when he does the whole creation will be consumed and appear inﬁnite and holy whereas it now appears ﬁnite and corrupt this will come to pass by an improvement of sensual enjoyment but ﬁrst the notion that man has body distinct from his soul is to be expunged this i shall by printing in the infernal method by corrosives which in hell are salutary and medicinal melting apparent surfaces away and displaying the inﬁnite which was hid if the doors of perception were cleansed everything would appear to man it is inﬁnite man has closed himself up till he sees all things through narrow chinks of his cavern memorable fancy i was in in hell and saw the method in which knowledge is transmitted from generation to generation in the ﬁrst chamber was clearing away the rubbish from cave s mouth within number of dragons were hollowing the cave in the second chamber was viper folding round the rock and the cave and others adorning it with gold silver and precious stones in the third chamber was an eagle with wings and feathers of air he caused the inside of the cave to be inﬁnite around were numbers of like men who built palaces in the immense cliffs in the fourth chamber were lions of ﬂaming ﬁre raging around and melting the metals into living ﬂuids in the ﬁfth chamber were unnamed forms which cast the metals into the expanse there they were received by men who occupied the sixth chamber and took the forms of books and were arranged in libraries 25 26 27 28 the project gutenberg ebook of the marriage of heaven and hell by william blake https giants who formed this world into its sensual existence and now seem to live in it in chains are in truth the causes of its life and the sources of all activity but the chains are the cunning of weak and tame minds which have power to resist energy according to the proverb the weak in courage is strong in thus one portion of being is the proliﬁc the other the devouring to the devourer it seems if the producer was in his chains but it is not so he only takes portions of existence and fancies that the whole but the proliﬁc would cease to be proliﬁc unless the devourer sea received the excess of his delights some will say is not god alone the proliﬁc i answer god only acts and is in existing beings or these two classes of men are always upon earth and they should be enemies whoever tries to reconcile them seeks to destroy existence religion is an endeavour to reconcile the two christ did not wish to unite but to separate them in the parable of sheep and goats and he says i came not to send peace but messiah or satan or tempter was formerly thought to be one of the antediluvians who are our energies memorable fancy an angel came to and said pitiable foolish young man horrible dreadful state consider the hot burning dungeon thou art preparing thyself to all eternity to which thou art going in such i said perhaps you will be willing to show my eternal lot and we will contemplate together upon it and see whether your lot or mine is most so he took through stable and through church and down into the church vault at the end of which was mill through the mill we went and came to cave down the winding cavern we groped our tedious way till void boundless nether sky appeared beneath us and we held by the roots of trees and hung over this immensity but i said if you please we will commit ourselves to this void and see whether providence is here also if you will not i but he answered not presume young man but we here remain behold thy lot which will soon appear when the darkness passes 29 30 31 32 the project gutenberg ebook of the marriage of heaven and hell by william blake https i remained with him sitting in the twisted root of an oak he was suspended in fungus which hung with the head downward into the deep by degrees we beheld the inﬁnite abyss ﬁery the smoke of burning city beneath us at an immense distance was the sun black but shining round it were ﬁery tracks on which revolved vast spiders crawling after their prey which ﬂew or rather swum in the inﬁnite deep in the most terriﬁc shapes of animals sprung from corruption and the air was full of them and seemed composed of them these are devils and are called powers of the air i now asked my companion which was my eternal lot he said between the black and white but now from between the black and white spiders cloud and ﬁre burst and rolled through the deep blackening all beneath so that the nether deep grew black sea and rolled with terrible noise beneath us was nothing now to be seen but black tempest till looking east between the clouds and the waves we saw cataract of blood mixed with ﬁre and not many stones throw from us appeared and sunk again the scaly fold of monstrous serpent at last to the east distant about three degrees appeared ﬁery crest above the waves slowly it reared like ridge of golden rocks till we discovered two globes of crimson ﬁre from which the sea ﬂed away in clouds of smoke and now we saw it was the head of leviathan his forehead was divided into streaks of green and purple like those on tiger s forehead soon we saw his mouth and red gills hang just above the raging foam tinging the black deeps with beams of blood advancing toward us with all the fury of spiritual existence my friend the angel climbed up from his station into the mill i remained alone and then this appearance was more but i found myself sitting on pleasant bank beside river by moonlight hearing harper who sung to the harp and his theme was the man who never alters his opinion is like standing water and breeds reptiles of the but i arose and sought the mill and there i found my angel who surprised asked how i escaped i answered all that we saw was owing to your metaphysics when you ran away i found myself on bank by moonlight hearing harper but now we have seen my eternal lot shall i show you yours he laughed at my proposal but i by force suddenly caught him in my arms and ﬂew westerly through the night till we were elevated above the earth s shadow then i ﬂung myself with him directly into the body of the sun here i clothed myself in white and taking in my hand swedenborg s volumes sunk from the glorious clime and passed all the planets till we came to saturn here i stayed to rest and then leaped into the void between saturn and the ﬁxed stars here said i is your lot in this space if space it may be soon we saw the stable and the church and i took him to the altar and opened the bible and lo it was deep pit into which i descended driving the angel before soon we saw seven houses of brick one we entered in it were number of monkeys baboons and all of that species 33 34 35 36 the project gutenberg ebook of the marriage of heaven and hell by william blake https by the middle grinning and snatching at one another but withheld by the shortness of their chains however i saw that they sometimes grew numerous and then the weak were caught by the strong and with grinning aspect ﬁrst coupled with and then devoured by plucking off ﬁrst one limb and then another till the body was left helpless trunk this after grinning and kissing it with seeming fondness they devoured too and here and there i saw one savourily picking the ﬂesh off his own tail the stench terribly annoyed us both we went into the mill and i in my hand brought the skeleton of body which in the mill was aristotle s analytics so the angel said thy phantasy has imposed upon and thou oughtest to be i answered we impose on one another and it is but lost time to converse with you whose works are only i have always found that angels have the vanity to speak of themselves the only wise this they with conﬁdent insolence sprouting from systematic reasoning thus swedenborg boasts that what he writes is new though it is only the contents or index of already published books man carried monkey about show and because he was little wiser than the monkey grew vain and conceived himself much wiser than seven men it is so with swedenborg he shows the folly of churches and exposes hypocrites till he imagines that all are religious and himself the single one on earth that ever broke net now hear plain fact swedenborg has not written one new truth now hear another he has written all the old falsehoods and now hear the reason he conversed with angels who are all religious and conversed not with devils who all hate religion he was incapable through his conceited notions thus swedenborg s writings are recapitulation of all superﬁcial opinions and an analysis of the more sublime but further have now another plain fact any man of mechanical talents may from the writings of paracelsus or jacob behmen produce ten thousand volumes of equal value with swedenborg s and from those of dante or shakespeare an inﬁnite number but when he has done this let him not say that he knows better than his master he only holds candle in memorable fancy 37 38 39 40 the project gutenberg ebook of the marriage of heaven and hell by william blake https i saw devil in ﬂame of ﬁre who arose before an angel that sat on cloud and the devil uttered these words the worship of god is honouring his gifts in other men each according to his genius and loving the greatest men best those who envy or calumniate great men hate god there is other the angel hearing this became almost blue but mastering himself he grew yellow and at last and smiling and then replied thou idolater is not god one and is not he visible in jesus christ and has not jesus christ given his sanction to the law of ten commandments and are not all other men fools sinners and nothings the devil answered bray fool in mortar with wheat yet shall not his folly be beaten out of him if jesus christ is the greatest man you ought to love him in the greatest degree now hear how he has given his sanction to the law of ten commandments did he not mock at the sabbath and so mock the sabbath s god murder those who were murdered because of him turn away the law from the woman taken in adultery steal the labour of others to support him bear false witness when he omitted making defence before pilate covet when he prayed his disciples and when he bid them shake off the dust of their feet against such refused to lodge them i tell you virtue can exist without breaking these ten commandments jesus was all virtue and acted from impulse not from when he had so spoken i beheld the angel who stretched out his arms embracing the ﬂame of ﬁre and he was consumed and arose elijah angel who is now become devil is my
