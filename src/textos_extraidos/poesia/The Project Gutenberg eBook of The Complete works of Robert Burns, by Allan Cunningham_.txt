the illustrious names of his native land those who bear the honours and inherit the virtue s of their ancestors the poetic genius of my country found the prophetic bard elijah did the plough and threw her inspiring mantle over she bade sing the loves the joys the rural scenes and rural pleasures of my native soil in my native tongue i tuned my wild artless notes she inspired she whispered to come to this ancient metropolis of caledonia and lay my songs under your honoured protection i now obey her dictates though much indebted to your goodness i not approach you my lords and gentlemen in the

lords and gentlemen your most devoted humble servant rober t burns edinburgh april 4 pref ace i can not give to my country this edition of one of its favourite poets without stating that i have deliberately omitted several pieces of verse ascribed to burns by other editors who too hastily and i think on insufﬁcient testimony admitted them among his works if i am unable to share in the hesitation expressed by one of them on the authorsh ip of the stanzas on pastoral poetry i can little share in the feelings with which they have intruded into the charmed circle of his poetry such compositions lines on the ruins of lincluden college verses on the destruction of the woods of drumlanrig verses viii ix the project gutenberg ebook of the complete works of robert burns by allan cunningham https on marble slab in the woods of aberfeldy and those entitled the tree of liberty these productions with the exception of the last were never seen by any one even in the handwriting of burns and are one and all wanting in that original vigour of language and manliness of sentiment which distinguish his poetry with respect to the tree of liberty in particular subject dear to the heart of the bard can any one conversant with his genius imagine that he welcomed its growth or celebrated its fruit with such capon craws these upo this tree there grows sic fruit its virtues can tell man it raises man aboon the brute it mak s him ken himsel man gif ance the peasant taste bit he s greater than lord man an wi beggar shares mite he can af ford there are eleven stanzas of which the best compared with the man s man that of burns sounds like cracked pipkin against the heroic clang of damascus blade that it is extant in the handwriting of the poet can not be taken proof that it is his own composition against the internal testimony of utter want of all the marks by which we know so to speak which is visible on all that ever came from his pen misled by his handwriting i inserted in my former edition of his works an epitaph beginning here lies rose budding rose the composition of shenstone and which is to be found in the of owen it is not included in every edition of that poet s acknowledged works burns who was an admirer of his genius had it seems copied it with his own hand and hence my error if i hesitated about the exclusion of the tree of liberty and its three false brethren i could have scruples regarding the ﬁne song of evan banks claimed and justly miss williams by sir walter scott or the humorous song called shelah neal composed by the late sir alexander boswell when i have stated that i have arranged the poems the songs and the letters of burns nearly possible in the order in which they were written that i have omitted piece of either verse or prose which bore the impress of his hand nor included any by which his high reputati on would likely be impaired i have said all that seems necessary to be said save that the following letter came too late insertion in its proper place it is characteristic and worth place anywhere allan cunningham to archibald laurie mossgiel 13th nov dear s ir i have along with this sent the two volumes of

in the shire of ayr on the 25th day of january natural mark of the event sudden storm at the same moment swept the land the of the frail dwelling gave way and the was hurried through tempest of wind and sleet to the shelter of securer hovel he was the eldest born of three sons and three daughters his father william who in his native kincardineshire wrote his name burness was bred gardener and sought work in the west but coming from the lands of the noble family of the keiths suspicion accompanied him that he had been rebellion was softly the suspicion fatal to his hopes of rest and bread in so loyal district and it was only when the clergyman of his native parish certiﬁed his loyalty that he was permitted to toil this suspicion of jacobitism revived by burns himself when he rose into fame seems not to have inﬂuenced either the feelings or the tastes of agnes brown young woman on the doon whom he wooed and married in december 1757 when he was years old to support her he leased small piece of ground which he converted into nursery and garden and to shelter her he raised with his own hands that humble abode where she gave birth to her eldest son the elder burns was silent austere man who endured idle gaiety nor indecorous language while he relaxed somewhat the hard stern creed of the covenanting times he enforced all the well observances which the calvinistic kirk requires and scrupled at promiscuous dancing the staid of our own day scruple at the waltz his wife was of milder mood she was blest with singular fortitude of temper was devout of heart she was calm of mind and loved while busied in her household concerns to sweeten the bitterer moments of life by chanting the songs and ballads of her country of which her store was great the garden and nursery prospered so much that he was induced to widen his views and by the help of his kind landlord the laird of doonh olm and the more questionable aid of borrowed xxiii the project gutenberg ebook of the complete works of robert burns by allan cunningham https he entered upon neighbouring farm named mount oliphant extending to an hundred acres this was in 1765 but the land was hungry and sterile the seasons proved rainy and rough the toil was certain the reward unsure when to his sorrow the laird of generous ferguson the strict terms of the lease well the rent were exacted by harsh factor and with his wife and children he was obliged after losing struggle of six years to relinquish the farm and seek shelter on the grounds of lochlea some ten miles off in the parish of tarbolton when in men s characters were in the hands of his eldest son the scoundrel factor sat that lasting portrait of insolence and wrong in the t wa in this new farm william burns seemed to strike root and thrive he was strong of body and ardent of mind every day brought increase of vigour to his three sons who though very young already put their hands to the plough the and the ﬂail but it seemed that nothing which he undertoo k was decreed in the end to prosper after four seasons of prosperity change ensued the farm was far from cheap the gains under any lease were then so little that the loss of few pounds was ruinous to farmer bad seed and wet seasons had their usual inﬂuence the gloom of hermits and the moil of slaves the poet alluding to those days said were endured to purpose when to crown all difference arose between the landlord and the tenant to the terms of the lease and the early days of the poet and the declining years of his father were harassed by disputes in which sensitive minds are sure to suf fer amid these labours and disputes the poet s father remembered the worth of religious and moral instruction he took part of this upon himself in lochlea wore the sober looks of sunday he read the bible and explained intelligent peasants are accustomed to the sense when dark or difﬁcult he loved to discuss the spiritual meanings and gaze on the mystical splendours of the revelations he was aided in these labours ﬁrst by the schoolmaster of near the doon secondly by john murdoch student of divinity who undertook to teach arithmetic grammar french and latin to the boys of lochlea and the sons of ﬁve neighboring farmers murdoch who was an enthusiast in learning much of pedant and such judge of genius that he thought wit should always be laughing and poetry wear an eternal smile performed his task well he found robert to be quick in apprehension and not afraid to study when knowledge was the reward he taught him to turn verse into its natural prose order to supply all the ellipses and not to desist till the sense was clear and plain he also in their walks told him the names of different objects both in latin and french and though his knowledge of these languages never amounted to much he approached the grammar of the english tongue through the former which was of material use to him in his poetic compositions burns was even in those early days sort of enthusiast in all that concerned the glory of scotland he used to fancy himself soldier of the days of the wallace and the bruce loved to strut after the and the drum and read of the bloody struggles of his country freedom and existence till scottish prejudice he says was poured into my veins which will boil there till the of life are shut in eternal in this mood of mind burns was unconsciously approaching the land of poesie in addition to the histories of the wallace and the bruce he found on the shelves of his neighbours not only whole bodies of divinity and sermons without limit but the works of some of the best english well scottish poets together with songs and ballads innumerable on these he loved to pore whenever moment of leisure came nor was verse his sole favourite he desired to drink knowledge at any fountain and guthrie s grammar dickson on agriculture addison s spectator locke on the human understanding and taylor s scripture doctrine of original sin were welcome to his heart shakspeare milton pope thomson and young there is mystery in the workings of genius with these poets in his head and hand we see not that he has advanced one step in the way in which he was soon to walk highland mary and tam shanter sprang from other inspirations xxiv the project gutenberg ebook of the complete works of robert burns by allan cunningham https lifts up the veil himself from the studies which made him poet in my boyish days he says to moore i owed much to an old woman jenny wilson who resided in the family remarkable her credulity and superstition she had i suppose the largest collection in the country of tales and songs concerning devils ghosts fairies brownies witches warlocks spunkies kelpies wraiths apparitions cantraips giants enchanted towers dragons and other trumpery this cultivated the latent seeds of poesie but had so strong an effect upon my imagination that to this hour in my nocturnal rambles i sometimes keep on suspicious here we have the young poet taking lessons in the classic lore of his native land in the school of janet wilson he proﬁted largely her tales gave hue all their own to many noble effusions but her teaching was at the when he was in the ﬁelds either driving cart or walking to labour he had ever in his hand collection of songs such any stall in the land could supply him with and over these he pored ballad by ballad and verse by verse noting the true tender and the natural sublime from affectation and fustian to this he said i am convin ced that i owe much of my critic craft such it his mother too unconsciously led him in the ways of the muse she loved to recite or sing to him strange but clever ballad called the life and age of man this strain of piety and imagination was in his mind when he wrote man was made to he found other tenderer nature and softer inﬂuence you know he says to moore our country custom of coupling man and woman together partners in the labours of harvest in my ﬁfteenth autumn my partner was bewitching creature year younger than myself she was in truth bonnie sweet sonsie lass and unwittingly to herself initiated in that delicious passion which in spite of acid disappointment horse prudence and bookworm philosophy i hold to be the ﬁrst of human joys how she caught the contagion i can not tell i never expressly said i loved her indeed i did not know myself why i liked so much to loiter behind with her when returning in the evenings from our labours why the tones of her voice made my heart strings thrill like an æolian harp and particularly why my pulse beat such furious ratan when i looked and ﬁngered over her little hand to pick out the cruel and thistles among other qualities she sang sweetly and it was her favourite reel to which i attempted to give an embodied vehicle in rhyme thus with began love and this intercourse with the fair part of the creation was to his slumbering emotions voice from heaven to call them into life and poetry from the school of traditionary lore and love burns now went to rougher academy lochlea though not producing ﬁne crops of corn was considered excellent ﬂax and while the cultivation of this commodi ty was committed to his father and his brother gilbert he was sent to irvine at midsu mmer 1781 to learn the trade of under one peacock kinsman to his mother some time before he had spent portion of summer at school in kirkoswald learning mensuration and where he had mingled in scenes of sociality with smugglers and enjoyed the pleasure of silent walk under the moon with the young and the beautiful at irvine he laboured by day to acquire knowledge of his business and at night he associated with the gay and the thoughtless with whom he learnt to empty his glass and indulge in free discourse on topics forbidden at lochlea he had one small room lodging which he gave shilling week meat he seldom tasted and his food consisted chieﬂy of oatmeal and potatoes sent from his father s house in letter to his father written with great purity and simplicity of style he thus gives picture of himself mental and bodily honou red sir i have purposely delayed writing in the hope that i should have the pleasure of seeing you on new years day but work comes so hard upon us that i not choose to be absent on that account my health is nearly the same when you were here only my sleep is little sounder and on the whole i am rather better than otherwise though i mend by very slow degrees the weakness of my nerves had so debilitated my mind that i dare neither review past wants nor look forward into futurity the least anxiety or perturbation in my breast produces most unhappy effects on my whole frame sometimes indeed when an hour or two my spirits are little lightened i glimmer little into futurity but my principal and indeed my only pleasurable employment is looking backwards and xxv the project gutenberg ebook of the complete works of robert burns by allan cunningham https

and daily preparing to meet them i have but just time and paper to return you my grateful thanks the lessons of virtue and piety you have given which were but too much neglected at the time of giving them but which i hope have been remembered ere it is yet too this remarkable letter was written in the year of his age it alludes to the illness which seems to have been the companion of his youth nervous headache brought on by constant toil and anxiety and it speaks of the melancholy which is the common attendant of genius and its sensibilit ies aggravated by despair of distinc tion the catastrophe which happened ere this letter was well in his father s hand accords ill with quotations from the bible and hopes ﬁxed in heaven we gave he says welcome carousal to the new year the shop took ﬁre and burnt to ashes and i was left like true poet not worth this disaster was followed by one more grievous his father was well in years when he was married and age and constitution injured by toil and disappointment began to press him down ere his sons had grown up to man s estate on all sides the clouds began to darken the farm was unprosperous the speculations in ﬂax failed and the landlord of lochlea raising question upon the meaning of the lease concerning rotation of crop pushed the matter to lawsuit alike ruinous to poor man either in its success or its failure after three years tossing and whirling says burns in the vortex of litigation my father was just saved from the horrors of jail by consumption which after two years promises kindly slept in and carried him away

was not decreed that these resolutions were to endure and that he was to become mighty agric ulturist in the west farmer attention the proverb says is good farmer all the world over and burns was such

is about to yoke and song on the girl who shows the whitest hands among his reapers has small chance of leading market or of being laird of the ﬁelds he rents the dreams of burns were of the muses and not of rising markets of golden locks rather than of yellow corn he had other faults it is not known that william burns was aware before his death that his eldest son had sinned in rhyme but we have gilbert s assurance that his father went to the grave in ignorance of his son s errors of less venial that he was soon to give proof of both in rob the rhymer s address to his bastard child poem less

burns it is one of the delusions of the poet s critics and biographers that the sources of his inspiration are to be found in the great classic poets of the land with some of whom he had from his youth been familiar there is little or trace of them in any of his compositions he read and warmed his fancy at their ﬂame he corrected his own natural taste by theirs but he neither copied nor imitated and there are but two or three allusions to young and shakspeare in all the range of his verse he could not but feel that he was the scholar of different school and that his thirst was to be slaked at other fountains the language in which those great bards embodied their thoughts was unapproachable to an ayrshire peasant it was to him an almost foreign tongue he had to think and feel in

subdue he had recourse to the scottish and he found it sufﬁcient the goddesses or the dalilahs of the young poet s song were like the language in which he celebrated them the produce of the district

not blaze while the social strains of the unfortunate fergusson revived in the city if not in the ﬁeld the memory of him who sang the monk and the miller s but notwithstanding these and other

escaped the contamination of their sensual manners and prodigality the people of kyle regarded this conduct with suspicion they were not to be expected to know that when burns ranted and housed with

used the scythe the and the ﬂail with skill and the malicious even began to say that there was something more in him than wild sallies of wit and foolish rhymes but the farm lay high the bottom was wet and in third season indifferent seed and wet harvest robbed him at once of half his crop he seems to have regarded this an intimation from above that nothing which he undertook would prosper and consoled himself with joyous friends and with the society of the muse the judgment can not be praised which selected farm with wet cold bottom and sowed it with unsound seed but that man who despairs because wet season robs him of the fruits of the ﬁeld is unﬁt the warfare of life where fortitude is much required by general on ﬁeld of battle when the tide of success threatens to ﬂow against him the poet seems to have believed very early in life that he was none of the elect of mammon that he was too much of genius ever to acquire wealth by steady labour or by he loved to call it prudence or grubbing industry and yet there were hours and days in which burns even when the rain fell on his unhoused sheaves did not wholly despair of himself he laboured nay sometimes he slaved on his farm and at intervals of toil sought to embellish his mind with such knowledge might be useful should chance the goddess who ruled his lot drop him upon some of the higher places of the land he had while he lived at tarbolton united with some young men all sons of farmers in that neighbourhood in forming club of which the object was to charm away few evening hours in the week with agreeable and the discussion of topics of economy or love of this little society the poet was president and the ﬁrst question they were called on to settle was this suppose young man bred farmer but without any fortune has it in his power to marry either of two women the one girl of large fortune but neither handsome in person nor agreeable in conversation but who can manage the household affairs of farm well enough the other of them girl every way agreeable in person conversation and behaviour but without any fortune which of them shall he choose this question was started by the poet and once every week the club were called to the consideration of matters connected with rural life and industry their expenses were limited to threepence week and till the departure of burns to the distant mossgiel the club continued to live and thrive on his removal it lost the spirit which gave it birth and was heard of more but its aims and its usefulness were revived in mauchline where the poet was induced to establish society which only differed from the other in spending the moderate ﬁnes arising from on books instead of liquor here too burns was the president and the members were chieﬂy the sons of husbandmen whom he found he said more natural in their manners and more agreeable than the mechanics of villages and towns who were ready to dispute on all topics and inclin ed to be convinced on none

project gutenberg ebook of the complete works of robert burns by allan cunningham https other sought to soften the harsher rules and observances of the kirk and to bring moderation and charity into its discipline well its councils both believed themselves right both were loud and hot and personal with bitterness only known in religious controversy the poet sided with the professors of the new

mercilessness of when his frailties caused him to visit the stool of repentance and moreover his friend gavin hamilton writer in mauchline had been sharply censured by the same authorities daring to

tulzie which recorded gave at the same time wings to the scandal while holy willie an elder of mauchline and an austere and hollow pretender to righteousness he reserved the ﬁercest of all his lampoons in holy willie s prayer he lays burning hand on the terrible doctrine of predestination this is satire daring personal and profane willie claims praise in the singular acknowledges folly in the plural and makes heaven accountable his sins in similar strain of undevout satire he congratulates goudie of kilmarnock on his essays on revealed religion these poems particularly the two latter are the sharpest lampoons in the language while drudging in the cause of the new light controversialists burns was not unconsciously strengthening his hands worthier toils the applause which selﬁsh divines bestowed on his witty but graceless effusions could not be enough one who knew how ﬂeeting the fame was which came from the heat of party disputes nor was he insensible that songs of beauty unknown century to national poesy had been unregarded in the hue and cry which arose on account of holy willie s prayer and the holy he hesitated to drink longer out of the agitated puddle of calvinistic controversy he resolved to slake his thirst at the pure of patriot feeling and domestic love and accordingly in the last and best of his controversial compositions he rose out of the lower regions of lampoon into the upper air of true poetry the holy fair though stained in one or two verses with personalities exhibits scene glowing with character and incident and life the aim of the poem is not so much to satirize one or two old light divines to expose and rebuke those almost indecent festivities which in too many of the western parishes accompanied the administration of the sacrame nt in the earlier days of the church when men were staid and sincere it was doubt an impressive sight to see rank succeeding rank of the old and the young all calm and all devout seated before the tent of the preacher in the sunny hours of june listening to his eloquence or partaking of the mystic bread and wine but in these our latter days when discipline is relaxed along with the sedate and the pious come swarms of the idle and the proﬂigate whom eloquence can edify and solemn rite affect on these and such these the poet has poured his satire and since this desirable reprehension the holy fairs east well west have become more decorous if not more devout his controversial sallies were accompanied or followed by series of poems which showed that national character and manners

highest moral feeling the purest patriotic sentiments and deep sympathy with the fortunes both here and hereafter of his they delineate domestic manners man s stern well social hours and mingle the

which on saturday night most of the sturdy beggars of the district had met to sell their meal pledge their superﬂuous rags and drink their gains it may be added that he loved to walk in solitary spots that his chief was the banks of the ayr the season most congenial to his fancy that of winter when the winds were heard in the leaﬂess woods and the voice of the swollen streams came from vale and hill and that he seldom composed whole poem at once but satisﬁed with few fervent verses laid the subject aside till the muse summoned him to another exertion of fancy in little back closet still

ripe corn invited the sickle or the ready market called the measured grain the poet was under other spells and was slow to avail himself of those golden moments which come but once in the season to this may be added too superﬁcial knowledge of the art of farming and want of intimacy with the nature of the soil he was called to cultivate he could speak ﬂuently of leas and faughs and fallows of change of seed and rotation of crops but practical knowledge and application were required and in these burns was deﬁcient the moderate gain which those dark days of agriculture brought to the economical farmer was not obtained the close the all but niggardly care by which he could win and keep his gold was seldom in the farmer s hand either above or below the mind of the poet and mossgiel

excuse some of those free ones which followed burns whose twa dogs was then incomplete ﬁnished the poem at sitting and put it in the van much to his printer s satisfaction if the jolly beggars was omitted any other cause than its freedom of sentiment and language or death and doctor hornbook from any other feeling than that of being too personal the causes of their exclusion have remained secret it is less easy to account the emission of many songs of high merit which he had amon g his papers perhaps he thought those which he selected were sufﬁcient to test the taste of the public before he printed the whole he with the consent of his brother altered his name from burness to burns chan ge which i am told he in after years regretted in the summer of the year 1786 the little volume big with the hopes and fortun es of the bard made its appearance it was entitled simply poems chieﬂy in the scottish dialect by robert burns and accompanied by modest preface saying that he submitted his book to his country with fear and with trembling since it contained little of the art of poesie and at the best was but voice given rude he feared and uncouth to the loves the hopes and the fears of his own bosom had summer sun risen on winter morning it could not have surprised the lowlands of scotland more than this kilmarnock volume surprised and delighted the people one and all the milkmaid sang his songs the ploughman repeated his poems the old quoted both and ever the devout rejoiced that idle verse had at last mixed tone of morality with its mirth the volume penetrated even into nithsdale keep it out of the way of your children said cameronian divine when he lent it to my father lest ye ﬁnd them i found mine reading it on the wonder that such volume made its way to the hearts of peasantry whose taste in poetry had been the marvel of many writers the poems were mostly on topics with which they were familiar the language was that of the ﬁreside raised above the vulgarities of common life by purifying spirit of expression and the exalting fervour of inspiration and there was such brilliant and graceful mixture of the elegant and the homely the lofty and the low the famil iar and the rapid succession of scenes which moved to tenderness or tears or to subdued mirth or open unlooked allusions to scripture or touches of sarcasm and superstitions to scare and of humour to through the whole was diffused the scent of ﬂowers through summer air moral sentimental beauty which sweetened and sanctiﬁed all the poet s expectation s from this little venture were humble he hoped much money from it would pay his passage to the west indies where he proposed to enter into the service of some of the scottish settlers and help to manage the double mystery of sugar and slavery the hearty applause which i have recorded came chieﬂy from the husbandman the shepherd and the mechanic the approbation of the magnates of the west though not was longer in coming stewart of stair indeed commended the poems and cheered their author dugald stewart received his visits with pleasure and wondered at his vigour of conversation much at his muse the door of the house of hamilton was open to him where the table was ever spread and the hand ever ready to help while the purses of the ballantynes and the parkers were always open to him were the doors of their houses those persons must be regarded the real patrons of the poet the high names of the district are not to be found among those who helped him with purse and patronage in 1786 that year of deep distress and high distinction the montgomerys came with their praise when his fame was up the kennedys and the boswells were silent and though the cunninghams gave effectual aid it was when the muse was crying xxxv the project gutenberg ebook of the complete works of robert burns by allan cunningham https loud voice before him come all and see the man whom i delight to honour it would be unjust well ungenerous not to mention the name of dunlo p among the poet s best and early patrons the distance at which she lived from mossgiel had kept his name from her till his poems appeared but his works induced her to desire his acquaintance and she became his warmest and surest friend to say the truth burns endeavoured in every honourable way to obtain the notice of those who had inﬂuence in the land he copied out the best of his unpublished poems in fair hand and inserting them in his printed volume presented it to those who seemed slow to buy he rewarded the notice of this one with attentions of that one with sally of encomiastic verse he left psalms of his own composing in the manse when he feasted with divine he enclosed holy willie s prayer with an injunction to be grave to one who loved mirth he sent the holy fair to one whom he invited to drink gill out of mutchkin stoup at mauchline market and on accidentally meeting with lord daer he immediately commemorated the event in sally of verse of strain more free and yet ﬂattering ever ﬂowed from the lips of court bard while musing over the names of those on whom fortune had smiled yet who had neglected to smile on him he remembered that he had met miss alexander young beauty of the west in the walks of ballochmyle and he recorded the impression which this fair vision made on him in song of unequalled elegance and melody he had met her in the woods in july on the 18th of november he sent her the song and reminded her of the circumstance from which it arose in letter which it is evident he had laboured to render polished and complimentary the young lady took notice of either the song or the poet though willing it is said to hear of both now seems to have been the last attempt he made on the taste or the sympathies of the gentry of his native district on the very day following we ﬁnd him busy in making arrangements his departure to jamaica this step burns had more than sufﬁc ient reasons the proﬁts of his volume amounted to little more than enough to waft him across the atlantic wee johnnie though the edition was all sold refused to risk another on speculation his friends both ballantynes and parkers volunteered to relieve the printer s anxieties but the poet declined their bounty and gloomily indented himself in ship about to sail from greenock and called on his muse to take farewell of caledonia in the last song he ever expected to measure in his native land that ﬁne lyric beginning the gloomy night is gathering fast was the offspring of these moments of regret and sorrow his feelings were not expressed in song alone he remembered his mother and his natural daughter and made an assignment of all that pertained to him at that was but of all the advantage which cruel unjust and insulting law allowed in the proceeds of his poems their support and behoof this document was publicly read in the presence of the poet at the of ayr by his friend william chalmers notary public even this step was to burns one of danger some person had uncoupled the merciless pack of the law at his heels and he was obliged to shelter himself he best could in woods it is said by day and in barns by night till the ﬁnal hour of his departure came that hour arrived and his chest was on the way to the ship when letter was put into his hand which seemed to light him to brighter prospects among the friends whom his merits had procured him was laurie district clergyman who had taste enough to admire the deep sensibilities well the humour of the poet and the generosity to make known both his works and his worth to the hearted and amiable blacklock who boldly proclaimed him poet of the ﬁrst rank and lamented that he was not in edinbur gh to publish another edition of his poem burns was ever man of impulse he recalle d his chest from greenock he relinquished the situation he had accepted on the estate of one douglas took secret leave of his mother and without an introduction to any one and unknown personally to all save to dugald stewart away he walked through glenap to edinbur gh full of new hope and conﬁding in his genius when he arrived he scarcely knew what to he hesitated to call on the professor he refrained from making himself known it has been supposed he did to the enthusiastic blacklock but sitting down in an obscure lodging he sought out an obscure printer recommended by humble comrade from kyle and began to negotiate xxxvi the project gutenberg ebook of the complete works of robert burns by allan cunningham https new edition of the poems of the ayrshire ploughman this was not the way to go about it his barge had well nigh been shipwrecked in the launch and he might have lived to regret the letter which hindered his voyage to jamaica had he not met by chance in the street gentleman of the west of the name of dalzell who introduced him to the earl of glencairn nobleman whose classic education did not hurt his taste scottish poetry and who was not too proud to lend his helping hand to rustic stranger of such merit burns cunningham carried him to creech then the murray of edinbur gh shrewd man of business who opened the poet s eyes to his true interests the ﬁrst proposals then all but issued were put in the ﬁre and new ones printed and diffused over the island the subscription was headed by half the noblemen of the north the caledonian hunt through the interest of glencairn took six hundred copies duchesses and countesses swelled the list and such crowding to write down names had not been witnessed since the signing of the solemn league and covenant while the were ﬁlling and the new volume printing on paper and in type worthy of such high patronage burns remained in edinbur gh where the winter season he was lion and one of an unwonted kind philosophers historians and scholars had shaken the elegant coteries of the city with their wit or enlightened them with their learning but they were all men who had been polished by polite letters or by intercourse with high life and there was sameness in their very dress well address of which peers and peeresses had become weary they therefore welcomed this rustic candidate the honour of giving wings to their hours of lassitude and wearine ss with welcome more than common and when his approach was announced the polished circle looked the advent of lout from the plough in whose uncouth manners and embarrassed address they might ﬁnd matter both mirth and wonder but they met with barbarian who was not at all barbarous the poet met in lord daer feelings and sentiments natural those of ploughman so they met in ploughman manners worthy of lord his air was easy and unperplexed his address was perfectly and elegant in its simplicity he felt neither eclipsed by the titled nor struck dumb before the learned and the eloquent but took his station with the ease and grace of one born to it in the society of men alone he spoke out he spared neither his wit his humour nor his seemed to say to i am man and you are more and why should i not act and speak like one was remarked however that he had not learnt or did not desire to conceal his he commended with more rapture than was courteous and contradicted with more bluntness than was accounted polite it was thus with him in the company of men when woman approached his look altered his eye beamed milder all that was stern in his nature underwent change and he received them with deference but with consciousness that he could win their attention he had won that of others who differed indeed from them only in the texture of their kirtles this natural power of rendering himself acceptable to women had been observed and envied by sillar one of the dearest of his early comrades and it stood him in good stead now when he was the object to whom the duchess of gordon the loveliest well the wittiest of her discourse burns she afterwards said won the attention of the edinbur gh ladies by deferential way of an ease and natural grace of manners new it was he told them the stories of some of his tenderest songs or liveliest poems in style quite his little narratives which had one and all the merit of being short with personal incidents of humour or of pathos in party when blair and professor walker were present burns related the circumstances under which he had comp osed his melancholy song the gloom y night is gathering fast in way even more touching than the verses and in the company of the ruling beauties of the time he hesitated not to lift the veil from some of the tenderer parts of his own history and give them glimps es of the romance of rustic life lady of one of his must willing i am told to say that she should never forget the tale which he related of his affection mary campbell his highland mary he loved to call her she was fair he said and affectionate and guileless she was beautiful and beautiful he thought her in very high degree the ﬁrst time he saw her was during xxxvii the project gutenberg ebook of the complete works of robert burns by allan cunningham https of his musing walks in the woods of montgomery castle and the ﬁrst time he spoke to her was during the merriment of there were others there who admired her but he addressed her and had the luck to win her regard from them all he soon found that she was the lass whom he had long sought but never before that her good looks were surpassed by her good sense and her good sense was equalled by her discretion and modesty he met her frequently she saw by his looks that he was sincere she put full trust in his love and used to wander with him among the green knowes and till the sun went down and the moon rose talking dreaming of love and the golden days which awaited them he was poor and she had only her s fee she was in the condition of servant but thoughts of gear never darkened their dream they resolved to wed and exchanged vows of constancy and love they plighted their vows on the sabbath to render them more made them by burn where they had courted that open nature might be made them over an open bible to show that they thought of god in this mutual when they had done they both took water in their hands and scattered it in the air to intimate that the stream was pure so were their intentions they parted when they did this but they parted never to meet more she died in burning fever during visit to her relations to prepare her marriage and all that he had of her was lock of her long bright hair and her bible which she exchanged his even with the tales which he related of rustic love and adventure his own story mingled and ladies of rank heard the ﬁrst time that in all that was romantic in the passion of love and in all that was chivalrous in sentiment men of distinction both by education and birth were at least equalled by the peasantry of the land they listened with interest and inclined their feathers beside the bard to hear how love went on in the west and in case it ran quite smooth sometimes young hearts were kept asunder by the sordid feelings of parents who could not be persuaded to bestow their daughter perhaps an only one on wooer who could not coun t penny penny and number cow cow sometimes mother desired her daughter to look higher than to one of her station her beauty and her education entitled her to match among the lairds rather than the tenants and sometimes the devotional tastes of both father and mother approving of personal looks and connexions were averse to see daughter bestow her hand on one whose language in religion was indiscreet and whose morals were suspected yet neither the vigilance of fathers nor the suspiciou s care of aunts and mothers could succeed in keeping those asunder whose hearts were together but in these meetings circumspection and invention were necessary all fears were to be lulled by the seeming carelessness of the lass perils were to be met and braved by the spirit of the lad his home perhaps was at distance and he had wild woods to come through and deep streams to pass before he could see the now shown and now withdrawn at her window he had to approach with quick eye and wary foot lest father or

edinbur gh early in the winter the attentions which he received from all ranks and descriptions of persons were such would have turned any head but his own he retained the same simplicity of manners and appearance which had struck so forcibly when i ﬁrst saw him in the country his dress was suited to his station plain and unpretending with sufﬁcient attention to neatness he always wore boots and when on more than usual ceremony buckskin breeches his manners were manly simple and independent strongly xxxviii the project gutenberg ebook of the complete works of robert burns by allan cunningham

deference on subjects where his want of education deprived him of the means of information if there had been little more of gentleness and accommodation in his temper he would have been still more interesting but he had been accustomed to give law in the circle of his ordinary acquaintance and his dread of anything approaching to meanness or servility rendered his manner somewhat decided and hard nothing perhaps was more remarkable among his various attainments than the ﬂuency and precision and originality of language when he spoke in company more particularly he aimed at purity in his turn of expression and avoided more successfully than most scotsmen the peculiarities of scottish phraseology from his conversation i should have pronounced him to have been ﬁtted to excel in whatever walk of ambition he had chosen to exert his abilities he was passionately fond of the beauties of nature and i recollect he once told when i was admiring distant prospect in one of our morning walks that the sight of so many smoking cottages gave pleasure to his mind which none could understand who had not witnessed like himself the happiness and worth which cottages such was the impression which burns made at ﬁrst on the fair the titled and the learned of edinbur gh an impression which though lessened by intimacy and closer examination on the part of the men remained unimpaired on that of the softer sex till his his company during the season of balls and festivities continued to be courted by all who desired to be reckoned gay or polite cards of invitation fell thick on him he was not more welcome to the plumed and jewelled groups whom her fascinating grace of gordon gathered about her than he was to the grave divines and polished scholars who assembled in the rooms of stewart or blair or robertson the classic socialities of tytler afterwards lord woodhouslee or the elaborate supper of the whimsical monboddo whose guests imagined they were entertained in the manner of lucullus or of cicero were not complete without the presence of the ploughman of kyle and the feelings of the rustic poet facing such companies though of surprise and delight at ﬁrst gradually subsided he said he discerned that man differed from man only in the polish and not in the grain but edin burgh offered tables and entertainers of less orderly and staid character than those i have the glass circulated with greater rapidity where the wit ﬂowed more freely and where there were neither highbred ladies to charm conversation within the bounds of modesty nor serious philosophers nor grave divines to set limit to the license of speech or the hours of enjoyment to these these were all of the better classes the levities of the rustic poet s wit and humour were welcome us were the tenderest of his narratives to the accomplished duchess of gordon and the beautiful miss burnet of monboddo they raised social roar not at all classic and demanded and provoked his sallies of wild humour or indecorous mirth with much delight he had witnessed among the lads of kyle when at mill or forge his humorous sallies abounded the ale ﬂowed in these enjoyments the rough but learned william nicol and the young and amiable robert ainslie shared the name of the poet was coupled with those of profane wits free livers and that class of gentlemen who hang about the courts of law or season or two wear the livery of mars and handle cold iron edinbur gh had still another class of genteel convivialists to whom the poet was attracted by principles well by pleasure these were the relics of that once numerous body the jacobites who still loved to cherish the feelings of birth or education rather than of judgment and toasted the name of stuart when the last of the race had renounced his pretensions to throne the sake of peace and the cross young men then and high names were among them annually met on the pretender s and sang songs in which the white rose of jacobitism ﬂourished toasted toasts announcing adherence to the male line of the bruce and the stuart and listened to the strains of the laureate of the day who prophesied in drink the dismissal of the intrusive hanoverian by the right and might of the righteous and disinherited line burns who was descended from northern race whoso father was suspected of having drawn the claymore in 1745 and who loved xxxix the project gutenberg ebook of the

united genius of all parties had raised thrown wantonly down his jacobitism inﬂuenced not his head but his heart and gave mournful hue to many of his lyric compositions meanwhile his poems were

of criticism yet he was generally of complimental mood he loaded the robe of coila in the vision with more scenes than it could well contain that he might include in the landscape all the of his friends and he gave more than their share of commendation to the wallaces out of respect to his friend dunlop of the critics of edinbur gh he said they spun the thread of their criticisms so ﬁne that it was unﬁt either warp or weft and of its scholars he said they were never satisﬁed with any scottish poet unless they could trace him in horace one morning at blair s when the holy fair was the subject of conversation the reverend critic said why should speel the holy door with tidings of salvation if you had said with tidings of damnation the satire would have been the better and the bitterer excellent exclaimed the poet the alteration is capital and i hope you will honour by allowing to say in note at whose suggestion it was professor walker who tells the anecdote adds that blair evaded with equal good humour and decision this not very polite request nor was this the only slip which the poet made on this occasion some one asked him in which of the churches of edinbur gh he had received the highest gratiﬁcation he named the but gave the preference over all preachers to robert walker the colleague and rival in eloquence of blair himself and that in tone so pointed and decisive to make all at the table stare and look embarrassed the poet confessed afterwards that he never reﬂected on his blunder without pain and mortiﬁcation blair probably had this in his mind when on reading the poem beginning when guildford good our pilot stood he exclaimed ah the politics of burns always smell of the smithy meaning that they were vulgar and common in april the second or

great forerunner he visited too the lowly grave of the unfortunate robert fergusson and it must be recorded to the shame of the magistrates of edinbur gh that they allowed him to erect headstone to his memory and to the scandal of scotland that in such memorial he had not been anticipated he seems not to have regarded the graves of scholars or philosophers and he trod the pavements where the warlike princes and nobles had walked without any emotion he loved however to see places celebrated in scottish song and ﬁelds where battles the independence of his country had been stricken and with

street cursing in scotch and latin the loitering postilions not yoking the horses and hurrying him away all apology and explanation was in vain and burns with vexation which he sought not to conceal took his seat silently beside the irascible pedagogue and returned to the south by broughty castle the banks of endermay and queensferry he parted with the highlands in kindly mood and loved to recal the scenes and the people both in conversation and in song on his return to edinbur gh he had to bide the time of his bookseller and the public the impression of his poems extending to two thousand eight hundred copies was sold widely much of the money had to come from distance and burns lingered about the northern metropolis expecting settlement with creech and with the hope that those who dispensed his country s patronage might remember one who then now was reckoned an ornament to the land but creech parsimonious man was slow in his payments the patronage of the country was swallowed up in the sink of politics and though noblemen smiled and ladies of rank nodded their jewelled heads in approbation of every new song he sung and every witty sally he uttered they reckoned any further notice or care superﬂuous the poet an observant man saw all this but hope was the cordial of his heart he said and he hoped and lingered on too active genius to remain idle he addressed himself to the twofold business of love and verse repulsed by the stately beauty of the devon he sought consolation in the society of one fair and inﬁnitely more witty and an accident had time deprived him of the use of one of his legs he gave wings to hours of pain by writing series of letters to this edinbur gh enchantress in which he signed himself sylvander and addressed her under the name of clarinda in these compositions which one can regard serious and which james grahame the poet called romance of real platonic affection amid much affectation both of language and sentiment and desire to say ﬁne and startling things we can see the proud heart of the poet throbbing in the dread of being neglected or forgotten by his country the love which he offers up at the altar of wit and beauty seems assumed and put on its rapture is artiﬁcial and its brilliancy that of an icicle woman was ever wooed and won in that malvolio way and there is doubt that m lehose felt much offence pleasure at this boisterous display of regard in aftertimes he loved to remember her wine circulated mac was his favourite toast during this season he began his lyric contributions to the musical museum of johnson work which amid many imperfections of taste and arrangement contains more of the true old music and genuine old songs of scotland than any other collection with which i am acquainted burns gathered oral airs and ﬁtted them with words of mirth or of woe of tenderness or of humour with unexampled readiness and felicity he eked out old fragments and sobered down licentious strains so much in the olden spirit and feeling that the new can not be distinguished from the ancient nay he inserted lines and half lines with such skill and nicety that antiquarians are perplexed to settle which is genuine or which is simulated yet with all this he abated not of the natural mirth or the racy humour of the lyric muse of scotland he did not like her the less because she walked like some of the maidens of her strains at times and spoke with the freedom of innocence in these communications we observe how little his border among the fountains of ancient song contributed either of sentiment or allusion to his lyrics and how deeply his strains whether of pity or of merriment were coloured by what he had seen and heard and felt in the highlands in truth all that lay beyond the forth was an undiscovered land to him while the lowland districts were not only familiar to his mind and eye but all their more romantic vales and hills and streams were already musical in songs of such excellence induced him to dread failure rather than hope triumph moreover the highlands teemed with jacobitical feelings and scenes hallowed by the blood or the sufferings of men heroic and perhaps misguided and the poet willingly yielding to an impulse which was truly romantic and believed by thousands to be loyal penned his songs on drumossie and killiecrankie the spirit of sorrow or of bitterness prevailed

burns was probably aware of this he takes occasion in some of his letters to suggest that the hour may be at hand when he shall be accounted by scholars meteor rather than ﬁxed light and to suspect

desired to see one whom he once and still dearly loved who had been sufferer his sake and whom he proposed to make mistress of his ﬁreside and the sharer of his fortunes even while whispering of love to charlotte hamilton on the banks of the devon or sighing out the affected sentimentalities of platonic or pastoral love in the ear of clarinda his thoughts wandered to her whom he had left bleaching

language obscure obscure sir said burns you know not the language of that great master of your own devil if you had witch your client you would not be able to manage her defence he wrote few poems after his marriage but he composed many songs the sweet voice of burns and the craving of johnson s museum will in some measure account the number but not their variety which is truly wonderful in the history of that mournful strain mary in heaven we read the story of many of his lyrics they generally sprang from his personal feelings poet has put more of himself into his poetry than burns robert

the harvest season or two was abundant and the dairy yielded butter and cheese the market it seemed that the luckless star which ruled his lot had relented and now shone unboding and benignly but much more is required than toil of hand to make successful farmer nor will the attention bestowed only by ﬁts and starts compensate carelessness or oversight frugality not in one thing but in all is demanded in small matters well in great while careful mind and vigilant eye must superintend the labours of servants and the whole system of and economy now during the three years which burns stayed in ellisland he neither wrought with that constant diligence which farming demands nor did he bestow upon it the unremitting attention of eye and mind which such farm required besides his skill in husbandry was but rent though of his own ﬁxing was too high him and the times the ground though good was not so excellent he might have had on the same employed more servants than the number of acres demanded and spread them richer board than common when we have said this we need not add the expensive tastes induced by poetry to keep readers from starting when they are told that burns at the close of the third year of occupation resigned his lease to the landlord and bade farewell ever to the plough he was not however quite desolate he had year or more been appointed on the excise and had superintended district extending to ten large parishes with applause indeed it has been assigned the chief reason failure in his farm that when the plough or the sickle summoned him to the ﬁeld he was to be found either pursuing the defaulters of the revenue among the valleys of dumfrieshire or measuring out pastoral verse to the beauties of the land he retired to house in the of dumfries and commenced he commenced it with an empty pocket ellisland had swallowed up all the proﬁts of his poems he had now neither barn to produce meal nor barley to yield fat hen ﬁeld to which he could go at martinmas mart nor dairy to supply milk and cheese and butter to the had in short all to buy and little to buy with he regarded it compensation that he had to provide bankruptcies to dread horse to keep his excise duties were now conﬁned to dumfries and that the burthen of barren farm was removed from his mind and his muse at liberty to renew her unsolicited strains but from the day of his departure from the barren ellisland the downward course of burns may be dated the cold neglect of his country had driven him back indignantly to the plough and he hoped to gain from the furrowed ﬁeld that independence which it was the duty of scotland to have provided but he did not resume the plough with all the advantages he possessed when he ﬁrst forsook it he had revelled in the luxuries of polished tastes had been rendered expensive well pure he had witnessed and he hoped the pleasures of literary retirement while the hands which had led jewelled dames over scented carpets to supper tables leaded with silver took hold of the hilts of the plough with more of reluctance than edinbur gh with its lords and its ladies its delights and its hopes spoiled him farming nor were his new labours more acceptable to his haughty spirit than those of the plough the excise century had been word of opprobrium or of hatred in the north the duties which it imposed were regarded not by peasants alone serious encroachment upon the ancient rights of the nation and to mislead gauger or resist him even to blood was considered by few fault that the brightest genius of the whose tastes and sensibilities were so peculiarly its be reward set to look after and smuggled tobacco and to gauge s barrels was regret and marvel to many and source of bitter merriment to burns himself the

duty to his country and his kind and his conduct was so regarded by very competent and candid judge let look at the books of burns said maxwell of terraughty at the meeting of the district magistrates they show that an upright ofﬁcer may be merciful with salary of some seventy pounds year the chance of few guineas annually from the futur editions of his poems and the hope of rising at some distant day to the more lucrative situation of supervisor burns continued to live in dumfries ﬁrst in the and next in small house in humble street since called by his name in his earlier years the poet seems to have scattered songs thick summer eve scatters its dews nor did he scatter them less carelessly he appears indeed to have thought much less of them than of his poems the sweet song of mary morison and others not at all inferior lay unregarded among his papers till accident called them out to shine and be admired many of these brief but happy compositions sometimes with his name and oftener without he threw in dozens at time into johnson where they were noticed only by the captious ritson but now work of higher pretence claimed share in his skill in september 1792 he was requested by geor ge thomson to render his national collection the poetry worthy of the muses of the north and to take compassion on many choice airs which had waited poet like the author of the cotter s saturday night to wed them to immortal verse to engage in such an undertaking burns required small persuasion and while thomson asked strains delicate and polished the poet characteristically stipulated that his contributions were to be without remuneration and the language seasoned with sprinkling of the scottish dialect his heart was much in the matter he began to pour out verse with readiness and talent unknown in the history of song his engagement with thomson and his esteem johnson gave birth to series of songs brilliant varied and naturally easy they were gracefully original in looking over those very dissimilar collections it is not difﬁcult to discover that the songs which he wrote the more stately work while they are more polished and elegant than those which he contributed to the less pretending one are at the same time less happy in their humour and less simple in their pathos what pleases simple and naive says burns to thomson disgusts you ludicrous and low this reason fye gie my coggie sirs fye let us to the bridal with several others of that cast are to highly pleasing while saw ye my father delights with its descriptive simple pathos we read in these words the reasons of the difference between the lyrics of the two collections the land where the poet lived furnished ready materials song hills with ﬁne woods vales with clear waters and dames lovely any recorded in verse were to be had in his walks and his visits while the purposes of mirth or of humour characters in whose faces originality was legibly written were numerous in nithsdale he had found them in the west he had been reproached while in kyle with seeing charms in very ordinary looks and hanging the garlands of the muse on unlovely altars he was liable to such censure in nithsdale he poured out the incense of poetry only on the fair and captivating his jeans his lucys his phillises and his jessies were ladies of such mental or personal charms the reynolds s and the lawrences of the time would have rejoiced to lay out their choicest colours on but he did not limit himself to the charms of those whom he could step out to the walks and admire his lyrics give evidence of the wandering of his thoughts to the distant or the loves to remember charlotte hamilton and mary campbell and think of the sighs and vows on the devo n and the doon while his harpstrings were still quivering to the names of the millers and the m the charms of the lasses with golden or with ﬂaxen locks in the valley where he dwelt of jean m murdo and her sister phillis he loved to sing and their

jessie lewars two or three songs of gratitude and praise nor did he forget other beauties the accomplish ed riddel is remembered and the absence of fair clarinda is lamented in strains both impassioned and pathetic but the main inspirer of the latter songs of burns was young woman of humble birth of form equal to the most exquisite proportions of sculpture with bloom on her cheeks and merriment in her large bright eyes enough to drive an amatory poet crazy her name was jean lorimer she was not more than seventeen when the poet made her acquaintance and though she had got sort of from an ofﬁcer of the army to use his southron name of whelpdale she loved best to be addressed by her maiden designation while the poet chose to veil her in the numerous lyrics to which she gave life under the names of chloris the lass of and the lassie wi the lintwhite though of temper not much inclined to conceal anything burns complied so tastefully with the growing demand of the age the exterior decencies of life that when the scrupling dames of caledonia sung new song in her praise they were unconscious whence its beauties came is the lover of art that the shape and gracefulness of the marble nymph which he admires are derived from creature who sells the use of her charms indifferently to sculpture or to love fine poetry like other arts called ﬁne springs from strange places the ﬂower in the fable said when it bloomed on the dunghill nor is burns more to be blamed than was raphael who painted madonnas and magdalens with dishevelled hair and lifted eyes from loose lady whom the pope holy at antichrist charitably prescribed to the artist while he laboured in the cause of the church of the poetic use which he made of jean lorimer s charms burns gives this account to

them into better harmony with the airs and i am not the only one who has wondered that bard so impetuous and intractable in most matters should have become so soft and pliable to make changes which too often sacriﬁced the poetry the sake of fuller and more swelling sound it is true that the emphatic notes of the music must ﬁnd their echo in the emphatic words of the verse and that words soft and liquid are ﬁtter ladies lips than words hissing and rough but it is also true that in changing harsher word one more harmonious the sense often suffers and that happiness of expression and that dance of words which lyric verse requires lose much of their life and vigour the poet s favourite walk in composing his songs was on beautiful green sward on the li the project gutenberg ebook of the

good reasons may be assigned miller the elder of dalswinton had desired to oblige him in the affair of ellisland and his ﬁrm and considerate friend m murdo of drumlanrig was chamberlain to his grace

power and keen hostility against every system which enabled birth and opulence to anticipate those rewards which he conceived to belong to genius and when we add to this resentment of the injurious

and the laughter dishonest the poet was unfortunate in his political attachments miller gained the boroughs which burns wished he might lose and heron lost the county which he foretold he would gain

it appears by letter from the poet to captain erskine afterwards earl of mar gave great offence corbet one of the superiors was desired to inform him that his business was to act and not to think and that whatever might be men or measures it was his duty to be silent and the intercession of fintray and the explanations of burns were so far effectual that his political offense was forgiven only i understand said he that all hopes of my getting ofﬁcially forward are the records of the excise ofﬁce exhibit trace of this memorable matter and two noblemen who were then in the government have assured that this harsh proceeding received countenance at and must have originated with some ungenerous or malicious person on whom the poet had spilt little of the nitric acid of his wrath that burns was numbered among the republicans of dumfries i well remember but then those who held different sentiments from the men in power were all in that loyal town stigmatized democrats that he either desired to see the constitution change d or his country invaded by the liberal french who proposed to set us free with the bayonet and then admit us to the fraternal embrace one ever believed it is true that he spoke of premiers and peers with contempt that he hesitated to take off his hat in the theatre to the air of god save the king that he refused to drink the health of pitt saying he preferred that of far greater man that he wrote bitter words against that combination of princes who desired to put down freedom in france that he said the titled spurred and the wealthy switched england and scotland like two and that all the high places of the land instead of being ﬁlled by genius and talent were occupied were the of israel with idols of wood or of stone but all this and more had been done and said before by thousands in this land whose love of their country was never questioned that it was bad taste to refuse to remove his hat when other heads were bared and little better to refuse to pledge in company the name of pitt because he preferred washington can not admit of doubt but that he deserved to be written down traitor mere matters of whim or caprice or to be turned out of the unenvied situation of gauging auld wives barrels because he thought there were some stains on the white robe of the constitution seems sort of tyranny new in the history of oppression his love of country is recorded in too many undying lines to admit of doubt now nor is it that chivalrous love alone which men call romantic it is love which may be laid up in every man s heart and

sedition and when ladies retired from the table and the wine circulated with closed doors he was suspected of treason rather than of toasting which he often did with much humour the charms of woman even when he gave sentiment may our success be equal to the justice of our cause he was liable to be challenged by some gunpowder captain who thought that we deserved success in war whether right or wrong it is true that he hated with most cordial hatred all who presumed on their own consequence whether arising from wealth titles or commissions in the army ofﬁcers he usually called the epauletted puppies and lords he generally spoke of feather fools who could but strut and stare and be answer in kind to retort his satiric ﬂings his unfriends reported that it was unsafe young men to associate with one whose principles were democratic and scarcely either modest or safe young women to listen to poet whose notions of female virtue were so loose and his songs so free these sentiments prevaile d so far that gentleman on visit from london told he was dissuaded from inviting burns to dinner given by way of welcome back to his native place because he was the associate of democrats and loose people and when modest dame of dumfries expressed through friend wish to have but the honour of speaking to one of whose genius she was an admirer the poet declined the interview with smile saying alas she is handsome and you know the character publicly assigned to she escaped the danger of being numbered it is likely with the annas and the chlorises of his freer strains the neglect of his country the tyranny of the excise and the downfall of his hopes and fortunes were now to bring forth their poet s health began to decline his drooping looks his neglect of his person his solitary saunterings his escape from the stings of reﬂection into socialities and his distempered joy in the company of beauty all spoke plainly with tongue of sinking heart and declining body yet though he

shall ever see you again is i am afraid highly this remarkable letter proves both the declining health and the poverty of the poet his digestion was so bad that he could taste neither ﬂesh nor ﬁsh porridge and milk he could alone swallow and that but in small quantities when it is recollected that he had more than thirty shillings week to keep house and live like gentleman one need wonder that his wife had to be obliged to generous neighbour some of the chief necessaries her coming conﬁn ement and that the poet had to beg in extreme need two guinea notes from distant friend his sinking

case which of us should be there soonest he looked in my face with an air of great kindness and expressed his concern at seeing so ill with his usual sensibility at table he ate little or nothing we had long conversation about his present state and the approaching termination of all his earthly prospects he showed great concern about his literary fame and particularly the publication of his posthumous works he said he was well aware that his death would occasion some noise and that every scrap of his writing would be revived against him to the injury of his future reputation that letters and verses written with unguarded freedom would be handed about by vanity or malevolence when dread of his resentment would restrain them or prevent malice or envy from pouring forth their venom on his name i had seldom seen his mind greater or more collected there was frequently considerable degree of vivacity in his sallies but the concern and dejection i could not disguise damped the spirit of pleasantry he seemed willing to this was on the evening of the 5th of july another lady who called to see him found him seated at window gazing on the sun then setting brightly on the summits of the green hills of nithsdale look how lovely the sun is said the poet but he will soon have done with shining he now longed home his wife whom he ever tenderly loved was about to be conﬁned in his

reduced in pocket refused with scorn an offer of ﬁfty pounds which specu lating bookseller made leave to publish his looser compositions he had refused an offer of the like sum yearly from perry of the morning chronicle poetic contributions to his paper lest it might embroil him with the ruling powers and he had resented the remittance of ﬁve pounds from thomson on account of his lyric contributions and desired him to so more unless he wished to quarrel with him but his necessities now and they had at time been so great induced him to solicit ﬁve pounds from thomson and ten pounds from his cousin james burness of montrose and to beg his friend alexander cunningham to intercede with the commissioners of excise to depart from their usual practice and grant him his full salary without that he added if i die not of disease i must perish with hunger thomson sent the ﬁve pounds james burness sent the ten but the commissioners of excise refused to be either merciful or generous

through dumfries that burns had returned worse from the that maxwell thought ill of him and that in truth he was dying the anxiety of all classes was great differences of opinion were forgotten in sympathy his early fate wherever two or three were met together their talk was of burns of his rare wit matchless humour the vivacity of his conversation and the kindness of his heart to the poet

that the man sunk but the poet was bright to the last he did not sink in the sense that these words imply the man was manly to the latest draught of breath that he was poet to the last can be proved by facts well by the word of the author of christabel he lay silently growing weaker and weaker he observed jessie lewars modest and beautiful young creature and sister to one of his brethren of the excise watching over him with moist eyes and tending him with the care of daughter he rewarded her with one of those songs which are an insurance against forgetfulness the lyrics of the north have nothing ﬁner than this exquisite stanza altho thou maun never be mine altho even hope is denied tis sweeter thee despairing than aught in the world his thoughts he lay wandered to charlotte hamilton and he dedicated some beautiful stanzas to her beauty and her coldness beginning fairest maid on devon it was sad sight to see the poet gradually sinking his wife in hourly expectation of her sixth conﬁnement and his four helpless daughter sweet child had died the year one of their lineage to soothe them with kind words or minister to their wants jessie lewars with equal prudence and attention watched over them all she could not help seeing that the thoughts of the desolation which his death would bring pressed sorely on him he loved his children and hoped much from his boys he wrote to his father james armour at mauchline that he was dying his wife nigh her conﬁnement and begged that his mother would hasten to them and speak comfort he wrote to dunlop saying i have written to you so often without receiving any answer that i would not trouble you again but the circumstances in which i am an illness which has long hung about in all probability will speedily send beyond that bourne

of the bed fell on his face and expired he died on the 21st of july when nearly years and seven months old the burial of burns on the 25th of july was an impressive and mournful scene half the people of nithsdale and the neighbouring parts of galloway had crowded into dumfries to see their poet mingled with the earth and not few had been permitted to look at his body laid out interment it was calm

or the fortunes of the poet and that the tears which he saw on many cheeks around the earth was replaced were worth all the splendour of show which mocked with unintended mockery the burial of the

lady by whose side he had wandered and dreamed on the banks of the devon he was of nature proud and suspicious and towards the close of his life seemed disposed to regard all above him in rank men who unworthily possessed the patrimony of genius he desired to see the order of nature restored and worth and talent in precedence of the base or the dull he had medium in his hatred or his love he never spared the stupid if they were not to be endured becaus he was bright and on the heads of the innocent possessors of titles or wealth he was ever ready to shower his lampoons he loved to start doubts in religion which he knew inspiration only could solve and he spoke of calvinism with latitude of language that grieved pious listeners he was and generous to degree above all men and scorned all that was selﬁsh and mean with scorn quite romantic he was steadfast friend and good neighbour while he lived at ellisland few passed his door without being entertained at his table and even when in poverty on the the poor seldom left his door but with blessings on their lips of his modes of study he has himself informed us well of the seasons and the places in which he loved to muse he composed while he strolled along the secluded banks of the doon the ayr or the nith the images crowded on his fancy his pace became quickened and in his highest moods he was excited even to tears he loved the winter its leaﬂess trees its swelling ﬂoods and its winds which swept along the gloomy sky with frost and snow on their wings but he loved the autumn has neglected to say muse was then more liberal of her

his chief place of study at ellisland is still remembered it extends along the towards the isle there the neighbouring gentry love to walk and peasants to gather and hold it sacred the place where he composed tam shanter his favourit place of study when residing in dumfries was the ruins of lincluden college made classic by that sublime ode the vision and that level and clovery sward contiguous to the college on the northern side of the nith the latter place was his favourite resort it is known now by the name of burns s musing ground and there he conceived many of his latter lyrics in case of interruption he completed the verses at the ﬁreside where he swung to and fro in his till the task was done he then submitted the song to the ordeal of his wife s voice which was both sweet and clear and while she sung he listened attentively and altered or amended till the whole was in harmony music and words the genius of burns is of high order in brightness of expression and unsolicited ease and natural vehemence of language he stands in the ﬁrst rank of poets in choice of subjects in happiness of conception and loftiness of imagination he recedes into the second he owes little of his fame to his objects saving the beauty of few ladies they were all of an ordinary kind he sought neither in romance nor in history themes to the muse he took up topics from life around which were familiar to all and endowed them with character with passion with tenderness with all that he touched into the regions of poetry and morals he went to far lands the purpose of surprising us with wonders neither did he go to crowns or coronets to attract the stare of the peasantry around him by things which to them were book shut and sealed the daisy grew on the lands which he ploughed the mouse built her frail nest on his own the haggis reeked on his own table the scotch drink of which he sang was the produce of neighbouring still the twa dogs which conversed so wisely and wittily were

lonely glens of the doon burns was one of the ﬁrst to teach the world that high moral poetry resided in the humblest subjects whatever he touched became elevated his spirit possessed and inspired the commonest topics and endowed them with life and beauty his songs have all the beauties and but few of them the faults of his poems they ﬂow to the music readily if both air and words came into the world together the sentiments are from nature they are rarely strained or forced and the words dance in their places and echo the music in its pastoral sweetness social glee or in the tender and the moving he seems always to write with woman s eye upon him he is gentle persuasive and impassioned he appears to watch her looks and pours out his praise or his complaint according to the changeful moods of her mind he looks on her too with sculptor s well poet s eye to him who works in marble the diamonds emeralds pearls and elaborate ornaments of gold but load and injure the harmony of proportion the grace of form and divinity of sentiment of his nymph or his with burns the fashion of lady s boddice the lustre of her satins or the sparkle of her diamonds or other ﬁnery with which wealth or taste has loaded her are neglected us idle frippery while her beauty her form or her mind matters which are of nature and not of fashion are remembered and praised he is none of the millinery bards who deal in scented silks spider laces rare gems set in rarer workmanship and who shower diam onds and pearls by the bushel on lady s locks he makes bright eyes ﬂushing cheeks the

some summer glen when country girl searches among his many songs one which sympathizes with her own heart and gives it full utterance till wood and vale is ﬁlled with the melody it is remarkable that the most naturally elegant and truly impassioned songs in our literature were written by ploughman in honour of the rustic lasses around him his poetry is all life and energy and bears the impress of warm heart and clear understanding it abounds with passions and pictures of rural happiness and the raptures of successful love all fresh from nature and observation and not they are seen through the spectacles of books the wit of the clouted shoe is there without its coarseness there is prodigality of humour without licentiousness pathos ever natural and manly social joy akin sometimes to sadness melancholy not unallied to mirth and sublime morality which seeks to elevate and soothe to love of man he added an affection the ﬂowers of the valley the fowls of the air and the beasts of the ﬁeld he perceived the tie of social sympathy which united animated with unanimated nature and in many of his ﬁnest poems most beauti fully he has enforced it his thoughts are original and his style new and unborrowed all that he has written is distinguished by happy carelessness bounding elasticity of spirit and singular felicity of expression simple yet inimitable he is familiar yet digniﬁed careless yet correct and concise yet clear and full all this and much more is embo died in the language of humble dialect reckoned barbarous by scholars but which coming from the lips of inspiration becomes classic and elevated the prose of this great poet has much of the original merit of his verse but it is seldom so natural and so sustained it abounds with ﬁne outﬂashings and with genial warmth and vigour but it is defaced by false ornament and by constant anxiety to say ﬁne and forcible things he seems not to know that simplicity was rare and needful beauty in prose in verse he covets the pauses of sterne and the point and antithesis of junius like one who believes that to write prose well he must be ever lively ever pointed and ever smart yet the account which he wrote of himself to moore is one of the most spirited and natural narratives in the language and composed in style remote from the strained and witticisms and sensibilities of many of his letters simple john wilson says

scene task uncouth to the poetical were his motives courting the muses and in these he found poetry to be its own reward now that he appears in the public character of an author he does it with fear and trembling so dear is fame to the rhyming tribe that even he an obscure nameless bard shrinks aghast at the thought of being branded impertinent blockhead obtruding his nonsense on the world and because he can make shift to jingle few doggerel scotch rhymes together looking upon himself poet of small consequence forsooth it is an observation of that celebrated poet shenstone whose divine elegies honour to our language our nation and our species that humility has depressed many genius to hermit but never raised one to fame if any critic catches at the word genius the author tells him once all that he certainly looks upon himself possessed of some poetic abilities otherwise his publishing in the manner he has done would be manœuvre below the worst character which he hopes his worst enemy will ever give him but to the genius of ramsay or the glorious dawnings of the poor unfortunate fergusson he with equal unaffected sincerity declares that even in his highest pulse of vanity he has not the most distant pretensions these two justly admired scotch poets he has often had in his eye in the following pieces but rather with view to kindle at their ﬂame than servile imitation to his subscriber the author returns his most sincere thanks not the mercenary bow over counter but the gratitude of the bard conscious how much he owes to benevolence and friendship gratifying him if he deserves it in that dearest wish of every poetic be distinguished he begs his readers particularly the learned and the polite who may honour him with perusal that they will make every allowance education and circumstances of life but if after fair candid and impartial criticism he shall stand convicted of dulness and nonsense let him be done by he would in that case by him be condemned

and frankness of his manners left an impression on the mind of the poet which was never effaced the verses which the poet wrote on the occasion are among the most imperfect of his pieces but few stanzas may perhaps be matter of curiosity both on account of the character to which they relate and the light which they throw on the situation and the feelings of the writer before his work was known to the basil lord daer the uncle of the present earl of selkirk was born in the year 1769 at the family seat of mary s isle he distinguished himself early at school and at college excelled in literature and science he had greater regard democracy than was then reckoned consistent with his birth and rank he was when burns met him in his year was very tall something careless in his dress and

herald s ofﬁce and looking through that granary of honours i there found almost every name in the kingdom but my ancient but ignoble blood has crept thro scoundrels ever since the pope gules purpure ar gent quite disowned my father was of the north of scotland the son of farmer and was thrown by early misfortunes on the world at large where after many years wanderings and sojournings he picked up pretty large quantity of observation and experience to which i am indebted most of my little pretensions to have met with few who understood men their manners and their ways equal to him but stubborn ungainly integrity and headlong ungovernable irascibility are disqualifying circumstances consequently i was born very poor man s son the ﬁrst six or seven years of my life my father was gardener to worthy gentleman of small estate in the neighbourhood of ayr had he continued in that station i must have marched off to be one of the little underlings about but it was his dearest wish and prayer to have it in his power to keep his children under his own eye till they could discern between good and evil so with the assistance of his generous master my father ventured on small farm on his estate at those years i was by means favourite with anybody i was good deal noted retentive memory stubborn sturdy something in my disposition and an enthusiastic idiot 175 piety i say idiot piety because i was then but child though it cost the schoolmaster some thrashings i made an excellent english scholar and by the time i was ten or eleven years of age i was critic in substantives verbs and particles in my infant and boyish days too i owed much to an old woman who resided in the family remarkable her ignorance credulity and superstition she had i suppose the largest collection in the country of tales and songs concerning devils ghosts fairies brownies witches warlocks spunki es kelpies wraiths apparitions cantraips giants enchanted towers dragons and other trumpery this cultivated the latent seeds of poetry but had so strong an effect on my imagination that to this hour in my nocturnal rambles i sometimes keep sharp look out in suspicions places and though nobody can be more sceptical than i am in such matters yet it often takes an effort of philosophy to shake off these idle terrors the earliest composition that i recollect taking pleasure in was the vision of mirza and hymn of addison s beginning how are thy servants blest lord i particularly remember one which was music to my boyish though in dreadful whirls we hung high on the broken i met with these pieces in mason s english collection one of my the ﬁrst two books i ever read in private and which gave more pleasure than any two books i ever read since were the life of hannibal and the history of sir william wallace hannibal gave my young ideas such turn that i used to strut in raptures up and down after the recruiting drum and and wish myself tall enough to be soldier while the story of wallace poured scottish prejudice into my veins which will boil along there till the of life shut in eternal rest polemical divinity about this time was putting the country half mad and i ambitious of shining in conversation parties on sundays between sermons at funerals used few years afterwards to puzzle calvinism with so much heat and indiscretio n that i raised hue and cry of heresy against which has not ceased to this hour my vicinity to ayr was of some advantage to my social disposition when not checked by some modiﬁcations of spirited pride was like our catechism deﬁnition of inﬁnitude without bounds or limits i formed several connexions with other younkers who possessed superior advantages the youngling actors who were busy in the rehearsal 352 the project gutenberg ebook of the complete

the two extremes of which were often exposed to all the inclemencies of all the seasons they would give stray volumes of books among them even then i could pick up some observations and one whose heart i am sure not even the munny begum scenes have tainted helped to little french parting with these my young friends and benefactors they occasionally went off the east or west indies was often to sore afﬂiction but i was soon called to more serious evils my father s generous master died the farm proved ruinous bargain and to clench the misfortune we fell into the hands of factor who sat the

spirit was soon irritated but not easily broken there was freedom in his lease in two years more and to weather these two years we retrenched our expenses we lived very poorly i was dexterous ploughman my age and the next eldest to was brother gilbert who could drive the plough very well and help to thrash the corn might perhaps have viewed these scenes with some satisfaction but so did not i my indignation yet boils at the recollection of the scoundrel factor s insolent threatening letters which used to set us all in tears this kind of cheerless gloom of hermit with the unceasing moil of slave brought to my sixteenth year little before which period i ﬁrst committed the sin of rhyme you know our country custom of coupling man and woman together partners in the labours of

ﬁrst of human joys our dearest blessing here below how she caught the contagion i can not tell you medical people talk much of infection from breathing the same air the touch but i never expressly said i loved i did not know myself why i liked so much to loiter behind with her when returning in the evening from our labours why the tones of her voice made my strings thrill like an æolian harp and particularly why my pulse beat such furious ratan when i looked and ﬁngered over her little hand to pick out the cruel tings and thistles among her other qualities she sung sweetly and it was her favourite reel to which i attempted giving an embodied vehicle in ryhme i was not so presumptuous to imagine that i could make verses like printed ones composed by men who had greek and latin but my girl sung song which was said to be composed by small country laird s son on one of his father s maids with whom he was in love and i saw reason why i might not rhyme well he excepting that he could smear sheep and cast peats his father living in the moorlands he had more scholar than myself thus with began love and poetry which at times have been my only and till within the last twelve months have been my highest enjoyment my father struggled on till he reached the freedom in his lease when he entered on larger farm about ten miles farther in the country the nature of the bargain he made was such to throw little ready money into his hands at the comm encement of his lease otherwise the affair would have been impracticable four years we lived comfortably here but difference commencing between him and his landlord to terms after three years tossing and whirling in the vortex of litigation my father was just saved from the horrors of jail by 353 the project gutenberg ebook of the

before one comes to the subject verses 9th and 10th in particular where ocean s unseen bound leaves drear world of waters round are truly beautiful the simile of the hurricane is likewise ﬁne and indeed beautiful the poem is almost all the similes rise decidedly above it from verse 31st to verse 50th is pretty eulogy on britain verse 36th that foul drama deep with wrong is nobly expressive verse 46th i am afraid is rather unworthy of the rest to dare to feel is an idea that i not altogether like the contrast of valour and mercy from the 36th verse to the 50th is admirable either my apprehension is dull or there is something little confused in the apostrophe to pitt verse 55th is the antecedent to verses 57th and 58th but in verse 58th the connexion seems ungrammatical powers with gradation mark d their ﬂight but rose at once to glory s ris n should be the word instead of rose try it in prose powers ﬂight marked by gradations but the same powers risen at once to the height

verse 85th to verse 108th is an animated contrast between the unfeeling selﬁshness of the oppressor on the one hand and the misery of the captive on the other verse 88th might perhaps be amended thus

objects is equally original and striking the character and manners of the dealer in the infernal trafﬁc is well done though horrid picture i am not sure how far introducing the sailor was right though the sailor s common characteristic is generosity yet in this case he is certainly not only an unconcerned witness but in some degre an efﬁcient agent in the business verse 224th is nervous the heart

the strongest description of selﬁshness i ever saw the comparison of verses 285th and 286th is new and ﬁne and the line your arms to penury you lend is excellent in verse 317th like should certainly

their lighting mixing diving and the glorious description of the sportsman this last is equal to anything in the the idea of the ﬂoati ng tribe distant seen far glistering to the moon provoking his

rights bred and educated in revolution principles the principles of reason and common sense it could not be any silly political prejudice which made my heart revolt at the harsh abusive manner in which the reverend gentleman mentioned the house of stewart and which i am afraid was too much the language of the day we may rejoice sufﬁcient ly in our deliverance from past evils without cruelly raking up the ashes of those whose misfortune it was perhaps much their crime to be the authors of those evils and we may bless god all his goodness to us nation without at the same time cursing few ruined powerless exiles who only harboured ideas and made attempts that most of us would have done had we been in their situation the bloody and tyrannical house of stewart may be said with propriety and justice when compared with the present royal family and the sentiments of our days but is there allowance to be made the manners of the times were the royal contemporaries of the stewarts more attentive to their subjects rights might not the epithets of bloody and tyrannical be with at least equal justice applied to the house of tudor of york or any other of their predecessors the project gutenberg ebook of the complete works of robert burns by allan cunningham https simple state of the case sir seems to be this that period the science of government the knowledge of the true relation between king and subject was like other sciences and other knowledge just in its infancy emer ging from dark ages of ignorance and barbarity the stewarts only contended prerogatives which they knew their predecessors enjoyed and which they saw their contemporaries enjoying but these prerogatives were inimical to the happiness of nation and the rights of subjects in the contest between prince and people the consequence of that light of science which had lately dawned over europe the monarch of france example was victorious over the struggling liberties of his people with us luckily the monarch failed and his unwarrantable pretensions fell sacriﬁce to our rights and happiness whether it was owing to the wisdom of leading individuals or to the justling of parties i can not pretend to determine but likewise happily us the kingly power was shifted into another branch of the family who they owed the throne solely to the call of free people could claim nothing inconsistent with the covenanted terms which placed them there the stewarts have been condemned and laughed at the folly and impracticability of their attempts in 1715 and that they failed i bless god but can not join in the ridicule against them who does not know that the abilities or defects of leaders and commanders are often hidden until put to the touchstone of exigency and that there is caprice of fortune an omnipotence in particular accidents and conjunctures of circumstances which exalt us heroes or brand us madmen just they are or against us man publisher is strange weak inconsistent being who would believe sir that in this our augustan age of liberality and reﬁnement while we seem so justly sensible and jealous of our rights and liberties and animated with such indignation against the very memory of those who would have subverted certain people under our national protection should complain not against our monarch and few favorite advisers but against our whole legisla body similar oppression and almost in the very same terms our forefathers did of the house of stewart i will not i can not enter into the merits of the cause but i dare say the american congress in 1776 will be allowed to be able and enlightened the english convention was in 1688 and that their posterity will celebrate the centenary of their deliverance from us duly and sincerely we ours from the oppressive measures of the house of stewart to conclude sir let every man who has tear the many miseries incident to humanity feel family illustrious any in europe and unfortunate beyond historic precedent and let every briton and particularly every scotsman who ever looked with reverential pity on the dotage of parent cast veil over the fatal mistakes of the kings of his forefathers cxxxix to dunlop at m

men who in fact guide the most part and govern our world are looked on so many modiﬁcations of wronghead edness they know the use of bawling out such terms to rouse or lead the rabble but their own private use with almost all the able statesmen that ever existed or now exist when they talk of right and wrong they only mean proper and improper and their measure of conduct is not what they ought but what they dare the truth of this i shall not ransack the history of nations but appeal to one of the ablest judges of men that ever celebrated earl of chesterﬁeld in fact man who could thoroughly control his vices whenever they interfered with his interests and who could completely put on the appearance of every virtue often it suited his purposes is on the stanhopean plan the perfect man man to lead nations but are great abilities complete witho ut ﬂaw and polished without blemish the standard of human excellence this is certainly the staunch opinion of men of the world but i call on honour virtue and worth to give the stygian doctrine loud negative however this must be allowed that if you abstract from man the idea of an existence beyond the grave then the true measure of human conduct is proper and improper virtue and vice dispositions of the heart are in that case of scarcely the same import and value to the world at large harmony and discord in the modiﬁcations of sound and delicate sense of honour like nice ear music though it may sometimes give the possessor an ecstasy unknown to the coarser organs of the herd yet consid ering the harsh gratings and inharmonic jars

plashing homeward with his on his shoulder having been getting some repairs on them at neighbouring smithy his way lay by the kirk of alloway and being rather on the anxious in approaching place so well known to be favourite haunt of the devil and the devil s friends and emissaries he was struck aghast by discovering through the horro rs of the storm and stormy night light which on his nearer approach plainly showed itself to proceed from the haunted ediﬁce whether he had been fortiﬁed from above on his devout supplication is customary with people when they suspect the immediate presence of satan or whether according to another custom he had got courageously drunk at the smithy i will not pretend to determine but so it was that he ventured to go up to nay into the very kirk luck would have it his temerity came of f unpunished the members of the infernal junto were all out on some midnight business or other and he saw nothing but kind of kettle or caldron depending from the roof over the ﬁre simmering some heads of unchristened children limbs of executed malefactors the business of the was in penny in pound with the honest ploughman so without ceremony he unhooked the caldron from off the ﬁre and pouring out the damnable ingredients inverted it on his head and carried it fairly home where it remained long in the family living evidence of the truth of the story another story which i can prove to be equally authentic was follows on market day in the town of ayr farmer from carrick and consequently whose way lay by the very gate of alloway ard in order to cross the river doon at the old bridge which is about two or three hundred yards farther on than the said gate had been detained by his business till by the time he reached alloway it was the wizard hour between night and morning though he was terriﬁed with blaze stream ing from the kirk yet it is fact that to turn back on these occasions is running by far the greatest risk of mischief he prudently advanced on his road when he had reached the gate of the d he was surprised and entertained through the ribs and arches of an old gothic window which still faces the highway to see dance of witches merrily footing it round their old sooty blackguard master who was keeping them all alive with the power of his the farmer stopping his horse to observe them little could plainly descry the faces of many old women of his acquaintance and neighbourhood how the gentleman was dressed tradition does not say but that the ladies were all in their smocks and one of them happening unluckily to have smock

one against he reached the middle of the arch of the bridge and consequently the middle of the stream the pursuing vengeful hags were so close at big heels that one of them actually sprung to seize him but it was too late nothing was on her side of the stream but the horse s tail which immediately gave way at her infernal grip if blasted by stroke of lightning but the farmer was beyond her reach however the unsightly tailless condition of the vigorous steed was to the last hour of the noble creature s life an awful warning to the carrick farmers not to stay too late in ayr markets the last

that nature puts on her sables to mourn the expiry of the cheerful day shepherd boy belonging to farmer in the immediate neighbourhood of alloway kirk had just folded his charge and was returning home he passed the kirk in the adjoining ﬁeld he fell in with crew of men and wom en who were busy pulling stems of the plant ragwort he observed that each person pulled ragwort he or she got astride of it and called out up horsie on which the ragwort ﬂew off like pegasus through the air with its rider the foolish boy likewise pulled his ragwort and cried with the rest up horsie and strange to tell away he ﬂew with the company the ﬁrst stage at which the cavalcade stopt was merchant s in bordeaux where without saying by your leave they quaffed away at the best the cellar could afford until the

which i sent you in my last conjugal love is passion which i deeply feel and highly venerate but somehow it does not make such ﬁgure in poesy that other species of the passion where love is liberty

modulations of the human soul still i am very poet in my enthusiasm of the passion the welfare and happiness of the beloved object is the ﬁrst and inviolate senti ment that pervades my soul and

air i think might ﬁnd place among your hundred lear says of his knights you know the history of the air it is curious enough good many years ago james miller writer in your good town gentleman whom possibly you know was in company with our friend clarke and talking of scottish music miller expressed an ardent ambition to be able to compose scots air clarke partly by way of joke told him to keep to the black keys of the harpsichord and preserve some kind of rhythm and he would infallibly compose scots air certain it is that in few days miller produced the rudiments of an air which clarke with some touches and corrections fashioned into the tune in question ritson you know has the same story of the black keys but this account which i have just given you clarke informed of several years ago now to show you how difﬁcult it is to trace the origin of our airs i have heard it repeatedly asserted that this was an irish air nay i met with an irish gentleman who afﬁrmed he had heard it in ireland among the old women while on the other hand countess informed that the ﬁrst person who introduced the air into this country was baronet s lady of her acquaintance who took down the notes from an itinerant piper in the isle of man how difﬁcult then to ascertain the truth respe cting our poesy and music i myself have lately seen couple of ballads sung through the streets of dumfries with my name at the head of them the author though it was the ﬁrst time i had ever seen them i thank you admitting and i shall take care to furnish you with new chorus in fact the chorus was not my work but part of some old verses to the air if i can catch myself in more than ordinarily propitious moment i shall write new altogether my heart is much in the theme i am ashamed my dear fellow to make the

request is doubly so by tedious apology to make you some amends soon i have extracted the necessary information out of them i will return you ritson s volumes the lady is not little proud that she is

idea of singing our songs in alternate stanzas and regret that you did not hint it to sooner in those that remain i shall have it in my eye i remember your objections to the name philly but it is the common abbreviation of phillis sally the only other name that suits has to my ear vulgarity about it which unﬁts it anything except burlesque the legion of scottish poetasters of the day whom your brother editor ritson ranks with my coevals have always mistaken vulgarity simplicity whereas simplicity is much eloignée from vulgarity on the one hand from af fected point and puerile conceit on the other i agree with you to the air that chorus would in some degree spoil the effect and shall certainly have none in my projected song to it it is not however case in point with rothemurche there in roy s wife of aldivalloch chorus goes to my taste well enough to the chorus going ﬁrst that is the case with roy s wife well in fact in the ﬁrst part of both tunes the rhythm is so peculiar and irregular and on that irregularity depends so much of their beauty that we must en take them with all their wildness and humour the verse accordingly leaving out the starting note in both tunes has i think an effect that regularity could counterbalance the want of try oh roy s wife of aldivalloch lassie wi the locks and compare with roy s wife of aldivalloch lassie wi the locks does not the lameness of the preﬁxed syllable strike you in the last case with the true furor of genius you strike at once into the wild originality of the air whereas in the ﬁrst insipid method it is like the

cut off at the smaller end until the aperture be large enough to admit the stock to be pushed up through the horn until it be held by the thicker end of the bone and lastly an oaten reed exactly cut and notched like that which you see every shepherd boy have when the s are green and full grown the reed is not made fast in the bone but is held by the lips and plays loose in the smaller end of the stock while the stock with the horn hanging on its larger end is held by the hands in playing the stock has six or seven ventages on the upper side and one like the common ﬂute this of mine was made by man from the braes of athole and is exactly what the shepherds wont to use in that country however either it is not quite properly bored in the holes or else we have not the art of blowing it

when we lost ramsay and oswald i have good reason to believe that the verses and music are both posterior to the days of these two gentlemen it is beautiful song and in the genuine scots taste we have few pastoral compositions i mean the pastoral of nature that are equal to this oh open the door lord gregor it is somewhat singular that in lanark renfrew ayr wigton kirkudbright and there is scarcely an old song or tune which from the title can be guessed to belong to or be the production of these countries this i conjecture is one of these very few the ballad which is long one is called both by tradition and in printed collections the lass of lochroyan which i take to be lochroyan in galloway the banks of the tweed this song is one of the many attempts that english composers have made to imitate the scottish manner and which i shall in these strictures beg leave to distinguish by the ap pellation of productions the music is pretty good but the verse s are just above contempt 503 the

the production of richard hewit young man that blacklock to whom i am indebted the anecdote kept some years amanuensis i not know who is the author of the second song to the tune tytler in his amusing history of scots music gives the air to oswald but in oswald s own collection of scots tunes where he afﬁxes an asterisk to those he himself composed he does not make the least claim to the tune saw ye johnnie cummin quo she this song genuine humour in the verses and lively originality in the air is unparalleled i take it to be very old clout the caldron tradition is mentioned in the bee that the second bishop chisholm of dunblane used to say that if he were going to be hanged nothing would soothe his mind so much by the way to hear clout the caldron played i have met with another tradition that the old song to this tune hae ye onie pots or pans or onie broken chanlers was composed on one of the kenmure family in the cavalier times and alluded to an amour he had while under hiding in the disguise of an itinerant tinker the air is also known by the name of the blacksmith and his apron which from the rhythm seems to have been line of some old song to the tune saw ye my peggy this

that reason be the original song yet i take this ballad of which i have quoted part to be old verses the two songs in ramsay one of them evide ntly his own are never to be met with in the side circle of our peasantry while that which i take to be the old song is in every shepherd s mouth ramsay i suppose had thought the old verses unworthy of place in his collection the flowers of edinburgh this song is one of the many effusions of scots title flowers of edinbur gh has manner of connexion with the present verses so i suspect there has been an older set of words of which the title is all that remains by the bye it is singular enough that the scottish muses were all have paid more attention to every description of scots songs than perhaps anybody living has done and i not recollect one single stanza or even the title of the most triﬂing scots air which has the least panegyrical referenc to the families of nassau or brunswick while there are hundreds satirizing may be thought panegyric on the scots poets but i mean it such myself i would always take it compliment to have it said that my heart ran before my head surely the gallant though unfortunate house of stewart the
