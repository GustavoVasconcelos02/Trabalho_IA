green and violet peacocks through the golden dusk stately nostalgically parade endleaf preface at the earliest period concerning which we have any accurate information about the sixth century japanese poetry already contained the germ of its later development the poems of this early date were composed of ﬁrst line of ﬁve syllables followed by second of seven followed by third of ﬁve and so on always ending with line of seven syllables followed by another of equal number thus the whole poem of whatever length poem of many lines was scarce even at that day always was composed of an odd number of lines alternating in length of syllables from ﬁve to seven until the close which was an extra seven syllable line other rules there were none rhyme quantity accent stress were disregarded two vowels together must never be sounded diphthong and long vowel counts two syllables likewise ﬁnal n and the consonant m in some cases this method of writing poetry may seem to the reader to suffer from serious disadvantages in reality this was not the case contrast it moment with the undigniﬁed welter of undigested and ex parte theories which academic prosodists have tried three hundred years to foist upon english verse and it will be seen that the simple japanese rule has the merit of dignity the only part of it that we occidentals could not accept perhaps with advantage to ourselves is the peculiarly oriental insistence on an odd number of syllables every line and an odd number of lines to every 11 12 the project gutenberg ebook of japanese prints by john gould fletcher https to the western mind odd numbers sound incomplete but to the chinese and japanese art is mainly expression of chinese thought the odd numbers are masculine and hence heavenly the even numbers feminine and hence earthy this idea in itself the antiquity of which man can tell deserves less than treatise be written on it but the place that treatise is not here to return to our earliest japanese form sooner or later this crystallized into what is called tanka or short ode this was always ﬁve lines in length constructed syllabically 5 7 5 7 7 or syllables in all innumerable numbers of these tanka were written gradually during the feudal period improvising verses became pastime in court circles some one would utter the ﬁrst three lines of tanka and some one else would cap the composition by adding the last two this division persisted the ﬁrst hemistich which was composed of 17 syllables grew to be called the hokku the second or ﬁnishing hemistich of 14 syllables was called ageku thus was born the form which is more peculiarly japanese than any other and which only they have been able to carry to perfection composing hokku might however have remained mere game of elaborate literary conceits and double meanings but the genius of one man this was the great bashō who may be called certainly the greatest epigrammatist of any time during life of extreme and voluntary and wandering bashō contrived to obtain over thousand disciples and to found school of hokku writing which has persisted down to the present day he reformed the hokku by introducing into everything he wrote deep spiritual signiﬁcance unde rlying the words he even went so far to disregard upon occasion the syllabic rule and to add extraneous syllables if thereby he might perfect his statement he set his face sternly against impromptus poemes and the like the number of his works were not large and even these he perpetually sharpened and polished his inﬂuence persisted long after his death disciple and priest of zen buddhism himself his work is permeated with the feeling of that doctrine zen buddhism bashō practised it may be called religion under the forms of nature everything on earth from the clouds in the sky to the pebble by the roadside has some spiritual or ethical signiﬁcance us blake words describe the aim of the zen buddhist well any one to see world in grain of sand and heaven in wild ﬂower hold inﬁnity in the palm of your hand and eternity in an hour bashō would have subscribed to this the sole rule of poetry and imagination the only difference between the western and the eastern mystic is that where one sees the world in the grain of sand and tells you all about it the other sees and lets his silence imply that he knows its meaning or to quote those who speak not know those who know not speak it must always be understood that there is an implied continuation to every japanese hokku the concluding hemistich whereby the hokku becomes the tanka is existent in the writer mind but never uttered 13 14 the project gutenberg ebook of japanese prints by john gould fletcher https us take an example the most famous hokku that bashō wrote might be literally translated thus an old pond and the sound of frog leaping into the water this means nothing to the western mind but to the japanese it means all the beauty of such life of retirement and contemplation bashō practised if we permit our minds to supply the detail bashō deliberately omitted we see the mouldering temple enclosure the sage himself in medita tion the ancient piece of water and the sound of frog into the silence of eternity the poem has three meanings first it is statement of fact second it is an emotion deduced from that third it is sort of spiritual allegory and all this bashō has given us in his seventeen syllables all of bashō poems have these three meanings again and again we get sublime suggestion out of some quite commonplace natural fact instance on the there is ﬂower more beautiful than the wild violet the wild violet scentless growing hidden and neglected among the rocks of the suggested to bashō the life of the buddhist hermit and thus this poem becomes an exhortation to shun the world if you would be sublime i need not give further examples the reader can now see himself what the main object of the hokku poetry is and what it achieved its object was some universalized emotion derived from natural fact its achievement was the expression of that emotion in the fewest possible terms it is theref ore necessary if poetry in the english tongue is ever to attain again to the vitality and strength of its beginnings that we sit once more at the feet of the orient and learn from it how little words can express how sparingly they should be used and how much is contained in the meanest natural object shakespeare who could close scene of brooding terror with the words but see the morn in russet mantle clad walks the dew of yon high eastern hill was nearer to the oriental spirit than we are we have lost shakespeare instinct nature and fresh individual vision and we are unwilling to acquire it through if we not want art to disappear under the froth of shallow egotism we must learn the lesson bashō can teach us that is not to say that by taking the letter the spirit we should in any way strive to imitate the hokku form good hokkus can not be written in english the thing we have to follow is not form but spirit let us universalize our emotions much possible let us become impersonal shakespeare or bashō was let us not gush about our ﬁne feelings let us admit that the highest and noblest feelings are things that can not be put into words therefore let us conceal them behind the words we have chosen our deﬁnition of poetry would then becom that of edwin arlington robinson that poetry is language which tells through reaction 15 16 the project gutenberg ebook of japanese prints by john gould fletcher https our emotional natures something which can not be put into words unless we set ourselves seriously to the task of understanding that language is only means and never an end poetic art will be dead in ﬁfty years from surfeit of superﬁcial cleverness and devitalized realism in the poems that follow i have taken my subjects certain designs of the or passing world school these prints made and produced purely popular consumption by artists who whatever their genius were despised by the literati of their time share at least one characteristic with japanese poetry which is that they exalt the most trivial and commonplace subjects into the universal signiﬁcance of works of art and therefore i have chosen them to illustrate my doctrine which is this that one must learn to well small things before doing things great that the universe is just much in the shape of hand it is in armies politics astronomy or the exhortations of that style and technique rest on the thing conveyed and not the means of conveyance and that though sentiment is good thing understanding is better the poems themselves they are in some cases not japanese at all but all illustrate something of the charm i have found in japanese poetry and art and if they induce others to seek that charm themselves my purpose will have been attained john g ould f letcher part i lovers embracing force and yielding meet together an
