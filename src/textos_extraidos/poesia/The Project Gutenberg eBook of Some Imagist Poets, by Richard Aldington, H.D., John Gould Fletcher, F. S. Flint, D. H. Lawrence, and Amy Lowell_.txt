all rights reserved published april 1915 pref ace in march 1914 volume appeared entitled des imagistes it was collection of the work of various young poets presented together school this school has been widely discussed by those interes ted in new movements in the arts and has already become household word differences of taste and judgment however have arisen among the contributors to that book growing tendencies are forcing them along different paths those of us whose work appears in this volume have therefore decided to publish our collection under new title and we have been joined by two or three poets who did not contribute to the ﬁrst volume our wider scope making this possible in this new book we have followed slightly different arrangement to that of the former anthology instead of an arbitrary selection by an editor each poet has been permitted to represent himself by the work he considers his best the only stipulation being that it should not yet have appeared in book form sort of informal of more than half the authors here arranged the book and decided what should be printed and what omitted but general rule the poets have been allowed absolute freedom in this direction limitations of space only being imposed upon them also to avoid any appearance of precedence they have been put in alphabetical order pg v pg vi the project gutenberg ebook of some imagist poets by richard aldington john gould fletcher flint lawrence and https it has been suggested that much of the misunderstanding of the former volume was due to the fact that we did not expla in ourselves in preface we have thought it wise to tell the public what our aims are and why we are banded together between one set of covers the poets in this volume not represent clique several of them are personally unknown to the others but they are united by certain common principles arrived at independently these principles are not new they have fallen into desuetude they are the essentials of all great poetry indeed of all great literature and they are simply these to use the language of common speec h but to employ always the exact word not the nor the merely decorative word to create new the expression of new not to copy old rhythms which merely echo old mood we not insist upon the only method of writing poetry we ﬁght it principle of liberty we believe that the individuality of poet may often be better expressed in than in conventional forms in poetry new cadence means new idea to allow absolute freedom in the choice of subject it is not good art to write badly about aeroplanes and automobiles nor is it necessarily bad art to write well about the past we believe passionately in the artistic value of modern life but we wish to point out that there is nothing so uninsp iring nor so an aeroplane of the year 191 1 to present an image hence the name imagist we are not school of painters but we believe that poetry should render particulars exactly and not deal in vague generalities however magniﬁcent and sonorous it is this reason that we oppose the cosmic poet who seems to us to shirk the real difﬁculties of his art to produce poetry that is hard and clear never blurred nor indeﬁnite finally most of us believe that concentration is of the very essence of poetry the subject of is too complicated to be discussed here we may say brieﬂy that we attach the term to all that increasing amount of writing whose cadence is more marked more deﬁnite and closer knit than that of prose but which is not so violently nor so obviously accented the regular verse we refer those interested in the question to the greek melic poets and to the many excellent french studies on the subject by such distinguished and authors remy gourmont gustave kahn geor ges duhamel charles vildrac henri ghéon robert souza andré spire etc we wish it to be clearly understood that we not represent an exclusive artistic sect we publish our work together because of mutual artistic sympathy and we propose to bring out our coöperative volume each year short term of years until we have made place ourselves and our principles such we desire contents richard ldingt on childhood 3 the poplar
