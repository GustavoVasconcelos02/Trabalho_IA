gutenberg of the https york truslove hanson comba 67 fifth avenue 1900 dedication to india so have i read this wonderful and speech by krishna and prince arjun held discoursing each with each so have i writ its wisdom here its hidden mystery england our india dear to she edwin arnold preface this famous and marvellous sanskrit poem occurs an episode of the mahabharata in the sixth or bhishma parva of the great hindoo epic it enjoys immense popularity and authority in india where it is reckon ed one of the five jewels pancharatnani of devanagiri literature in plain but noble language it unfolds philosophic al system which remains to this day the prevailing brahmanic belief blending it does the doctrines of kapila patanjali and the vedas so lofty are many of its declarations so sublime its aspirations so pure and tender its piety that schlegel after his study of the poem breaks forth into this outburst of delight and praise towards its unknown author magistrorum reverentia brachmanis inter sanctissima pietatis officia refertur ergo primum vates sanctissime numinisque hypopheta quisquis tandem inter mortales dictus fueris carminis bujus auctor cujus oraculis mens ad excelsa quaeque quaeque aeterna atque divina cum inenarraoih quddam delectatione rapitur primum inquam salvere jubeo et vestigia semper adore lassen this splendid tribute and indeed so striking are some of the moralities here inculcated and so close the parallelism ofttimes actually verbal between its teachings and those of the new testament that controversy has arisen between pandits and missionaries on the point whether the author borrowed from christian sources or the evangelists and apostles from him this raises the question of its date which can not be positively settled it must have been inlaid into the ancient epic at period later than that of the original mahabharata but mr kasinath telang has offered some fair arguments to prove it anterior to the christian the weight of evidence however tends to place its composition at about the third century after christ and perhaps there are really echoes in this brahma nic poem of the lessons of galilee and of the syrian incarnation its scene is the level country between the jumna and the sarsooti kurnul and jheend its simple plot consists of dialogue held by prince arjuna the brother of king yudhisthira with krishna the supreme deity wearing the disguise of charioteer great battle is impending between the armies of the kauravas and pandavas and this conversation is maintained in war drawn up between the opposing the project gutenberg of the https poem has been turned into french by burnouf into latin by lassen into italian by stanislav gatti into greek by galanos and into english by thomson and mr davies the prose transcript of the being truly beyond praise its fidelity and clearness mr telang has also published at bombay version in colloquial rhythm eminently learned and intelligent but not conveying the dignity or grace of the original if i venture to offer translation of the wonderful poem after so many superior scholars it is in grateful recognition of the help derived from their labours and because english literature would certainly be incomplete without possessing in popular form poetical and philosophical work so dear to india there is little else to say which the song celestial does not explain itself the sanskrit original is written in the anushtubh metre which can not be successfully reproduced western ears i have therefore cast it into our flexible blank verse changing into lyrical measures where the text itself similarly breaks the most part i believe the sense to be faithfully preserved in the following pages but schlegel himself had to say in reconditioribus semper poetafoster mentem recte divinasse affirmare non ausim those who would read more upon the philosophy of the poem may find an admirable introduction in the volume of mr davies printed by messrs trubner edwin arnold contents
