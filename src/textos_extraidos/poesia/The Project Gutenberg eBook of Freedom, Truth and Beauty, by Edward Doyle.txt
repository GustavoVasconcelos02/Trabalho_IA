is blind but like homer his mental vision is clear and broad and deep president schurman of cornell university commenting on doyle once said it is true today of yore that the genuine poet even though blind is the seer and prophet of his generation the poem here printed illustrates the point did we not know that it was published some ﬁfteen years ago in volume entitled the haunted temple we should assume that it was written on the occasion of the fall of the czar in fact however it merely foretells this event by some dozen years and how terribly applicable are the lines to the facts of today the prophecy is one capable of repeated fulﬁllment but it is prophet of nationalism that this man compels our particular attentio the prophecy is embodied in play entitled the comet play of our times brought out far back the play is microcosm of american life the chief character is college president and he it is that is chosen to expound the true nature of nationalism and to give voice and utterance to the principle of is it merely coincidence that at that time woodrow wilson was president of princeton or is it case of poetic vision wilson be it remembered was already national ﬁgure and

helpless authorities hopeless social life in shreds and patches the plot of the play founded on this state of affairs is rich in incident varied and sufﬁciently complex in color passion and character to furnish material an exciting spectacular representation the tragic element is strong but supported and shaded by the compan y of roysterers jester whose foolery is compound of bluff of that period and bluff of modern politics and athletics the jester the black company and the penitents together with the roysterers form now the foreground now the background of action which in itself is never without the dolorous sound of the death bell the doomed city is under spell comparable to that set forth so vividly in manzoni i promessi sposi says the villain of the plot he listens from his seat at

pyrotechnics of the church propaganda though the advance of scientiﬁc discovery has laid heavy hand on thaumatur gy of the sort it would doubt have its use when properly handled on modern stage the
