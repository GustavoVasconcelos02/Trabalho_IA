in his letters an the project gutenberg ebook of the poems of sidney lanier by sidney lanier https biography which could be properly prepared only by his wife these pages can give but sketch of his life and work sidney lanier was born at macon on the third of february his earliest known ancestor of the name was jerome lanier huguenot refugee who was attached to the court of queen elizabeth very likely musical composer and whose son nichola s was in high favor with james and charles director of music painter and political envoy and whose grandson nicholas held similar position in the court of charles ii portrait of the elder nicholas lanier by his friend van dyck was sold with other pictures belonging to charles after his execution the younger nicholas was the ﬁrst marshal or presiding ofﬁcer of the society of musicians incorporated at the restoration the improvement of the science and the interest of its professors and it is remarkable that four others of the name of lanier were among the few incorporators one of them john lanier very likely father of the sir john lanier who fought major at the battle of the boyne and fell gloriously at steinkirk along with the brave douglas the american branch of the family originated early 1716 with the immigration of thomas lanier who settled with other colonists on grant of land ten miles square which includes the present city of richmond one of the family thomas lanier married an aunt of geor ge washington the family is somewhat widely scattered chieﬂy in the southern states the father of our poet was robert lanier lawyer still living in macon his mother was mary anderson virginian of scotch descent from family that supplied members of the house of burgesses of virginia many years and in more than one generation and was gifted in poetry music and oratory his earliest passion was music child he learned to play almost withou t instruction on every kind of instrument he could ﬁnd and while yet boy he played the ﬂute organ piano violin guitar and banjo especi ally devoting himself to the ﬂute in deference to his father who feared him the powerful fascination of the violin it was the that above all others commanded his soul he has related that during his college days it would sometimes so exalt him in rapture that presently he would sink from his solitary worship into deep trance thence to awake alone on the ﬂoor of his room sorely shaken in nerve in after years more than one listener remarked the strange violin effects which he conquered from the ﬂute his devotion to music rather alarmed than pleased his friends and while it was here that he ﬁrst discovered that he possessed decided genius he some time shared the early notion of his parents that it was an unworthy pursuit and he rather repressed his taste he did not then know by what inheritance it had come to him nor how worthy is the art at the age of fourteen he entered the sophomore class of oglethorpe college an institution under presbyterian control near midway which had not vitality enough to survive the war he graduated in 1860 at the age of eighteen with the ﬁrst honors of his class having lost year during which he took clerkship in the macon at least one genuine impulse was received in this college life and that proceeded from professor james woodrow who was then one of sidney teachers and who has since been connected with the university the project gutenberg ebook of the poems of sidney lanier by sidney lanier https seminary in columbia during the last weeks of his life lanier stated that he owed to professor woodrow the strongest and most valuable stimulus of his youth immediately on his graduation he was called to tutorship in the college which position he held until the outbreak of the war and here with some hesitation i record true biography requires the development of his consciousness of possessing real genius one with this gift has right to know it just others know if they possess talent or shiftiness of resource while we not talk so much of genius now we did generation ago we can yet recognize the difference between the fervor of that divine birth and the cantering of the livery pegasus forth and back along the vulgar boulevards over which facile talent rides his daily hack only once or twice in his own private or in letter to his wife when it was needful in sickness and loneliness to strengthen her will and his by testifying his own deepest consciousness of power did he whisper the assurance of his strength but he knew it and she knew it and it gave his will peace in toil peace notwithstanding sickness or want or misapprehension calm above the zone of clouds i have said his genius he ﬁrst fully discovered in music i copy from his pencilled college what can not have been written after he was eighteen years old the boy had been discussing the question with himself how far his inclinations were to be regarded indicating his best capacities and his duties he says the point which i wish to settle is merely by what method shall i ascertain what i am ﬁt preliminary to ascertaining god will with reference to or what my inclinations are preliminary to ascertaining what my capacities are that is what i am ﬁt i am more than all perplexed by this fact that the prime inclination that is natural bent which i have checked though of my nature is to music and that i have the greatest talent indeed not boasting god gave it i have an extraordinary musical talent and feel it within plainly that i could rise high any composer but i can not bring myself to believe that i was intended musician because it seems so small business in comparison with other things which it seems to i might question here what is the province of music in the economy of the world similar aspirations he felt at this early age probably eighteen grand literary labor the same would bear witness we see here the boy talking to himself boy who had found in himself standard above anything in his fellows the breaking out of the war summoned sidney lanier from books to arms in april 1861 he enlisted in the confederate army with the macon volunteers of the second geor gia battalion the ﬁrst military organization which left geor gia virginia from his childhood he had had military taste even small boy he had raised company of boys armed with bows and arrows and so well did he drill them that an honored place was granted them in the military parades of their elders having volunteered private at the age of nineteen he remained private till the last year of the war three times he was offered promotion and refused it because it would separate him from his younger brother who was his companion in arms their singularly tender devotion would not allow them to be parted the ﬁrst year of service in virginia was easy and pleasant and he spent his abundant leisure in music and the study of german french and spanish he was in the battles of seven pines drewry the project gutenberg ebook of the poems of sidney lanier by sidney lanier https the seven days ﬁghting about richmond culminating in the terrible struggle of malvern hill after this campaign he was transferred with his brother to the signal service the joke among his less fortunate companions being that he was selected because he could play the ﬂute his headquarters were now short period at petersbur g where he had the advantage of small local library but where he began to feel the premonitions of that fatal disease consumption against which he battled ﬁfteen years the regular full inspirations required by the ﬂute probably prolonged his life in 1863 his detachment was mounted and did service in virginia and north carolina at last the two brothers were separated it coming in the duty of each to take charge of vessel which was to run the blockade sidney vesse l was captured and he was ﬁve months in point lookout prison until he was exchanged with his ﬂute he never lost it near the close of the war those were very hard days him and picture of them is given in his tiger lilies the novel which he wrote two years afterward it is luxuriant unpruned work written in haste the press within the space of three weeks but one which gave rich promise of the poet chapter in the middle of the book introducing the scenes of those four years of struggle is wholly devoted to remarkable metaphor which becomes an allegory and sermon in which war is pictured strange enormous terrible ﬂower which the early spring of 1861 brought to bloom besides innumerable violets and jessamines he tells how the plant is grown what arguments the horticulturists give cultivating it how christ inveighed against it and how its shades are damp and its odors unhealthy and what ﬁne specimen was grown the other day in north america by two wealthy landed proprietors who combined all their resources of money of blood of bones of tears of sulphur and what not to make this the grandest specimen of modern horticulture it is supposed by some says he that seed of this american specimen now dead yet remains in the land but this author who with many friends suffered from the unhealthy odors of the plant he could ﬁnd it in his heart to wish fervently that this seed if there be verily any might perish in the germ utterly out of sight and life and memory and out of the remote hope of resurrection forever and ever matter in whose granary they are cherished through those four years though earnestly devoted to the cause and fulﬁlling his duties with zeal his horror of war grew to the end he had entered it in crack regiment with dandy uniform and was ﬁrst encamped near norfolk where the gardens with the northern market hopelessly cut off were given freely to the soldiers who lived in every luxury and every man had his sweetheart in norfolk but the tyranny and christlessness of war oppressed him though he loved the free life in the saddle and under the stars in february 1865 he was released from point lookout and undertook the weary return on foot to his home in geor gia with the gold piece which he had in his pocket when captured and which was returned to him with his other little effects when he was released of course he had the ﬂute which he had hidden in his sleeve when he entered the prison and which had earned him some comforts he reached home march 15th with his strength utterly exhausted there followed six weeks of desperate illness and just he began to recover from it his beloved mother died of consumption he himself arose from his with pronounced congestion of one lung but found relief in two months of life with an uncle at point clear mobile bay from december 1865 to april 1867 he ﬁlled clerkship in montgomery and in the next month made his ﬁrst visit to new york on the business of publishing his tiger lilies written in april in september 1867 he took charge of country academy of nearly hundred pupils in prattville and was married in december of the same year to miss mary day daughter of charles day of the project gutenberg ebook of the poems of sidney lanier by sidney lanier https the years before lanier marriage belong dozen poems included in this volume two of them are translations from the german made during the war the others are songs and miscellaneous poems full of ﬂush and force but not yet moulded by those laws of art of whose authority he had hardly become conscio us his access to books was limited and he expressed himself more with music than with literature taking down the notes of birds and writing music to his own songs or those of tennyson in january 1868 the next month after his marriage he suffered his ﬁrst hemo rrhage from the lungs and returned in may to macon in very low health here he remained studying and afterward practising law with his father until december during this period there came in the spring and summer of 1870 more alarming decline with settled cough he went treatment to new york where he remained two months returning in october greatly improved and strong in hope but again at home he lost ground steadily he was now fairly engaged in the brave struggle against consumption which could have but one end so precarious already was his health that change of residence was determined on and in december 1872 he went to san antonio texas in search of permanent home there leaving his wife and children meanwhile at macon but the climate did not prove favorable and he returned in april during these ﬁve years sense of holy obligation based on the conviction that special talents had been given him and that the time might be short rested upon lanier until it was impossible to resist it longer he felt himself called to something other than country attorney practice it was the compuls ion of waiting utterance not yet enfranchised from texas he wrote to his wife were it not some circumstances which make such proposition seem absurd in the highest degree i would think that i am shortly to die and that my spirit hath been singing its before dissolution all day my soul hath been cutting swiftly into the great space of the subtle unspeakable deep driven by wind after wind of heavenly melody the very inner spirit and essence of all songs and hath blown upon in quick gusts like the breath of passion and sailed into sea of vast dreams whereof each wave is at once vision and melody now fully determined to give himself to music and literature so long he could keep death at bay he sought land of books taking his ﬂute and his pen sword and staff he turned his face northward after visiting new york he made his home in baltimore december 1873 under engagement ﬁrst ﬂute the peabody symphony concerts with his settlement in baltimore begins story of brave and sad struggle the history of genius records on the one hand was the opportunity study and the full consciousness of power and will never subdued and on the other body wasting with consumption that must be forced to task beyond its strength not merely to express the thoughts of beauty which strove utterance but from the necessity of providing bread his babes his father would have had him return to macon and settle down with him in business and share his income but that would have been the suicide of every duty and ambition so he wrote from baltimore to his father november 29 the project gutenberg ebook of the poems of sidney lanier by sidney lanier https i have given your last letter the fullest and most careful consideration after doing so i feel sure that macon is not the place if you could taste the delicious crystalline air and the champagne breeze that i just been rushing about in i am equally sure that in point of climate you would agree with that my chance life is ten times great here in macon then to business why should i nay how can i settle myself down to be struggling lawyer the balance of my little life long there is certainty almost absolute that i can some other thing so much better several persons from whose judgment in such matters there can be appeal have told instance that i am the greatest in the world and several others of equally authoritative judgment have given an almost equal encouragement to work with my pen of course i protest against the necessity which makes write such things about myself i only so because i so appreciate the love and tenderness which prompt you to desire with you that i will make the fullest explanation possible of my course out of reciprocal honor and respect the motives which lead you to think differently from my dear father think how twenty years through poverty through pain through weariness through sickness through the uncongenial atmosphere of farcical college and of bare army and then of an exacting business life through all the discouragement of being wholly unacquainted with literary people and literary ways i say think how in spite of all these depressing circumstances and of thousand more which i could enumerate these two ﬁgures of music and of poetry have steadily kept in my heart so that i could not banish them does it not seem to you to that i begin to have the right to enroll myself among the devotees of these two sublime arts after having followed them so long and so humbly and through so much bitterness what could his father but yield and what could he during the following years of his son ﬁght on the planet but help but that help generously given by his father and brother their ability allowed at the critical times of utter prostration the end would not have been long delayed the little that was necessary to give his household humble support it was not easy the most strenuous young author to win by his pen in the intervals between his hemorrhages he asked very little only the supp ly of absolute necessities what it would be easy well man to earn but what it was very hard man to earn scarce able to leave his bed dependent on the chance income had from poems and articles in magazines that would take them or from courses of lectures in schools often months together he could work he was driven to texas to florida to pennsylvania to north carolina to try to recover health from pine breaths and clover blossoms supported by the implicit faith of one heart which fully believed in his genius and was willing to wait if he could only ﬁnd his opportunity his courage never failed he still kept before himself ﬁrst his ideal and his mission and he longed to live that he might accomplish them it must have been in such mood that soon after coming to baltimore he wrote to his wife who was detained in the south so many great ideas art are born to each day i am swept away into the land of by their strenuous sweet whirlwind and i ﬁnd within myself such entire yet humble conﬁdence of possessing every single element of power to carry them all out save the little paltry sum of money that would sufﬁce to keep

know then that disappointments were inevitable and will still come until i have fought the battle which every great artist has had to ﬁght since time began this dimly felt while i was doubtful of my own vocation and powers is clear the sun to now that i know through the ﬁercest tests of life that i am in soul and shall be in life and utterance great poet the philosophy of my disappointments is

absurdity says schumann in one of his letters the publishers will not listen to moment and dost thou not remember schubert and richter and john keats and sweet host more now this is written because i sit here in my room daily and picture thee picturing worn and troubled or disheartened and because i not wish thee to think up any groundless sorrow in thy soul of course i have my keen sorrows momentarily more keen than i would like any one to know but i thank god that in knowledge of him and of myself which cometh to daily in fresh revelations i have steadfast ﬁrmament of blue in which all clouds soon dissolve i have wanted to say this several times of late but it is not easy to bring one self to talk so of one self even to one dearer self have then fears nor anxieties in my behalf look

the heart that needs it will ﬁnd it having now given sacredly to art what vital forces his will could command he devoted himself with an intense energy to the study of english literature making himself master of and early english texts and pursuing the study down to our own times he read freely also and with scholar nice eagerness in further ﬁelds of study but all with view to gathering the stores which full man might draw from in the practice of poetic art he had that large compass which sees and seeks truths in various excursions and ﬁeld of history or philology or philosophy or science found him unsympathetic the opportunity these studies opened new in his development while we begin to ﬁnd crystallization of that theory of formal verse which he adopted and growing power to master it to this artistic side of poetry he gave from this time very special study until he had formulated it in his lectures in the johns hopkins university and in his volume the science of english verse the project gutenberg ebook of the poems of sidney lanier by sidney lanier https from this time the struggle against his fatal disease was conscious and constant in may 1874 he visited florida under an engagement to write book distribution by railroad company two months of the summer were spent with his family at sunnyside where corn was written this poem publish ed in lippincott magazine was much copied and made him known to many admirers one of these was of so much value to him bayard taylor at whose suggestion he was chosen to write the cantata the opening of the centennial exposition at philadelphia and with whom he carried on correspo ndence so long taylor lived to taylor he owed introductions of value to other writers and his sympathy and aid his letters prove that he felt very grateful in his ﬁrst letter to taylor written august 7 1875 he says i could never describe to you what mere drought and famine my life has been regards that multitude of matters which i fancy one absorbs when one is in an atmosphere of art or when one is in conversational relation with men of letters with travellers with persons who have either seen or written or done large things perhaps you know that with us of the younger generation in the south since the war pretty much the whole of life has been merely not dying the selection of lanier to write the centennial cantata ﬁrst brought his name into general notice but its publication in advance of the music by dudley buck was the occasion of an immense amount of ridicule more or less it was written by musician to go with music under the new relations of poetry to music brought about by the great modern development of the orchestra and was not to be judged without its orchestral accompaniment the criticism it received pained our poet but did not at all affect his faith in his theories of art to his father he wrote from new york may 8 1876 my experience in the varying judgments given about poetry has all conver ged upon one solitary principle and the experienc of the artist in all ages is reported by history to be of precisely the same direction that principle is that the artist shall put forth humbly and lovingly and without bitterness against opposition the very best and highest that is within him utterly regardless of contemporary criticism what possible claim can contemporary criticism set up to respect that criticism which cruciﬁed jesus christ stoned stephen hooted paul madman tried luther criminal tortured galileo bound columbus in chains drove dante into hell of exile made shakes peare

work the project gutenberg ebook of the poems of sidney lanier by sidney lanier https but the engagement was broken two months later owing to the illness of the friend of the family who was to provide the material from the mass of private correspondence following this disappointment new cold was incurred and his health became so much impaired that in november the physici ans told him he could not expect to live longer than may unless he sought warmer climate about the middle of december he started with his wife the gulf coast and visited tampa gaining considerable beneﬁt from the mild climate in april he ventured north again tarrying through the spring with his friends in geor gia and after summer with his own family in chadd ford ﬁnal move was ventured in october to baltimore home here he resumed his old place in the peabody orchestra and continued to play there three winters the old english studies which he had pursued with such deep delight he now put to use in course of lectures on elizabethan verse given in private parlor to class of thirty ladies this was followed by more ambitious shakespeare course of lectures in the smaller hall of the peabody institute the undertaking was immensely cheered on and greatly praised but was ﬁnancial failure it opened the way however to one of the chiefest delights of his life his appointment lecturer on english literature the ensuing year at the johns hopkins university after some correspondence on the subject with president gilma n he received notice on his birthday 1879 of his appointment with salary attached it may be mentioned which gave him the ﬁrst income assured in any year since his marriage this stimulated him to new life he was now barely able to walk after severe illness and renewed hemorrhage the last two years had been more fruitful in verse than any that had gone before he had now acquired conﬁdence in his view of the principles of art in 1875 he had written in this little song special pleading i have begun to dare to give myself some freedom in my own peculiar style and have allowed myself to treat words similes and metres with such freedom i desired the result convinces that i can so now safely among his poems of this period may be mentioned song of the future the revenge of hamish and what are excellent examples of the kind of art of which he had now gained command the song of the chattahoochee and song of love it was at this time that he wrote the marshes of glynn his most ambitious poem thus far and one which he intended to follow with series of hymns of the marshes which he left incomplete the summer of 1879 was spent at rockingham springs and here in six weeks was begun and ﬁnished his volume science of english verse another severe illness prostrated him in september but the necessity of work allowed time such distractions in october he opened three lecture courses in young ladies schools and through the winter notwithstanding most menacing illness about january 1st he was in continuous rehearsals and concerts at the peabody and besides miscellaneous writings and studies gave weekly ten lectures upon english literature two of them public at the university two to university classes and the remaining six at private schools the university public lecture s upon english verse more especially shakespeare in part contained and in part were introductory to the science of

fourth son was born in august unable to bear the fall climate he returned alone early in september to his baltimore home this winter brought battle life in december he came to the very door of death before february he had essayed the open air to test himself his second university lecture course his improvement ceased on that ﬁrst day of exposure nevertheless by april he had gone through the twelve lectures there were to have been twenty which were later published under the title the english novel few of the earlier lectures he penned himself the rest he was obliged to dictate to his wife with the utmost care of himself going in closed carriage and sitting during his lecture his strength was so exhausted that the struggle breath in the carriage on his return seemed each time to threaten the end those who heard him listened with sort of fascinated terror in doubt whether the hoarded breath would sufﬁce to the end of the hour it was in december of this winter when too feeble to raise his food to his mouth with fever temperature of 104 degrees that he pencilled his last and greatest poem sunrise one of his projected series of the hymns of the marshes it seemed if he were in fear that he would die with it unuttered at the end of april 1881 he made his last visit to new york to complete arrangements with charles scribner sons the publication of other books of the king arthur series but in day or two aggravated illness compe lled his wife to join him and his medical adviser pronounced in pure high climate to be the last hope his brother clifford was summoned from alabama to assist in carrying out the plans encamping near asheville whither the brothers went soon after the middle of may by what seemed hopeful coincidence he was tendered commi ssion to write an account of the region in railroad interest he had done six years before with florida this provided monthly salary which was to be the dependence of himself and family the materials this book were collected and the book thoroughly shaped in the author mind when july ended but his increasing anguish kept him from dictating often from all speech hours and he carried the plan away with him site was chosen on the side of richmond hill three miles from asheville clifford returned to alabama after seeing the tents pitched and ﬂoored and lanier came with her infant to take her place nurse the invalid early in july lanier the father with his wife joined them in the encampment the passing weeks brought improvement to the sufferer he started august 4th on carriage journey across the mountains with his wife to test the climate of lynn polk county there deadly illness attacked him return was possible and clifford was summoned by telegraph and assisted his father in removing the encampment to lynn deceived by hope and pressed by business cares clifford went home august 24th and the father and his wife ﬁve days later expecting to return soon lanier own words written in the brief annals of

enough to assure him little leisure to write his poems then his feeble but resolute hold upon earth was exhausted what he left behind him was written with his high above all the evils of the world he lived in realm of ideal serenity if it were the business of life to conquer difﬁculties this is not the place an essay on the genius of sidney lanier it is enough to call attention to some marked points in his character and work he had more than milton love music he sung like bard to the accompaniment of harp he lived in sweet sounds forever conscious of ceaseless ﬂow of melody which if resisted while by business occupations would swell again in its natural current and break at his bidding into audible music we have the following recognition of his genius from asger hamerik his director six years in the peabody symphony orchestra of baltimore to him child in his cradle music was given the heavenly gift to feel and to express himself in tones his human nature was like an enchanted instrument magic ﬂute or the lyre of apollo needing but breath or touch to send its beauty out into the world it was indeed irresistible that he should turn with those poetical feelings which transcend language to the penetrating gentleness of the ﬂute or the inﬁnite passion of the violin there was an agreement spiritual correspondence between his nature and theirs so that they mutually absorbed and expressed each other in his hands the ﬂute longer remained mere material instrument but was transformed into voice that set heavenly harmonies into vibration its tones developed colors warmth and low sweetness of unspeakable poetry they were not only true and pure but poetic allegoric it were suggestive of the depths and heights of being and of the delights which the earthly ear never hears and the earthly eye never sees doubt his ﬁrm faith in these lofty idealities gave him the power to present them to our imaginations and thus by the aid of the higher language of music to inspire others with that sense of beauty in which he constantly dwelt his conception of music was not reached by an analytic study of note by note but was intuitive and spontaneous like woman reason he felt it so because he felt it so and his delicate perception required more logical form of reasoning his playing appealed alike to the musically learned and to the unlearned he would magnetize the listener but the artist felt in his performance the superiority of the momentary living inspiration to all the rules and shifts of mere technical scholarship his art was not only the art of art but an art above art i will never forget the impression he made on when he played the of emil hartmann at peabody symphony concert in 1878 his tall handsome manly presence his ﬂute breathing

his study had it not been that his mind was truly philosophically and scientiﬁcally accurate it was poetically sensuous and imaginative in letter to stedman he complained that in all directions the poetic art was suffering from the shameful circumstance that criticism was without scientiﬁc basis even the most elementary of its judgments although the work was irksome to him he could not go on writing at trusting to his own mere taste to decide what was good until he had settled himself scientiﬁcally what are the laws of poetical construction this accounts his exposition of the laws of beauty in that unique work the science of english verse which was based on dante thought the best conceptions can not be save where science and genius are the book is chieﬂy taken up with discussion of rhythm and in verse and it is well within the truth to say that it is the most complete and thorough original investigation of the formal element in poetry in existence the rhythm he treated the marking of deﬁnite time measurements which could be indicated by bars in musical notation having their regular time and their regular number of notes with their proper accent to this time measurement lanier gave the which coleridge and other writers have given to accent he conceived of line of poetry consisting of deﬁnite number of bars or feet each bar containing in dactylic metre three equal eighth notes of which the ﬁrst is accented or in iambic metre which has the same triple time of one eighth note and one quarter note with the accent on the second thus the accented syllable is not necessarily longer than the unaccented except the rhythm happens to make it so this idea is very fully developed and with great wealth of curious old english illustrations under the designation of he treats very suggestively of rhyme alliteration and vowel and consonant distribution showing how the recurrence of euphonic vowels and consonants secures that rich variety of which music gives in orchestration the work thus breaks away from the classic grammarian tables of trochees and anapaests and discusses the forms of poetry in the terms of music and of both and of rhythm he would say in the words of old king james the very whereof is music illustrations of these technical beauties of musical rhythm and vowel and consonant distribution abound in lanier poetry such is the song of the chattahoochee which deserves place beside tennyson brook it strikes higher key and is scarcely less musical such passages are numerous in his sunrise on the marshes in the lines beginning not slower than majesty moves or the other lines beginning oh what if sound should be made the project gutenberg ebook of the poems of sidney lanier by sidney lanier https investigations in the science of verse bore their fruit especially in the poems written during the last three or four years of his life when his sense of the solemn sacredness of art became more profound and he acquired greater ease in putting into practice his theory of verse and this made him thoroughly original he was imitator either of tennyson or of swinburne though musically he is nearer to them than to any others of his day we constantly notice in his verse that dainty effect which the ear loves and which comes from deft marshalling of consonants and vowels so that they shall add their suppler and subtler reinforcement to the steady infantry tramp of rhythm of this delicate art which is much more than mere alliteration which is concerned with dominant accented vowe ls well consonants with the easy ﬂow of liquids and fricatives and with the progressive opening or closing of the organs of articulation the laws are not easy to formulate but examples abound in lanier poems stedman poet and critic raises the question whether lanier extreme conju nction of the artistic with the poetic temperament which he says man has more clearly displayed did not somewhat hamper and delay his power of adequate expression possibly but he was building not the day but time he must work out his laws of poetry even if he had almost to invent its language to him was given the power of analysis well of construction and he was too conscientious to anything else than to ﬁnd out what was best and why and then tell and teach it he had learnt it even if men said that his late spring was delaying bud and blossom but it would be great mistake to ﬁnd in lanier only or chieﬂy the artist he had the substance of poetry he possessed both elements stedman says in extreme conjunction he overﬂowed with fancy his imagination needed to be held in check this was recognized in corn and appears more fully in the symphony the ﬁrst productions which gave him wide recognition poet illustrations too much abound to allow selection and the substance of invention there needed in lanier judgment large and exact knowledge of the world facts poet must be student of things truths and men his own studies were wide and his scholarship accurate he did not believe that art comes all by instinct without work in one of his keen criticisms of poets he said of edgar poe whom he esteemed more highly than his countrymen are wont to the trouble with poe was he did not know enough he needed to know good many more things in order to be great poet lanier had passion the exact truth and all of it the intense sacredness with which lanier invested art held him thrall to the highest ethical ideas to him the most beautiful thing of all was right he loved the words the beauty of holiness and it pleased him to reverse the phrase and call it the holiness of beauty when one reads lanier he is reminded of two writers milton and ruskin more than any other great english authors they are dominated by this beauty of holiness lanier was saturated with it it shines out of every line he wrote it is not that he never wrote maudlin line but that every thought was lofty that it must be so was ﬁrst postulate of his art hear his words to the students

portraying moral ugliness moral purpose may well give over his marble time whose judgments are inexorably moral will not accept his work indeed we may say that he who has not yet perceived how artistic beauty and moral beauty are conver gent lines which run back into common ideal origin and who therefore is not aﬁre with moral beauty just with artistic beauty that he in short who has not come to that stage of quiet and eternal frenzy in which the beauty of holiness and the holiness of beauty mean one thing burn one ﬁre shine one light within him he is not yet the great artist and he returns to the theme can not one say with authority to the young artist whether working in stone in color in tones or in character of the novel so far from dreading that your moral purpose will interfere with your beautiful creation go forward in the clear conviction that unless you are suffused soul and body one might say with that moral purpose which ﬁnds its largest expression in love that is the love of all things in their proper relation unless you are suffused with this love not dare to meddle with beauty unless you are suffused with beauty not dare to meddle with love unless you are suffused with truth not dare to meddle with goodness in word unless you are suffused with truth wisdom goodness and love abandon the hope that the ages will accept you an artist thus was it true was said of his work by his associate wm hand browne that one thread of purpose runs through it all this thread is found in his fervid love his and his never ceasing endeavors to kindle an enthusiasm beauty purity nobility of life which he held it the poet ﬁrst duty to teach and to exemplify and so there came into his verse solemn worshipful element dominating it everywhere and giving loftiness to its beauty he was the democrat whom he described in contrast to whitman mere brawny hero whose strength was only that of the biceps my democrat the democrat whom i contemplate with pleasure the democrat who is to write or to read the poetry of the future may have mere thread his biceps yet he shall be strong enough to handle hell he shall play ball with the earth and albeit his stature may be more than boy he shall still be taller than the great redwoods of california his height shall be the height of great resolution and love and faith and beauty and knowledge and subtle meditation his head shall be forever among the stars this standard he could not get in his judgments of artists there was something in whitman which refreshed him like harsh salt spray but to whitman lawlessness of art he was an utter foe we ﬁnd it written down in his notes whitman is poetry butcher huge raw collops slashed from the rump of poetry and never mind gristle is what whitman feeds our

thought took him to the deepest spiritual faiths and the vastness of nature drew him to trust in the inﬁnite above us thus his young search after god and truth brought him into the membership of the presbyterian church while at oglethorpe college and though in after years his creed became broader than that imposed by the church he had joined on its clergy he could not outgrow the simple faith and consecration which are all it requires of its membership his college notebook records his earnestness liberty patriotism and civilization are on their knees before the men of the south and with

elements with every spectrum the prism steals from star the old he has and all the new all this man of lanier breadth understood fully he had large capacity and he sought full equipment perhaps the most remarkable feature of his gifts was their complete symmetry it is hard to tell what register of perception or sensibility or wit or will was lacking the constructive and the critical faculties
