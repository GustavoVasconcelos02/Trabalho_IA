to trust himself more entirely to an author who writes under the fearful responsibility of involving the reputation of such bodies the archæol dahom or the acad lit et scient kamtschat i can not but think that the early editions of shakespeare and milton would have met with more rapid and general acceptance but the barrenness of their respective and i believe that even now publisher of the works of either of those justly distinguished men would ﬁnd his account in procuring their admission to the membership of learned bodies on the continent proceeding whit more incongruous than the reversal of the judgment against socrates when he was already more than twenty centuries beyond the reach of antidotes and when his memory had acquired deserved respectability i conceive that it was feeling of the importance of this precaution which induced locke to style himself on the page of his essay who should say to his readers that they could receive his metaphysics on the honor of gentleman

the difﬁculty of latinizing any of those honorary adjuncts with complete list of which i took care to furnish the proper persons nearly year beforehand or whether it had its origin in any more culpable motives i forbear to consider in this place the matter being in course of painful investigation but however this may be i felt the omission the more keenly i had in expectation of the new

sugariness of tamed and cultivated fruit it may be also that some touches of my own here and there may have led to their wider acceptance albeit solely from my lar ger experience of literature and authorship 9 i was at ﬁrst inclined to discourage biglow attempts knowing that the desire to poetize is one of the diseases naturally incident to adolescence which if the ﬁtting remedies be not at once and with bold hand applied may become chronic and render one who might else have become in due time an ornament of the social circle painful object even to nearest friends and relatives but thinking on further experience that there was germ of promise in him which required only culture and the pulling up of weeds from about it i thought it best to set before him the acknowledged examples of english composition in verse and leave the rest to natural emulation with this view i accordingly lent him some volume s of pope and goldsmith to the assiduous study of which he promised to devote his evenings not long afterward he brought some verses written upon that model specimen of which i subjoin having changed some phrases of less elegancy and few rhymes objectionable to the cultivated

of him who preached all his hearers out of the save only the sexton who remaining yet little space from sense of ofﬁcial duty at last gave out also and presenting the keys humbly requested our preacher to lock the doors when he should have wholly relieved himself of his testimony i confess to satisfaction in the self act of preaching nor i esteem discourse to be wholly thrown away even upon sleeping or unintelligent auditory i can not easily believe that the gospel of saint john which jacques cartier ordered to be read in the latin tongue to the canadian savages upon his ﬁrst meeting with them fell altogether upon stony ground the earnestness of the preacher is sermon appreciable by dullest intellects and most alien ears in this wise did episcopius convert many to his opinion s who yet understood not the language in which he discoursed the chief thing is that the messenger believe that he has an authentic message to deliver counterfeit messengers that mode of treatment which

refusing to shorten their pulpit eloquence it is possible that i having been invited into my brother biglow desk i may have been too little scrupulous in using it the venting of my own peculiar

of some larger ﬁsh jerks suddenly and ﬁnds that he has caught bottom hauling in upon the end of his line trail of various algæ among which nevertheless the naturalist may haply ﬁnd somewhat to repay the disappointment of the angler yet have i conscientiously endeavored to adapt myself to the impatient temper of the age daily degenerating more and more from the high standard of our pristine new england to the catalogue of lost arts i would mournfully add also that of listening to sermons surely we have been abridged into race of pygmies truly in those of the old discourses yet subsisting to us in print the endless spinal column of divisions and subdivisions can be likened to nothing so exactly to the vertebræ of the saurians whence the theorist may conjecture race of anakim propor tionate to the withstanding of these other monsters i say anakim rather than nephelim because there seem reasons supposing that the race of those whose heads though giants are constantly enveloped in clouds which that name imports will never become extinct the attempt to vanquish the innumerable heads of one of those aforementioned discourses may supply us with plausible interpretation of the second labor of hercules and his successful experiment with ﬁre af fords us useful precedent but while i lament the degeneracy of the age in this regard i can not refuse to succumb to its inﬂuence

lenitives good life behind him is the best thing to keep an old man shoulders from shivering at every breath of sorrow or but methinks it were easier an old man to feel the disadvantages of youth than the advantages of age of these latter i reckon one of the chiefest to be this that we attach less inordinate value to our own productions and distrusting daily more and more our own wisdom with the conceit whereof at twenty we wrap ourselves away from knowledge with garment reconcile ourselves with the wisdom of god i could have wished indeed that room might have been made the residue of the

is curiosity about the affairs of our neighbors which is not only pardonable but even commendable but i shall abide more ﬁtting season touching the following literary effort of esquire biglow much might be proﬁtably said on the topick of idyllick and pastoral poetry and concerning the proper distinctions to be made between them from theocritus the inventor of the former to collins the latest authour i know of who has emulated the classicks in the latter style but in the time of civil war worthy milton to defend and lucan to sing it may be reasonably doubted whether the publick never too studious of serious instruction might not consider other objects more deser ving of present attention concerning the title of idyll which biglow has adopted at my suggestion it may not be improper to animadvert that the name properly signiﬁes poem somewhat rustick in phrase though the learned are not agreed to the particular dialect employed by theocritus they are universanimous both to its rusticity and its capacity of rising now and then to the level of more elevated senti ments and expressions while it is also descriptive of real scenery and manners yet it must be admitted that the production now in question which here and there bears perhaps too plainly the marks of my correcting hand does partake of the nature of pastoral inasmuch the interlocutors therein are purely imaginary beings and the whole is little better than greek kapnou skias onar the plot was i believe suggested by the brigs of robert burns scott ish poet of the last century that found its prototype in the complaint of plainstanes and causey by fergusson though the metre of this latter be different by foot in each verse perhaps the two dogs of cervante s gave the ﬁrst hint i reminded my talented young parishioner and friend that concord bridge had long since yielded to the edacious tooth of time but he answered to this effect that there was greater mistake of an authour than to suppose the reader had fancy of his own that if once that faculty was to be called into activity it were better to be in the whole sheep than the shoulder and that he knew concord like book expression questionable in propriety since there are few things with which he is not more familiar than with the printed page in proof of what he afﬁrmed he showed some verses which with others he had stricken out too much delaying the action but which i communicate in this place because they rightly deﬁne which bartlett would have kind of perch creature to which i have found rod or pole not to be so easily equivalent in our inland waters in the books of arithmetic and because it conveys an eulogium on the worthy son of an excellent father with whose acquaintance eheu fugaces anni i was formerly honoured nowadays

present to write so fully i could wish my time being occupied with the preparation of discourse the forthcoming bicentenary celebration of the ﬁrst settlement of jaalam east parish it may gratify the publick interest to mention the circumstance that my investigations to this end have enabled to verify the fact of much historick importance and hitherto hotly debated that shearjashub tarbox was the ﬁrst child of white parentage born in this town being named in his father will under date august 7th or 9th it is well known that those who advocate the claims of mehetable goings are unable to ﬁnd any trace of her existence prior to october of that year respects the settlement of the mason and slidell question biglow has not incorrectly stated the popular sentiment so far i can judge by its expression in this locality myself i feel more sorrow than resentment i am old enough to have heard those talk of england who still even after the unhappy estrangement could not unschool their lips from calling her the mother but england has insisted on ripping up old wounds and has undone the healing work of ﬁfty years nations not reason they only feel and the spretæ injuria formæ rankles in their minds bitterly in that of woman and because this is so i feel the more satisfaction that our government has acted all governments should standing they between the people and their passions if it had arrived at years of discretion there are three short and simple words the hardest of all to pronounce in any language and i suspect they were easier before the confusion of tongues but which man or nation that can not utter can claim to have arrived at manhood those words are i was wrong and i am proud that while england played the boy our rulers had strength enough from the people below and wisdom enough from god above to quit themselves like men the sore points on both sides have been skilfully exasperated by interested and unscrupulous persons who saw in war between the two countries the only hope of proﬁtable return their investment in confederate stock whether political or ﬁnancial the alway s supercilious often insulting and sometimes even brutal tone of british journals and publick men has certainly not tended to soothe whatever resentment might exist in america it was right to dissemble your love but why did you kick down stairs we have reason to complain that england necessary consequence of her clubs has become great society the minding of other people business and we can smile naturedly when she lectures other natio ns on the sins of arrogance and conceit but we may justly consider it breach of the political convenances which are expected to regulate the intercourse of one government with another when men holding places in the ministry allow themselves to dictate our domestic policy to instruct us in our duty and to stigmatize unholy war the rescue of whatever people should hold most vital and most sacred was it in good taste that i may use the mildest term earl russell to expound our own constitution to president lincoln or to make new and fallacious application of an old phrase our beneﬁt and tell us that the rebels were ﬁghting independence and we empire if all wars independence were by nature just and deserving of sympathy and all wars empire ignoble and worthy only of reprobation or if these easy phrases in any way characterized this terrible struggle not so truly in any superﬁcial sense from the essential and deadly enmity of the principles that underlie it his lordship bit of borrowed rhetoric would justify smith nana sahib and the the project gutenberg ebook of the complete poetical works of james russell lowell by james russell lowell https while it would condemn nearly every war in which england has ever been engaged was it so very presumptuous in us to think that it would be decorous in english statesmen if they spared time enough to acquire some kind of knowledge though of the most elementary kind in regard to this country and the questions at issue here before they pronounced so hand judgment or is political information expected to come in england like reading and writing by nature and now all respectable england is wondering at our irritability and sees quite satisfactory explanation of it in our national vanity suave mari magno it is pleasant sitting in the chairs of downing street to sprinkle pepper on the raw wounds of kindred people struggling life and philosophical to ﬁnd in the cause of our instinctive resentment surely we were of all nations the least liable to any temptation of vanity at time when the gravest anxiety and the keenest sorrow were never absent from our hearts nor is conceit the exclusive attribute of any one nation the earliest of english travellers sir john mandeville took less provincial view of the matter when he said fro what partie of the erthe that men duellen other aboven or beneathen it semethe alweys to hem that duellen that thei gon more righte than any other folke the english have always had their fair share of this amiable quality we may say of them still the authour of the cabalistiques said of them more than century ago derniers disent natur

nation et pour du récit des grandes qualités la sienne of this bull we may safely say with horace habet fænum in cornu what we felt to be especially insulting was the quiet assumption that the descendants of men who left the old world the sake of principle and who had made the wilderness into new world patterned after an idea could not possibly be susceptible of generous or lofty sentiment could have feeling of nationality deeper than that of tradesman his shop one would have thought in listening to england that we were presumptuous in fancying that we were nation at all or had any other principle of union than that of booths at fair where there is higher notion of government than the constable or better image of god than that stamped upon the current coin it is time englishmen to consider whether there was nothing in the spirit of their press and of their leading public men calculated to rouse just indignation and to cause permanent estrangement on the part of any nation capable of and sensitively jealous ours then was of foreign interference was there nothing in the indecent haste with which belligerent rights were conceded to the rebels nothing in the abrupt tone assumed in the trent case nothing in the ﬁtting out of confederate privateers that might stir the blood of people already overchar ged with doubt suspicion and terrible responsibility the laity in any country not stop to consider points of law but they have an instinctive perception of the animus that actuates the policy of foreign nation and in our own case they remembered that the british authorities in canada did not wait till diplomacy could send home to england her slow ofﬁcial tinder to ﬁre the add to this what every sensible american knew that the moral support of england was equal to an army of two hundred thousand men to the rebels while it insured us another year or two of exhausting war it was not so much the spite of her words though the time might have been more tastefully chosen the actual power evil in them that we felt deadly wrong perhaps the most immediate and efﬁcient cause of mere irritation was the sudden and unaccountable change of manner on the other side of the project gutenberg ebook of the complete poetical works of james russell lowell by james russell lowell https only six months before the prince of wales had come over to call us

alliterative complime nts being so bitterly true that perhaps it will not be retracted even now to this outburst of affection we responded with genuine warmth if with something of the awkwardness of poor relation bewildered with the sudden tightening of the ties of consanguinity when it is rumored that he has come into large estate then came the rebellion and presto ﬂaw in our titles was

philosopher much to make him smile rather but the earth surface is not chieﬂy inhabited by philosophers and i revive the recollection of it now in perfect merely by way of suggesting to our british cousins that it would have been easier them to hold their tongues than us to keep our tempers under the circumstances the english cabinet made blunder unquestionably in taking it so hastily granted that the united states had fallen forever from their position power and it was natural that they should vent little of their vexation on the people whose inexplicable obstinacy in maintaining freedom and order and in resisting degradation was likely to convict them of their mistake but if bearing grudge be the sure mark of small mind in the individual can it be proof of high spirit in nation if the result of the present estrangement between the two countries shall be to make us more independent of british twaddle indomito nec dira ferens stipendia tauro so much the better but if it is to make us insensible to the value of british opinion in matters where it gives us the judgment of an impartial and cultivated outsider if we are to shut ourselves out from the advantages of english culture the loss will be ours and not theirs because the door of the old home stead has been once slammed in our faces shall we in huff reject all future advances of conc iliation and cut ourselves foolishly off from any share in the humanizing inﬂuences of the place with its ineffable riches of association its heirlooms of immemorial culture its historic monuments ours less than theirs its

this particular has said worst speak something good if all want sense god takes text and preacheth patience there are one or two other points in sawin letter which i would also brieﬂy animadvert upon and ﬁrst concerning the claim he sets up to certain superiority of blood and lineage in the people of our southern states now unhappily in rebellion against lawful authority and their own better interests there is sort of opinions anachronisms at once and anachorisms foreign both to the age and the country that maintain feeble and buzzing existence scarce to be called life like winter ﬂies which in mild weather crawl out from obscure nooks and crannies to expatiate in the sun and sometimes acquire vigor enough to disturb with their enforced familiarity the studious hours of the scholar one of the most stupid and pertinacious of these is the theory that the southern states were settled by class of emigran ts from the old world socially superior to those who founded the institutions of new england the virginians especially lay claim to this generosity of lineage which were of possible account were it not the fact that such superstitions are sometimes not without their effect on the course of human affairs the early adventurers to massachusetts at least paid their passages felons were ever shipped thither and though it be true that many deboshed younger brothers of what are called good families may have sought refuge in virginia it is equally certain that great part of the early deportations thither were the sweepings of the london streets and the leavings of the london stews it was this my lord bacon had in mind when he wrote is shameful and unblessed thing to take the scum of people and wicked condemned men to be the people with whom you plant that certain names are found there is nothing to the purpose even had an alias been beyond the invention of the knaves of that generation it is known that servants were often called by their masters names slaves are now on what the heralds call the spindle side some at least of the oldest virginian families are descended from matrons who were exported and sold so many hogsheads of tobacco the head so notorious was this that it became one of the jokes of contemporary playwrights not only that men bankrupt in purse and character were the plantations and this before the settlement of new england but also that any drab would sufﬁce to wive such pitiful adventurers choose wife if you were going to virginia says middleton in one of his comedies the mule is apt to forget all but the equine side of his pedigree how early the counterfeit nobility of the old dominion became topick of ridicule in the mother country may be learned from play of behn founded on the rebellion of bacon even these kennels of literature

back him that was ancient riches whence also the spanish were wont to call their nobles ricos hombr es and the aristocracy of america are the descendants of those who ﬁrst became wealthy by whatever means petroleum will in this wise be the source of much good blood among our posterity the aristocracy of the south such it is has the shallowest of all foundations it is only deep most odious of all while affecting to despise trade it traces its origin to successful trafﬁck in men women and children and still draws its chief revenues thence and though doctor chamberlayne consolingly says in his state of england become merchant of foreign commerce without serving any apprentisage hath been allowed disparagement to gentleman born especially to younger brother yet i conceive that he would hardly have made like exception in favour of the particular trade in question oddly enough this trade reverses the ordinary standards of social respectability less than of morals the retail and domestick is creditable the wholesale and foreign is degrading to him who follows it are our morals then better than mores after all i not believe that such aristocracy exists at the south i hold with marius fortissimum quemque gener osissimum will be found an element of anything like persistent strength in war thinking the saying of lord bacon whom one quaintly called inductionis dominus et verulamii true it is pithy that more gentlemen ever the lower books of subsidies it is odd enough an historical precedent that while the fathers of new england were laying deep in religion education and freedom the basis of polity which has substantially outlasted any then existing the ﬁrst work of the founders of virginia may be seen in wingﬁeld was conspiracy and rebellion yet showing the changes which are wrought by circumstance that the ﬁrst insurrection in south carolina was against the aristocratical scheme of the proprietary government i not ﬁnd that the cuticular aristocracy of the south has added anything to the reﬁnements of civilization except the carrying of knives and the chewing of tobacco southern gentleman being commonly not only quadrumanous but quidruminant i confess that the present letter of sawin increases my doubts to the sincerity of the convictions which he professes and i am inclined to think that the triumph of the legitimate government sure sooner

amply justiﬁed in resorting to that heroick treatment the felicity of which applied by the great bentley to milton had long ago enlisted my admiration indeed i had already made up my mind that in case

estimate of its length i would write down hypothetical inscription based upon antecedent probabilities and then proceed to extract from the characters engraven on the stone meaning nearly possible conformed to this priori product of my own ingenuity the result more than justiﬁed my hopes inasmuch the two inscriptions were made without any great violence to tally in all essential particulars i then proceeded not without some anxiety to my second test which was to read the runick letters diagonally and again with the same success with an excitement pardonable under the circumstances yet tempered with thankful humility i now applied my last and severest trial my experimentum crucis i turned the stone now doubly precious in my eyes with scrupulous exactness upside down the physical

of poetical composition which he was endowed by nature with remarkable aptitude his hymn beginning with clouds of care encompassed round has been attributed in some collections to the late president

notes appended to the verses we received them and purporting to be by scaliger bentley and others them the esprit voltair these we have omitted clearly meant to be humorous and altogether failing

the general reader even the alk though doubtless originally highly interesting in the domestic circle is so largely made up of theological discussion and matters of local or preterite interest that we have found it hard to extract anything that would at all satisfy expectation but in order to silence further inquiry we subjoin few passages illustrations of its general character i think i could go near to be perfect christian if i were always visitor i have sometimes been at the house of some hospitable friend i can show great deal of where the best of everything is urged upon with kindly importunity it is not so very hard to turn the other cheek kiss and when i meditate upon the pains taken our entertainment in this life on the endless variety of seasons of human character and fortune on the costliness of the hangings and furniture of our dwelling here i sometimes feel singular joy in looking upon myself god guest and can not but believe that we should all be wiser and happier

such not many who in material things are shrewd the squirrels lay up the spiritual winter of themselves and their children i have seen churches that seemed to garners of these withered nuts it is wonderful how prosaic is the apprehension of symbols by the minds of most men it is not one sect nor another but all who like the dog of the fable have let drop the spiritual substance of symbols

historical comment may be permitted here my late reverend predecessor was i would humbly afﬁrm free from prejudice falls to the lot of the most highly favored individuals of our species to be sure i have heard him say that were called strong prejudices were in fact only the repulsion of sensitive organizations from that moral and even physical efﬂuvium through which some natures by providential appointment like certain unsavory quadrupeds gave warning of their neighborhood better ten mistaken suspicions of this kind than one close encounter this he said somewhat in heat on being questioned to his motives always refusing his pulpit to those itinerant professors of vicarious benevolence who end their discourses by taking up collection but at another time i remember his saying there was one large thing which small minds always found room and that was great prejudices this however by the way the statement which i purposed to make was simply this down to 1830 jaalam had consisted of single parish with one house set apart religions services in that year the foundations of baptist society were laid by the labors of elder joash balcom 2d the members of the new body were drawn from the first parish wilbur was time considerably exercised in mind he even went so far on one occasion to follow the reprehensible practice of the earlier puritan divines in choosing punning text and preached from hebrew s xiii 9 not carried about with divers and strange doctrines he afterwards in accordance with one of his own maxims get dead injury out of the mind soon is decent bury it and then ventilate accordance with this maxim i say he lived on very friendly terms with rev shearjashub scrimgour present pastor of the baptist society in jaalam yet i think it was never unpleasing to him

added smiling at such times the only view which honorable members give of what goes on in the world is through their intercalumniations i smiled at this after moment reﬂection and he added gravely

papers which had appeared in the monthly to preﬁx an essay which not only gave personal narrative of the origin of the whole scheme but particularly dwelt upon the use in literature of the homely dialect in which the poems were couched in this cabinet edition it has seemed expedient to print the introduction here rather than in immediate connection with the poems themselves though prefaces

introduction private letter to the project gutenberg ebook of the complete poetical works of james russell lowell by james russell lowell https more than twenty years ago i wrote the ﬁrst of the series i had deﬁnite plan and intention of ever writing another thinking the mexican war i think it still national crime committed in behoof of slavery our common sin and wishing to put the feeling of those who thought i did in way that would tell i imagined to myself such an man i had often seen at antislavery gatherings capable of english but always instinctively falling back into the natural stronghold of his homely dialect when heated to the point of getfulness when i began to carry out my conception and to write in my assumed character i found myself in strait between two perils on the one hand i was in danger of being carried beyond the limit of my own opinions or at least of that temper with which every man should speak his mind in print and on the other i feared the risk of seeming to vulgarize deep and sacred conviction i needed on occasion to rise above the level of mere patois and this purpose conceived the rev wilbur who should express the more cautious element of the new england character and its pedantry biglow should serve its homely viviﬁed and heated by conscience the parson was to be the complement rather than the antithesis of his parishioner and i felt or fancied certain humorous element in the real identity of the two under seeming incongruity wilbur fondness scraps of latin though drawn from the life i adopted deliberately to heighten the contrast finding soon after that i needed some one of the mere drollery i conceive that true humor is never divorced from moral conviction i invented sawin the clown of my little i meant to embody in him that which i had noticed the recoil in gross natures from puritanism that still strove to keep in its creed the intense savor which had long gone out of its faith and life in the three i thought i should ﬁnd room enough to express it was my plan to the popular feeling and opinion of the time the names of two of my characters since i have received some remonstrances from very worthy persons who happe n to bear them i would say that they were purely fortuitous probably mere unconscious memories of or directories sawin sprang from the accident of rhyme at the end of his ﬁrst epistle and i purposely christened him by the impossible surname of birdofredum not more to stigmatize him the incarnation of destiny in other words of national recklessness to right and wrong than to avoid the chance of wounding any private sensitiveness the success of my experiment soon began not only to astonish but to make feel the responsibility of knowing that i held in my hand weapon instead of the mere i had supposed very far from being popular author under my own name so far indeed to be almost unread i found the verses of my pseudonym copied everywhere saw them pinned up in workshops i heard them quoted and their authorship debated i once even when rumor had at length caught up my name in one of its eddies had the satisfaction of overhearing it demonstrated in the pauses of concert that i was utterly incompetent to have written anything of the kind i had read too much not to know the utter worthlessness of contemporary reputation especially regards satire but i knew also that by giving certain amount of inﬂuence it also had its worth if that inﬂuence were used on the right side i had learned too that the ﬁrst requisite of good writing is to have an earnest and deﬁnite purpose whether æsthetic or moral and that even good writing to please long must have more than an average amount either of imagination or the ﬁrst of these falls to the lot of scarcely one in several generations the last is within the reach of many in every one that passes and of this an author may fairly hope to becom in part the mouthpiece if i put on the cap and bells and made myself one of the of king demos it was less to make his majesty the project gutenberg ebook of the complete poetical works of james russell lowell by james russell lowell https to win passage to his royal ears certain serious things which i had deeply at heart i say this because there is imputation that could be more galling to any man than that of being mere jester i endeavored by generalising my satire to give it what value i could beyond the passing moment and the immediate application how far i have succeeded i can not tell but i have had better luck than i ever looked in seeing my verses survive to pass beyond their nonage in choosing the yankee dialect i did not act without forethought it had long seemed to that the great vice of american writing and speaking was studied want of simplicity that we were in danger of coming to look on our mother dead language to be sought in the grammar and dictionary rather than in the heart and that our only chance of escape was by seeking it at its living sources among those

and milton to which of course the bible should be added but whoever should read the debates in congress might fancy himself present at meeting of the city council of some city of southern gaul in the decline of the empire where barbarians with latin varnish emulated each other in being more than ciceronian whether it be want of culture the highest outcome of that is simplicity or whatev er reason it is certain that very few american writers or speakers wield their native language with the directness precision and force that are common the day in the mother country we use it like scotsmen not if it belonged to us but if we wished to prove that we belonged to it by showing our intimacy with its written rather than with its spoken dialect and yet all the while our popular idiom is racy with life and vigor and originality bucksome milton used the word to our new occasions and proves itself mere graft by sending up new suckers from the old root in spite of us it is only from its roots in the living generations of men that language can be reinforced with fresh vigor its needs what may be called literate dialect grows ever more and more pedantic and foreign till it becomes at last

meaning of the mind which is behind the meaning of the words it has sometimes seemed to that in england there was growing tendency to curtail language into mere convenience and to defecate it of all emotion thoroughly algebraic signs this has arisen doubt in part from that health y national contempt of humbug which is characteristic of englishmen in part from that sensitiveness to the ludicrous which makes them so shy of expressing feeling but in part also it is to be feared from growing distrust one might almost say hatred of whatever is super there is something sad in the scorn with which their journalists treat the notion of there being such thing national ideal seeming utterly the project gutenberg ebook of the complete poetical works of james russell lowell by james russell lowell https forgotten that even in the affairs of this world the imagination is much matter the understanding if we were to trust the impression made on us by some of the cleverest and most characteristic of their periodical literature we should think england hopelessly stranded on the cynicism of and should fancy it an enchanted nation doomed to sit forever with its feet under the mahogany in that mood which follows conscientious repletion and which it is to disturb with any topics more exciting than the quality of the wines but there are already symptoms that large class of englishmen are getting weary of the dominion of consols and divine and to believe that eternal three per cent is not the chief end of man nor the highest and only kind of interest to which the powers and opportunities of england are entitled the quality of exaggeration has often been remarked on typical of american character and especially american humor in petri gedrängtes handbuch der fremdwörter we are told that the word humbug is commonly used the exaggerations of the americans to be sure one would be tempted to think the dream of columbu s half fulﬁlled and that europe had found in the west nearer way to orientalism at least in diction but it seems to that great deal of what is set down mere extravagance is more ﬁtly to be called intensity and picturesqueness symptoms ol the imaginative

public addresses commented at some length on the beauty and moral signiﬁcance ol the french phrase and called on his young friends to practise upon it in life there was not yankee in his audience whose problem had not always been to ﬁnd out what was about east and to shape his course accordingly this charm which familiar expression gains by being commented it were and set in new light by foreign language is curious and instructive i can not help thinking that matthew arnold forgets this little too much sometimes when he writes of the beauties of french style it would not be hard to ﬁnd in the works of french academicians phrases coarse those he cites from burke only they are veiled by the unfamiliarity of the language but however this may be it is certain that poets and peasants please us in the same way by translating words back again to their primal freshness and infusing them with delightful strangeness which is anything but alienation what example is milton of battle but doing into english of the latin acies was die gans gedacht der schwan vollbracht what the goose but thought that the swan full brought or to it little what the goose conceived that the swan achieved and it may well be that the life invention and vigor shown by our popular speech and the freedom with which it is shaped to the instant want of those who use it are of the best omen our having swan at last the part i have taken on myself is that of the humbler bird but it is afﬁrmed that there is something innately vulgar in the yankee dialect beuve says with his usual neatness déﬁnis un patois une

part of his deﬁnition applies to dialect like the provençal the last to the tuscan before dante had lifted it into classic and neither it seems to will quite ﬁt which is not properly dialect but rather certain archaisms proverbial phrases and modes of pronun ciation which maintain themselves among the uneducated side by side with the ﬁnished and universally accepted language norman french example or scotch down to the time of james could hardly be called patois while i should be half inclined to name the yankee lingo rather than dialect it has retained few words now fallen into disuse in the mother country like to tarry to progress ﬂeshy fall and some others it has changed the meaning of some in freshet and it has clung to what i suspect to have been the broad norman pronunciation of which molière puts into the mouth of his rustics in such words sarvant parfect vartoo and the like it maintains something of the french sound of also in words like chămber dănger though the latter had certainly begun to take its present sound so early 1636 when i ﬁnd it sometimes spelt dainger but in general it may be said that nothing can be found in it which does not still survive in some one or other of the english provincial dialects there is perhaps single exception in the verb to sleeve to sleeve silk means to divide or ravel out thread of silk with the point of needle till it becomes ﬂoss sléfan to cleave this i think explains the errand in and cressida so inadequately sometimes so ludicrously darkened by the commentators is not errand one that can not be unravelled incomprehensible and therefore bootless i am not speaking now of americanisms properly so called that is of words or phrases which have grown into use here either through necessity invention or accident such carry affair prairie to vamose even these are fewer than is sometime s taken granted but i think some fair defence may be made against the charge of vulgarity properly speaking vulgarity is in the thought and not in the word or the way of pronouncing it modern french the most polite of languages is barbarously vulgar if compared with the latin out of which it has been corrupted or even with italian there is wider gap and one implying greater boorishness between ministerium and métier or sapiens and sachant than between druv and drove or agin and against which last is plainly an arrant superla our rustic coverlid is nearer its french original than the diminutive into which it has been ignorantly corrupted in politer speech i obtained from three cultivated englishmen at different times three diverse pronunciations of single word cowcumber coocumber and cucumber of these the ﬁrst which is yankee also comes nearest to the nasality of concombr lord ossory assures us that voltaire saw the best society in england and voltaire tells his countrymen that handker chief was pronounced hanker cher i ﬁnd it so spelt in hakluyt and elsewhere this enormity the yankee still persists in and there is always reason such deviations from the sound represented by the spelling may we not suspect two sources of derivation and ﬁnd an ancestor kercher in couvertur rather than in couvr echef and what greater phonetic vagary which dryden by the way called fegary in our lingua rustica than this ker couvr i copy from the of my books where i have noted them from time to time few examples of pronu nciation and phrase which will show that the yankee often has antiquity and very respectable literary authority on his side my list might be largely increased by referring to glossaries but to them every one can go himself and i have gathered enough my the project gutenberg ebook of the complete poetical works of james russell lowell by james russell lowell https will take ﬁrst those cases in which something like the french sound has been preserved in certain single letters and diphthongs and this opens curious question to how long this gallicism maintained itself in england sometimes diver gence in pronunciation has given two words with different meanings in genteel and jaunty which i ﬁnd coming in toward the close of the seventeenth century and wavering between genteel and jantee it is usual in america to drop the u in words ending in very proper change recommended by howell two centuries ago and carried out by him so far his printers would allow this and the corresponding changes in musique musick and the like which he also advocated show that in his time the french accent indicated by the superﬂuous letters french had once nearly strong an accent

mortal merit hainous giant with many more and marston satires are full of them the two latter however are not to be relied on they may be suspected of chaucerizing herrick writes baptime the tendency to throw the accent backward began early but the incongruities are perplexing and perhaps mark the period of transition in warner england we have creator and crëatur side by side with the modern creator and creatur and occur in campion 1602 and yet envy survived milton in some cases we have gone back again nearer to the french in i had been so used to hearing imbecile pronounced with the accent on the ﬁrst syllable which is in accordance with the general tendency in such matters that i was surprised to ﬁnd in verse of wordsworth the dictionaries all give it so i asked highly cultivated englishman and he declared imbeceel in general it may be assumed that accent will ﬁnally settle on the syllable dictated by greater ease and therefore quickness of utterance example is more rapidly pronounced than to which our yankee clings following in this the usage of many of the older poets is easier than and therefore the false quantity has carried the day though the true one may be

narrative the word has its more common meaning of approving or praising said king much allowing this declaration said ducange quotes bracton sub voce adlocare the meaning admit proved and the transition from this to is by means violent izaak walton has allows waterfrogs to be good meat and here the word is equivalent to afﬁrms at the same time when we consider some of the meanings of allow in old english and of allouer in old french and also remember that the verbs prize and praise are from one root i think we must admit allaudar to share in the paternity of allow the sentence from hakluyt would read equally well our strengthe and praising or valuing their great eating of ﬂesh the cause of their increase in strength after all if we conﬁne ourselves to allocar it may turn out that the word was somewhere and somewhen used to bet analogously to put up put down post cf spanish apostar and the like i hear boys in the street continually saying i bet that good horse or what not meaning by means to risk anything beyond their opinion in the matter the word improve in the sense of to make use of employ pickering deﬁnes it he long ago proved to be neologism he would have done better i think had he substituted proﬁt by employ he cites franklin saying that the word had never so far he knew been used in new engla nd before he left it in 1723 except in mather providences which he oddly calls old book franklin pickering goes on to show was mistaken bartlett in his merel y abridges pickering both of them should have conﬁned the application of the word to material things its extension to which is all that is peculiar in the supposed american use of it surely letter have been this opportunity time out of mind i will illustrate the word little further because pickering

has been treated in the same way by whole nation and not lady among us by the uncultivated only it perhaps grew into use in the republics of italy in the same way and the same reasons with us but i admit that our abuse of the word is villainous i know of an orator who once said in public meeti ng where bonnets preponderated that ladies were last at the cross and ﬁrst at the tomb but similar sins

overpersuaded by the cunning of the painter i heard man in order to give notion of some very cold weather say to another that certain joe who had been taking mercury found lump of quicksilver in each

faculty at any rate there is humor here and not mere quickness of wit deeper and not the shallower quality the tendency of humor is always towards overplus of expression while the very essence of wit is its logical precision captain basil hall denied that our people had any humor deceived perhaps by their gravity of manner but this very seriousness is often the outward sign of that humorous quality of the mind which delights in ﬁnding an element of identity in things seemingly the most incongruous and then again in forcing an incongruity upon things identical perhaps captain hall had humor himself and if so he would never ﬁnd it did he always feel the point of what was said to himself i doubt it because i happen to know chance he once had given him in vain the captain was walking up and down the veranda of country tavern in massachusetts while the coach changed horses thunder was going on and with that pleasant european air of indirect compliment in condescending to be surprised by american merit which we ﬁnd so conciliating he said to countryman lounging against the door heavy thunder you have here the other who had divined at glance his feeling of generous concession to new country drawled gravely we du considerin the number of inhabitants this the more i analyze it the more humorous does it seem the same man was capable of wit also when he would he was

or if i had sooner thought of noting the yankeeisms i met with in my reading i might have been able to more justice to my theme but i have done all i wished in respect to pronunciation if i have proved that where we are vulgar we have the countenance of very good company to the jus et norma loquendi i agree with horace and those who have paraphrased or commented him from boileau to gray i

your greeks and trojans and the whole of homer iliad or much of it you please i had some such feeling of the impertinence of our when i chose our homely dialect to work in should we be nothing because somebody had contrived to be something and that perhaps in provincial dialect ages ago and to be nothing by our very attempt to be that something which they had already been and which therefore nobody could be again without being bore is there way left then i thought of being natural of being naïf which means nothing more than native of belonging to the age and country in which you are born the yankee at least is new phenomenon let us try to be that it is perhaps pis aller but is not thor oughfar written up everywhere else in the literary world things seemed to very much they were in the latter half of the last century pope skimming the cream of good sense and expression wherever he could ﬁnd it had made not exactly poetry but an honest salable butter of worldly wisdom which pleasantly lubricated some of the drier morsels of life daily bread and seeing this scores of harmlessly insane people went on the next ﬁfty years coaxing his buttermilk with the regular up and down of the pentameter churn and in our day we not scent everywhere and even carry away in our clothes against our will that faint perfume of musk which tennyson has left behind him or worse of heine patchouli and might it not be possible to escape them by turning into one of our narrow new england lanes shut in though it were by bleak stone walls on either hand and where better ﬂowers were to be gathered than goldenrod and hardhack beside the advantage of getting out of the beaten track our dialect offered others hardly inferior i was about to make an endeavor to state them i remembered something that the clear goethe had said about hebel gedichte which making proper deduction special reference to the book under review expresses what i would have said far better than i could hope to

by the approval of many whose opinions i valued with feeling too tender and grateful to be mixed with any vanity i mention one of these the late clough who more than any one of those i have known longer living except hawthorne impressed with the constant presence of that indeﬁnable thing we call genius he often suggested that i should try my hand at some yankee pastorals which would admit of more sentiment and higher tone without foregoing the advantage offered by the dialect i have never completed anything of the kind but in this second series both my remembrance of his counsel and the deeper feeling called up by the great interests at stake led to venture some passages nearer to what is called poetical than could have been admitted without incongruity into the former series the time seemed calling to with the old poet then your wonted prattle the oaten reed forbear i hear sound of battle and trumpets rend the air the only attempt i had ever made at anything like pastoral if that may be called an attempt which was the result almost of pure accident was in courtin while the introduction to the first series was going through the press i received word from the printer that there was blank page left which must be ﬁlled i sat down at once and improvised another ﬁctitious of the press in which because verse would ﬁll up space more cheaply than prose i inserted an extract from supposed ballad of biglow i kept copy of it and the printer directed cut it off when the gap was ﬁlled presently i began to receive letters asking the rest of it sometimes the balance of it i had none but to answer such demands i patched conclusion upon it in later edition those who had only the ﬁrst continued to importune afterward being asked to write it out an autograph the baltimore sanitary commission fair i added other verses into some of which i fused little more sentiment in homely way and after fashion completed it by sketching in the characters and making connected story most likely i have spoiled it but i shall put it at the end of this introduction to answer once all those kindly importunings i have seen extracts from what purported to be writings of biglow which were not genuine i may properly take this opportunity to say that the two volumes now published contain every line i ever printed under that pseudonyme and that i have never so far i can remember written an anonymous article elsewhere than in the american review and the monthly during my editorship of it except review of stowe wooing and some twenty years ago sketch of the antislavery movement in america an english journal word more on pronunciation i have endeavored to express this so far i could by the types taking such pains i fear may sometimes make the reading harder than need be at the same time by studying uniformity i have sometimes been obliged to sacriﬁce minute exactness the emphasis often modiﬁes the habitual sound example is commonly fer shorter sound than fur far but when emphatic it always becomes so too is pronounced like to it was anciently spelt and to like ta the sound in the tou of touch but too when emphatic changes into tue and to sometimes in similar

said on this head in the preface to the former volume of course in what i have said i wish to be understood keeping in mind the difference between provincialisms properly so called and slang slang is always vulgar because it is not natural but an affected way of talking and all mere tricks of speech or writing are offensive i not think that biglow can be fairly charged with vulgarity and i should have entirely failed in my design if i had not made it appear that high and even reﬁned sentiment may coexist with the shrewder and more comic elements of the yankee character i believe that what is essentially vulgar and in politics seldom has its source in the body of the people but much rather among those who are made timid by their wealth or selﬁsh by their love of power democracy can affor d much better than an aristocracy to follow out its convictions and is perhaps better qualiﬁed to build those convictions on plain principles of right and wrong rather than on the shifting sands of expediency i had always thought slick libel on the yankee character and complete falsiﬁcation of yankee modes of speech though aught i know it may be true in both respects so far the british provinces are concerned to the dialect was native was spoken all about when boy at time when an irish was rare an american one now since then i have made study of it so far opportunity allowed but when i write in it it is in mother tongue and i am carried back far beyond any studies of it to noonings in my father and to the talk of sam and job over their jug of blackstrap under the shadow of the which still dapples the grass whence they have been gone so long but life is short and prefaces should be and so my good friends to whom this introductory epistle is addressed farewell though some of you have remonstrated with i shall never write any more papers however great the temptation especially at the present time it be to complete the original plan of this series by bringing out sawin an union man

russell lowell by james russell lowell https moreover i am longer the same careless youth with nothing to but live to myself my books and my friends that i was then i always hated politics in the ordinary sense of the word and i am not likely to grow fonder of them now that i have learned how rare it is to ﬁnd man who can keep principle clear from party and personal prejudice or can conceive the possibility of another doing so i feel if i could in some sort claim to be an emeritus and i am sure that political satire will have full justice done it by that genuine and delightful humorist the rev petroleum nasby i regret that i killed off wilbur so soon he would have enabled to bring into this preface number of learned quotations which must now go and also enabled to dispersonalize myself into vicarious egotism he would have helped likewise in clearing myself from charge which i shall brieﬂy touch on because my friend hughes has found it needful to defend in his preface to one of the english editions of the papers i thank hughes heartily his friendly care of my good name and were his preface accessible to my readers here i am glad it is not its partiality makes blush i should leave the matter where he left it the charge is of profanity brought in by persons who proclaimed african slavery of divine institution and is based so far i have heard on two passages in the first you gut to git up airly ef you want to take in god and send the bill to you and on some scriptural illustrations by mr sawin now in the ﬁrst place i was writing under an assumed character and must talk the person would whose mouthpiece i made myself will any one familiar with the new england countryman venture to tell that he does not speak of sacred things familiarly that biblical allusions allusions that is to the single book with whose language from his habits he is intimate are not frequent on his lips if so he can not have pursued his studies of the character on so many muster and at so many but i scorn any such line of defence and will confess at once that one of the things i am proud of in my countrymen is i am not speaking now of such persons i have assumed sawin to be that they not put their maker away far from them or interpret the fear of god into being afraid of him the talmudists had conceived deep truth when they said that things were in the power of god save the fear of god and when people stand in great dread of an invisible power i suspect they mistake quite another personage the deity i might justify myself the passages criticised by many parallel ones from scripture but i need not the reverend homer wilbur supply with three apposite quotations the ﬁrst is from father of the roman church the second from father of the anglican and the third from father of modern english poetry the puritan divines would furnish with many more such bernard says sapiens nummularius est deus nummum ﬁctum non recipiet cunning changer is god he will take in base
