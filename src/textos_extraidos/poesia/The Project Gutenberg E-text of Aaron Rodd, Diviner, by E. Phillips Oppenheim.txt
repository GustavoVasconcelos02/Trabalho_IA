miracle had found its way through pall of clouds and mist suddenly fell though exhausted across the asphalt path of the embankment gardens tall gaunt young man who had been seated with folded arms in the corner of one of the seats stared at it though bewildered his eyes suddenly met those of young lady in deep black who was gazing about her in similar stupefaction almost at once and with perfect spontaneity she smiled upon him but it is astonishing this she exclaimed sunshine in january the young man was little confused he was very diffident and such lack of conventionality on the part of perfect stranger surprised him it is unusual he admitted it is thing which i have never seen she went on dropping voice little and glancing towards close at hand in which an elderly and very looking old gentleman was muffled up in furs and apparently asleep it is something even which i had not dared to hope we seem so far here from everything that is bright and beautiful and cheerful aaron rodd who was shy and awkward being felt unexpectedly at his ease he was even anxious further conversation he had rather long pale face with eyes and rugged features he was soberly even sombrely dressed in dismal black he had the air of recluse perhaps that was why the young lady smiled upon him with such confidence you are not english he ventured she shook her head what we are now alas she sighed glancing towards the i scarcely know we have country like every one else in such plight we come to england it is your father who sleeps there he enquired it is my grandfather she told him and i and my have passed through terrible times he has lost all power to sleep at night in the daytime when it does not rain he is wheeled out here and if it is only not too cold then he sleeps he does now and i watch you are very young to have char ge of him she smiled little pitifully one grows old so quickly in these terrible days i am already but you she went see how inquisitive i am saw you yesterday from the distance seated here there are nursemaids and queer fragments of humanity who seem to pass through these gardens and loiter and sometimes there are those with affairs who go on their way but you think of you sit there you are writer perhaps he laughed little harshly his voice was not altogether pleasant i am lawyer he declared without practice sometimes the ghosts who call at my empty of fice stifle and i come out here to escape from them lawyer an avocat she repeated softly to the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https she found something to interest her in the statement she glanced towards the sleeping man then she came little nearer he was conscious of very delightful and altogether perfume aware suddenly that her eyes were the colour of violets framed underneath with deep but not unbecoming lines that her mouth was curved in fashion strange to him englishmen they say are so much to be trusted she murmured and lawyer too i am an american by birth he interposed although i have lived over here nearly all my life it is the same thing we need advice so badly let ask you one question is it not the first principle of lawyer to hold sacred whatever confidence his client may confide in him absolutely he assured her even if that confidence she persiste d should bring the person who offered it within the hold of the law lawyer may refuse client he said but he may never betray his confidence will you tell your name and address she asked eagerly my name is aaron rodd he told her my address is number seventeen manchester street adelphi and my of fice is on the third floor aaron rodd she repeated with queer little foreign intonation that is strange name and i shall remember it when might one visit you monsieur at three this afternoon i shall be in all day then au revoir she exclaimed with an abrupt gesture of farewell the old gentleman had opened his eyes and was gazing fretfully about she crossed the asphalt walk swiftly towards him an attendant who seemed to have gone to sleep standing on one leg gripped the handle of the the girl passed her arm around the old man shoulders and whispered something to the attendant they passed away together the little streak of sunshine had gone aaron rodd thrust his ungloved hands into his coat pockets and made his way in the opposite direction about an hour later small rubicund man man whose dark hair was turning grey but whose eyes were bright and whose complexion was remarkably health y paused before the of an office building in one of the back streets leading from the adelphi he was dressed with extreme neatness from the tips of his patent boots to his grey felt hat and he was obviously of cheerful disposition he glanced down the list of names twirling his cane in fashion and whistling softly to himself suddenly he paused his cane ceased its aimless configurations and rested moment upon name about down the list the name of aaron rodd solicitor and commissioner oaths there was also an indication that rodd offices were to be found upon the third floor his prospective visitor glanced around and discov ering that there was lift started out the stone stairs on the first landing he encountered small boy descending with roll of papers under his arm him the er whose name was mr harvey grimm promptly addressed my young sir he said pleasantly from the red tape around that bundle of papers which you are carrying i gather that you have legal connections you are probably the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https clerk of the gentleman whom i am proposing to visit can you tell before i attempt another flight of these very dusty and unsympathetic steps whether aaron rodd is within the boy glanced at his questioner suspiciously i am not in mr rodd of fice he replied i steel and agnett second floor that harvey grimm sighed regretfully is unfortunate very excellen t firm yours my boy not let any longer interfere with your ef forts on their behalf aaron rodd prospective visitor with sigh recommenced the ascent the boy looked after him moment dubiously and then disappeared arrived at the third floor at the extreme end of the corridor the former discovered door on which was painted the name of aaron rodd he knocked was bidden to enter and stepped at once into single bald and apartment good morning aaron he said cheerfully closing the door behind him and advancing across the dusty floor aaron rodd who had been seated before desk apparently immersed in legal document first raised his head and then rose slowly to his feet his first look of expectancy he had turned towards his visitor faded by degrees into very curious expression an expression which seemed made up of great deal of amazement and certain amount of dread with his left hand he gripped the side of the desk my god he exclaimed it his visitor held out his hand my dear aaron he interrupted firmly you are deceived by slight resemblance you are thinking probably of that poor fellow ned stiles you will never see ned again aaron the intelligence appeared to cause the listener grief neither did it carry with it any conviction harvey grimm is my name the went on harvey grimm if you please of chicago you remember now without doubt he extended his hand confidently his smile was ingratiating his air that of an ingenuous child anxious favourable reception aaron rodd slowly thrust out his stained fingers i remember you all right he admitted the visitor having established his identity seemed disposed to abandon the subject he glanced around the room and discovering chair on which were piled some documents he calmly swept them away annexed the chair which he carefully flicked around with silk handkerchief and brought it to the side of the desk sit down my dear fellow i beg you he invited laying his hat on the floor by his side hitching up his blue serge trousers and smiling in momentary satisfacti on at his shoes i have appropriated i fancy the client chair am i right i wonder in presuming that there has not been much use it lately perfectly right was the grim reply the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https hard times these have been all of us harvey grimm declared with an air of placid satisfaction y are not expecting client this morning i presume nor miracle in that case i will smoke the mer continued producing small gold case selecting cigarette and lighting it t ry one aaron rodd hesitated and finally accep ted the offer he smoked with the air of one unused to the indulgence harvey grimm of chicago he muttered studying his visitor very immaculate appearance have i heard the name somewhere or seen it in the papers lately possibly was the suave reply my arrival in london has i think created some slight interest even your press i find is not above recording the movements of capitalist what capitalist harvey grimm repeated calmly with name like mine and an abode like chicago i am amazed that you did not divine it seven years ago aaron rodd observed we divided seventeen pounds four shillings and eightpence it was i believe our united capital and to judge by your surroundings his companion sighed i fear my friend that you have been emulating the man who tied up his talent in stocking i on the other have changed your name and become capitalist aaron rodd interrupted drily precisely there was moment silence harvey grimm with the beatific smile of opulence was whistling softly to himself his companion thoughts had apparently travelled back into the past well the latter said at last i will imitate your candour the document i was examining with so much interest when you came in is lease long since cancelled the few black boxes you see around the room are with one exception bogus i sit here from morning till night and nothing happens i sit here and brood dear dear his visitor murmured sympathetically by turning my chair around aaron rodd continued i can just catch glimpse of the river across the gardens there i sit and watch wonder whether tug will go past next or lighter watch the people in the gardens wonder where they are going why they are loitering why hurrying i speculate about the few down in the street there sometimes i close my eyes and i fancy myself in lincoln inn seated in padded morocco chair with on the floor and rows of boxes black tin boxes with wonderful names inscribed upon them in white lettering reaching to the ceiling and my secretary poring over my engagemen t book wondering when it would be possible to squeeze in half an hour an important client too much of the dreamer about you harvey grimm pronounced perhaps after all it is the fault of your work it sedative profession you know aaron it would suit to have to sit and wait clients the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https it the black bogey of my life the other assented with thin note of passion in his tone if only one could get out and work even if one did get penny it and financially harvey grimm enquired with an apologetic cough on the rocks was the bitter reply you can understand he went on with heedless sarcasm what wonderful thing it is to welcome capitalist in my shabby of fice and an old friend was the cheerful reminder come come aaron we must look into this i must place some of my af fairs in your char ge aaron rodd lip curled with bitter incredulity some of your affairs i had taste of those in the old days mean harvey you brought to the brink of you drove over here to make fresh start harvey grimm waved his hand these reminiscences were indelicate my dear fellow he protested now come answer few questions such affairs of business have fallen to your lot have been conducted if you mean have i preserved my reputation the lawyer replied grimly i have i have temptation to otherwise that is capital his friend declared that helps us at once and now i think he went on glancing at his neat little wristwatch lunch aaron rodd first movement was almost eager he checked himself however then glance at his visitor immaculate toilet and distinctly opulent appearance reassured him there will be trouble i presume he said little diffidently to the settlement of our bill i warn you before we start that shilling and few harvey grimm laid his hand almost af fectionately upon the other shoulder my dear aaron he expostulated you are little confused you have not yet taken in the position capitalist is of course relative term i will not press that point but let assure you that i have suite of rooms at the milan ample credit any meals i choose to take there even money to pay them if necessary i am not fit to go to the milan aaron rodd muttered brushing himself vigorously that is entirely your mistake his friend replied rising to his feet and lighting another cigarette judicious shabbiness is an approved form of eccentricity with your ascetic face my dear aaron that little wisp of black tie your clean but frayed collar your sombre clothes you would be mistaken by the casual observer either chancery lawyer with an indifferent housekeeper or writer of dramatic blank verse which every one admires but one buys reassure yourself aaron i predict that companion you will every credit the first time grim hard smile parted the lips of the man who was making out with rather weary fingers the accustomed card to af fix to his door the needy adventurer is what i feel like in these days he observed and why not adventurer harvey grimm protested they descended the stone steps we are all needy that is to say we all need something or other and we of us who understand life at any adventures even with the success i have myself will be quite frank with you my dear am the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https i can assure you that i am not above finding interest and pleasure well profit in any adventure which may come to hand his companion chuckled drily i can well believe it he murmured they strolled up the street somewhat curiously assorted couple harvey grimm grey felt hat his neat and somewhat jaunty figure rather suggested the successful trainer of careful habits or elderly jockey enjoying the opulence of middle age aaron rodd on the other hand looked exactly what he lean and hungry professional man with whom the times have gone queer neighbourhood this you chosen your office aaron his friend remarked pausing they neared the corner what sort of people come into these parts anyway it just backwater there the broad stream of london flowing on to succes s and prosperity few yards up the hill if you listen moment you can hear it these little streets are just parasitical branches still alive and still struggling but fit nothing but to be snapped off all the furtive businesses in the world might be conducted behind these silent unwashed windows and blank theatrical agencies doubtful publications betting offices of poor reputation people come here to hide or to escape notice there was murder committed down by the railings at the end of the street only year or so ago obviously harvey grimm remarked cheerfully the region of melancholia and tragedies we must see how things go aaron perhaps later on it would be well you to move to better part just at present however it is well enough the tall young man looked down at his companion half derisively half eagerly he knew him too well to ask many questions knew him too well to hope unduly knew too the danger into which this simple luncheon might lead him yet only few nights ago he had thought of the river it was better to take luncheon with harvey grimm at the milan than to feel the black waters sucking his breath away feeling better aaron harvey grimm enquired of his friend about an hour and half later aaron rodd was both feeling and looking better and acknowledged the fact his manner towards his host too showed signs of subtle change the latter was obviously persona grata in the restaurant their table although little retired was in coveted corner and attentions of every sort had been respectfully offered them neverth eless his guest felt some sense of relief when he saw the bill signed with little flourish and accepted with low bow by their waiter harvey grimm leaned back in his chair and removed the cigar moment from his lips you faith in aaron he declared with an encouraging smile that what you always lacked even in the old you losing touch with the world you know cooped up in that musty office of yours you expect anything to happen to you so long you grub away there you nothing has happened at any rate aaron rodd admitted i will not say that it is your fault his companion continued tolerantly you are by nature of meditative and retiring temperament it is piece of extraordinarily good fortune you that i never get old friends the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https have you anything to propose to aaron rodd asked bluntly his host leaned across the table always so downright my dear aaron he murmured so material howeve r you have asked the question and here is my answer i am proposing to remain in london some little time there are various schemes which have suggested themselv es to which might readily lead to an enlar gement of my income their prosecution my dear aaron i need one only one companion whom i can trust one man who is out the big things that is why i come to you i offer you partnership in the grimm and rodd traffickers in fate dealers in adventures how your hand shakes man there you dropped the ash from your cigar aaron rodd thin lips were quivering his eyes seemed full of unutterable things i have made such fight of it he muttered you got though harve i eaten my last crust i should have had to sell my of fice stool meal his friend shook his head genially my dear aaron he protested such confession from man of brains when one considers how the world is overrun with fools is terrible one one has conscience rodd sighed and profession like mine does lend itself to crooked dealing harvey grimm smiled tolerantly he had the air of one listening to child the wolves of the world he said keep their conscience and regards doing it just success that makes the difference my dear fellow he broke off looking up into the face of man who had paused at their table and whose hand was now reposing heavily upon his shoulder my dear brodie this is most opportune let present you to my friend aaron rodd aaron this is the language of the cinemas he added dropping his voice little and leaning forward the sleuthhound of europe the greatest living detective aaron rodd sat moment motionless the cigar slipped from his fingers on to the plate all his new hopes seemed crumbling away his eyes were fixed upon the hand which gripped his companion shoulder harvey grimm began to laugh softly cheer up my pessimistic friend he exclaimed this is the grip of the law which is upon my shoulder brodie and i are might even say allies aaron rodd recovered himself and murmured few words of mechanical greeting the meanwhile took the chair which the waiter had offered him he was tall burly man with steely grey eyes and grey hair brushed back from his forehead his manner was consequential his tone patronising so this is our third hand eh guessed it in one with your usual astuteness harvey grimm acknowledged cheerfully lawyer of unblemished character not momentarily affluent with the principles of latitudinarian has he got the nerve brodie demanded if we are on the right track there room weaklings in the job aaron rodd all right his friend declared confidently you leave that to i answer him the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https younger man leaned across the table i understand he enquired that our enterprise is on the side of the law harvey grimm smiled the present one my dear aaron i should explain to you perhaps that brodie is not officially attached either to scotland yard or to police headquarters in new york he spent some years at scotland yard and having the good luck to inherit small fortune and feeling himself handicapped by the antiquated methods and jealousie s of his competitors he decided to strike out himself an independent investigator some day he will tell us few of his adventures brodie had folded his arms and was looking very imposing i have hunted criminals he asserted in every quarter of the world i have methods of my own i have genius making use of people so you see my dear aaron harvey grimm pointed out at present brodie and i are the greatest of friends he recogni ses the fact that i am what is baldly spoken of an adventurer and that the time may come when we shall find ourselves in opposite camps but just at present it is our privilege to be of service to mr brodie then thing ordinary enough in its way happened in curious manner brodie was large man but he seemed suddenl y to fade away there was his empty chair and dim vision of retreating figure behind one of the central sideboards aaron rodd seemed dimly conscious of look of warning flashed between the two men but nothing equal to the swift secrecy of brodie movements had ever confused his senses harvey grimm leaned across the table holding his liqueur glass in his hand slick fellow brodie he murmured good his being seen talking to us when the quarry about eh nice brandy this on the dry side perhaps but with flavour to it aaron rodd understood that he was to ask questions and he discussed the subject of brandy in sufficiently ignorant manner he too however within the course of the next few seconds found need the exercise of all his powers of only few yards away from him was young man in some foreign uniform with his arm in sling discussing with maîtr to the locality of his table by his side was the girl with whom he had talked that morning in the embankment gardens and behind the two somewhat pathetic picture was the old man his face withered parch ment his narrow white beard carefully trimmed leaning heavily upon stick almo st he realised their presence they moved on escorted by the maîtr to table in distant corner aaron rodd drew long breath they disappeared his companion looked at him curiously are those the people the lawyer asked eagerly on whose account brodie moved away harvey grimm watched them settle in their places they are he admitted trio and now my dear aaron he went on we will discuss your little adventure in the embankment gardens this morning you perceive that the moment is appropriate my little adventure aaron rodd repeated blankly mean to say you were there then you saw her speak to certainly i was seated little further down talking with my friend brodie we had our eyes upon the young lady the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https rodd felt sudden disinclination to speak of that little gleam of sunshine she spoke to quite casually he declared afterwards she asked my profession i told her that i was lawyer perhaps she had already guessed it i suppose i rather look the part you indeed my friend and then the younger man hesitated his partner s benevolent face suddenly assumed sterner aspect aaron he reminded him we are on business the truth reservations she asked the other went on whether the confidence of client is always respected by one in my profession and your reply i assured her of course that under any circumstances it was harvey grimm leaned back in his chair he rolled the remaining drop of brandy around in his glass his expression was beatific my dear aaron he said fate smiles upon our new partnership the young lady is going to pay you visit at three this afternoon if she keeps her word finish your brandy and come with to my apartment harvey grimm directed we have matters to discuss and arrange before you receive that visit an hour or so later aaron rodd was seated once more before his dilapidated stained desk the gloom of the winter afternoon was only partly dissipated by the single burning above his head the same old lease was spread out underneath his hands in his face however there was distinct change the listlessness had gone he had the air of one awaiting events so he had sat the last with his eyes fixed alternately upon the outside door purpo sely left ajar and the inner one which led to his humble there came at last the sound which he had been waiting up that last flight of stone stairs he could hear distinctly the slow movement of weary footsteps the continual tapping of stick the occasional cough and querulous complaint of tired old man and by the side of those shuffling footsteps others marvellously light the swish of silken skirt the music of clear very sweet young voice you see we are arrived she was saying there is the name upon the door you will be able to sit down directly courage dear grandfather remember it is leopold sake then there followed gentle knock the somewhat hesitating entrance of the two the look of the girl towards the tall gaunt young man whose face seemed almost saturnine underneath that unshaded light he moved forward however she recognised him and smile of relief parted her lips ah it is rodd is it gentleman with whom i spoke in the gardens this lawyer the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https bowed anxiety made his voice sound even harsher many things had happened since the morning you have kept your promise then he remarked you have come to consult i am at your service one moment he brought two of the chairs which stood stiffly against the wall and placed them by the side of his desk the old man sat down with an air of relief the passage up the stairs had apparently exhausted him we are very haphazard clients i fear rodd he said wearily this is unfortunately one of my bad days i must leave my granddaughter to explain the reason of our visit and in what manner we hope to be able to make use of your services if i so grandfather she said turning little towards him i am going to tell the whole truth if it must be he murmured uneasily the girl took up at once the burden of explanation my grandfather my brother and myself she began are staying at the milan hotel we make use of name the name of brinnen to which we have some right even though it may be shadowy one we happen to be belgians by birth fact which at the present moment makes our position easier to be honest with you however my brother has just returned from america he has been engaged some time in more hazardous enterprises even than defending his country against the germans the old man interrupted her impatiently these explanations are waste of time he insisted tell this gentleman quickly what we desire of him she patted his hand and glanced half apologetically across at aaron rodd he had resumed his seat before his desk his face half hidden by his hand listening to the girl voice he had become conscious of gotten sentiment encumbered though she was with difficult mission there was certain fineness of speech and manner an appeal sympathy in even this last gesture which he found strangely disturbing you need explain to more than you wish he told her little stiffly i shall be glad to be of any service to you there is need you to enter into any painful details she shrugged her shoulders protestingly you and my grandfather are of one mind she remarked then i will make confession which may sound abrupt but which is nevertheless true we brother my grandfather and not entitled to the sympathy we receive we are to certain extent impostors is your standard of morals very high one mr rodd scarcely really know he stammered lawyer i am brought into contact with all conditions of people i have before now done my best the criminal i have the honest man it is reassuring she admitted behold then my full confession you have to now with may i say adventurers we have we three to dispose of secretly very large amount of precious stones i have come to you advice the ordinary avenues of sale are closed to us how can we get into touch with some one who will buy them and ask questions the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https rodd was conscious of little shock up to this last moment he had been doubtful notwithstanding the story which had been unfolded to him by harve y grimm he had clung to his first impressions impressions from which he was parting now with dire reluctance it is not an easy matter he admitted but if anyone can help you i can the girl nodded there must be secrecy she declared you see my brother is in way notorious he has been very daring and very successful the sake of those who buy them well our own sake the jewels must not be recognised afterwards i have friend who might arrange it aaron rodd announced i must warn you however that selling your stones in this way you can not possibly receive their full value we not expect that the old man mumbled what we want though is the money my friend could doubtless manage that the lawyer declared when can we see him the girl asked eagerly at once was the prompt reply he was with when you came and i sent him into my private apartments if it is your wish i will fetch him by all means the old man insisted eagerly yes yes the girl echoed aaron rodd rose to his feet and crossed the room to the door which led into his private apartment he opened it and beckoned to its unseen occupant i have some clients here who would like word with you grimm he announced there may perhaps be some business harvey grimm made his appearance at once his air of curiosity he looked into the room was very well done business he repeated this gentleman and young lady aaro n rodd explained are clients of mine their names are unnecessary they have consulted to the disposal of valuable jewels their claim to be open to question harvey grimm threw the cigar which he had been smoking into the i see he murmured better tell the circumstances the girl repeated her story with few more details the old man listened in sort of placid stupor he interrupted only once it is foolish way this there is man in you will tell what you advise monsieur the girl begged we must have money and the jewels must be made unrecognisable harvey grimm took small magnifying glass from his pocket and screw ed it together the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https you have probably brought some of the stones with you he observed briskly the girl hesitated she turned to her companion though guidance he was still mumbling to himself however something about amsterdam it is absolutely essential harvey grim m continued that i should know something definite about the character of the stones you have to is if you wish to deal with them there was brief silence then the girl rose to her feet and deliberately turned away from the three men several moments when she swung around again she held in her hand small chamois leather bag very carefully she opened and shook out its contents into the palm of harvey grimm outstretched hand the large one she said simply belonged to an american millionaire my brother says that it is worth twenty thousand pounds he too is wonderful judge of precious stones the old man seemed to wake up moment it is worth he faltered king ransom they all three bent over the little collection of jewels aaron rodd expression was one of simple curiosity his knowledge of diamonds was nil his partner manner on the other hand underwent curious change there was hard glitter in his eyes and unsuspected lines about his mouth the atmosphere of the little room had become charged with new forces the girl face was tense with excitement the old man seemed suddenly and subtly dif ferent not waste time the former begged little feverishly it is not safe to bring these jewels into the daylight even here if you will buy state your price give us an idea we can meet again perhaps harvey grimm turned towards them the small stones are negligible he pronounced the large stone is worth quite much you say to cut it up however and then sell it in secret market is another thing the most you could hope would be five thousand pounds the girl face was little vague tell she enquired in english money how much is that year two hundred and fifty pounds so that if there were ten stones like that she went on little wistfully that would be an income of two thousand two hundred and fifty pounds one could live comfortably on that one could hide somewhere in quiet country place and live like gentlefolk certainly harvey grimm assured her she turned little doubtfully towards her companion i am afraid she sighed that grandfather is almost past realising what money means in any case we must consult my brother then there came without warning an interruption which seemed equally startling to all of them without any preliminary summons the door of the office was thrown open the detective brodie followed by man in plain clothes out with an unmistakably professional appearance entered the room the latter closed the door behind him the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https the little group the girl eyes were lit with terror harvey grimm dropped his handkerchief over the jewels whilst his partner stepped forward aaron rodd tone was harsh with anxiety his face seemed more drawn than ever what you want here he demanded brodie smiled tolerantly his eyes were fixed upon the table he pushed the questioner on one side and lifted the handkerchief which harvey grimm had thrown over the diamonds then he turned towards his companion with little cry of triumph that he declared pointing to the jewel upon the table is one of the van hutten diamonds i not understand the girl said quietly enough although she was shaking from head to foot it belongs to us it is the property cut it out brodie interrupted brusqu ely we talk to you young lady at police the girl turned to aaron rodd who is this man and what does he want she cried is this trap into which you have drawn us is it crime here in england then to of fer jewels sale we talk this all out at the police station brodie intervened curtly inspector the man in plain clothes stepped forward and took command of the situation my instructions are he announced politely to ask you both to come with to the the old gentleman simply looked dazed he rose to his feet obediently and turned towards the girl she patted his arm reassuringly but there was look in her face which brought sob into aaron rodd throat he was filled all the time with silent fury he cursed the moment which had taken him into the embankment gardens which had brought harvey grimm once more into his life the single look which the girl had flashed upon him was like dagger in his heart brodie had replaced the diamonds one by one in the little bag he handed them over to his companion and motioned them all towards the door the old gentleman moved wearily along leaning upon his granddaughter arm aaron rodd hurried forward and opened the door he tried to say something but the girl turned from him contemptuously he stood on the threshold listening to their slow footsteps they descended into the street then he swung back into the room slammed the door and sank into the chair in front of his desk it was though he had passed through some terrible nightmare he sat gazing out through the shadows had it all really happened then he caught faint unfamiliar breath of perfume which suddenly set his heart beating with unaccustomed vigour little morsel of white lace lay underneath the chair upon which she had been seated he stooped and picked it up smoothed it out and let it slip from his fingers almost in despair it was all true then she had sat in that chair had come to his office trusting him had walked into the trap it was an hour or more before harvey grimm returned he closed the door after him and came briskly across the floor well young fellow he exclaimed you ca say that i have fished you out of the backwaters the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https i wish to god you left there was the bitter reply tell what happened to her to her the young lady harv ey grimm murmured with an illuminating smile she all right she back at the milan by this time they could identify the diamond then aaron rodd asked eagerly not by long chalk was the smiling reply to tell you the truth brodie about the sickest man in london just now the stone he rolled out in front of the expert they had waiting down at scotland yard was what lump of paste harvey grimm declared lighting cigarette queer business eh there charge against the old gentleman and his granddaughter then aaron rodd demanded breathlessly none whatever why not try cigarette aaron you all nerves the lawyer pushed the box away from him you may think this sort of thing worth while he declared gloomily i ca say that i there be reward to share and it seems to that we made an enemy there reward harvey grimm agreed but there this he drew his handkerchief from his pocket diamond almost large cobnut rolled over and lay upon the desk aaron rodd stared at it in amazement what that he demanded one of the van hutten diamonds was the triumphant reply look at it well you wo see it again by this time it will have been cut aaron rodd was stupefied he looked from the stone up to his companion face even his demand some elucidation was mute i had the duplicate ready harvey grimm explained that was my game i changed them underneath my handkerchief it was perfectly easy they got the imitati on one at police and they are feeling particularly pleased with themselves that fellow brodie is about the bummest detective who ever crossed the atlantic aaron rodd was sitting transfixed his fingers were shaking they beat upon the desk my god he exclaimed light streamed in upon him we thieves talk like fool the other admonished it fair enough game between crooks we stolen stolen jewel and by doing it we saved the girl and her grandfather and her brother too from gaol that fair is it when i finished with that there be matter of three or four thousand pounds us to divide what about it eh he swept the jewel back into his pocket aaron rodd fingers were still idly beating upon the desk the walls of his dusty bare apartment had fallen away the thrall of the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https by compulsionsordid poverty lay longer like dead weight upon his spirits three or four thousand pounds to divide what you need harvey grimm decla red briskly handing him his hat is drink come right along chapter ii paul brodie walked unannounced into aaron rodd office matter of ten days after the episode of the changed diamond he had lost little of his bombast and he carried himself with less than his usual confidence his eyes however had lost none of their old inquisitive fire he was perfectly aware even he greeted the two men who rose to welcome him that aaron rodd was wearing new suit of clothes that the office had been that the box of cigarettes upon the desk were of an expensive brand and that the violets in the buttonhole of harvey grimm immaculate coat had come from bond street florist good morning gentlemen he said airily subsiding into the chair which the latter had vacated him nice little trio of conspirators we are eh harvey grimm shrugged his shoulders it rough on you he giv es you kind of twist of course with the i ca see any sense in the thing yet they were meaning to trade off that bit of paste on diamond expert surely the detective scratched his chin that bit of paste he declared was all they had on them anyway seems though they had quite sized you and rodd were paying you test visit gee they clever you had them searched i suppose the other enquired to be sure they had the real goods with them you bet the detective assented gloomily made it all the worse us afterwards i tell you i dare show my face at scotland yard these days harvey grimm nodded sympathetically still they must know that these people are what they profess to be he observed that all very well brodie agreed but every one goes about with kid gloves on in this country that why i threw up my job and went over to the states even criminal known criminal has got to be treated though he were little god almighty until the charge is right there and the proof lying handy i spent last night with inspector ditchwater he sure i am that the young man is other than jeremiah sands but he sooner let him slip through his fingers than take risk how does it come about then aaron rodd asked quietly that famous diamond thief is wearing the uniform of belgian of ficer that he is decorated and wounded simple possible brodie explained we knew perfectly well that jeremiah sands was belgian that little fact had been in every description of him that ever been issued he chucked his little enterprises in new york the moment war was declared the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https europe bringing the loot with him he was clever paint though he played the old game of sending double to chicago and he was in belgium before we knew the truth there from what we gather he handed over the stuff to the old man and his sister and took up his soldiering job the worst of it is he covered up his traces so well that we have chance unless we can catch him or one of the three with the goods meanwhile there he is less than quarter of mile away with half million of loot under his nose there reward of thousand dollars his apprehension and here we three men sit needing the money and pretty well powerless i would go so far that harvey grimm said quietly i fancy you come to the end of your tether yet brodie the detective knocked the ash from his cigar and rose to his feet well he admitted i ai giving up sure all the same this little failure has made things difficult if i put my head in at and whisper h sands they down my throat i just looked in to see how you boys were he added they have tumbled to you both now so i afraid the game off so far you are concerned so long see you round at the milan about cocktail time harvey eh brodie took his leave with more expressions of cordiality aaron rodd closed the door carefully after him and came back into the room several moments neither of the two men spoke harvey grimm carefully selected cigarette and lit it then he walked to the door opened it and peered down the stairs too damned amiable he muttered he returned to his place did you see the way he peered around you have brightened things up bit aaron i have done more than was absolutely necessary the young lawyer protested the place was simply filthy harvey grimm suddenly burst into hearty laugh and slapped his knee that all right old fellow he declared it matter snap of the fingers that chap brodie does get though baby could see through him he got just sense enough to believe that we pinched the why he been round here it just matter damn aaron what he suspects that diamond does exist any longer neither our friends whom of its incriminating possession nor paul brodie will ever see that stone again let lunch aaron rodd reached his hat and followed his friend out into the street at the end of the little dingy thoroughfare they made their way up towards the strand harvey grimm paused abruptly in front of what seemed to be small there were only one or two volumes in the window of what seemed to be editions luxe of some unknown work there was single modern engraving and water of futurist propensities background harvey grimm eyed these treasures appreciatively this place pleases he announced it has an air of its own we will spend few minutes here the two men entered and looked about them little bewildered by their surroundings they seemed to have stepped into small and feminine the walls of which were hung with water of unusual subjects and colouring there was little pile of paper volumes upon the table young lady of sombre and uncertain appearance came forward and harvey grimm promptly removed his hat we have perhaps made mistake he observed tentatively from the exterior appearance of your establishment i gathered that we might possibly be able to the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https something unusual in the way of literature in small way i am collector of old books we are entirely modern here the young woman replied i can show you made pottery or the water of young futurist artist or i can offer you the poetical works of one or two of our most modern poets books or objets we not deal in we consider she concluded that modernity absolute modernity is the proper cult harvey grimm fanned himself moment with his hat his companion was gazing with his mouth little open at picture upon the wall which appeared to him to represent the bursting of ripe tomato upon crazy landscape an impression of war the young woman remarked following his gaze wonderful piece of work by young futurist painter harvey grimm studied it moment through his eyeglass and coughed he turned back to the table and picked up paper volume poetry he murmured is one of my great solaces have you met with the work of steph en cresswell the young woman enquired almost solemnly harvey grimm repeated the name several times the he confessed eightpence the girl interrupted depositing one of the paper volumes in his hand perhaps your friend would like one too i can promise you that when you have read cresswell spring l yrics you will find all victorian poetry anæmic harvey grimm handed copy to his companion laid down two shillings and pocketed the eightpence change little dif fidently you would perhaps like to look around the young lady suggested she vanished into an inner room almost at that moment the door leading into the street was violently opened and young man of somewhat surprising appearance abruptly entered he was over six feet in height he wore flannel shirt and collar much the worse wear brown tweed coat from which every button was missing and through an old pair of patent boots came an unashamed and very evident toe the two visitors stared at him in amazement the young man eyes from the moment of his entrance were fixed upon the paper volume which harvey grimm was carrying sir he enquired am i to conclude that you have purchased copy of poems you hold in your hand i have just done so harvey grimm admitted also my friend the young man pushed past him towards the inner room bertha he exclaimed loudly eightpence please you have sold two copies of my poems the eightpence there was momentary silence and then the clinking of coins the young man reappeared and made the door with an air of determination in his face harvey grimm tapped him on the shoulder the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https sir he said forgive if i take liberty but am i right in presuming that you are the author of this volume i am was the prompt reply and i am going to have drink one moment if you please his questioner begged this you must remember is an impertinent age modernity demands it are you not also hungry ravenous stephen cresswell confessed but what can one with eightpence you will join my friend and myself harvey grimm declared firmly we are going to take chop the young man tongue seemed to wander around the outside of his lips chop he repeated absently at neighbouring harvey grimm went on come i have bough t two copies of your poems i have claim your consideration i understand the young man asked that you will pay the chop that will be my privilege was the prompt assertion you are doubtless mad the poet observed but you are probably opulent let us hurry they left the place and crossed the stree t the young man in the middle aaron rodd was speechless his eyes seemed fascinated by the deficiencies of their new friend toilet fact of which he himself seemed sublimely unconscious harvey grimm however proceeded to make delicate allusion to the matter some little accident i gather he remarked has give my noticing it your right shoe the poet glanced carelessly downwards it occurred this morning he sighed to tell you the truth i had scarcely noticed it there was green streak in the sunrise i harvey grimm had paused in front of boot shop this place he said firmly will well another why not the young man agreed entering promptly seating himself upon the nearest vacant chair and holding out his foot something light he begged you will observe that my foot is long and narrow the shopman withdrew the tattered remnants of shoes and stared in amazement at his prospective customer bare feet the latter held out his hand cigarette and tapped it against the side of harvey grimm case it appears to he continued gazing at his feet that i came out without socks the sunrise again howe ver it is deficiency which i perceive that you are in position to remedy he selected without embarrassment pair of socks and shoes and was perfectly willing to don tie which they purchased from small haberdasher shop at the end of the street that af fair disposed of however he became quite the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https the af fair of the he insisted we are there harvey grimm interrupted leading him to an hotel the young man paused before the large open grid and carefully indicated the chop which he considered suitable his consumption he then seated himself opposite his two friends and expressed himself in favour of mixed vermouth very pleasing encounter this he declared drawing the eightpence from his pocket and looking at it thoughtfully may i ask sir whether you are acquai nted with my poems not yet harvey grimm confessed your purchase then was accidental entirely his patron explained my friend and i are adventurers we seek the unusual the appearance of the shop where we met you attracted us the youn g lady to whom we addressed some enquiries tendered us copy of your verses the young man sighed it is scandalous thing he said to be published in paper covers at fourpence to the author so you are adventurers you mean by that thieves sir aaron rodd interrupted i am solicitor my ignorance the young man decla red is amazing but that i presume is legalised form of robbery i am one of the few persons in the world who give value the money i earn i produce create if only ten thousand people in the city were to pay eightpence copy of my works i should be affluent you two are i should lunch here every day and drink bur gundy then in very short time harvey grimm reminded him you would cease to write poetry his protégé shook his head body is an incentive to poetic thought he insisted there is richness of imagery which comes with composing sort of mental starvation an anæmic scantiness of similes which follows the fruit luncheon and cold water of necessity adventurers gentlemen are you that is to say you are people with wits tell an idea from the practical shall i make ten thousand people buy copy of my poems come that an interesting problem harvey grimm declared of course if one were to answer you in single word that one would be advertisement if i could write my name across the heavens or flash it from million lights through the clouds the young man remarked i would so but these things call either miraculous powers or money i have neither your case harvey grimm promised shall have our attention my friend and mine in the meantime the moment seems opportune pending the arrival of our chops glance at your work permit the poetaster crossed his legs leaned back in his chair thrust an eyeglass into his eye and turned over the pages of the paper volume which he had been carrying aaron rodd followed his example the poet entirely unembarrassed eyed hungrily each covered dish which passed at the arrival of the meal harvey grimm solemnly the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https book and replaced his eyeglass aaron rodd went on reading moment then he glanced surreptitiously at their guest and laid his volume face downwards upon the table your poems i perceive harvey grim m observed he helped himself to potato are not written the man in the street they are written the poet declared falling hungrily upon his chop any one who will pay eightpence them conversation faded away it was not until the service of coffee and cigars that anything more than disjointed words were spoken the young man face was still colourless but his eyes were less hard he took out his pencil and toyed moment with the menu some little trifle he suggested commemorative of the occasion i would rather harvey grimm confes sed think out some scheme advertising your work there little thing here about lame any scheme you suggest the young man assented dreamily i frankly admit that the dispersal of my productions is matter in which i have failed the appreci ative few may have purchased but the man of the day passes on ignorant of the great need he really has of poetry ten thousand copies of my poems sold in london would produce at once more gracious spirit you would observe difference in the deportment the speech the greater altruism of the multitude how shall i force my works into their hands and their eightpences into my pocket fourpence only aaron rodd reminded him the publishers get half in the event of large circulation the poet pointed out with wave of the hand better terms might be arrived at you legal man can appreciate that possibility there is only one idea which occurs to harvey grimm declared after brief pause come and we will make an experiment they marched out into the streets and walked solemnly along towards leicester square suddenly harvey grimm stopped short and accosted small man who was carrying bag and walking quickly i beg your pardon sir the former began what is it the little man demanded harvey grimm took him gently by the lapel of his coat the little man seemed too surprised to resist i want the privilege of few minutes conversation with you harvey grimm continued you are one of the uneducated ten thousand who on behalf of my friend here stephen cresswell the great poet i am anxious to reach have you read cresswell poems i am in hurry the little man insisted gazing at his interlocutor in bewildered manner and struggling to escape the whole world is in hurry harvey grimm observed drawing the paper volume from his pocket with the other hand this volume of poems will cost you eightpence it will bring relief to its impoverished author you yourself will become an enlightened the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https i wish you let go the little man protested angrily i know you and i want to stand about the streets talking to stranger let go or i call policeman policeman can afford you assistance harvey grimm assured him i shall remain polite but insistent you will buy this volume of poems eightpence or what his victim demanded harvey grimm leaned down and whispe red in his ear the little man hand shot into his pocket he produced sixpence and two coppers snatched at the book and hurried off the victor in this little rencontre turned to his companions with an air of triumph and handed the eightpence to the poet who immediately pocketed it the whole problem is solved he declared you are great man sir the poet exclaimed grasping him by the hand but what was it you whispered in his ear i simply told him harvey grimm said blandly that i should biff him one the cost of new hat is ten and sixpence the price of your poems is eightpence you are great man sir the poet repeated heartily watch the newspapers with bunch of early violets in his buttonhole neatly and correctly dressed from the crown of his hat to his patent boots harvey grimm one morning about fortnight later turned down the narrow street which led to his friend aaron rodd office he took few steps and paused in surprise little crowd encumbered the pavement in front of him there were at least half dozen taxicabs waiting by the side of the pavement printer van was busy unloading constant procession consisting chiefly of elderly and men were entering and leaving the little waiting his turn harvey grimm stepped in the whole of the central table was taken up by great piles of little paper volume recognisable at once the poetical works of stephen cresswell and fast the flow of customers could be served they departed with one or more copies in their pockets the young lady whose hair was more untidy than ever and who wore stupefied air doled them out in and mechanical fashion she had lost her air of superiority she pointed longer to the sketches upon the walls or the pottery beyond she behaved like dazed automaton now and then harvey grimm could hear her reply to enquiries there will be cloth edition of cresswell works out in few days she said the printers have promised them by the end of the week in the background were two very obvious newspaper men waiting so far unsuccessfully to get in word with her harvey grimm elbowed his way by some means or other into the line paid his eightpence and retired into the recesses of the little suite of rooms beyond moment rush of at least dozen old gentlemen had made exit temporarily impossible he stood and watched the scene he was conscious of fashionably dressed young man lounging in an easy chair few yards away the young man suddenly arose my benefactor he cried harvey grimm gripped his copy of poems tightly and held it up pax he exclaimed i have one the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https poet smiled wearily he drew his erstwhile patron little further back into the most retired portion of the premises listen he said this has been the most stupendous the most colossal joke of the day on the first night i sandbagged wholesale provision merchant who admitted that he had never read my poems and he wrote to the times the next morning i made myself objectionable to seven others the following night they too made various complaints after that i description of my identity was becoming embarrassing harvey grimm was little puzzled but the thing has been going on right up till last night he declared the papers days have been source of joy to after the first few nights the young man explained i was compelled to engage substitutes i have acquaintances whose life has been we say on the fringe of things with their aid i made the acqu aintance of various professional gentlemen from the east end who suitable remuneration took up this business with avidity they were of all sizes and they operated in all localities choosing their victims so far possible with discretion there was but one you read the poems of stephen cresswell bewildered negative and then biff the peop le began frantically to enquire who was stephen cresswell where were his poems to be obtained people who had the slightest pretensions to literary knowledge were assailed with questions punch i saw punch mr harvey grimm interrupted v ery clever then the stream began the young man continued i can assure you that from the opening time till dark this place is mobbed you see on the third night confederate was saved from an imaginary assault by promptly producing copy of my poems he wrote to the paper in mock indignation but describing his escape then the rush began eleven thousand copies have been sold some at premium eleven thousand fourpences have found their way into my pocket and edition are waiting in the press one thing and that the name of my benefactor i wish to dedicate the third fourth and fifth editio ns of my poems to you the young man declared grandiloquently harvey grimm pondered it is an immense compliment he acknowledged w will talk of it in the meantime the poet went on listen the curse of these days is jealous y and imitation young man of worthy upbringing but wholly ignorant of art who perpetrated the daubs which you see upon the walls here was struck with my success only last thursday an elderly gentleman such one might have been selected by my own employés was stopped in hampstead and asked whether he had seen the sketches of sidney wentworth displayed in manchester street adelphi the fool admitte d that he had never heard of them and down he went i ask you sir was there ever more flagrant case of spoiling man market from the moment this absurd affair was reported public feeling has begun to change curiously enough there has been very small resentment even on the part of those who have suffered slight pains in the cause of art to my methods now however that the idea has commenced to spread that such means are becoming regular curriculum of the advertiser i have noticed distinct expressions of indignation in plain words i can see the end coming the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https nothing lasts harvey grimm pointed out and you must admit you had run your money i had more than that sir the poet admitted i am established many of the leading periodicals of the day including titbits and the london mail have invited to contribute to their pages the society of authors has made tempting proposition to join their ranks you may look upon sir man whose future is now assured i am delighted to hear it harvey grimm declared heartily i fear i must now be getting on the young man took down his hat possessed himself of pair of expensive doeskin gloves and silver cane i will let you out by the back way he suggested it is my desire to accompany you i am going to call upon friend in the neighbourhood harvey grimm remarked the friend with whom i met you first the same i shall accompany you the young man announced cautiously opening side door and peering up and down passage the way is clear sir come with they sallied out and found themselves in the street the young man gripped the arm of his companion the moment he confessed i am weary of poetry i seek life you are an adventurer you have told i shall link my fortune with yours you have brain sir enterprise and i should imagine that you are untrammelled by the modern conscience i am in the same position poetry is affording some time at least the means of sustenance let us go together little further afield the older man looked his companion up and down he was strong young fellow and the hollows of his cheeks had already filled out notwithstanding his mannerisms he was without doubt young man of resolution we will see harvey grimm suggested what aaron rodd has to say about it i like your friend name the young man declared solemnly i am sure that he will accept comrade they trod the few remaining yards of pavement ascended the stone stairs and after preliminary knock at the door harvey grimm exercising the privilege of familiarity turned the handle and stepped inside followed by his companion single moment neither of them spoke harvey grimm first conscious action was to close the door behind him then they stood inside the apartment transfixed around them was scene of the wildest disorder the linoleum had been torn up and thrown into corner planks had been torn bodily from the floor the cupboards stood open and their contents were thrown right and left the little row of tin boxes stood on their sides and masses of dusty parchment littered the whole place seated in his chair before the desk was aaron rodd with gag in his mouth his arms bound behind him his legs tied together his face was livid his eyes half closed he showed signs of life at their coming the poet produced knife we must set him free he the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https alliance of thieveshis companion subconsciously amazed at the young man initiative followed him to the desk methodically the latter having removed the gag from aaron rodd mouth cut the bonds which held him one by one harvey grimm produced small brandy flask and held it to his lips the poet threw open window and swung the chair round aaron rodd groaned he is coming to cresswell remarked hopefully he caught up sheaf of newspapers and fanned the swooning man vigorously then he suddenly paused harvey grimm followed the direction of his gaze sheet of coloured was pinned upon the desk the poet snif fed what delicious odour he murmured and how familiar they both approached little nearer the sheet of fluttering little in the breeze which streamed through the window gave out the subtlest and most delicate perfume perfume which seemed like waft from field of violets carried on west wind there were only few words written in delicate feminine handwriting should ther not be honour even amongst thieves the young man struck theatrical attitude fate has sent to join you he declared waving his hand towards the sheet of paper i recognise the handwriting i know well the perfume i can tell you who wrote that note chapter iii aaron rodd was walking along the to him unfamiliar thoroughfare of bond street when he was suddenly confronted with vision large limousine motor was drawn up just in front of him an elderly lady with white hair leaning upon the arm of powdered footman crossed the pavement followed by girl who was smothered in sables carried small dog under her arm and wore great bunch of violets partially concealed by her furs aaron rodd abrupt pause was not one of politeness alone with an eagerness which took account of manners or discretion he gazed at the girl eyed blankly unashamed if anything were left to complete his bewilderment it was the little smile upon her lips she met his eyes good afternoon mr aaron rodd she murmured she passed she disappeared through the swing doors of the shop aaron stared after her though expecting backward glance stared at the very handsome motor at what appeared to be coronet upon the panel at the imperturbable expression of the powdered footman standing with rug over his arm looking into vacancy then he limped on few feet and devoted himself to an absorbed contemplation of some japanese trifles in curio shop he lost count of time in his firm determination to await her return matter of fact it was only few minutes before he was conscious of her reappearance she hesitated moment on the threshold of the shop shook her head at the footman who was already opening the door of the car and approached aaron rodd he turned abruptly from the window and greeted her with grave politeness she glanced at his left arm still in sling at the heavy by which he supported the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https good afternoon rodd she said you have met perhaps with little accident it is so your friends were little rough he replied i shall be annoyed with them she promised y received my message certainly he replied on the whole i agree with you she shrugged her shoulders and what are you doing in bond street she asked him i am on my way to meet my friend harvey grimm she nodded that is your clever confederate who stole our diamond she remarked suavely very fortunate circumstance you he ventured to remind her if that the real one i been discovered in your possession at the i fancy that your position in this country would have become little dif ficult oh la la she laughed you should have seen the face of brodie though when they examined the imitation stone i not think that the english police are pleased with him they were very kind to my grandfather and nevertheless he advised if i were your brother i think that i would keep away from london just now and why aaron rodd glanced up and down the pavement to be sure that there were listeners that fellow brodie is not such fool he seems he declared he has made one mistake i not think that he is likely to make another she laughed if it is to be duel of wits she murmured between leopold and brodie you know i believe that leopold will win there is such thing over he reminded her i have so many ways she told him with twinkling eyes of diverting these people from the scent you recognise the old lady upon whom i am in attendance the old lady who went with into that shop i have not that pleasure he replied grimly is she one of the gang she is royal princess augusta if you not believe look in this week tatler and you will see her mine you are very funny man aaron rodd and you have treated us very badly indeed but i like i like you quite well how much money did you get that stone you stole from us the colour mounted mercilessly to his temples he seemed suddenly bereft of words not be foolish she continued quickly really you know i am an adventuress myself and i rather admire you both i think that we ought to make friends you could the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https great service to us there is need us to quarrel because you have had the best of this first little exchange what you say to that my friend aaron rodd found himself and became once more man he looked her squarely in the eyes i would rather be friends with you he said than any one in the world moment the triumph was his it was she who was almost embarrassed by his directness then intervention came ah she exclaimed the princess au revoir she stepped lightly away from him with little nod of farewell the footman stood he opened the door of the car one of the principals of the establishment which the lady had just quitted stood bowing upon the pavement in the face of all this the girl turned deliberately around and waved her hand the car drove off aaron rodd limped down bond street called taxi and drove to the milan court his two auditors listened to aaron rodd story with varying poet with pleased and affable sympathy harvey grimm on the other hand with obvious irritation they were seated in corner of the and the latter at once despatched waiter copy of the tatler when it arrived they all three pored over one of the leading illustrations there was doubt whatever in the minds of any of the three men to the identity of the girl who was depicted being amongst the waiting of royal personage that the poet declared is young lady whose name is henriette floge she has an underhand service at badminton and she wants to learn to be futurist she attended class last year organised by an artist friend of mine in chelsea ye gods that without single doubt aaron rodd assented laying his forefinger upon the illustration is the young lady who was in attendance this afternoon upon the princess augusta and it is equally and absolutely and conclusively certain harvey grimm pronounced that she came to manchester street adelphi the confederate of jeremiah sands who the poet asked eagerly is jeremiah sands i like the name jeremiah sands harvey grimm told him is the head and brains of the smallest but most formidable band of criminals who have ever succeeded in eluding justice nearly ten years there is reward of ve thousand dollars his arrest in america and he is wanted in most of the capitals of europe he has dozen aliases and score of personalities this much about him is certain he is either of belgian or french birth he is young man and he has spent the greater part of the last seven years in america the universal excuse given by the police of every country their failure to apprehend him is that at any rate the last five years he has simply accumulated his booty and has made effort to dispose of it you know most of the thieves of the world are traced backwards through the receiver of stolen goods his last exploit in new york was the theft of the van hutten jewels it was without doubt one of those diamonds which was mislaid in aaron rodd office and it was one of jeremiah sands agents who paid our friend here that last domiciliary visit in search of it what by the by became of that diamond the poet enquired we are living upon it mr harvey grimm the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https poet sighed enviously it is beautiful existence he declared when are we going to embark upon another adventure of the sort the aftermath of the last one is still enveloping us harvey grimm reminded him there is scotland yard who have seen the imitation stone and who suspect us of changing it then there is jeremiah sands who knows that we did and who is only just beginning to realise that we have been clever enough to dispose of it finally there is brodie the amateur detective who has the same idea and who is furious with us letting him down with the authorities between the three you see our position is little difficult personally i am much interested in our friend aaron account of his conversation with the young lady her suggestion of some measure of alliance appeals to and the poet agreed let us approach them at once i should like to come into contact with this jeremiah sands there was brief interval whilst waiter deposited before them tray of cocktails subtly ordered by the poet by means of sundry evolutions with his forefinger afterwards harvey grimm sat few mom ents in silence smoothing out his immaculate doeskin gloves listen he said presently after cautious glance around the room i will tell you my impressions jeremiah sands has never been caught two because he has stored up all his booty and has never been in the hands of the receivers secondly because he has in every capital of europe all of them safer than london or new york at the present moment he is like rabbit which has been ferreted out of its hole europe is suddenly closed to him he has been driven to london he is ill at ease here he has lost many of his agents to maintain his belgian nationality he has been forced into the army the perfect machinery of his wonderful system must be seriously dislocated the time too has probably arrived when he finds it necessary to dispose of some of his plunder let us of fer him tentative amity aaron rodd frowned you think that he would trust us after that last little affair i mind being the thief or the he added bluntly but i rather hate being the third party the only party we have to consider is ourselves harvey grimm replied deliberately to tell you the truth i fear that we have lost the confidence of paul brodie i am not sure whether it would be worth our while to try and regain it the sharing of rewards is poor game i would rather hear what jeremiah sands has to say he took up his pencil and scrawled few lines across half sheet of they both looked over his shoulder if the young lady with violets would like to resume her conversation with certain person in bond street this morning please reply in friday elegraph i propose harvey grimm expla ined to insert this in morning telegraph to send copy to mr brinnen and await results brilliant the poet exclaimed it gives the proper flavour to the whole thing but why not write note and send it up by the waiter harvey grimm the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https my young friend he said you are an adventurer of the type let tell you this i happen to know it to be fact from the moment when paul brodie communicated his suspicions to our friends to scotland yard their every movement and without doubt their correspondence has been closely watched i will guarantee to you that not letter is delivered to either captain leopold brinnen to brinnen or to the young lady which does not run very considerable risk of being opened the poet listened with pleased smile i like the flavour of this sort of thing he acknowledged let us insert the advertisement by all means if the young lady suggests meeting i shall recommend myself the most suitable person to keep the appointment soon after midday two mornings later stephen cresswell entered the room at the milan he was carrying daily telegraph under his arm he wore bunch of violets in his buttonhole and he was dressed with great care he approached the table where harvey grimm and aaron rodd were awaiting him you too have seen the answer to our advertisement he exclaimed capital we were just now discussing it harvey grimm assented the poet sat down made signs to the waiter hitched up his trousers and made himself thoroughly comfortable i have decided he announced that i am the proper person to entertain the young lady harvey grimm nodded thoughtfully tell us through what channel of thought my young friend you have arrived at that conclusion he begged the poet straightened his tie there was doubt that he was remarkably looking young man i am modest person he said but it is useless to deny that nature has been kind to then too there is peculiar and romantic importance attached to the succe ssful poet whose reputation has been enhanced in so singular fashion the young lady will be interested in from the start she will be proud to remember that we are old acquaintances and she will treat with greater confidence than any ordinary person harvey grimm lit cigarette deliberately aaron rodd heavy eyebrows seemed to have contracted little why are you so sure that it will be the young lady who will keep the appointment the former enquired stephen cresswell placed his forefinger upon the advertisement in the paper which he had been carrying milan café luncheon wednesday will discuss bond str eet that tells us nothing harvey grimm pointed out so far the probabilities are concerned i should say that it is extremely unlikely that either the young lady or any of those associated with her will keep the appointment any negotiations we may have will probably be conducted through third party the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https poet face fell he ordered another cocktail brusquely how shall we know whom to look out then he demanded the onus of recognition will rest with the others harvey grimm replied i have engaged table just inside the door we shall take our places there before fteen and await the arrival of whoever may come in case it should be the young lady the poet persisted you would find that my previous acquaintance with her would be of immense service to us she would place confidence in you shall be of the party harvey grimm promised i have ordered the table five so to be on the safe side i not understand our friends selecting place meeting but on the other hand there is flavour of genius in such apparent recklessness if you are ready i think it is time that we made start they strolled down to the café and took their places at table just inside the door at precisely quarter past one little tremor of excitement suddenly unloosed their tongues my god harvey grimm muttered they must be mad aaron rodd whispered in hoarse undertone it is henriette floge stephen cresswell murmured complacently you will perceive soon the advantage of my presence the girl approached their table smilingly she was followed by the young officer in belgian uniform the three men rose to their feet she smiled pleasantly at aaron rodd you have not yet met my brother have you she asked let present captain leopold aaron rodd mr harvey grimm she paused with her eyes fixed questioningly upon the poet the young officer had brought his heels together and bowed ceremoniously to the two men i am not i hope forgotten the poet observed my name is stephen cresswell i have had the pleasure of playing badminton with you in walter donne studio she looked across at him with slightly upraised eyebrows the faint tracings of somewhat insolent smile at the corners of her lips badminton is that an english game i perceive that i have double i have not played it you are mademoiselle floge the poet persisted she shook her head gently on the contrary she replied i am henriette brinnen leopold this is stephen cresswell they all took their places the poet little heavily his stupefaction even though it proceeded from different cause was only little less profound than that of the other two harvey grimm took up the menu once more and gave few murmured orders to the maîtr aaron rodd who was on her side leaned towards the girl his face was almost haggard with anxiety forgive he whispered but is this wise have you counted the cost of it the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https i not understand she answered little vaguely you know that we are all watched he reminded her we thought it best even not to communicate with you direct you three are such droll men she laughed there is your friend stephen cresswell who sits there and will not take his eyes off he does not believe that he has never met before and harvey he does not seem nervous person does he and just now he is almost pale and you speak with bated breath of risks and being watched how then you carry through your great coups my friend have you not learnt the first axiom of the is nothing which dispels suspicion so readily candour aaron rodd shrugged his shoulders and busied himself with the task of attending to his companion wants conversation around the little table became platitudinal the three men although they behaved in all respects reasonably were unable to keep their thoughts and attention from wandering continually towards their slim young guest in his somewhat battered uniform who seemed chiefly engrossed with his luncheon it was hard to believe that he sat there in one of the restaurants in the world with great price upon his head in some respects he was like his sister aaron rodd decided although there was curious virility of expression which flashed sometimes into his features and more calculating light in his hard clear eyes his mouth was unusually long straight and thin his cheekbones little high one could believe that notwithstanding his inconsiderable stature his frame was like steel he spoke english very deliberately with now and then the slightest american accent but on the few occasions when he addressed his sister it seemed to be relief him to relapse into french it was not until the coffee was served that he leaned little towards harvey grimm and dispelled by few words the atmosphere of unreality which had somehow or other hovered over the little sir he proposed let us approach the object of this meeting with pleasure harvey grimm assented some reason or other the young man continued my sister although we know to our cost her acquaintance with you so far has not been altogether profi table has confidence in you let us speak frankly you gentlemen i believe are what is generally known chevaliers there was sudden flush of colour in aaron rodd cheeks the poet who was little sullen distinctly scowled only harvey grimm bowed placidly seemingly unconscious of the faint note of contempt in the other tone in the ordinary sense of the word that is true he admitted consider then our position the youn g man continued my grandfather and sister whom i meet again after an absence of some years owing to the haste with which they were compelled to leave belgium are almost penniless my consist of perhaps half million pounds worth of diamonds these jewels he went on knocking the ash from his cigarette have all been stolen they can only be disposed of in an irregular fashion that is to say the stones must be recut in normal times this problem would present difficulties to when london is the only capital of europe open to us i must admit that i find myself in difficult position the few artificers in this country are i understand well known and watched i am bound therefore to employ an agent under the peculiar circumstances to which i have alluded i can not seek an honest man i am prepared to make it worth the while of men such yourselves to deal honestly with the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https my brother has your english gift of plain speech you see the girl whispered soothingly to aaron rodd the young officer lit fresh cigarette and watched the smoke curl upward moment surely it is best he said softly thes gentlemen are at the present moment living and living doubt exceedingly well upon the proceeds of one of my diamonds they should not therefore be sensitive i may be allowed to remind you sir harvey grimm interrupted that incidentally the little artifice by means of which we secured it is responsible your unhindered presence here i take that fact into consideration leopold brinnen assented in the toleration with which i view the circumstance the point is are you willing to deal with i am perfectly willing to so sir harvey grimm replied i am willing too and so i am sure are my friends to take certain amount of risk i may add that i am probably the only man in england who can dispose of your jewels so that they can not be traced but before we proceed further let ask you question are you aware sir of your position there is an amateur detective here from new york named paul brodie who has other object in life than to lay his hands upon certain person scotland yard although just now they are little fed up with brodie have very definite intentions with regard to the same person you are living here openly you are even flaunting your belgian uniform there are eyes upon us we sit at this table there are eyes upon you and your sister and your grandfather from the moment you rise in the morning till the moment you retire at night your rooms are at all times subject or liable to be searched any place you might visit is liable to be searched let ask you then plain question more than any other quality i admire courage you think however that you are playing little too near to the fire the young officer stroked his thin black moustache he had listened to harvey grimm words attentively he even indicated in the slow movement of his head some measure of approbation to all that you have said harvey grimm i can make you only one reply he said every step which i have taken in life has been carefully thought out the present position although necessity has here intervened to some extent has been subject to the same attentive consideration i am safer than you think let that be enough that i have friends is proved by the little visitation which was made upon aaron rodd the other day i offer you apologies sir he continued bowing across the table it was part of the game when we thrust the law outside our lives you have done and i then we must take our knocks philosophically the future however even though we play the thieves game there is reason why we should not play it honestly very admirable sentiment the poet murmured to put this matter upon business basis grimm captain brinnen continued supposing i supply you with certain quantity of diamonds will you guarantee to have them cut so to render them unrecogni sable dispose of them hand of the proceeds and retain third yourself i have worked before upon those terms harvey grimm replied i accept them there is one little matter though to be cleared up captain brinnen smiled grimly the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https i fancy that i follow you he observed you refer to the mysterious disappearance of diamond from your friend of fice harvey grimm coughed bearing in mind i took the liberty of pointing out few minutes ago that its disappearance saved you from considerable he began the affair is finished brinnen interrupted carry out faithfully the other transactions which we may arrange and we will i say resigned attitude with regard to that incident when are you prepared to deal with the first parcel of stones at any moment harvey grimm promised y will bring them to the girl who had been listening eagerly to their conversation leaned across the table i think she said that this time you had better come and fetch them grimm or better mr aaron rodd or the poet suggested she shook her head it is to be aaron rodd she decided you will not be afraid she added turning towards him with little smile at the corners of her lips where am i to come to and when he enquired she glanced at her brother then back again towards her neighbour i shall tell you presently she whispered the little party broke up shortly afterwards the hall outside where they lingered to make their adieux was unusually crowded harvey grimm felt touch upon his elbow pleasant luncheon i trust he frowned he recognised brodie who was apparently waiting friend it was exactly the meeting which he had desired to avoid he greeted him however with his customary geniality lunching late are you he observed brodie seemed scarcely to hear him his eyes were fixed upon the young belgian who with his arm in sling was being helped carefully into his overcoat suddenly however he stretched out his arm laid it upon harvey grimm shoulder and drew him to within whispering distance see here harvey he muttered i know what game you playing but if any man tries to boost he going to have rough journey harvey grimm was shocked my dear fellow he began waste your breath the other interrupted he turned away remembe r i got my eye on you well our friend there it may be waiting game but you find there at the finish sure my name paul brodie the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https strode off towards the telephone booth harvey grimm found his hand gripped by his guest my sister and i thank you very excellent luncheon grimm captain brinnen said politely i trust that you will soon give us an opportunity of repaying your hospitality you will come to the girl whispered in aaron rodd ear at number thirteen grosvenor square this afternoon at five the poet was inclined to be peevish the three men walked down the strand in this adventure he declared i not see where i come in aaron rodd is to go and fetch the diamonds and probably have tea with the beautiful young lady who has changed her name and you he went on addressing harvey grimm thereupon vanish with the stones to your mysterious and return with the gold i am simply not in it i might well not exist it is regrettable but true harvey grimm assented remember however that you are to our little circle place shall be found you presently i can promise you that the cycle of our adventures will not be ended with the realisation of jeremiah sands diamonds this affair unfortunately presents opportunity your activities i not propose even to offer you more than trifling share in the financial results financially the poet announced airily i am independent the taste my poetry has spread like forest fire there will be trifle of mine by the by in the pall mall night get to look out it harvey grimm once was unsympathetic look here he said stopping suddenly i wish you forget your poetry few minutes there is just one way you can make yourself useful you saw sleek podgy bulky looking man with hair brushed back who spoke to in the hall at the milan the poet nodded i remember he murmured wishing that you would allow to edit your acquaintances that man harvey grimm continued was paul brodie an amateur detective he has set himself the task of bringing about the arrest of jeremiah sands he came to europe with that idea it was he who had the old gentleman and his daughter taken to the from my rooms we have been working together but he out with us now and he blames us that fiasco i should like to know why he is still hanging about the milan court i will return there the poet promised i will endeavour to engage him in conversation harvey grimm smiled pityingly oh my ingenuous youth he murmured your ideas of tackling detectiv are bright and engaging yet your best the very imbecility of your methods may lead to success i should very much like to know where paul brodie is proposing to spend this afternoon the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https nodded in mysterious fashion and left them harvey grimm passed his arm through his friend they turned into the little street which led down to aaron rodd offices aaron he said earnestly if your little expedition this afternoon should by any chance involve you in any manner of trouble remember that there one golden silence you make cult of it in private life if anything should happen to depart from it at precisely the appointed hour aaron rodd was shown by footman in deep black livery into small but hed room in the largest house which he had ever entered on his way thither he had caught the sound of many voices laughing and talking the tinkling of teacups the scraping of violin evidently some sort of reception was in progress outside canvas shelter was stretched to the curbstone and long row of automobiles and carriages was in evidence it was almost ten minutes before the door was abruptly opened and henriette brinnen appeared she had changed her clothes since luncheon and was wearing gown of some soft grey material and large hat with black feathers in her hand she was carrying small brown paper package sealed at both ends the little smile with which she welcomed him was bewildering i have kept you waiting she exclaimed and i must send you away again quickly believe i am not always so inhospitable this afternoon it happens madame is receiving and i must help her i would ask you to come and be presented but it is more important that you proceed swiftly with your mission of course he assented taking the parcel from her hand tell first she begged keeping her fingers upon the closed door why were you so sad and silent all he laughed little hardly hesitated and was suddenly frank because he told her i have not yet got used to my new rôle in life but it is amusing surely perhaps i am he sighed i rather resent being driven into the crooked ways you are thinking only of yourself then to be perfectly truthful he assured her i was thinking very little of myself i am afraid you but why because you are reckless he answ ered your brother may be the cleverest adventurer who ever kept the police at arm length but there is always the risk you can not go on playing part ever you may hide at the milan court and call yourself what you will and the chances are with you but to borrow some one else identity to advertise yourself the companion of reigning princess to occupy position of trust and favour in her household and help to receive her guests how long you think that will go on she laughed at him but her eyes were full of kindness you speak only of my brother cleverness she said is that because i am woman let assure you my dear friend in many ways i am his equal your fears the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https i am right am i not when i assume that your present position is new to you it is aaron rodd confessed until these last few the day in fact when i first saw you in the embankmen t gardens and harvey grimm sauntered an hour later into my of have lived miserably perhaps but honestly she laughed once more in his face oh but you are so foolish she murmured believe person is really honest we all live upon our neighbours there is only one thing in life which is common to all by honour i mean fidelity to one friends take that into your heart dear mr aaron rodd and you can hold your head high any man on earth he stooped and kissed her fingers she stood by the open door an action curiously enough which he had never contemp lated in his life before in connection with any woman yet which seemed to him at that moment an entirely natural proceeding that at least he promised is something which i can hold on to he descended the stairs the clasp of her fingers still tingling on his was handed from the grave major who guarded the hall to another servant and on to the footman who summoned taxicab him he gave the address of his office and was driven promptly off few yards from the corner of the square however the taxicab slackened speed and stopped by the side of the pavement almost before he realised what was happening the door was opened an inspector in uniform and peaked cap let down the vacant seat and sat opposite to him paul brodie smoking large cigar followed and took the place by his side the cab went on aaron rodd remained stonily silent the eyes of the two men were fixed upon the brown paper parcel which he had had time to conceal sorry to take you out of your way rodd brodie said with ponderous sarcasm but we just want you to call mom ent at the marlborough street tation in the meantime you would care to tell us i suppose what you have in that small parcel you are holding so carefully aaron rodd sat perfectly still chain of wild ideas flashed through his brain only to be instantly dismissed he thought of throwing the parcel out of the window hurling himself upon the two men and making fierce struggle liberty there was something ignominious in the facility of his capture in the completeness of his failure yet he realised perfectly well that escape by any means was hopeless that behaviour of any sort incompatible with his supposed position would be an instant confession of guilt i am engaged on confidential business on behalf of client he announced stiffly and i can not conceive what authority you have to delay or to ask questions brodie nodded sympathetically that perfectly correct he admitted perfectly correct not another word was spoken until the cab drew up outside the brodie paid the taxicab driver and aaron rodd with an escort on either side of him crossed the pavement passed through the bare stone hall and into small superintendent who was writing at desk glanced up they entered brodie leaned down and said few words in his ear the former nodded and turned to aaron rodd have you any objection he asked to our examining the parcel which you are carrying the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https none whatever aaron rodd answered coolly brodie took it from him and carried it to the desk the superintendent broke the seals and withdrew the lid from an oblong wooden jeweller box there was mass of inside which he hastily removed then his fingers suddenly stopped he gazed downwards and frowned brodie face was study the imprecations which broke from his lips were transatlantic and sufficing aaron rodd emboldened by their consternation stepped forward and looked over their shoulders at the bottom of the box reposed small black opal the of which was broken the superintendent rose to his feet whisper ed something sharply to brodie who lapsed into gloomy silence and turned to aaron rodd you mind telling where you were taking this box mr rodd he asked to jeweller to have the pin mended was the prompt reply the superintendent replaced the wadding thrust the lid back along its grooves tied up the box and returned it to its owner we are very sorry to have interfered with your mission he said but before you leave us i am going to ask you so that we may be perfectly satisfied to allow to search your person aaron rodd shrugged his shoulders pray you will he consented holding out his arms the superintendent went carefully through his pockets felt his clothing and returned to his place we are very sorry to have detained you sir he said the necessities of the law you know inspector get mr rodd another i know something about the law aaron rodd declared trying hard to feel that this was not some absurd nightmare and i still fail to realise on what possible authority you can practically arrest solicitor leaving the house of an exceedingly distinguish ed client break the seals of private packet and dismiss him without word of explanation the superintendent glanced severely at mr brodie we are unfortunately in the position rodd he confessed of having been misled by false information we can more nor less than apologise our action mistaken though it seems to have been was undertaken in the interests of the law with the profession of which you are connected i hope therefore that you will be tolerant aaron rodd received his packet wished the three men brief good afternoon and left the he drove at once to his office where he found the poet reclining on three chairs drawn up to the window with block of paper in his hand and pipe in his mouth where harvey grimm aaron demanded the poet laid down his pencil and waved his hand gone gone where i have idea was the bland reply i spent an hour or two at the milan conversing with several friends and incidentally looking out brodie then an idea came the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https of wappingme i needed space and solitude i thought of your empty rooms and i hastened here if you would like to damn your poetry aaron rodd interr upted tell what you mean when you say that harvey grimm has gone he was to have been waiting here i left the milan the poet explained i enquired of the if harvey grimm had returned the man told that not only had he returned but that he had left again in taxicab few minutes afterwards i understood the fellow to say that he had gone into the country and would not be back several days aaron rodd put his hand to his forehead already dim suspicion of the truth was finding its way into his brain then there was gentle tinkle from the bell of his newly installed telephone he took up the receiver the voice which spoke was the voice of harvey grimm that you aaron yes anything happened yes it you need explain back in about week so long aaron rodd laid down the receiver he was still little bewildered oppressed by certain sense of humiliation he threw the packet which he had been carrying so carefully upon his desk and scowled what upset you cresswell asked amiably seems to i nothing but aaron rodd replied gloomily messenger boy could have done my job worry the poet advised by the by you happen to know of rhyme silken you the telephone bell ringing once more intervened to save the poet from the which aaron fingers were handling longingly what is it he demanded taking up the receiver just little message aaron rodd please was the soft reply please forgive was so necessary and the pin was little fering will you please have the chain mended and wear it that was all there was pause any reply the connection was finished aaron laid down the receiver lit cigarette and almost swaggered back to his desk sorry old fellow he said genially i ca seem to think of one the moment i have try chapter the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https the following morning aaron rodd somewhat to his surprise received visit from his only client jacob potts who was publican and retired pugilist and whose appearance entirely coincided with his dual profession looked around the apartment with little snif f ho he exclaimed better times arrived eh you telephone too and new chairs golly does it run to cigars aaron rodd shamelessly offered him box of harvey grimm cabanas his client bit off the end of one with relish and seemed inclined to swallow it he eventually spat it out however lit the cigar and throwing himself back in chair crossed his rather pudgy legs know anything about maritime law he began not much aaron rodd admitted lawyer very seldom knows anything outside his little bent he went on we have great rows of books properly indexed turn up the point and read the decisions where are jacob potts enquired looking around the somewhat bare walls pawned aaron rodd confessed all the same i can go into the law library and give you an answer on any point you like to put forward within very few minutes potts nodded that why i kind of took fancy to you years ago when you was nipper he confessed doubling and twisting about you just straightforward answer to straightforward question you know anything about maritime law sez i sez you i can find out and so you can now one of the regular kidney of you fellows have been messing about half an hour and then have read it all out of book you never tumbled to it yet did you what my new line of business was never aaron rodd acknowledged from your conversation at various times i gathered that you saved money in the ring acquired prosperous property and were in some way or other responsible the organisation of labour in your neighbourhood jacob potts grinned let it go at that he decided well the point i want to know about is this supposing in the course of business i committed an offence against the law you understand and i legs it nootral country you be holland can i be of f dutch boat in nootral waters on my way to holland it would depend aaron rodd replied on the nature of your offence i will let you know your exact position if you like to come in

he added with grin what about twelv that give time to get can of beer and some bread and cheese the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https i shall be quite ready you at that time aaron rodd promised the departed and aaron rodd after giving him time to get away followed him out into the street spent half an hour in the nearest law library and returned with volume under his arm he found the poet seated on the top of the stairs outside his rooms my dear fellow the latter exclaimed peevishly he rose to his feet this new habit of yours of locking the door after you is most inconvenient why not go to your club and wait aaron rodd suggested it only few yards away inhospitable the other sighed and i have come to you filled with most generous idea listen this may seem commonplace thing to you but to it is an epoch in my career i have opened banking account i noticed that the was thronged usual i came by aaron rodd remarked this week the poet declared

maritime law he is coming back directly the poet ignored the hint my presence here will you good he pointed out he will perhaps take another client he is not man of culture by any chance he is not aaron rodd admitted tersely nor is he one of those who have been whacked into reading one of your poems he must have read about them at any rate cresswell insisted little irritably if you introduce you had better mention my identity fame so far has left quite unspoiled i still feel little thrill of pleasure in noticing the effect which the mention of my name has upon strangers come in he added pleasantly in response to thunderous knock at the door the door opened and jacob potts entered bringing with him strong atmosphere of old ale and bread and cheese to aaron rodd surprise he recognised the poet with broad grin my ulysses of wapping the latter exclaimed holding out his hand what meeting jacob potts jerked his thumb towards cresswell he turned to the lawyer one of my clients he remarked aaron rodd was puzzled he had once paid visit to the over which jacob potts presided and he found it hard to associate cresswell in any way with the atmosphere there mr jacob potts had pressed thick forefinger to his the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https mum the word he declared reassuringly you worry the poet picked up his hat from this gentleman he asserted grandiloquently i have secrets to be frank with you it was he and another friend who are responsible those incidents in my career with which you have been professionally connected jacob

handkerchief to think of meeting he murm ured weakly you see we our jokes even in the serious professions not that i ever let my boys go too far he concluded and i keep out of trouble much i can that why i want to know the law about this sea business the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https rodd read him extracts from the volume he had brought back and explained several doubtful points the publican face was little grave when he had finished i ai at all sure he decided that i fancy trusting any of my best boys with this job and i loathe foreigners any way well i wo ask you any questions aaron rodd said but if you want any free advice here it is you made plenty of money i should keep friends with the law if i were you you ca employ such band of ruffians you

rodd and much obliged you add your little bit on to my quarterly account wot another client he added i toddling he shook hands with his adviser and reached the door just it was opene d and henriette entered he stood moment though stupefied then he disappeared through the doorway he turned round and winked solemnly at aaron wishing you good morning he said he closed the door curiously enough on that first morning when they had met in the embankment gardens little ray of wintry sunshine which had stolen in through the dusty uncurtained windows lay between them aaron rodd whose first impulse had been one of joy at this unexpected visit stopped suddenly in his progress across the room there was something so entirely different about her change so absolute and mystifying the faintly supercilious deportment and expression of the young woman of the world carrying herself so easily and with such natural grace and seemed to have deserted her she was suddenly frightened child seeking shelter and with effort of imagination he seemed to see her flying sanctuary from those terrors of which he had already warned her is anything wrong he enquired anything fresh i mean she sank into his chair she was panting little though she had been hurrying i am afraid she confessed i am terrified give your hand to hold and listen she gripped his strong fingers they both almost held their breaths there was sound except the distant rumble of traf fic by degrees she grew calmer you are not worrying about my errand he asked anxiously you know what happened to it is that she told him simply that was all planned beforehand you did mind of course not he assured her it is something which happened before i came to england she went on something terrible something from which it seems to i can never escape listen i must tell you one shall tell you now leopold has always been fortunate but the luck went against one day i was face to face with detection i had the whole of the jewels in the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https i was confronted with the worst i had time to think i killed the man who would have brought ruin on all of us on worse than ruin you hear killed him aaron rodd sat speechless she seemed so small and it was incredible he was great man colonel in the prussian guards he had high connections some of them belgian the threats of his people reached my ears even before i had escaped they swore to get back into belgium and if i were once there god knows what would happen to at first when i reached london i felt safe i managed to become attached to the household of madame surely in london was sanctu ary and lately i have felt different this will not tell you his is connected even with the family of madame herself i begin to fear that they have suspicions the princess has been cold to lately there are several others in the household who seem to look askance at i have had letters from relatives in belgium inviting to go back some of them i know have been forgeries during the last few days i have been followed about only yesterday there was little fog i was in the square near the corner of brook street suddenly i heard swift footsteps just behind there was whistle taxicab drove up by the kerb there was man in it sitting back in the corner i saw his was cruel horrible i could hear another man running from out of the fog towards i knew what they thrust into the taxicab and just at that moment i shrieked and two strangers came from one of the big houses and i clung to them the taxicab drove off and the man seemed to melt away the two gentlemen thought i was mad they escorted to another taxicab since then i dare not move alone how did you come here he asked in one of madame cars it waits outside even at the corner of this street there were two men who frightened my week of service is up with madame she has not encouraged to stay longer she looks at with the eyes of suspicion and at the milan court i am afraid my grandfather is so world is finished him and leopold is so cold and mysterious he comes and goes with never word there you see what has happened to she exclaimed with little quaver in her tone i have lost my nerve and i have been brave monsieur aaron i have been brave of course you have he answered encouragingly and of course you will continue to be brave you must not fancy things believe you are safe at least against being sent back to belgium against your will the fears you and about you well what are they she interrupted anxiously tell about them these diamonds he continued slowly if i might venture to say so it seems to that your brother is making mistake in dragging you into the affair at all we could have done our business with him and left you out of it but he is watched every hour of the day she explained they can not find the jewels and they can prove nothing against him unless they find them but they know very well that soon he must dispose of them and they never willingly let him out of their sight besides we are all to share in the proceeds why should we not take little of the risk oh believe she went on eagerly i can face anything that comes to through the jewels it is the other thing i am afraid of i can not speak even to you of that awful moment the man who guessed our of fered silence we were alone she broke off suddenly absolutely incapable of speech she was white almost to the lips her eyes were filled with reminiscent horror he leaned over and took her hands once more little clumsily in the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https think of it he begged that part of it at any rate is done with one must fight what one has the sake of others i know she agreed trying to smile at him but tell is any way is

rejoined henriette they drove in what was to him unaccustomed splendour to the milan and parted in the little hall it is foolish she said she held out her hand but i feel better because i have been

have been little depressing but the poet uproarious spirits he sang himself hoarse and filled the vehicle with cigarette smoke they reached at last region of small streets all running one way in the background vision of lights suspended apparently from nowhere the sound of an occasional siren the constant sometimes overpowering odour of mud when at last the taxicab came to standstill they were near enough to the river to hear its rise and fall against little bank of shingle from behind the windows of the one side of which seemed to abut on to the came the sound of many voices they dismissed the taxicab and pushed open the the poet who had been complaining bitterly of thirst on the way down led the way to the counter two whiskies and sodas tim he ordered where the the man jerked his thumb over his shoulder up in the room getting things to rights he announced if you take my advic cresswell you slip in there soon you had your drink there be crowd when the gong goes and they tough lot to struggle with seats aaron glanced around the room was filled with motley throng of loafers with here and there sprinkling of sailors one huge dutchman in soiled nautical uniform was already furiously drunk the two young men slipped up the stairs to which the poet led the way and passed through the door into the further apartment just the dutchman truculent eye fell upon them should wonder if we did tumble across something in the way of an adventure here the poet remarked cheerfully we ought to have changed our clothes hello here the boss jacob potts on his way down the long dimly lit room came to sudden standstill his expression scarcely confirmed the welcome which the heartiness of his invitation earlier in the day had promised he glanced at the two visitors in something like dismay nothing however could damp the poet the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https we come down to see the scrap he declared if you have jacob potts replied with something which sounded threatening in his tone you welcome if so be that you any other reason your coming maybe word of advice from would be out of place and that word git when we seen the scrap and not before cresswell chuckled you know that it cost the best part of quid to get down here bring in and let see what stuff they made of jacob potts looked at the speaker doubtfully you drop young fellow you he muttered trenchantly and convincingly put old chap the poet replied steadying himself by the back of the chair my dear friend and i are making an evening of it potts face cleared little boys will be boys he assented amiably and there none of you the worse drop good liquor on board fact is i bit jumpy he confessed my boys have got little game of all nights did you happen to notice he asked anxiously if that dutchman was down there there is son of holland in the bar the poet replied in glorious state of inebriation he is seeking some one to destroy tell you the truth we fled before him his eye rested upon us and he scowled jacob potts lifted blind and stared out towards the river that his steamer lying there he muttered i wish to god he get aboard her aaron rodd moved softly to his side is this little game you spoke of he the game your boys have on one which brought you up to consult about maritime law this morning it is jacob potts admitted and wot about it aaron rodd shrugged his shoulders before he could reply however gong sounded the door of the room was thrown open and sur ging mob from the bar streamed in front seats yelled the poet making dive forward but aaron caught him firmly by the arm stephen he whispered there something up here we may have to come into it let get seats by the door where we can slip out quietly i not joking considering all things cresswell was wonderfully amenable they stood on one side and let the crowd rush past them and eventually found two seats against the side wall within few yards of the door jacob potts seemed the moment to have forgotten their existence he was standing in the middle of the little ring which was roped off on raised platform stamping with his heel upon the floor there were shrill whistles and cries of order gents potts announced this is scrap twelve rounds between our old friend canary joe and youngster i found in craven dunks he pointed first towards young man with flaxen hair brushed smoothly down over his forehead attired in scarlet knickerbockers and pink vest the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https heterogeneous attire he had thrown soiled ulster his opponent wore thin flannel vest pair of dilapidated golfing knickerbockers and the remains of they both arose and made awkward salutations canary joe was evidently the favourite but mr potts himself led the applause his opponent fair gents he begged this young stranger but from what i seen of i believe out to best and we none of us ca more there were few more preliminaries and the two young men faced one another they moved round moment like cats amidst an almost breathless silence then there were one or two wild plunges little more cautious sparring and yell of applause the young man in the golfing knickerbockers landed his right very near his opponent mouth you treat too light canary they yelled from the back keep your eye on left there was brief pause at the end of the first round canary joe sat scowling at his opponent he received the attentions of his second the next round although without decisive effect was more vigorous the third produced black eye each the audience settled down to enjoy itself suddenly the door at the back of the room was opened and from somewhere below came the sound of gong struck three tunes there were little murmurs of annoyance disjointed oaths and growls from various quarters but without single moment hesitation at least score of the audience rose to their feet and made the door aaron rodd and his companion watched them they slunk by the poet was exceedingly interested someone going to get biffing he confided i wonder what it all about aaron acted on an inexplicable impulse let go and see he suggested the poet rose at once to his feet he was ready enough if trifle dubious they wo want us butting in he remarked all the same we might see little of the fun it will be more like the real thing than this they passed down the few stairs into the bar several of the men had paused drink but others had already slunk out into the street following on the heels of the hindmost aaron rodd and his compan ion found themselves almost swallowed up in sudden fog which had rolled in from the river from somewhere in the midst of the chaos they heard quick authoritative voice joe you and half dozen of you take the corners of the street hold up anything that tries to come down start fight amongst yourselves if there are coppers about you others come out on the wharf that dutchman in this i swear the poet whispered let try and find our way down to the river i know where the gate is almost he spoke heavy hand desce nded upon his shoulder and dark evil face was thrust almost into his look here the man said you may be after any down but it one them nights we need strange rs around you tumble the old man wolves are out and they nasty way of snapping anything that comes along the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https what the game sid the poet asked engagingly we only here bit of sport never you mind what the game is was the terse reply you get back and watch those two chickens scratching one another faces there was moment silence then from few yards off came the sound of slight moan from person suf focating what that aaron rodd demanded sharply never you mind what it is was the swift reply from their unseen adviser take your carcases inside if you want to keep them whole he vanished in the fog aaron rodd gripped his companion arm stephen he muttered that was woman voice sounded like it the poet assented have you got your electric torch in your pocket yes they heard the rattle of key in the gate which led out on to the wharf some time it refused to turn again they heard the moan and aaron blood ran cold i ca stand this stephen he whispered hoarsely come on one moment the poet answered they ca get the gate open i believe the on to this stay where you are minute he hurried back tore up the stairs and into the dimly lit room filled still with breathless expectancy it was the end of another round during which canary joe had obtained some slight advantage the poet walked straight up the room regardless of the growls which assailed him and touched its presiding spirit upon the shoulder he said you told when we had dealings that you never taken on any job in which there was woman to be harried that right boy jacob potts agreed there woman in the game woman who has been brought down here by some of your lot and who is down there now either drugged or half conscious they are trying to get her on the dutchman steamer how you know it woman was the brief demand i tell you we both heard her groan the poet insisted jacob potts rose to his feet boys he said addressing the belligerents and gents there will be ten minutes interval sorry but it business joe will serve the drinks which this occasion only will be free the ten minutes interval softened by the promise of free drinks displeased one jacob potts still in his strode out of the place through the front room of the and out into the street where queer unnatural silence seemed to reign there ai woman about he

yards away on the old wooden wharf they just gone through aaron whispered fiercely come on jacob potts produced key from his pocket and swung the gate open if you fellows have made fool of he muttered there be trouble but if my boys have let in there be hell just he finished speaking they once more heard the faint smothered cry from in front followed by man oath they saw the flashing of light and heard the fall of rope from the wharf into the river jacob potts quickened his pace turn on that glim yours he growled and mind where you going there there was confusion of answering voices it the they heard some one say then the light of aaron rodd torch flashed upon the short wooden dock and upon the men grouped at the top of the crazy steps at its furthest extremity one of them came back it was the man who had warned the poet and aaron he said earnestly this ai your show you leave us alone and get back to the fight that be damned jacob potts replied firmly it job of yourn to tell wot to you know very well there just one thing i stick at and i asks you plain question sid and plain answer expected is that bundle you carrying woman or ai it it woman the man proclaimed doggedly and it

right arm landed full on the point of his assailant jaw the man went over with sickening crash sid who was sparring still with jacob potts leaned moment downwards lay her down in the boat and come up one of you he shouted bill done in get down and let the other boys through they at the gate we finish off these blighters then one of the men who had been stepping into the boat turned back suddenly there was scream from below and aaron rodd knew that his had been dream the voice was henriette help help she cried her voice was smothered but aaron rodd shout rang through the night we here henriette we rescue you hold on then there was the sound of mighty splash the poet who had suddenly closed with his man had got him to the very edge of the wharf apparently one or both had lost their balance moment the fighting ceased every one listened few yards away they could hear the long level strokes of man man only then jacob potts voice broke the tense silence done he moaned aaron rodd who had been waiting the two men running up the steps swung round peaceful man all his life he was suddenly fiend he seized the electric torch from his pocket and brought it down with all his strength on

his head felt them battered down struck wildly again and again one of his blows went home with sickening thud and the joy of it thrilled him both men were closing in upon him however on the other side of the wharf they could hear the gate being rattled there was low whistle twice repeated the man from the boat shouted climb the gate boys there more of jacob potts gasped keep it up moment rodd i coming in to help you then there was another hush ominous in sense mysterious there was sound which conveyed little enough to aaron rodd but which the others recognised promptly long mechanical swing of oars without second hesitation aaron two assailants turned and ran and silent off the wharf and vanished somewhere in the darkness the gate was rattled more and from up the street came the sound of flying footsteps jacob potts began to sob it the river police that ever i should be glad to welcome get down to the boat mr rodd my god what come to you sir aaron rodd walked from one side of the quay to the other like drunken man there were all manner of stars in front of him he gripped hold of the rope and stole down the steps he was suddenly steadied by great excitement with black shawl torn

over her gripping the end of the rope his face streaming with blood but with all manner of things in his eyes and she made little movement tried to hold up her hands tried even to smile oh thank god thank god the sound of the oars was longer audible long boat crowded with men in dark uniform came gliding out of the shadows gripped the side of the quay the poet looking like drowned retriever stood up in the bows and cheered lustily one of the uniformed men who seemed to be an inspector flashed lantern upon the scene what wrong here he asked quickly aaron rodd kneeled upon the slippery steps and pointed to the girl one of the men clambered into the boat and cut the ropes they half carried her up on to the wharf the policemen followed they flashed lanterns around the man sid was lying on his side motionless aaron rodd first assailant was tying in heap moaning to himself mr jacob potts was just beginning to recover himself so you in this are you potts the inspector remarked grimly the boys broken loose eh just little scrap the publican groaned then aaron rodd was suddenly aware of new sensation he felt pair of warm arms thrown around his neck the poet who had been shaking himself like

that harvey grimm promised at few minutes after twelve on the following morning harvey grimm very spruce and very debonair pushed open the of the small of the milan and crossed the room with the obvious intention of proceeding towards the bar little welcoming chorus assailed him from circular lounge in the corner of the room seated there were four of his friends whom at first he scarcely recognised there was aaron rodd with his arm in sling piece of on his forehead and thick stick by his side the poet with bandaged head and shade over his eye henriette looking little fragile but very animated and her brother still in uniform leaning back in an easy chair by her side harvey grimm stared at them all in blank and astonishment has there been an earthquake he asked he shook hands and exchanged greetings with everybody or have i in my country seclusion missed scrap you have missed the scrap of your life cresswell replied eagerly you have saved your skin at the expense of untold glory tell about it the begged he took his place in the little circle where can one find words the poet began expansively it was an homeric sight battle royal it took place in the darknes s upon

tell you this my friend an untrained fighter the world does hold man who can hit so quickly and so hard our newly established hero aaron rodd i have decided that he has earned immortality i am composing poem which i shall dedicate to him could i hear what it was all about harvey grimm asked meekly henrietta the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https they told their story all of them in turn except brinnen supplying details towards the end however the poet took up the running and finished alone his face the latter declared gripping aaron rodd by the arm was like pastel in white chalk against the soft background of velvety blackness heaven lit the burning light in his eyes the swing of his right arm was like the pendulum of oh keep this rot the poem aaron rodd interrupted forcibly if you want to gas what about your own swim to the river series of truly homeric episodes the poet assented with gentle sigh my pen shall give them immortality i shall not forget to allude to the part which i too played in this drama of fog and river the water was very cold he added suddenly finishing his cocktail and our friend from the country brinnen asked quietly how has he fared there was breathless silence harvey grimm nodded slightly he glanced around the room of which they were the only occupants both doors were closed all is well he announced softly i returned last night the business is finished how much brinnen enquired eagerly there will be thousand pounds i could not draw it all last night but it will be paid within week i have nine thousand with six of that i will hand over at any moment you please there is one in the room brinnen murmured suggestively harvey grimm drew out ran some notes through his fingers and passed them over to brinnen once more the latter glanced around the room then with his left hand he produced from the pocket of his coat necklace of brilliants one of which the centre one seemed to shine with faint rosy light better see what you can with that he remarked tossing it lightly across harvey grimm held the necklace moment in his fingers before he slipped it into the concealment of his pocket during that moment he caught an impr ession of henriette eyes full of amazement fixed upon it she turned towards her brother leopold she exclaimed wonderingly i not he brushed her words aside you have not seen all he told her significantly harvey grimm rang the bell i warn you he said that it will be few days before i can abandon civilisation again even task like this brinnen moved uneasily in his chair it is work this he pointed out which carries with it special urgency remember that its results will last lifetime quite true was the somewhat grudging admission it also means great risks i have been near the end of things within the last hours i care to be the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https brodie strikesthe waiter appeared with tray full of cocktails harvey grimm accepted his and leaned back in his chair with beatific aspect this he murmured is one of the decadent luxuries denied to in my country seclusion like many other things in life it is almost worth while to lose it time the he broke off in his speech they all leaned little forward in their chairs from side door at the further end of the apartmen t leading to the private suites in the hotel lift man suddenly appeared with valet upon his heels they crossed the room with almost feverish haste they were obviously distressed small boy followed moment or two later with face pale death there was confused murmur of voices just outside the glass door leading to the main portion of the hotel and moment afterw ards they reappeared with the manager between them all talking excitedly at the same time then the door opened once more and woman tall and dark in long of green silk rushed in she threw out her hands towards the manager send the police she cried my is murdered and my they are all stolen the police you hear they all vanished through the distant door the woman clinging to the manager arm and talking excitedly all the time the little party looked at one another that was madame borria the wife of the south american millionaire harvey grimm said slowly the woman who wears the necklace with the rose diamond henriette exclaimed breathlessly then there was queer tense silence captain brinnen lifted his glass to his lips and finished his cocktail there is more than one rose diamond in the world he observed coolly chapter vi jacob potts blowing very hard and with his tongue protruding from the corner of his mouth finished an elaborate signatu re patted his waistcoat pocket in which he had just deposited cheque laid down the pen and leaning back in his chair crossed his legs he was once more occupying the distinguished position of being aaron rodd only client i never thought to it he declared i never thought to part with sailor while i was so to speak in the prime of life it the lads turn agin that done it it shows mr rodd he added impressively what money will in this world financially aaron rodd reminded him you are independent absolutely independent of work i know but what man to potts replied with sigh there was plenty down there always to keep occupied and those i could have sworn to their running straight till that blarsted dutchman came along i tell you rodd he went on i done some deals in my life and i been up against propositions where money did seem much object i jobs brought to which i would allow my lads to tackle where they in manner of speaking thrust blank cheque down under the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https but i never in my born days knowed money chucked about like them was at the back of that dutchman was willing to chuck it about why an ordinary job if my boys got tenner apiece they thought themselves on velvet from wot tim my barman told and he generally noses out wot there is going abaht there was two quid each of those boys if they got the young woman on board wonder they were kind of of f their chumps where exactly did they mean to take her aaron rodd asked jacob potts grinned i bet she knows sir and i should thought she told you before this he replied give every man due i say and an amateur that more idea than babe unborn how to put up his dukes i must say you did fairly let into rodd i never seed man lose of so in manner of speaking and that young gent writes poetry why i make bruiser of in six months seem to feel pain and bein we on the subject of that scrap sir are you above taking word of advice from an old man i certainly am not aaron rodd assured him if i was you i should go bit quiet with the young lady and friends jacob potts said seriously i nowt straightforward to tell agin and that fact but bit here and bit there is good enough man with level head there three or four of kidney in this country and if i not greatly mistook they wrong i ca think that the young lady comes altogether under that designation aaron rodd protested stiffly at the same time potts i must admit that her associ ations are mysterious steer clear of them sir and take an old man advice the begged i things to about them that i should like altogether to put into aaron rodd saw his client out and found an old friend ascending the staircase harvey grimm was whistling softly to himself his hat was at its usual jaunty angle his violets were fresh ever his clothe s carefully brushed only his expression was different he was almost serious he took aaron by the arm put on your hat my friend he said w will walk little time aaron obeyed and they made their way down to the embankment gardens listen harvey grimm began looking around to be sure that were within hearing distance there is such thing tempting fate little too far i think we have come to the point when we had better draw in explain yourself please his companion begged during the last few weeks harvey grimm proceeded i have broken up and cut into different shapes nearly hundred thousand pounds worth of diamonds i have actually handled nearly eighty thousand pounds in money you and i are fifteen thousand pounds each to the good our friends want to go on frankly i got the funks i like to cry of f time that does sound like you aaron remarked perhaps not his friend admitted all the same i fancy thrusting my neck into the noose brodie does even know it himself but he was hot on the scent last time he found out somehow or other the very house in which i was living we were in the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https room he even had searched once i saw him stare i thought it was all up then his suspicion passed it was just the way one of the jewish girls down there had accepted which put him off but i tell you aaron it was touch and go then the diamonds was stroke of geniu s there of which i am proud i had long to it either where you think i hid them idea of course you have listen i had set them roughly in common brass fittings like pile of common brooches that were being sold and i mixed them all up together let them lie there on the counter of the little jeweller shop where i have been doing my work and where i was hiding brodie took up some and let them fall through his fingers i tell you that was the closest shave of my life i think we should be wise to drop it aaron declared earnestly we are off the rocks now harvey i am content with what i got that how i feeling the other assented and yet there this last necklace it seems rather playing it on brinnen not to get rid of that him you see unless it broken up quickly it more dangerous stuf f to handle than the others why aaron demanded be foolish harvey grimm admo nished little impatiently there the hotel where it was stolen right in front of you here am i with the necklace hundred yards away there brinnen on the same floor there madame it devil piece of work anyway you mean that it madame borria necklace you got aaron rodd groaned of course it is harvey grimm replied little testily you saw it yesterday did you there it is in my overcoat pocket the pocket nearest you at the present moment aaron rodd paused abruptly before bench and sat down it was quite close to where he had first seen henriette look here he said god sake harvey jump into taxi at there and take the thing of f somewhere take it off was the grim response i give cool hundred to be rid of it at this minute the trouble is that if i make single move in the direction of any of my haunts the whole thing will be blown upon you mean that you are being followed brodie has been fifty yards away from since nine harvey grimm muttered madame borria saw him yesterday just after the theft and he persuaded her to put the matter into his hands see that end one but three on the top storey but two aaron looked up to where the spotless white front of the milan gleamed through the budding trees i see it he admitted that is the window of madame borria now count five windows to the left and one is my room now up again and two on to the right and you come to the apartments of captain brinnen known to paul brodie the redoubtable jeremiah sands when you add to these geographical coincidences the fact that the necklace is at the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https moment in my pocket and that i ca move yard without being followed you will understand that one needs all one wits this morning we are getting just little near the bone nearer than you imagine perhaps aaron rodd whispered here brodie harvey grimm was moment curiously still his frame seemed to have stiffened into sort of rigid attention one felt that his brain was working with the same concentrated force he neither moved nor looked in the direction which his companion had indicated instead he leaned little further back in the corner of the seat and lit cigarette one needs to remember he murmured that it is really quite long time since i have seen this unwelcome intruder upon our privacy brodie came strolling along the asphalt walk puffing out his cheeks and gazing about him though exercise and an interested contemplation of the river were the sole reason his peregrinations he appeared to recognise the two men only in the act of passing them he at once stopped short and greeted them in his usual hearty fashion pleasant little spot this an hour recreation he declared i was thinking about you by the by grimm i walked along i am flattered was the calm reply i should have thought that all your attention would have been engrossed upon the little affair over yonder i understand that madame borria has placed the recovery of her necklace in your hands quite feather in your cap my friend if you succeed brodie glanced casually at the block of buildings in front yes he assented i have that on my mind of course by the by were you going back to your rooms by any chance i was on my way there come that fortunate with your permission we will walk along together the two men rose and they all strolled along towards the hotel curiously enough brodie went on i was wondering whether i should be likely to run up against you grimm we wanted to ask your advice inspector ditchwater and i about that little af fair the night before last you heard the particulars i suppose i was in the harvey grimm admitted when madame came running down in her naturally we heard the story told good many times just so madame it seems the detective continued heard nothing knew nothing until late in the morning when her maid told her that the floor valet was unable to obtain admittance to her husband room she at once stepped through the communica ting door and found him still unconscious with the necklace missing has he recovered yet harvey grimm enquired is he able to give any account of what happened i saw him few minutes last night brodie replied he seemed still very dazed and confused but he talked quite coherently his story is simple enough and does help us much he was fast ca even say at what he was awakened by the thrusting of gag into his mouth and bandage over his eyes he thought at first it was nightmare and he tried to spring out of bed he was held down however quite firmly and something placed under his nose which made him feel just though to the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https own words he was sinking back to sleep again he remembers nothing more until the morning when he was found by his wife the moment they released the gag he was violently sick and the room certainly smells ethery what about the necklace well the necklace some reason or other seems to have been kept in tin in his room it was locked of course but the keys were under his pillow fact which the thief whoever it was seems to have known the box was simply opened and the necklace taken it all sounds though the thief must have been some one staying in the hotel aaron observed the detective smiled pleasantly upon him they had left the gardens now and were approaching the back entrance to the milan the legal mind rodd he the legal mind yes i may say that we have come to that conclusion ourselves ditchwater and some one staying in the hotel we think they passed through the mahogany doors and brodie rang the bell the lift by the by grimm he suggested have you any have so often asked to have look at your rooms here delighted i sure the other assente d cheerfully we had better get out on the restaurant floor and take the lift on the other side of the café i am afraid you wo see them at their best just now i only returned yesterday from week absence that so brodie murmured say these little trips away from town are very pleasant i seem to be able to get away from my work often enough not that i been doing much good he confessed dolefully during the last few months things have been going rather against grimm i put in lot of work and it seem to have panned out according to expectations too bad harvey grimm sympathised you up against genius though brodie question about that paul brodie nodded solemnly i tell you sir he declared that jeremiah sands is more than genius he has the devil own luck too and i have come to the conclusion he added dropping his voice to confidential undertone that the young lady is almost clever he is i mind admitting he went on they passed through the café and stood waiting the other lift that at one time grimm i was inclined to think that you put it over little affair of the faked diamond you know when we tried to make scoop in rodd office i have changed my mind though jerry sands was too clever ever to walk into trap like that i guess i did you an injustice there grimm and you rodd things have been bit better with you lately though have they he wound up little abruptly aaron rodd raised his eyebrows he had the air of one who considered the last remark impertinent have they he observed coolly business of mine of course brodie went on say is this your floor grimm the lift had come to standstill and they stepped the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https my rooms are this way the latter announced the little party traversed corridor at the further end of which harvey grimm threw open door leading through small into an octagonal having pleasant outlook on the thames man was standing with his back towards them gazing out of the window he turned around at their entrance ah our friend ditchwater brodie murmured you know inspector ditchwater you grimm i know him certainly harvey grimm replied frowning but i ca imagine what the mischief he is doing in my rooms perhaps i ought to have explained the detective said apologetically we have taken the liberty grimm of making few slight investigations in your apartments the devil you have their tenant exclaimed gazing through the door into the inner room is that the reason why my bedroom seems all upside down probably the detective quite probably you see he continued you are in your way my friend an exceedingly interesting person to the police in this country you were at one time i believe to the police of new york when little affair such we been talking about happens only it were few yards away from your rooms why naturally we some interest in your doings have you anything against harvey grimm asked quietly few questions the other murmured see here grimm he went on with sudden change of tone you been absent from town exactly nine days until yesterday morning just where have you spent those nine days harvey grimm moved to the sideboar d and helped himself to cigarette from an open box well he observed i hanged if i can see that that anybody business except my own i will admit sir brodie proceeded that there is at the present moment not the slightest necessity why you should answer that is in fact matter slightly removed from the immediate object of our visit this yet it is question which i am going to press upon you and which should you feel so disposed grimm you might possibly answer with great benefit to yourself the long and short of it is this is it worth your while to put yourself right with the authorities and with or is it i tell you man to man i have theory of my own about you and your disappearances i should have thought harvey grimm remarked after brief pause that inspector ditchwater having made himself so free with my apartments would have been in position to have told you everything himself however come this way he led them into the bedroom portmanteau not wholly unpacked was open upon the stand my portmanteau he pointed out whi ch you have doubtless already ascertained from the came back with the night before last there the label brodie turned it over and examined it exford he the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https just so harvey grimm assented now what about those two sets of there the detective fingered the label and read the address aloud harvey grimm the cr own hotel exfor that of course harvey grimm conti nued drily is not evidence the label is in my own handwriting but you will find that the golf clubs there bear railway label i think the detective turned the bag around and nodded very interesting he admitted but this time of the year you sportsman brodie harvey grimm said reproachfully or you know all about the march trout just moment come back into the he led the way searched moment on the sideboard and threw daily mirror on to the table brodie adjusted his eyeglasses in the corner of one of the inner pages was small picture of man fishing and underneath fine catch of harvey grimm london sportsman in the river ex last monday quite good likeness too the detective observed he laid down the newspaper say this is very interesting grimm it disposes altogether of one of my theor ies i had idea that you possessed such simple tastes i done little myself well well ditchwater got back in time last night to help yourself to madame borria necklace it was all an affair of seconds ditchwa ter had suddenly caught harvey grimm two arms from behind whilst brodie hand had dived into his coat pocket the necklace glittered upon the table there was moment intense silence brodie was breathing quickly there was gleam of triumph in his eyes dear harvey grimm exclaimed fancy your finding that the detective bent over his prize the middle diamond is without doubt he announced rose diamond quite peculiar red light ditchwater step round to madame borria rooms ask her if she will be so good to come here at once the inspector disappeared harvey grimm relit his cigarette took off his overcoat in dazed way threw it over the back of chair and hung up his hat i should bother to that grimm the detective advised him quietly i am afraid we shall have to ask you to come and pay us little visit you got plenty of common sense i know it is necessary i suppose to tell you that there are couple more men in the corridor i idea of making fool of myself harvey grimm replied but you mind if i help myself to whisky and soda your methods are little the detective stepped in front of the sideboard say i believe moment grimm he said that you up against it badly enough that but i think i worry about drink just now the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https mix it yourself then the other suggested the detective hesitated moment and then did he was asked keeping his back however to the sideboard and reaching first the whisky and then the say when he invited courteously with his hand on the siphon that nicely thank you brodie your very good health harvey grimm drained the tumbler and set it down almost he did so there was knock at the door the sound of voices and madame borria entered the detective had just time to throw newspaper over the necklace before she appeared you sent she exclaimed turning at once to brodie tell have you news of my necklace you mind just running over its points once more brodie asked she made little grimace i wrote it all out scotland yard she reminded him patiently the stones are very fine but without any special character there are of them almost equal in size until you come to the front it is the front that is so wonderful the middle stone is rose diamond the only one in the world which flashes natural pink cross there is nothing else like it the two on either side are slightly pink and there is one yellow one two places from the middle stone but it is the middle stone brodie that is worth all the rest put together it is the most wonderful in the world please not keep in suspense the detective lifted the newspaper from the table it was seldom that he permitted himself any emotion there was slight gesture of triumph however he turned towards the woman she literally spran g upon the necklace turned it over gazed at it blankly moment and flung it back upon the table you brought here to look at this she exclaimed and after you have heard my description too why my necklace has twice many stones and my rose diamond has the flash of the cross both brodie and the inspector stood moment though stupefied incapable of speech harvey grimm threw his cigarette into the hearth madame borria he said i should perhaps add my apologies to those which our good friend there is engaged in framing the necklace is mine or rather it is entrusted to sale i am well aware that it does not resemble yours which i have often seen and admired brodie however in his excessive zeal gave time explanations he descended upon my rooms seized the necklace from my overcoat likely receptacle i think stolen goods he added with little expostulatory and sent of f you the lady turned almost savagely upon the detective so this is the way she said you conduct your affairs paul brodie you insult harmless gentleman whom one but an idiot could mistake thief you drag from my room to look at necklace which does not resemble mine in the slightest and meanwhile the thief gets further and further away she added with biting sarcasm oh you are very busy are you not catch ing him you are very near that two thousand pounds the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https stamped her foot and turned away brodie opened the door her his attitude was cringing madame borria he said i sorry but two necklaces who could conceive such thing rest assured however that this is not the end she strode away without another word brodie came back into the room he fingered the brim of his hat thoughtfully say are you in the habit of carrying valuable necklaces about with you in your overcoat pocket grimm he asked harvey grimm took up his stand very deliberately on the hearthrug i am he announced i also occasionally wear coronet instead of hat and suit of armour instead of pyjamas i these things because i choose and because it damned well one else business except my own so you going to take that tone are you brodie observed thoughtfully between ourselves i think it time i did was the prompt reply the soone r you make up your mind that i am harmless individual the better i told you openly within hours of making your acqua intance upon the steamer that i was an expert in precious stones that is how i make my living and it is perhaps reputable way yours the necklace which you have had the impertinence to accuse of stealing is entrusted to sale and if at any time there was any real reason to disclose the name of the owner i would so at present however i consider that i have humoured you far enough you will oblige by leaving my rooms at once and taking inspector ditchwater with you so that the line eh that is the line harvey grimm assented and what are you going to about it personally inspector ditchwater decid ed turning towards the door i am going to wish you and offer you my apologies grimm we seem to be always in the wrong when we act upon brodie information and the report i going to make to will perhaps save you any further trouble brodie face was imperturbable he accepted the situation however and followed ditchwater from the room the two men left behind listened to their retreating footsteps harvey grimm threw himself into an easy chair so that that he observed an exciting quarter of an hour eh aaron i am bewildered aaron rodd admitted i understand even now was it madame borria necklace then that one was you mean to say that you got two necklaces feel in the other pocket harvey grimm directed him aaron obeyed from the pocket of the overcoat which was hanging over the chair he drew out second and more beautiful necklace he held it before him the cross flashed out from the rose diamond in the centre good god he exclaimed y mean to say that it was here all the time the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https of course it was i told you that i was in tight corner he never gave chance to hide it i knew these rooms would be searched fortunately he chose the nd pocket of my overcoat instead of the right what are you going to with it aaron asked breathlessly harvey grimm glanced at the clock it was quarter to one you shall see he replied just open the door will you i think i heard some one ring put the necklace away that drawer will aaron did he was told short dark man dressed with extreme care pushe d past him into the room it was the husband of madame borria i have come he announced how is the good grimm and what is the news this morning the news is harvey grimm told him that the detective your wife employed has been up here searching the necklace marvellous the little man declared rolling himself cigarette nervously how sagacious what foresight but to results eh harvey grimm with little sigh of relief thrust his hand into the drawer produced the necklace and handed it to the south american borria face glowed with satisfaction i have had leetle trouble with madam he announced but it is past she agreed at last eagerly to the advertisement you have seen it harvey grimm nodded two thousand pounds reward and questions asked he murmured borria drew from his pocket battered and soiled cardboard box into which he proceeded to stow the necklace i make package here you see he pointed out i have received an anonymous note which makes demand upon my honour that if i accede to its terms i destroy it it is destroyed the harvey grimm began borria tapped his forehead in the my brain he exclaimed what does it matter it is destroyed i go to the place named i produce the two thousand the necklace is mine he laid upon the table and drew out sheaf of notes which he carefully counted into two heaps one he pushed towards harvey grimm the other he replaced in his pocket then he smiled he had the engaging smile of child so he pronounced we are all happy and contented madame my wife will wear her necklace and once more rejoice i shall have that thousand pounds in my pocket which is so necessary man like myself in this your great city of gallantry and happiness and you my dear harvey grimm who played the burglar and assisted in my little scheme you too have thousand pounds so now that all is well shall we visit the little lady down in the american bar afterwards i will take taxi just the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https infidelity of jack lovejoynowhere and i will come back in another taxi from nowhere i shall break into my wife rooms and she will hold out her arms to and she will have her necklace and i have got my thousand pounds enfin let us descend harvey grimm took up his hat and aaron rodd followed suit it seems to aaron remarked he brought up the rear of the little procession that the only man who gets nothing out of this is mr brodie chapter vii cresswell and aaron rodd were dinin g with captain brinnen and his sister at corner table in the milan restaurant harvey grimm had once more left them an unknown destination and they were all aware that the period of his absence would be this time more than ever one of strain though by general consent however the conversation did not touch once upon personal matters they spoke good deal of the war brinnen himself was roused by sundry reflections into momentary bitterness an expression of that peculiar irritation common to many of his notwithstanding their underlying gratitude you people in england he declared you have perceptions brains with which to combat system of espionage nothing but an infinite complacency an infinite stupidity the people who hate you walk in your midst unharmed even if they are pointed out your officials shrug their shoulders and smile in superior fashion can us harm they assure you are reasons why we prefer to leave them alone and you are at war you people ah if only you would realise it you are quite right aaron rodd admitted we have grown too accustomed to look upon espionage and secret service the bonne bouche of the novelist i suppose they exist they not only exist brinnen continued but they are becoming very important factor in the progress of the war look at this room did you ever see more cosmopolitan gathering there are belgians russians americans the two young men who have just come in are roumanians over here one knows why this however i could tell you if england takes heed of their presence germany does they will be watched by germany until they leave and all your army of censors germany will know day by day just what they and even nearer to us i could give your secret service very useful piece of advice concerning the young man at the third table from here with the lady in white spangles aaron rodd and the poet both glanced cautiously in the direction indicated tall young man dark with big black eyes mass of black hair and rather puffy cheeks in stagy sort of way was entertaining an artistically decorated young ornament of the musical comedy stage you know him perhaps brinnen enquired both men shook their heads he is always about here cresswell remarked generally in the bar he is an american actor brinnen continued his name on the programmes is jack lovejoy his real name is karl festonheim and he was born in cologne his father the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https grandfather his mother and his grandmother were germans he married german negligible affair perhaps the matrimonial arrangements of those sort of people are inclined to be but still it shows his tendencies the man like many thousands of others calls himself an american because he went there boy and has lived there ever since yet every relative he has lives in germany every spark of real feeling such person may happen to possess is german he eats like german he lives like german he even talks like one yet that young man has difficulty about passports he can live in london listen to the secret voices of your nation and make his way unhindered and unharmed over to germany whenever he chooses there are of course many technical difficulties aaron rodd pointed out in dealing with naturalised americans whatever the country of their birth you are very punctilious over here captain brinnen observed with fine sarcasm however i give that young man an instance because i know that certain information concerning the whereabouts of three of your cruisers earlier in the war was conveyed by him to the german admiralty i can not prove this but i know it i also know that while if you speak to him he will tell you that he is out of job that the war has played the deuce with musical comedy he has refused three parts within the last month on some pretext or another because he is better occupied stephen cresswell sat up in his place an expectant light shone in his eyes an adventure he murmured if you sir brinnen remarked could develop the sagacity of french or german secret service man and fasten upon the life of that young man you would probably gain the adventure which you seek i am the very man the task the poet declared eagerly i have stuck like leech to my friend aaron rodd here in the hopes of travelling with him little way into the land where adventures are plentiful gooseberries the only one to which he has introduced has been highly satisfacto ry in its way he declared bowing to henriette and the remembrance of it will be happiness to all my life but one can not live on one adventure alone i am eager more i claim that young man rodd you hear i claim him he is yours the other acquiesced grimly poor fellow one is almost inclined to pity him cresswell smiled in superior fashion my dear fellow he said you are without doubt man of energy and brain s but what you lack is initiative initiative is the gift vouchsafed to genius i have genius therefore i have initiative to you the affair connected with this young man appears at present to be impenetrable blank wall you would not know where to start wait you shall watch my methods in the meantime henriette whispered gazing intently towards the doorway behold madame borria and her recovered necklace they all turned their heads the south american woman was on her way through the room and around her neck flashed the light from her wonderful necklace aaron rodd leaned little forward in his chair she is soon wearing it again he remarked brinnen shrugged his the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https why not it was lost only few hours madame had the good sense to follow her husband advice and to offer that greatest of lures to the educated reward and questions asked madame deserves to have recovered her it becomes her well shall we take our cof fee outside they all rose to their feet and left the restaurant together the poet thrust his arm through brinnen and led him on one side talking earnestly aaron was left alone few minutes with henriette they found corner far possible from the strains of the band it is three months he reminded her since i saw you first in the gardens of the embankment what memory she murmured and i like the very forward person you have since discovered to be made tentative overtures to you with the object of discovering whether you were lawyer not too squeamish about your clients or their business his face hardened little are we coming soon he asked to the end of your rather your brother stock of jewels why she whispered looking up at him with slightly contracted eyebrows because i am tired of it he declared frankly tired of it in connection with you that is to say i spend whole days sometime s in positive state of terror luxury is small thing compared with freedom and life you have had over forty thousand pounds now why you take your grandfather somewhere away into the country even if you have to be content with half that sum you could live on it and be safe let your brother go his own way it is really worth while henriette she looked at the point of her slipper carefully moment she wore perfectly plain black velvet gown and only single pearl hanging from strip of black velvet around her neck her fingers were ringless even her hair was arranged in the simplest of coils yet there was one else in the room quite like her henriette he went on leaning over her if you speak i shall make fool of myself she started and looked timorously into his eyes then quickly she looked away again her hands clasped the arms of her chair she seemed suddenly interested in the orchestra you were going to say she begged you know he obeyed almost rough ly i am nearly forty years old i have money except the ten or fifteen thousand pounds i have made by helping to dispose of your stolen jewels and i sick of it all sick of it because i found something in life worth living differently you know what that is leave your brother to live his own life bring your grandfather and come away somewhere henriette and marry it sounds absurd does it he went on little wistfully but in way you been so kind to you must have known she suddenly laid her hand upon his it was delightful little gesture please say any more just now she implored i shall remember every word that you have said and i think i have ever felt so much like what the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https doing what you ask she continued quickly there just little we must think of other things you see here comes my brother and cresswell whatever is mr cresswell going to look the american actor and his companio n had taken seats almost opposite to them suddenly cresswell left his host side and crossed the room towards them with slight bow he addressed lovejoy brinnen who had strolled over to where his sister and aaron rodd were seated smiled little cynically what you call in your expressive language rather the methods of bull in china shop he observed i fancy that we shall see our friend return little chastened you know stephen his friend murmured he has more confidence than any other man on earth look waiter had been summoned to bring chair the poet was seated now next the young lady to whom he had just been introduced they were all three chatting amiably waiter was receiving an order cof fee and liqueurs that is what he calls initiative henriette whispered the first steps are easy brinnen remarked and after all one must remember that lovejoy is by means clever person he is conceited and bumptious well at any rate we must wish mr cresswell luck i was just asking your sister aaron said abruptly whether we were almost coming to the end of your hidden stores the young belgian glanced around moment quickly and flicked the ash from his cigarette why because i am beginning to fear the risk more every day your sister sake aaron continued steadily our friend brod ie has made good many mistakes but he is not an entire fool grimm admitted only the other day that he had tracked him down to the very place where he recuts the been within few feet of them nothing came of it though brinnen observed frowning it may not be so every time aaron rodd persisted i was trying to persuade your sister to be content with small things your grandfather is very old think what the shock would be to him if anything were to happen to either of you put what you have left in safe deposit if you like time and start again disposing of them when things have blown over little the brother and sister exchanged glances which to aaron were inexplicable what does mr harvey grimm say about it the former asked oh grimm will go on till he drops aaron rodd declared adventure danger whatever the cost is the spice of life to him but he is just man alone it different thing when girl like your sister is concerned it is her sake that i want to see the thing closed up brinnen dropped his eyeglass and rubbed it moment with his handkerchief you seem to take great interest in my sister rodd he said calmly i have just asked her to marry aaron rodd replied bluntly the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https turned slowly around he was suddenly like his grandfather his eyebrows were little uplifted his expression was the expression of one who listens to some unthinkable thing absurd he muttered it is nothing of the sort aaron rodd answered simply if your sister has been guiltily concerned in your adventurous life i too have turned myself into receiver of stolen property we are in the same boat only i want to get her out of it i have asked her to marry and come over to america we could start life again on what i have she leaned over suddenly and spoke to her brother in low tone and in language which was strange to aaron rodd his expression changed little he listened then the waiter appeared with their coffee and liqueurs when they were served and he had left captain brinnen reopened the subject i gather that you yourself rodd he observed have hankerings towards the humdrum life the life of honesty and the virtues and that sort of thing i have tried many years to make an honest living aaron replied shortly the only time i ever crossed the line was long ago when harvey grimm and i were in america it was anything very serious then our present transactions have been my only other essay i come of an ned new england family and however one may laugh at their principles and the narrowness of their outlook i have those principles in my blood and frankly i hate this life if it bad it worse your sister i want to take her away i will consider what you have said rodd brinnen replied the prese nt we will if you please abandon the conversation little glance of entreaty from henriette closed aaron lips they spoke of general things few moments then captain brinnen rose to his feet i am afraid that i must take my sister away now rodd he announced she has an engagement this evening but before we leave he added holding out his hand whatever i may feel concerning the proposals you have made i should like once more to express my thanks your great courage the other night my sister and i owe you more than we can ever repay your sister aaron said with boldness which surprised him can repay if she will she looked into his eyes and they seemed to him larger and softer than he had ever seen them there was little quiver at her lips too even though her words were light ones you are growing into courtier rodd she murmured au revoir they passed up the stairs and aaron sank back in his chair there was certain satisfaction mingled even with his disap pointment at least he had spoken his mind then the little group on the other side of the way arose and the poet catching his eye beckoned to him in friendly fashion this the poet declared aaron approached is my friend aaron rodd aaron allow to present you to lady whom you have often worshipped from distance miss pamela keane aaron who had idea who miss pamela keane was bent over her hand and cursed the poet under his breath the latter who was thoroughly enjoying himself laid his the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https lovejoy shoulder and also to my friend jack lovejoy he continued lovejoy is the one man in london who makes wish that i could write the musical comedy stage one has one limitations alas there followed few minutes desultory conversation then miss pamela keane picked up wonderful collection of golden trifles and turned towards the exit we shall meet again cresswell she said smiling upon him bring rodd with you if he cares to come au revoir she turned away followed by lovejoy the poet linked his arm through aaron and demanded another liqueur you did really know the fellow did you aaron asked curiously not i he replied but i have told you many times i am born adventurer i am equal to any situation have i ever mentioned that i am also something of snob i seem to remember the confession well i am i have an aunt who is the wife of baronet i make use of her occasionally in the days of my more abject poverty i used to go there free meal when i had black coat she is by way of being patroness of the arts entertains all sorts of jumbled up parties in all probability lovejoy has either been asked to one of them or wishes he had hence my lovejoy i say in my best manner i believe i had the pleasure of meeting you at my aunt lady sittingley he hesitates and i can see that i have him fixed he has the least intention of ever denying that he was there although he does know from adam and there you are you know it the natural spirit of the adventurer what was that about going on there aaron enquired we are both going my boy was the cheerful reply miss pamela keane is entertaining few friends to chemin fer at her flat in buckingham gate i have explained that i not play but we are going to look in glass of wine and chat matter of fact i just want to cast my eye over lovejoy friends you see there need to come aaron rodd protested there is every need the poet insisted watching the arrival of the liqueurs with satisfaction i like companionship i like some one with whom to compare impressions after such visit this you may notice something which has escaped aaron frowned little wearily captain brinnen was probably talking quite at random he remarked lovejoy does seem to to be the type of man who take serious interest in anything except his own pleasures quite right the other agreed shrewdly but he might reasonably take an interest in the means of procuring those pleasures and to our friend talking at random i believe it man with face and character like his does chatter we just spruce up here bit and follow them right along the two men spent the next two hours in entirely different fashion stephen cresswell made host of new friends with marvellous facility flirted with many pretty the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https ladies ate pâté foie gras sandwiches and drank champagne though it were his first meal of the day aaron on the other hand found the customary stiffness of his manner only intensified by the bohemianism of his the women with their laughing eyes their frankly flirtatious speeches their general air of and lack of reserve seemed to him simply intolerable every time he thought of henriette he hated his surroundings and longed the solitude which notwithstanding his efforts he was only partially able to achieve to escape the new acquaintances whom the poet was continually bringing up to him he even played an hour afterwards when the rooms became more crowded he escaped into corner and sat looking on it was exactly the sort of gathering he had good many young ladies from the stage with their escorts strong element of the betting fraternity theatrical agent or two and sprinkling of those nameless people always well dressed always mysterious who seem to pass through life so easily without toiling or spinning he was just deciding that so far the object of their visit was concern ed the evening had been wasted when pamela keane came suddenly across the room and sat down by his side i want to talk to you rodd she said throwing herself back in chair and displaying an amazing amount of white silk stocking you are very kind he murmured cresswell tells that you are lawyer that is so aaron admitted little startled where are your of fices seventeen manchester street adelphi he replied third floor can i come and see you at eleven morning with pleasure good i be there not word to jack mind come and have glass of champagne he drank his glass of champagne and watched his companion drink three then she floated off to greet some and aaron made his escape the poet called him up in the hall the usual sort of crowd here he remarked they left the house pretty hot lot some of those bookmakers and jockeys but i did see soul whom i ever suspect of getting of f his own little run what about you come and see at twelve morning was all the poet could get out of his companion that night miss pamela keane was marvellously punctual in blue serge costume straight from paris hat which was marvel of simplicity wonderful veil and wave of perfume she swept into aaron rodd room the next morning eleven was striking he handed her the clients chair into which she sank little breathless say this is some climb she remarked you have any elevators in your offices on this side plenty he assured her i have very small practice and these are way premises the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https lifted her veil her face was thick with powder and her eyes seemed to him artificially brightened there was some stuff which he did understand upon her lashes and in contradistinction to these to him somewhat ghastly allurements her expression was hard her tone she spoke almost rasping see here rodd she began i have come to talk to you about jack lovejoy know anything about nothing he confessed i suppose you ever seen on the stage even never so much the better i did want to go to one of these everything theatrical lawyers who call you dear and promise you the earth well i married millionaire over in the states and i fixed things so that he could get rid of without it costing him something i got an income of five thousand poun ds year rodd and though that ai the earth it useful naturally he assented i done more than i should like to tell you jack lovejoy she went on of course we live together and we much married the law allows he got nothing but what he was earning and that was much when i took him up now he got his motor and anything he wants i not changeable woman i older than he is of course but i barely forty and all i wanted of jack was that he should play the game he not doing it mr rodd the lawyer shrugged his shoulders ever so slightly the question of lovejoy infidelities appeared to him profoundly uninteresting i tell you how i know she went on we had little trouble month ago and i waited him to come to his cheque since instead of handing it over he has been and he had all the money he wanted he getting it from somewhere what i want to know is where aaron was little more interested betting card playing he suggested she waved her hand scornfully i know the firm with whom he does his betting and he owes them tidy sum already and to card playing why any of would clean him out in time he has the brains of rabbit it woman he goes to see her every day at six i found that out myself and i found out the direction he goes in the rest i have come to you to aaron exclaimed little startled yes it part of your job ai it supposing it was divorce i wanted i should have to go to lawyer should i i not imagining you hang about street corners yourself but you got to employ some one to have him watched and you got to begin this afternoon i can give you start all right from luncheon time he bring anywhere i at two we shall leave there perhaps at three and he drive home from that point he have to be watched he may come in an hour or he may not but it wher he goes to afterwards that i want to know will you take this job on mr rodd the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https with pleasure he agreed it little out of my line but i think i can arrange it then that that the lady remarked rising i got to be at my dressmak er at ring up when you anything to report aaron rodd bowed his client down the stairs went back to his office and threw the windows wide open then he telephoned the poet i am going to disgraceful thing he told him upon his arrival i going to betray client confidence would it well out easier with the help of matutinal the poet suggested with glance at the clock my throat dry this morning aaron shook his head and told the story now get at it he enjoined he bundled him out it your job not mine and i have letter to write the poet few days later paid an afternoon call he rang the bell of flat in northumberland court enquired abrahams and after moment hesit ation was shown into small in which half dozen people were seated the lady who was evidently hostess large woman rose from her place on the couch and regarded him with mingled distrust and curiosity the poet however who had seen jack lovejoy in corner of the room was not in the least abashed you have forgotten i hope mrs abrahams he said bending gallantly over her hesitating hand i met you at my aunt lady sittingley and you were kind enough to say that i might come and see you sometime i ventured to bring you the small offering i promised poems bound now i am thankful to say with little more dignity than when we last met abrahams face cleared slightly but she remained somewhat disturbed of course you are cresswell are you the poet i remember the curious stories there were about the beginning of your popularity you have really brought that book how charming of you i have promised myself this pleasure long time cresswell assured her let see she went on making room him by her side when was it that i met you at your aunt i have memory even such inspiring events he confessed ingenuously but i think it was about three months ago she sighed gently this terrible war she murmured makes it difficult to remember anything you will have some tea mr cresswell let introduce you to professor david the poet bowed to his neighbour and glanced around the little circle winding up with nod to lovejoy who seemed hopelessly out of place they were the most part very gloomy and serious little company i interrupted an interesting conversation i am sure the poet declared genially may it not continue the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https was moment rather awkward silence and abrahams sighed alas she said i am afraid there was nothing original about our conversation this afternoon it was the the war cresswell balanced his plate upon his knee sipped his tea and talked commonplace nonsense quarter of an hour then he got up to leave coming my way lovejoy he enquired the young actor hesitated moment and then acquiesced abrahams bade them both farewell she extended to neither of them any invitation to return rather heavy sort of crowd you is it cresswell asked they descen ded in the lift abrahams was kind to when i first came to london lovejoy remarked little vaguely i promised i look in there some day and i happened to be near this afternoon just so the poet murmured they paused at the corner of the street so long jack lovejoy stepped into taxi and was driven away westwards cresswell crossed the road turned into whitehall made his way into block of public buildings and after half an hour delay was shown into the presence of an gentleman who bade him take seat and peered at him doubtfully over the top of his eyeglasses sir lionel his visitor began i have come to you because i have some information which should be exceedingly valuable to the home branch of the secret service young man the official replied you are the fifteenth caller within the last few hours who has brought information guaranteed to save the empire lucky number the fifteenth the poet remarked cheerfully you happen to know abrahams of northumberland court i know her slightly sir lionel admitted she is friend of several members of the cabinet why is she interned cresswell demanded she is german her husband was born in england but she is german all the same the young man persisted i have been making enquiries about her myself and i find that years before the war she was doing nothing but run down the culture and customs of this country compared with germany the of ficial shrugged his shoulders there is information that i am aware of against abrahams he said and you must remember that she is i told you friend of several members of the cabinet they would not be likely to listen to anything against her what country the poet sighed what officialdom what methods of making war have you anything against mrs abrahams sir lionel the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https i have was the prompt reply i have proof to offer because i am an unofficial person and i can not take those steps which are necessary to procure proof but i can assure you that every afternoon from four till six abraham in the northumberland court is bureau the meeting of various persons whose interests are inimical to this country dear the other exclaimed blandly what they there i ca tell that cresswell admitted my idea is that they each bring information of various sorts which abrahams transmits to germany is that rather an assumption on your part an assumption with very definite background the poet persisted unruf fled instance take this afternoon amongst abraham visitors were profess or david who has spent half his life in germany has stumped this country lecturing on german ideals and since the war has maintained sedulous and enigmatic silence there were also present halston who married german and has had to resign his seat in parliament owing to his doubtful sympathies jack lovejoy the actor two men who from their conversation are i gathered censors and the minister of country whom we all know quite well to be inimical to us these men meet every afternoon they are there fun are they and it is by chance that they all have the same point of view sir lionel stifled what seemed suspiciously like yawn you must forgive if i seem little unmoved he observed but we hear so many of these vague stories the matter shall be looked into cresswell but i may well warn you at once that abrahams has several friends in the cabinet and they are not likely to countenance any proceedings unfavourable to her the poet rose from his chair thank you sir lionel he said humbly i begin to what that friend of cabinet minister in this government can wrong the young man declared picking up his hat aaron rodd and the poet lunched together the next day at the milan miss pamela keane saw them from the other end of the room where she was talking to the maîtr about table and at once came over towards them well she asked aaron rodd i have some information already the latter replied i am not in position to make definite report but if it interests you to know it i not think that lovejoy afternoon philanderings are of an amorous nature say you hear that she exclaimed her face suddenly lightening if it interests to know it is that exactly what i came to you well ca you give an idea what he is up to then not at present aaron rodd regretted but you might if you would help with another hint get on with it then the lady ur ged he may come in at any moment the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https can you tell in which direction his sympathies lie with regard to the war miss pamela keane was moment serious then she shrugged her shoulders well you know she said there are good many of us americans who think that great britain been asking trouble some years back little too much of the lord almighty you know i should say that jack was overmuch in sympathy with you britishers that helps aaron rodd admitted in two or three days at the most i think i can let you have report so far i can see at present he added i think that it will be satisfactory to you say you smarter than you look rodd she declared she turned away with little nod come round and see any time the two men finished their luncheon and walked round to scotland yard inspector ditchwater whom they enquired received them with some surprise gentlemen he said this is most unexpected pleasure we have come aaron rodd began to lay certain information before you which has come to professionally and to ask your aid the facts are these certain abrahams who is german woman by birth married to an anglicised german jew who was naturalised fifteen years ago is in the habit of receiving little circle of friends every afternoon these friends are every one of them of more or less german sympathies although they some of them occupy public posts in this country one of them i have reason to know is receiving money continually from abrahams i have proof of anything and i am not in position to proceed far enough in the matter to secure it the authority of the law is needed my friend here cresswell has been to the home office and has interviewed sir lionel rastall he however declines to intervene in the matter because abrahams who is woman of great deal of superficial culture and many acquaintances is friend of several cabinet ministers if sir lionel declines to interfere the inspector pointed out what can we get on to the track and find some proof aaron rodd suggested there is any one can stop you then from behaving in commonsense manner and lose our promotion and get snubbed our pains the detective remarked i care much about the job rodd thanking you all the same i mind telling you that abrahams was on the list of suspected persons kept here and has been crossed off at the special instructions of personage it is my business to interfere with her or her doings the two visitors withdrew little perplexed the poet however was undaunted my friend he said this was to be my adventure and i tell you i trump card left yet come along they paid one more call at large and imposing establishment great distance away after wait of nearly an hour an orderly came in the chief will see you and your friend cresswell he announced be quick you can please the poet who loved words showed that he knew how to dispense with them he shook hands with the somewhat handsome soldier who welcomed the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https this is my friend rodd solicitor he said sir horace i have put my hand by accident upon nest of conspiracy within quarter of mile from here the home office or the police wo touch it because the woman chiefly concerned is persona grata with cabinet ministers will you take it on i will sir horace promised if there anything in it get on with your information the woman name is abrahams and she has flat in the northumberland court the poet continued i followed young man there the other afternoon who is born german but calls himself an american abrahams was entertaining smal l party of friends every one of whom is of german sympathies although two are employed censors by his majesty government the young man i followed is drawing money from her nearly every week and spends most of his spare time motoring round london with one of the new naval air defence commanders that all pretty well the poet admitted but there espionage work going on there every afternoon sounds probable the other agreed now what you want to i ca raid the place without more information lend two men and i take the risk of something turning up the poet begged sir horace scribbled few lines on piece of paper get out with you he said my regards to your aunt show this to the orderly in room c and he give you couple of plainclothes policemen the poet gripped aaron rodd arm triumphantly they stepped outside man he exclaimed man at last it was two days before anything fresh happened then about five in the afternoon aaron rodd and the poet who had wandered round by the front of the northumberland court to see that their watchers were in position almost ran into the arms of huge roughly dressed man with brown beard man who looked in his clothes and walked with rolling gait my god the poet muttered it the dutchman come on aaron they turned round and followed him at short distance he entered the northumberland court they followed him few minutes later and cresswell addressed the whom he knew slightly my name cresswell he said i on government job tell what flat that man asked who has just gone in number sir the man mrs abrahams seen him here before he comes about once week sir generally on sunday i sha move from here cresswell declared turning to his companion i shall hold on to that chap myself if he comes out before we can get the men together will you hurry aaron there one at the corner of parliament street the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https and the other here quiet voice said behind it all right cresswell i sent jimmy i saw that man go in know who he is i that the poet assented his ship been searched twice the inspector went on we had secret service man on board the last time they crossed nothing was discovered but he under suspicion when i saw him turn in here i thought things might be coming our way inspector cresswell asked eagerly your powers will allow you to hold him wo they i think i have to stretch them bit sir the man replied we wait till he comes out you better let the get an extra constable this dutchman is pretty difficult customer to tackle the who had been divided between curiosity and nervousness departed with alacrity the men spread themselve s out little the poet and aaron rodd affected great interest in the lighting of cigarettes small boy in buttons eyed them with immense inquisitiveness there was something up he whispered the news to the who had strolled out breath of fresh air ripple of electrical interest thrilled the group the returned an unwilling constable in the rear what this he enquired of the elder of the two men i ca leave my beat unless there char ge the man showed him badge the constable saluted wait just outside the former whisper ed the suddenly thrust his head through the swing doors party you enquiring sir has just come out of number two he announced he stepping into taxi there was rush the door which the poet led the taxicab was disappearing round the corner they reached the entrance of the next block of flats the still dangling his whistle watched their approach with amazement what taxi the inspector asked quickly monico shaftesbury avenue another taxi quick the man blew his whistle taxicab from the rank obeyed the summons the fellow ca suspect anything if he really gone to the monico the inspector observed they all crowded into the vehicle in few minutes they were at the café the poet gave little sigh of relief he peered eagerly around somehow or other he felt that this was his own special adventure and that the onus of its success rested upon him at table little way in the room the dutchman was seated with huge tumbler of what seemed to be brandy and water in front of him he was in the act of striking match to light cigar which was already in the corner of his mouth suddenly his eyes fell upon the poet vague sense of recognition coupled with premonition of danger seemed to oppress him his frame seemed to grow tenser even underneath his clothes one could fancy that his muscles were stiffening he watched the four men approach and those few of the neighbouring loungers who chanced to be looking that way held their breaths the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https around seemed to have become electric the inspector stood by the dutchman table although he was not in uniform his of ficial bearing was unmistakable i want you my man he said y must come with to the why i am acting under special orders the inspector told him i can satisfy you to my authority the thing is are you coming quietly apparently the dutchman was not pandemonium ensued the inspector was and he was on guard but his adversary rush was irresistible he went crashing over against an opposite table and the dutchman left fist sent the second man prostrate the inspector however was not yet done and aaron rodd and cresswell suddenly sprang simultaneously into the fray men and women leapt from their tables there were shrieks crash of breaking glass the policeman who had been knocked down staggered to his knees and blew his whistle furiously the dutchman kicking shaking even trying to bite the poet fingers which had somehow seized his throat dragged his assailants yard by yard towards the door the whole place was in an uproar suddenly the were pushed open two uniformed constables hurried in even then the dutchman did not abandon the struggle he wrenched himself almost free from the three men who had momentarily relaxed their hold dealt the leading constable terrific blow which only just missed the side of his head and knocked his helmet into pulp that however was the end the other constable was powerful fellow and within thirty seconds the dutchman was handcuf fed there was crowd now upon the pavement the dutchman his face covered with blood and his eyes glaring like the eyes of wild animal was bustled into taxi aaron and the poet were left behind they were neither of them much the worse the struggle but aaron collar was torn to pieces and the poet coat had been ripped down one side waiter was hovering around them admiringly bring you something to drink gentlemen he suggested they drank brandy and soda each then the poet rose he was conscious of various bruises but he was very happy home and seclusion i think time my friend he said what heavenly scrap late that evening very immaculat ely dressed young man of most superior appearance discovered the poet in an easy chair in his club awaiting the midnig ht rush of journalists and actors the young man presented card you will find my name there sir he said and also the service on behalf of which i pay you this visit cresswell scrutinised the card and sat up in his chair have drink he suggested his visitor begged to be excused the chief asked to find you at the earliest possible moment he announced to first of all express his thanks and the thanks of his department your valuable services had the dutchman got the goods on him the poet asked eagerly the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https yellow eye he had indeed he was carrying documents of high importance which were obviously destined our enemies the young man said their contents are to certain extent secret and i am to ask you to add to your services by allowing the matter to slip from your memory what going to become of mrs abrahams cresswell enquired we received an indirect suggestion from the home office the young man replied that the lady in question should be cautioned if it is any relief to you let assure you that my chief is not the sort of man to listen to such tosh the lady will be interned whatever her friends may attempt on her behalf two of the other people implicated both in the censor office i regret to say will be shot you appear to have discovered bureau which existed the purpose of collecting and dispatching abroad every week various items of information likely to be of service to our enemies what the dutchman get the young man hesitated i have already somewhat exceeded my latitude he said gravely may i ask you to consider what i have said in confidence to forget this little adventure and never again in this life to worry about the dutchman i wo the poet promised with chuckle by the by what about jack lovejoy there is reference only to some promised information from person whom we concluded to be that young man was the reply he has been asked to leave the country within hours the young man took his leave and few moments later aaron rodd appeare he was wearing pearl pin of wonderful quality which the poet eyed curiously little farewell present the former explained he settled down from miss pamela keane chapter viii at few minutes before the popular dining hour aaron rodd having selected table ordered in consultation with the chief maîtr small dinner and possessed himself of theatre guide sat in the reception lounge of the carlton awaiting the arrival of henriette there was mirror exactly opposite to him and he sipped his cocktail he caught glimpse of his own face he set down his glass momentarily startled somehow it seemed to him like being brought face to face with the ghost of his youth he rose to his feet and loung ed over towards the mirror on the pretext of examining some illustrated papers in the intervals of glancing at them he looked furtively at his own reflection trying to account the change he saw there at the poet earnest solicitation he had visited tailor had bought the right shape of collar had learnt to tie his evening bow with the proper twist personally conducted visit to fashionable hairdresser had followed and his fine black hair longer ragged and unkempt was brushed back from face which seemed even to its owner to have changed in some marvellous way durin g the last few months he was without doubt younger there was new expression about his lips from which the hardness seemed to have gone and curiously enough he was conscious that notwithstanding all his anxieties never more poignant than at this particular moment life had taken sudden and sympathetic turn with him since the coming of harvey grimm he had at last the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https up from that weary rut of depression and but since the coming of henriette he had been transported bodily into the world where human beings live where the flowers have different perfume and the sun shines always even if sometimes from behind the clouds but you then also are vain rather surprised very amused voice exclaimed almost in his ears why you remind of cresswell standing there preening yourself before the mirror moment he felt almost embarrassed then he smiled he bent over henriette fingers i was wondering he confessed what could have brought so great change into my then you came her eyes softened she looked at him her lips parted she studied him moment apprisingly you are changed you know she decided you look younger you seem somehow to have moved from one world into another you were looking very melancholy that first day when we met in the gardens i not think that adventures have disag reed with you if one could only stop them now he exclaimed eagerly she laid her finger upon her lip the maîtr stood bowing before them madame will come this way henriette approved of the table approved of the dinner approved of her companion aaron rodd the shadows which sometimes terrified him seemed to have passed far away into the background he was deaf and dumb to the voices and glances of their neighbours attracted by his companion unanalysable elegance her aristocratic little face with its flawless complexion her little perhaps but all the more quaint individual distinction she wore ornaments except the pearls which hung from her neck her hair to his untutored eyes might have been arranged with her own fingers her gown alwa ys was black this time of chiffon and it was not him to know that its simplicity represented the last word in fashion he simply found her adorable and dinner was almost concluded before she uttered little cry why we have not yet decided what theatre to go to he sent messenger try she begged and get some seats the casino i want so much to see the revue the boy brought them plan of the theatre and aaron secured small box very reluctantly they left their table short time later i have loved my dinner so she declared they sat together in the taxi i think that i am getting greedy everything tasted so good and i think that i too am greedy her companion whispered leaning towards her because i want so the greatest thing in the world could have to of fer she suddenly clutched his arm with her white fingers drew it tightly to her hold my fingers please she begged sit just like this let us spoil anything will you be content please the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https leaned little towards her her eyes were half pleading with his half doubtful i will be content he promised if she drew away from him moment later i did not mean to let you kiss she declared naively i meant to if i could he confessed she laughed little hysterically but not unhappily let us pretend that we have behaved like couple of bad children she said because we must not just now talk of these things that was just slip slip he repeated very wonderful delightful slip she murmured and here we are they found themselves soon in little box small even two people henriette settled down almost from the first to enjoy the performance she laughed at the whimsical frenchman applauded the versatile leading lady entered with wonderful facility into the spirit of the place and then some after their entran ce aaron rodd felt the fingers which he was holding under cover of programme suddenly twitch he glanced up to his amazement all the joy and had passed from her face her features seemed though they might have been carved out of piece of ivory her lips were little parted her eyes filled with fear she was gazing with strange intensity upon the figure of girl who heralded by much applause had suddenly bounded on to the stage he leaned towards her is anything wrong henriette he asked softly she roused herself little yes she whispered that you see what she is her neck he glanced down on to the stage in puzzled fashion the girl in question frenc h and who was singing little song of the boulevards with good deal of appropriate action wore jewellery except single rather curious yello w stone suspended from her neck by platinum chain you mean that yellow thing she looked at him in surprise but of course you not know she exclaimed that is the great yellow diamond it belongs to whom he interrupted eagerly to my brother collection she explained hesitatingly he was puzzled moment then the sense of her words and their import began to dawn upon him you mean that the stone is amongst those that your brother has acquired he continued dif one of those he has not yet tried to have recut yes she the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https was moment embarrassed silence henriette was obviously distraught she watched the rather fascinating figure upon the stage with strained eyes it is she went on turning abruptly to her companion that i mind if leopold chooses to amuse himself he has probably lent the girl the diamond her first appearance i see that it is her debut it is not that but he is so rash so daring that stone is known throughout the history its description have been published everywhere why if there is anyone in the house who knows anything of the history of gems they will recognise it it will be easily traced to leopold oh what folly i must go and see her i must go at once she rose to her feet they drew little into the background of the box i am afraid it will be rather dif ficult aaron rodd warned her it must be arranged she insisted we will go together and find some one at the box office who will take message round they spent more or less uncomfortable ten minutes at the box office where they were assured that owing to the smallness of the theatre visits to the artistes were not permitted the manager at last appeared and began an explanation on similar lines henriette interrupted him monsieur she begged it is great exception there is something which mademoiselle should know something which it is very important her to know and i am the only person who can tell her you will make an exception please this once the manager was quite human and person of discrimination he made further difficulty if you will both please follow he invited mademoiselle larilly has just gone off he led them by tortuous way to the back of the stage and knocked at the door of room entrez was the shrill response their guide ushered henriette and aaron rodd into tiny little apartment prettily furnished notwithstanding the bare floors mademoiselle larilly was standing before admiring herself she swept round at their entrance madame she murmured in surprise the manager spoke hasty word or two of explanation in french and disappeared henriette waited until the door was closed then she turned to the girl mademoiselle she said i owe you perhaps an apology this unusual visit i come your sake well my own and another will you tell please who lent you the diamond which you wear the girl held it tightly to her bosom it has not been lent to she declared it is given but that is not possible henriette protested you know that the jewel you are wearing is worth nearly million francs the girl started but she simply shrugged her the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https oh la la she exclaimed what i care it was given by gentleman not an englishman and one has any right to ask questions about it i not receive here mademoiselle i have but few minutes to rest if you would please go henriette made efforts to modify the haughtiness of her tone the air of aloofness with which she seemed shrouded mademoiselle larilly she said i will not believe that you wish evil things to the gentleman who lent or gave you that jewel yet believe you will bring harm upon him if you wear it in public you will bring greatest of all misfortunes the girl opened her hands little and gazed at the gem she shook her head that i can not help she decided it is his affair he must know better than you i promised him to wear it he may even be here i shall keep my word henriette began then the words died away on her lips the door of the had opene d and closed without any knock paul brodie stood there suave and with little smile upon his lips he bowed gesture which seemed to include every one mademoiselle larilly glanced at him contemptuously but who allowed you to enter she demanded i not receive here i will send the manager it is an impertinence when people come to my room without permission brodie held out his hand deprecatingly miss larilly he begged pray not disturb yourself i am one of those who must go anywhere they choose at any time indeed she exclaimed indignantly you are not the owner of the theatre or the author of the revue and i not know you i beg you to leave at once young lady brodie continued his eyes fastened upon the gem which hung from her neck i have not the good fortune to be either of the gentlemen you mention but i represent force which has to be reckoned with by people i am of the police she stood quite still once more her hands clutched at the jewel which rested on her bosom the police she repeated but i not understand what the police want with in my room now come miss larilly brodie went on soothingly it nothing you need worry about i just want your permission to examine the jewel which you are wearing she refused sharply one shall that the jewel has been lent to lent to on one i permit one to touch it look here young lady brodie protest ed quietly but forcibly i want to make any disturbance and i sooner deal with this matter in friendly fashion all the same if you out trouble i can soon bring you plenty of it come it wo take you long to slip that of f your neck she began to look little frightened she glanced towards henriette though guidance henriette however seemed almost on the point of breaking down herself she had sunk into the chair which aaron had the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https courage aaron whispered in her ear that brute is watching you brodie had drawn closer to mademoiselle larilly she held her hands tightly against her bosom if you come step further she cried i will shriek i will call the artistes to defend manager you must come to when i am not playing if you would ask questions young lady the detective said with new sternness you can call the manager if you will and i shall repeat to him what i say to you if you not suffer to examine that jewel i shall stop the performance and have you taken to the she was obviously terrified now the rouge upon her cheeks seemed like great daub of red she set her teeth her hands flew apart it is miserable country she exclaimed passionately in france this could not happen look then at the stone and go but will give it up to one if you take it you must drag it from my neck and i will follow you shrieking even on to the stage i will not be robbed how i know that you are of the police you may be thief yourself the tell you that it is worth fortune i can well believe it brodie assented calmly one moment if you please he held the stone in the palm of his hand and fitted magnifying glass into his eye there was moment silence henr iette suddenly gripped her companion hand mademoiselle larilly stood there panting her bosom rising and falling quick ly there was murder in her eyes presently brodie let the stone fall replaced the magnify ing glass in his pocket he stood moment though thinking then he turned towards the door miss larilly he said looking back at her my apologies the bauble which you are wearing is worthless piece of yellow crystal worth perhaps twenty pounds i was was perhaps the young lady over yonder he added with little ironical by wonderful resemblance he closed the door quietly behind him there was queer silence in the room henriette was deathly pale relief and bewilderment were struggling in her face the french girl expression had become electrically transformed with sudden little gesture she leaned towards the closed door her hand flashed in front of her face her gesture was significant if vulgar it is worth twenty pounds my bauble is it she mocked and he thinks that big ugly man that i would come on to the stage with bauble round my neck worth twenty pounds eh but he is not gentleman of france an inner door suddenly opened leopold brinnen appeared and behind him the tall slender figure of monsieur larkson the leading french actor in the revue with your permission brinnen began bowing to mademoiselle larilly henriette he stopped short in amazement henriette rose to her feet and came towards him leopold she exclaimed talking to him rapidly in french what have you done how dare you all our sakes run these awful risks if the man brodie had not been fool if he had known anything of jewels if he had not been blind where should we have been at this moment you think they would have let mademoiselle go until she the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https from whence came the yellow eye oh but you are so reckless take it away from her quickly hide it leopold listened to her words little gravely will you tell my sister he enquired what you are doing here i have dined and am spending the evening with aaron rodd she explained we sit in the box here and i recognise the yellow eye i hurry here mademoiselle receives i beg her to take it off not to wear it i warn her that there is danger she scoffs at and then brodie comes but that must be mad he held the stone in his hand the young man smiled quietly then he listened at the door which led into the passage and softly turned the key he glanced towards mademoiselle ah but if you all will she exclaimed behold her hand disappeared moment down her back she threw the platinum chain and stone which she was wearing on to the in moment another flashed upon her bosom you see she went on how simple i obeyed on the stage i wore that great beautiful stone and even before i had reached my room in the passage the other hung in its place leopold brinnen smiled amiably nevertheless he was little apologetic he turned towards his sister it is that man brodie he sighed he is so persistent and yet he has not the wits success he wearies with his blunders this is just little lesson little lesson henriette repeated reproachfully with sob in her throat which might have cost he waved his hand ah little sister he protested you take too gloomy view even paul brodie he continued lowering his voice so that it was inaudible at the other end of the room has not yet succeeded in forging the missing link between jeremiah sands and captain brinnen of the belgian artillery you permit now madame he went on turning back to the others that i present to you my sister and monsieur aaron rodd mademoiselle larilly he explained is the wife of monsieur larkson here whom i take the liberty also to present what you say which stone shall mademoiselle wear when she sings her next song one may play with fire little too long aaron rodd observed leopold his sister implored clasping her hands the young man bowed it shall be you will he promised holding out his hand and accepting the stone which mademoiselle larilly was eagerly pressing upon him into my pocket with this one then madame shall dance the first time in her life with worthle ss bauble around her throat but there shall be recompense i insist we will all sup

aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https call boy came shouting down the passage giro at brinnen reminded them all it shall be au revoir then madame henriette said she passed through the door which aaron was holding open her there was great relief in henriette face she leaned back in the darkest corner of the box and closed her eyes the atmosphere of the evening however had depa rted she was longer full of that quivering electrical gaiety she watched the rest of the performance with interest and talked now and then to aaron but their homeward drive afterwards was performed almost in silence she rested her fingers in his and leaned back forgive if i rest she murmured i am terrified i shake now when i think of that moment it is all over now he reminded her try and be quiet little time presently she sat up listen she said it will be half an hour at least before they can arrive at giro madame must change her toilette madame last toilette had been one of pink silk in which there was very much more stocking than skirt the suggestion seemed probable what would you like to aaron asked i would like to call back at the milan she begged i nearly always see my grandfather moment before he goes to sleep and i can rest and bathe my eyes you will not mind waiting of course not he redirected the driver and they drew up few minutes later at the milan she descended at the court entrance and crossed over at once to the lift i will not ask you up she said i shall find you here perhaps y ten minutes he assented and bought an evening paper in less than the time she had stated the lift stopped and she reappeared to his surprise she had taken off her hat she came towards him with strange look in her face he could see the tears quivering in her eyes dear friend she whispered

died suddenly you must excuse my joining you luigi will serve the supper there was little murmur of sympathy his bohemian friends crowded silently around him one by one they shook his queer little function then he turned away and stood moment on the pavement outside aaron rodd by his side rodd he said my grandfather death may make dif ference in many ways aaron rodd straightened himself he was never sure of the demeanour of this young adventurer who seemed the most part to treat life jest in what way he asked brinnen replied with question can you communicate with mr harvey grimm aaron shook his head i not even know where he does his work forgive reminding you he added that your sister is in great distress the young man stepped into taxi it is necessary that i see harvey grimm soon possible he insisted harvey grimm wo be hurried over his work aaron declared your own sake he is better out of sight until it is concluded shall i tell the man to go to the milan brinnen nodded he leaned out of the window moment however before the cab started aaron rodd he said you mind if i speak to you moment with perfect frankness not in the least aaron assured him promptly in some respects

cousin through the shop rosa i got something to thay to you motht important he announced come right over here she paused and swung around little unwillingly her scarlet underlip was thrust outwards she walked with her hand upon her hip not averse to impressing even this young cousin of hers with all the allurements of her slipshod finery i thay rosa you look fine the boy declared admiringly lithen now you told to keep my eyes open if ever i should see any more of mr levy eh the girl face was suddenly alight she moved close to the counter you heard of him she exclaimed eagerly you know

him yourthelf it worth shilling rosa eh the girl hand dived into the recesses of her skirt she produced cheap purse of imitation russia leather and solemnly counted out sixpence and six coppers you

you little shark his cousin cried indignantly why i should have found out myself if i gone straight in to grandfather maybe and maybe not he answered with his finger upon his nose and his hand guarding the pocket where the shilling reposed the girl was breathing quickly with excitement the loss of the shilling after all was slight thing to girl earning man wages listen she enjoined you say i been i off back to tidy up i shall be here in half an hour he wo be gone by then sure not was the confident assent he brought his valise come to stop rosa almost tiptoed her way out of the shop

must have cost something the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https nodded vision of cheap furs with black hat from which flared one great scarlet flower she carried bag of some jingling metal in her hand her patent shoes squeaked loudly she displayed at least twelve inches of limbs and she diffused little waves of perfume carefully selected on account of its qualities the customer who knew her by sight gazed after her admiringly that your cousin rosa is it she asked the small boy nodded withdrawing his eyes from the disappearing figure with reluctance it must be wonderful to earn enough money to dress like that he observed enviously my did you see those furs the firtht ornament rosa ever bought from wath one of these brooches he went on reverting to the subject in hand two shillings she paid my dear and eighteenpence i asking you jutht because i like to business when the old man ai here maybe you could pay the extra sixpence next saturday rosa swept through the door and descended the two steps into the dingy in chair drawn up to the scanty fire his head little on one side sat her grandfather asleep she passed on tiptoe through the room down the narrow passage and softly turned the handle of the work shop door the air was vibrating slightly with the monotonous hum of concealed dynamo bending low over the board with huge magnifying glasses in his eyes levy with small bright instrument in his hand was absorbed in some delicate process of refashioning little glittering mass carefully held between the thumb and forefinger of his left hand some instinct told the girl to keep silence she watched him breathlessly until the consciousness of her presence reached him through his finer senses he raised his knife from its task and turned swiftly around touched knob with his foot and the dynamo gradually slackened speed and died away you he exclaimed removing the glasses from his eyes she saw the stone upon which he had been working transferred swiftly to his pocket she was immensely curious nevertheless the personal element came first you nice man are you eh she demanded coming slowly towards him what about that little dinner we were going to have eh and theatre you just leave your place without word of warning i wonder grandfather took you back again my dear young lady he began rosa she pouted rosa then he went on pleasure

window he explained but let talk about the work how well you look the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https tossed her head lot you care about how well i look she

he grumbled i generally stick on here until i tired out we see about that she promised would you like oh bother she broke off i promised to go to the pictures with stolly wykes her companion faint sigh of regret was very cleverly assumed perhaps another evening then he suggested you such slippery customer she went on here and gone sort of chap i suppose i could put stolly off she went on meditatively raising her eyes and looking at him i would that he protested i ca help thinking how disappointed i should be in his place plenty of feeling others you have have you she observed sarcastica lly i know i care about going out with stolly he always worrying to get engaged i wondered more than once he told her confidentially why you have been engaged long ago how old are you twenty i am she confessed and if i not engaged it because i have been i think much of these young fellows round here i feel somehow though i wanted something dif ferent he sighed sympathetically and then though with an effort turned back to his bench if the old man wakes up and finds i not working he remarked he be annoyed you can get on with your work then she replied i going to talk to him minute or two be good she gave him little backward nod enigmatically encouraging and left him closing the door softly behind her she made her way into the stuffy little parlour and shook the project

luncheon and bottle of wine but some reason or other the old spirit was lacking they missed aaron rodd and speculated to the cause of his absence cresswell too seemed to have inherited new seriousness with his unaccustomed attire it was their mutual recognition of the drawing to an end of one little cycle of their life and try though he might harvey grimm could never escape from the queer sense of foreboding which had haunted him the last few hours and then towards the end of the meal came into the room gazed around moment and approached their table two gentlemen would like to speak to you mr

grimm shook his head firmly he decided if it the end well i face it if only jerry had cleared out i might have got rid of the stones stephen and good luck to you better follow out perhaps if i return he made his way without undue haste from the room exchanging one or two greetings pausing even in the swing doors to say few words with friend then when he stood in the little lobby he knew that there

aaron the girl given him the slip down at tilbury he like madman of course the inspector who had lit his second cigarette strolled up i am afraid he said that people are beginning to recognise us you

inspector by his side the constable opposite they drove off enquiries eh harvey grimm ruminated i wonder what you want to enquire about i fancy the inspector said confidentially that the chief will start by having you searched what you expect to find if it fair question the inspector smiled he had thrust his arm in friendly fashion through his companion we an idea he replied that this time we shall find few of jerry sands diamonds chapter x aaron rodd clasped his arms little further around the barrel against which he was leaning trod water with his feet and thought about death the curtain of slight mist had fallen around him there was nothing visible but the cold grey sea sometimes high above his head sometimes like water tumbling away many feet below him all around him he could hear the hooting of the steamers sounding their weird notes of warning from some unseen unimaginable world few feet away also clinging to barrel was bronzed and hairy man in nautical attire who was using the most awful language good wasting your breath aaron gasped t ry another shout the man did he was advised without eliciting any reply from the other side of the grey walls whereupon he proceeded once more in lurid language to express his opinion of murdering foreigners and mysterious gents who tempted honest into doubtful enterprises suddenly he broke of crikey something on the top of us he exclaimed shout quick once more aaron rodd drew long breath and shouted his voice sounded like child falsetto lost in the stentorian roar of his companion demand immediate help and rescue then the grey fog was suddenly pierced huge dark mass seemed to be gliding almost on the top of them from somewhere up in the clouds came an answering shout aaron rodd companion was moved to one supreme and successful effort clear loud voice shouted directions to them we lowering ropes catch hold if you can before the we lower boats in minute half dozen ropes came down like curving snakes one of them hit the water scarcely foot from aaron he gripped it tightly twist it round your body mate his companion spluttered twist it two or three times round and hold on dear life the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https next few minutes were barely realisable aaron felt himself tossed like cork on to the top of seething mass of sea flung down again with the roar of it in his ears left moment in peace and then dragged through the water at such pace that he found himself wondering whether his arms were going to be torn from his body then he was shot forward with new impetus his body and arms ached with the strain he was only half conscious that done it matey he heard his companion shout hold on there the boat coming aaron rodd never wholly lost conscious ness he heard the measured beat of the oars the sharp clear voice of the officer stand ing up in the stern he saw the boat emer ge from the gloom heard the quick orders felt himself lifted up by the shoulders felt the luxury of something solid beneath his feet the officer in charge of the boat looked at the two men curiously what this he asked collision aaron rodd companion took long breath and tried to explain what it was the officer listened to him spellbound the men almost got to row some one seems to have been playing dirty trick on you eh the former remarked when at last the mariner ceased through sheer exhaustion well you can tell the commander when we get on board gradually fuller consciousness returned to aaron rodd he was able to walk along the deck of the ship they boarded to grope his way unaided down the narrow stairs into the small cabin below where man was seated at table with chart before him he pushed it away the two men were ushered in hullo what this he exclaimed the of ficer who had brought them made brief report the commander nodded fetch them some hot whisky quick he directed now tell us your story the got in first but after few sentences the commander stopped him i think i get at the truth quicker from you he decided nodding to aaron quick please aaron pulled himself together and took long gulp of the hot whisky which was at that moment brought in may i enquire if this is an english he asked he set the glass down his majesty destroyer flying fox was the brief reply now tell what you two men are doing on barrels in the north sea aaron rodd found few terse and explicit words early this morning he said i escorted young lady to tilbury we went there on the strength of bogus telegram which informed us that her brother who is belgian officer was leaving there at midday on munition ship bound havre we found ship boat waiting us at the dock mentioned in the telegram but they refused to take on board with her i thought this reasonable it was supposed to be government vessel and i stayed behind to wait her she was sooner safely on board than the steamer hoisted the norwegian flag and steamed of the commander stared moment then he looked away the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https sounds queer story he observed it true one aaron assured him of course there reason this abduction the young lady some months i want the whole story the commander interrupted i want to know how you got into the north sea i was coming to that aaron rodd proceeded my companion can bear out to the rest i hired his tug meaning to follow the steamer into whatever port it might go if they refused to take on board we caught her up and signalled her to stop she manoeuvred little disclosed gun and blew us to pieces the captain here and i are the only two who ever came up again the commander glanced at the lieutenant who had remained in the room not word passed between them who are you he enquired my name is aaron rodd was the prompt reply i am an american but i have practised law in england good many years i know my story sounds fanciful but there getting away from the sequel the here can confirm every word of it the proceeded to so and the two officers listened time though fascinated the commander interrupted him at last what the name of this boat he asked she had ss christiania painted across her stern the said and she was flying the norwegian flag but the ship name new painted i passed close alongside yesterday and queer lot they were on board the two of ficers exchanged quick glances the christiania the commander murmured softly he paused moment and bent over the chart then he looked up take rodd and the to the he directed rig them both out in some dry clothes and see that they have everything they want aaron rodd had forgotten the discomfo rt of his condition he had only one idea in his brain sir he told the commander that ship the christiania is in the pay of the germans you may be right rodd the latter assented when you have changed your clothes come down and have another chat if i am not on the bridge even then aaron lingered sir he went on i know that there nothing i can say will keep you one moment from what you think to be your duty i have just had fortune left in america i give destroyer to the british navy if you overhaul the christiania search her and take that young lady of the commander the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https the british navy does need bribin g sir he said i had hint about the christiania myself i see what can be done now off you go and get into those dry clothes the two unexpected guests were hospit ably entertained in the wardroom and aaron rodd made very creditable appearance an hour later in some oddments of naval uniform they found their way on deck but were only allowed at the top of the the fog had lifted there were half dozen steamers in sight and the destroyer seemed to be completing rather violent curve suddenly there were loud orders the roar of the machinery was lessened she glided through the water slackening speed at every instant looking down the deck they could see sight which thrilled them both the understood it better than aaron she cleared action he exclaimed the gunners are all at their posts see the signal my god that the christiania he pointed to the steamer round which they had circled they signalled her to stop he continued if i get my hands on the capta in hullo another signal watch it that the last to at once or what aaron rodd asked the smacked his lips those little boys will talk he replied with gusto we could send the christiania to the bottom in something less than thirty seconds you watch the angle of those guns look at the man face who just had an order he trained on her my god the christiania had pursued her course suddenly there was deafening roar vibration which shook the ship fifty yards in front of the christiania the sea was all churned into foam it just an the exclaimed in delight it blankety look at running about on board there were signs of an immense commotion on board the christiania another signal slowly fluttered to the masthead the who was watching the steamer progress grinned they giving in he declared they stopped the engines oh if they only let go on board her the lieutenant came running lightly down the bridge and approached aaron we are sending crew on board the christiania he announced you better go and see if you can identify the young lady there boat being lowered from the other deck may i go along sir the asked eagerly the of ficer shook his head you stay where you are my man he directed you get compensation your tug if your story turns out to be true the man sighed there two sorts of compensation he muttered he spat upon his the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https rodd sat by the side of the lieutenant and though he had never done such thing in his life before he stepped confidently up the rope ladder after him and boarded the christiania the captain was waiting to receive them he was small very fair man who spoke english with harsh and guttural accent his manner was exceedingly perturbed by what right will you tell this piracy he demanded barely accepting the lieutenant salute my papers were cleared in london my car few words with you below if you please captain the lieutenant interrupted you had better stay on deck mr rodd he added looking around aaron walked up and down and endeavoured unsuccessfully to converse with various members of the crew the ship bore all the usual evidences of being small cargo steamer but there was to his fancy something sinister in the appearance of the sailors and the sound of their conversation they pointed to the grey and looking rising and falling upon the waves short distance away suddenly man who might have been steward appeared from below and touched him on the shoulder come this way please he invited he led aaron downstairs into dark odoriferous saloon the captain and the english lieutenant were seated at the top of one of the long tables the latter motion ed aaron rodd to approach the captain denies having any passenger on board mr rodd he observed i saw young lady taken on board at tilbury aaron pronounced firmly she was brought here under false pretext and she is here now it is not true the captain declared furiously there is young lady on board what you say to that mr rodd the lieutenant enquired aaron leaned little forward he stretched out his hand and the captain moment shrank back the man is lying he said calmly the young lady was brought here under the pretext of seeing her brother if this vessel is allowed to proceed on its way to norway she will be intercepted somewhere by german boat and the young lady will be made prisoner that is certainty the gentleman has made mistake the captain insisted there were many vessels lying in the thames yesterday morning we not carry passengers the boatswain of the destroyer who had accompanied them on board entered the saloon and coming up to the lieutenant saluted could i have word with you sir he asked the lieutenant rose to his feet and retired few moments to the further end of the saloon when he returned his manner had under gone change captain hooge he said in confirma tion of this gentleman story i find that you have two concealed guns on board and there are other suspicious circumstances which my boatswain has pointed out which confirm my own impressions about you i am signalling prize crew and shall take you to harwich the captain sprang to his feet his eyes were red with fury the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https you damned meddlesome englishme n he cried if you keep here another hour you will hear of it my government will protest it is contrary to the accepted principles of maritime law it is very much against the principles of maritime law i read it the lieutenant answered coolly you to blow to pieces with concealed gun tug which simply came up to ask you questions now be sensible man captain hooge i shall have your ship searched from top to bottom if the young lady is found you will have to stand your trial in an english court on an extremely serious char ge if there is any young lady on board the captain declared sullenly it is witho ut my knowledge i will go and see the purser we will come too the lieutenant said dryly they passed down little ay the captain opened the door of small stateroom and talked some time in norwegian to bearded and spectacled man the latter after some time turned towards the two men and spoke in english there is young lady here she must have boarded us by accident we were on the point of starting and we could not land her come this way they followed the man down long gloomy passage he knocked at the door of stateroom at the end of it faint voice answered the door was thrown open henriette white and eager stood shrinking back against the wall there was rush of cold air into the place aaron she exclaimed in blank astonishment aaron rodd words failed her altogether it seemed too wonderful she peered into his face shook him by the shoulders and finally almost collapsed in his arms it all right henriette he cried his own voice shaking y quite safe but where did you come from how did you get here she gasped i followed in tug he told her these pleasant people blew us up i heard the gun she cried i saw the tug i saw it go down i saw the men swimming in the water it was horrible i was one of them aaron continued the master and i were picked up by an english destroyer this is one of the officers i managed to make them believe my story and we overhauled and boarded your steamer we are going to take it into harwich you are safe henriette she began to sob the tears stood in aaron own eyes he saw thrust through the open porthole the umbrella on which she had tied various fragments of clothing i have been waving this out of the porthole she explained hysterically i thought they might see i was locked in until moment ago better bring the young lady up on deck the officer suggested we accommodation you on board the flying fox but i am going to signal the commander prize crew and place the captain and officers of this ship under arrest so you both feel quite safe here you be in

they met the captain and the purser talking together in the the former saluted little awkwardly sorry to hear that there was mistake miss he said we were expecting young lady on board the daughter of the owner who had been giving her people some trouble henriette simply looked at the man he turned away i want to go on deck she whispered to aaron i want to get away from this atmosphere come quickly please oh look look half dozen english sailors came down the they were in war trim and they looked like ruddy goliaths by the side of the pale crew of the christiania henriette gave little sob i feel safe she cried safe after all aaron yes dear her little face so white and pitiful was strained up to his the ghost of one of her old provocative smiles quivered at her lips even leopold she murmured will not be able to say any longer you know that you are wonderful person you are like one of those heroes in romances there never was such rescue he pressed her arm our last adventure he whispered is going to be the greatest of all the magistrate court was crowded almost to suffocation when the third time harvey grimm was charged with having aided and abetted in the theft of vario us jewels found in his possession the solicitor the treasury rose at once when called upon urbane even apologetic yet firm i trust that this time dyson the magistrate remarked you are in position to offer sufficient evidence to enable either to dischar ge or to send the prisoner trial the solicitor the treasury proceeded to explain he reminded their worships that the prisoner had been discovered last week owing to the assiduous efforts of brodie actually engaged in secretly cutting up and disguising valuable diamonds there was question at all but that these diamonds were stolen the trouble which the prosecution had to contend with was the fact that they were stolen in america and that some of the stones had been mutilated in such fashion to render them almost unrecognisable commission from the police force of new york had already sailed not only to identify the jewels but with strong hope of identifying the prisoner confederate of one of the most notorious jewel thieves of this generation he was exceedingly sorry to have to ask fourth remand but in this case there was alternative he sat down man arose from his side and addressed the the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https your worship he said i am defending the prisoner in the event of the prosecution having further evidence to offer which i understand to be the case may i be allowed to call witness the magistrate coughed you would be within your rights ransome he admitted leaning forward and looking over his eyeglasses but i need scarcely remind you that to certain extent by calling witnesses the defence at this stage of the proceedings you might possibly prejudice your client case the solicitor bowed my client being wholly innocent man your worship he said is only anxious to have the truth known soon possible you can you choose mr ransome the magistrate consented there was moment whispering name only partially heard was called outside and ripple of interest passed through the court when captain brinnen still in his belgian uniform entered the the solicitor the prosecution looked little staggered the solicitor the defence stood up will you tell the magistrate your name he asked the witness bowed leopold francis henri brinnen floge and your titles comte malaison baron chevalier di scolo vicomte floge there was distinct sensation in court sense of impending events which left every one pleasantly excited harvey grimm leaned forward gripping at the rail in front of him you are i believe the solicitor continued godson of the late king of the belgians that is so the witness admitted you know anything of the prisoner the witness glanced at harvey grimm and meeting his astounded stare greete d him in friendly fashion certainly he replied harvey grimm is valued acquaintance i engaged him recently to recut and if possible to present to in an altered form variety of precious stones may i ask your reason this the solicitor enquired it is matter of almost political history the witness explained turning towards the magistrate the floge collection of diamonds is famous i believe i may say throughout the world they were the subject at the time of the outbreak of the war of lawsuit between the german branch of the floge family and my own during the hearing of the case the jewels were deposited by common consent at the antwerp museum where anybody who is an expert in these matters will tell you that they have been inspected by connoisseurs from all over the world with the invasion of our country the project gutenberg of aaron rodd diviner by phillips oppenheim https grandfather and i determined to our best to prevent these jewels which were worth an immense sum from falling into the hands of the enemy the curato rs of the antwerp museum although they were under bond consented under the circumstances to hand them over to our branch of the family and they were transporte d to my grandfather chateau which is very near the french frontier just before the sack of antwerp subsequently my grandfather and my sister the comtesse floge after series of remarkable adventures in which the latter especially was concerned managed to escape to england with the bulk of the jewels my cousin however who represents the german side of our family has seized our lands and home and has made desperate attempts in various directions to secure also the jewels which the authorities would now award him matter of course i deemed it wise bearing all these things in mind to yield to my grandfather almost passionate insistence and dispose secretly of many possible there was great sensation in court harvey grimm asked chair and sat down did you the solicitor the defence asked impose entire secrecy upon harvey grimm under the peculiar circumstances of the case i did was the prompt reply the solicitor turned to the magistrate there is nothing left your worship he said but to ask you to sanction the immediate release of my client he resumed his seat the solicitor the prosecution promptly arose i may be allowed your worship he asked to the witness certainly the magistrate assented may i ask you sir whether you have any evidence in support of these extraordinary statements of yours the young man bowed certainly he replied the belgian minister who was my father greatest friend and relative and the princess augusta my godmother

jeremiah sands the international jewel thief i must admit that the idea was my own floge explained you see we were extremely anxious that one should know whose jewels these really were the one way to ensure absolute secrecy was to dispose of them stolen property that is what we did and i must say that under the circumst ances grimm your silence was more than admirable to great extent i must admit we were humouring my grandfather who was oppressed the whole of the time with nervous fear of being ordered by the british government to restore them his death makes all the fact i have this morning entrusted the whole of the rest of my collection to christie and they will offer them sale soon the south american buyers can be duly advised it is perhaps just well that we have passed the crisis i

the belgian inspired of course but still according to the law of the whole of the jewels are in way stolen property is not the sort of theft that counts harvey grimm looked out of the windows there

unreality began to fall away once more the earth was firm beneath harvey grimm feet the money i have wasted he groaned why i had young actor establishing alibis all the time i was away where aaron just back from the north sea with my sister floge replied he will tell you story that will make your hair stand on end and the poet down with an of ficers training corps he is coming up to lunch if he

spotless gaiters bunch of violets in his buttonhole sense of stupefied but immeasurable satisfaction radiating from him he took his place at the round luncheon table between aaron rodd and henriette
