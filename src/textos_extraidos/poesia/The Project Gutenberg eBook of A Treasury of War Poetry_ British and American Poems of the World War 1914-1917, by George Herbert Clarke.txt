dedication by mar garet peterson from the w omen message introduction because man is both militant and paciﬁc he has expressed in literature indeed in the other forms of art his paciﬁc and militant moods nor are these moods of necessity incompatible war may become the price of peace and peace may so decay inevitably to bring about war of the dully unresponsive paciﬁcist and the jingo patriot quick to anger the latter doubt is the more dangerous to the cause of true freedom yet both are undesirable citizens he who believes that peace is illusory and spurious unless it be based upon justice and liberty will be proud to battle if battle he must the sake of those foundations the most part the poetry of war undertaken in this spirit has touched and exalted such special qualities patriotism courage sacriﬁce enterprise and endurance where it has tended to glorify war in itself it is chieﬂy because war has released those qualiti es so to speak in stirring and spectacular ways and where it has chosen to round upon war and to upbraid it it is because war has slain ardent and lovable youths and has brought misery and despair to women and old people but the war poet has left the mere arguments to others himself he has seen and felt envisaging war from various angles now romantically now realistically now the celebrating chronicler now the contemplative interpreter but always in spirit of catholic curiosity he has sung the fall of troy the roman adventures the mediaeval battles and crusades the ﬁelds of agincourt and waterloo and the more modern revolutions since homer he has spoken with martial eloquence through the voices of drayton spenser marlowe webster shakespeare milton byron scott burns campbell tennyson browning the new england group and walt whitman mention only

lately lost their lives while on active service captain charles hamilton sorley who was killed at hulluch october 18 1915 and alan seeger who fell mortally wounded during the char ge on july 4 there can be little doubt that these several minds and spirits stirred by the passion and energy of war and reacting sensitively both to its cruelties and to its pities have experienced the kinship of quickened insight and ﬁner unselﬁshness in the face of death the project gutenberg ebook of treasury of war poetry british and american poems of the world war by george herbert https silently compared perhaps the normal materialistic conventions in business politics education and religion with the relief from those conventions that nearly all soldiers and many civilians experience in time of war

seem to be due less to the physical realities of must in many ways cramp and constrain the to the relative spiritual freedom engendered by the needs of war if they are to be successfully met the man of war has an altogether unusual opportunity to realize himself to cleanse and heal himself through the mastering of his physical fears through the facing of his moral doubts through the reëxamination of whatever thoughts he may have possessed theretofore about life and death and the universe and through the quietly unselﬁsh devotion he owes to the welfare of his fellows and to the cause of his native land into the stuff of his thought and utteran ce whether he be on active service or not the interpreter of war weaves these intentions and coöperates with his fellows in building up little

accessions even thus early arising out of the present great conﬂict and we may be sure that other equally notable contributions will be made the present anthology contai ns number of representative poems produced by men and women the editorial policy has been humanly hospitable rather than academically critical especially in the case of some of the verses written by soldiers at the front which however slight in certain instances their technical merit may be are yet psychologically interesting sincere transcripts of personal experience and will it is thought that very reason peculiarly attract and interest the reader it goes without saying that there are several poems in this group which conspicuously succeed also works of art the rest the attempt has been made within such limitations have been experienced to present pretty freely the best of what has been found available in contemporary british and american war verse it must speak itself and the reader will ﬁnd that in not few instances it does so with sensitive sympathy and with living power sometimes too with that quietly intimate companionableness which we ﬁnd in gray elegy and which john maseﬁeld while lectur ing in america in 1916 so often indicated prime quality in english poetry but if this quality appears in chaucer and the and wordsworth it appears also in longfello w and lowell in emerson and lanier and in william vaughn moody american poetry is after all english poetry with difference sprung from the same sources and coursing along similar channels the new fellowship of the two great nations which book of this character may to degree illustrate is ﬁlled with such high promise both of them and all civilization that it is perhaps hardly too much to say with ambassador walter page in his
