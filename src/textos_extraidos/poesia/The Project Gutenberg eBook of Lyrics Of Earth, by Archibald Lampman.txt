yielding to the press of an unnamed delight sudden brightness of the heart magic ﬁre drawn down from paradise that rent the cloud with golden gleam apart and far before his eyes the loveliness and calm of earth lay like limitless dream remote and strange the joy the strife the triumph and the mirth and the enchanted change and so he followed the sweet sound till faith had traversed her

the endless dream the high lethean calm they see wide on the eternal way the services of earth the life of man and listening to the magic cry they say it is the note of pan long ago when the new strains of hostile hymns and conquering faiths grew keen and the old gods from their deserted fanes fled silent and unseen so too the pan not less sadly obedient to the mightier hand cut him new reeds and in sore distress passed out from land to land and lingering by each haunt he knew of fount or sinuous stream or grassy marge he set the syrinx to his lips and blew note divinely lar ge and all around him on the wet cool earth the frogs came up and with smile he took them in his hairy hands and set his mouth to theirs awhile and blew into their velvet throats and ever from that hour the frogs repeat the murmur of pan pipes the notes and answers strange and sweet and they that hear them are renewed by knowledge in some touch conveyed entering again into the eternal mood wherein the

remote and clear the barking of dog or call to cattle sharply pealed borne echoing from some wayside stall or barnyard far then all is silent and the snow falls settling soft and slow the evening deepens and the gray folds closer earth and sky the world seems shrouded far away its noises sleep and i secret yon buried stream plod dumbly on and dream sunset 45 46 the project gutenberg ebook of lyrics of earth by archibald lampman https this windy bridge at rest in some former curious hour we have watched the city hue all along the orange west cupola and pointed tower darken into solid blue tho the biting north wind breaks full across this drifted hold let us stand with icèd cheeks watching westward of old past the violet to the farthest fringe of pine where far of f the narrows to dusky line and the last pale splendors die slowly from the olive sky till the thin clouds wear away into threads of and the sudden stars between brighten in the pallid green till above the spacious east slow returnèd one by one like pale prisoners released from the dungeons of the sun capella and her train appear in the glittering charioteer till the rounded moon shall grow great above the eastern snow shining into burnished gold and the silver earth outrolled in the misty yellow light shall take on the width of night ore subtly conscious all awake let us clear our eyes and break through the cloudy chrysalis see the wonder it is down narrow alley blind touch and vision heart and mind turned sharply inward still we plod till the calmly smiling god leaves us and our spirits grow more thin more acrid we go creeping by the sullen wall we forego the power to see the threads that bind us to the all god or the immensity whereof on the eternal road 47 48 the project gutenberg ebook of lyrics

issuing in perpetual change from the rainbow gates of time but he who through this common air surely knows the great and fair what is lovely what sublime becomes in an increasing span one with earth and one with man one despite these mortal scars with the planets and the stars and nature from her holy place bending with unveilèd face fills him in her divine employ with her own majestic joy up the ﬁelded slopes at morn where light wefts of shadow pass films upon the bending corn i shall sweep the purple grass heights and mossy woods and the outer solitudes dim with pine shall be home and haunt of mine i shall search in crannied hollows where the sunlight scarcely follows and the secret forest brook murmurs and from nook to nook forever downward curls and cools frothing in the bouldered pools many noon shall ﬁnd laid in the pungent balsam shade where sharp breezes spring and shiver on some deep river and the plangent waters come amber and streaked with foam where beneath the sunburnt hills all day long the crowded mills with remorseless champ and scream overlord the sluicing stream and the rapids iron roar hammers at the forest core where corded rafts creep slowly on glittering in the noonday sun and the tawny river shepherding the branded logs bind and heave with cadenced cry where the blackened tugs go by panting hard and straining slow laboring at the weighty tow bar ges all in trim 49 50 the project gutenberg ebook of lyrics of earth by archibald lampman https in long cumbrous line loaded to the water brim with the clean pine perhaps in some low stretching wide on either hand i shall see the belted bees rocking with the tricksy breeze in the spirèd or with eager trampling feet burrowing in the boneset blooms treading out the dry perfumes where newly mown climb the hillside ruddy brown i shall see the haymakers while the noonday scarcely stirs brown of neck and booted gray tossing up the rustling hay while the bend and rock they take each scented cock jolting over dip and rise and the wavering butterﬂies the spaces brown and bare light and wander here and there i shall stray by many stream where the lilies gleam napping out the sultry days in the quiet secluded bays where the tasseled rushes tower the purple and the ﬂoating azure glint and crystal watches the burnished stream with his eye of ebony where the lolls at rest on his ﬂoat of that the swaying water weaves and distends his yellow breast lowing out from shore to shore with hollow vibrant roar where the softest wind that blows it lightly comes and goes the jungled river meads stirs whisper in the reeds and wakes the crowded from their stately reveries flashing through their hordes like brandishing of swords there too the tremble to the golden core children of enchanted hours whom the rustling river bore in the night bewildered noon woven of water and the moon i shall hear the grasshoppers from the parched grass rehearse 51 52 the project gutenberg ebook of lyrics of earth by archibald lampman https with drowsy note prolong evermore the same thin song i shall hear the crickets tell stories by the humming well and mark the locust with quaint eyes caper in his cloak of gray like jester in disguise rattling by the dusty way i shall dream by upland fences where the season wealth condenses over many weedy wreck wild desert places that sovereign beauty loves to deck with her softest dearest graces there the long year dreams in quiet and the summer strength runs riot shall i not remember these deep in winter reveries berried brier and and milkweed with its dense perfume slender vervain towering up in cup like candlestick each spire kindled with violet ﬁre matted creepers and wild cherries elderberries and on scanty plots of sod groves of branchy goldenrod what though autumn mornings now winterward with glittering brow stiffen in the silver grass and what though robins ﬂock and pass with subdued and sober call to the old year funeral though october crimson leaves rustle at the gusty door and the tempest round the eaves alternate with pipe and roar i sit erst unharmed secure conscious that my store is sure the fencèd ﬁelds or the untilled forest yields of unhurt remembrances or thoughts far these i have reaped and laid away treasure of unwinnowed grain to the garner packed and gray gathered without toil or strain and when the darker days shall come and the ﬁelds are white and dumb when our ﬁres are half in vain and the crystal starlight weaves mockeries of summer leaves pictured on the icy pane 53 54 the project gutenberg ebook of lyrics of earth by archibald lampman https the high aurora gleams far above the arctic streams like line of shifting spears and the broad meres glimmering in that spectral light thunder through the northern night then within the bolted door i shall con my summer store though the fences scarcely show black above the drifted snow though the icy sweeping wind whistle in the empty tree safe within the sheltered mind i shall feed on memory yet across the windy night comes upon its wings cry fashioned forms and modes take ﬂight and vision sad and high of the laboring world down there where the lights burn red and warm pricks my soul with sudden stare glowing through the veils of storm in the city yonder sleep those who smile and those who weep those whose lips are set with care those whose brows are smooth and fair mourners whom the dawning light shall grapple with an old distress lovers folded at midnight in their bridal happiness pale watchers by belovèd beds fallen with nodding heads whom sleep captured by surprise with the circles round their eyes maidens with breath dreaming of enchanted bowers old men with the mask of death little children soft ﬂowers those who wake and start in some madness of the heart those whose lips and brows of stone evil thoughts have graven upon shade by shade and line by line refashioning what was once divine all these sleep and through the night comes passion and cry with blind sorrow and might i know not whence i know not why something i can not control nameless hunger of the soul it holds fast in vain in vain i remember how of old i saw the ruddy race of men through the glittering world outrolled multitude all immortal all divine 55 56 the project gutenberg ebook of lyrics of earth by archibald lampman https in wreathèd line by pathway through wood the sun cup the earth is the cup of the sun that he ﬁlleth at morning with wine with the warm strong wine of his might from the vintage of gold and of light fills it and makes it divine and at night when his journey is done at the gate of his radiant hall he setteth his lips to the brim with long last look of his eye and lifts it and draineth it dry drains till he leaveth it all
