our lives something has gone out when with each successive day we miss the presence that has become part of ourselves and struggle against the realization that it is with us more we begin to live in the past and thank god the gracious boon of memory few of us there are who having advanced to middle life have not come to look back on the travelled road of human existence in thought of those who journeyed awhile with us part of all our hopes and joyousness the sharers of all our ambitions and our pleasures whose mission has been fulﬁlled and who have left us with the of years still seeming to stretch out on the path ahead it is then that memory comes with its soothing inﬂuence tellin g us of the happiness that was ours and comforting us with the ever recurring thought of the pleasures of that travelled road it is happiness to walk and talk with brother forty years and it is happiness to know that the surety of that brother affection the knowledge of the greatness of his heart and the nobility of his mind are not one memory alone but may be publicly attested admiration and emulation that it has fallen to to speak to the world of my brother i knew him i rejoice i not fear that speaking brother i shall crowd the laurel wreaths upon him to this extent he lies in peace already honored but if i can show him to the world not poet but man i may lead men to see more of that goodness sweetness and gentleness that were in him i shall the more bless the memory that has survived my brother was born in louis in whether the exact day was september 2 or september 3 was question over which he was given to speculation more particularly in later years when he was accustomed to discuss it frequently and with much earnest ness in his youth the anniversary was generally held to be september 2 perhaps the result of humorous remark by my father that oliver cromwell had died september 3 and he could not reconcile this date to the thought that it was an important anniversary to one of his children many years after when my uncle charles kellogg field of vermont published the genealogy of the field family the original date september 3 was restored and from that time my brother accepted it although with each recurring anniversary the controversy was gravely renewed much to the amusement of the family and always to his own perplexity in november 1856 my mother died and at the breaking up of the family in louis my brother and myself the last of six children were taken to amherst massachusetts by our cousin miss mary french who took upon herself the care and responsibility of our bringing up how nobly and she entered upon and dischar ged those duties my brother gladly testiﬁed in the beautiful dedication of his ﬁrst published poems little book of western verse wherein he honored the gracious love in which he grew and bade her look kindly on the faults of his pen she had always looked on his own few years my brother attended private school boys in amherst then at the age of fourteen he was intrusted to the care of rev james tufts of monson one of those noble instructors of the blessed old school who are passing away from the arena of education in america by tufts he was ﬁtted college and from the enthusiasm of this old scholar he caught perhaps the inspiration the love of the classics which he carried through life in the fall of 1868 he entered williams choice was largely remained there one year my father died in the summer the project gutenberg ebook of little book of western verse by eugene field https and my brother chose his guardian professor john william burgess now of columbia university new york city when professor burgess later in the summer accepted call to knox college galesbur g illinois my brother accompanied him and entered that institution but the restlessness which was so characteristic of him in youth asserted itself after another year and he joined then in my junior year at the university of missouri at columbia it was at this institution that he ﬁnished his education so far it related to prescribed study shortly after attaining his majority he went to europe remaining six months in france and italy from this european trip have sprung the absurd stories which have represented him squandering thousands of dollars in the pursuit of pleasure unquestionably he had the not unnatural extravagance which accompanies youth and most generous disposition he was lavish and all through life to an unusual degree but at time was he particularly given to wild excesses and the fact that my father estate which was largely realty had shrunk perceptibly during the panic days of 1873 was enough to make him soon reach the limit of even moderate extravagance at the same time many good stories have been told illustrative of his contempt money and it is eminently characteristic of his lack of the puritan regard small things that one day he approached my father executor hon gray of louis with request dollars but objected this cautious and excellent man i gave you dollars only yesterday eugene what did you with that oh replied my brother with an impatient and scornful toss of the head i believe i bought some postage stamps before going to europe he had met miss julia sutherland comstock of joseph missouri the sister of college friend and the attachment which was formed led to their marriage in october much of his tenderest and sweetest verse was inspired by love the woman who became his wife and the dedication to the second book of verse is hardly surpassed depth of affection and daintiness of sentiment while lover lane st is the very essence of loyalty love and reminiscential ardor at the time of his marriage my brother realized the importance of going to work in earnest and shortly before the appointment of the he entered upon the active duties of journalism which he never relinquished during life these duties with the exception of the year he passed in europe with his family in were conﬁned to the west he began paragrapher in louis quickly achieving somewhat more than merely local reputation time he was in joseph and eighteen months following january 1880 he lived in kansas city removing thence to denver in 1883 he came to chicago at the solicitation of melville stone then editor of the chicago daily news retaining his connection with the news and its offspring the record until his death thus hastily have been skimmed over the bare outlines of his life the formative period of my brother youth was passed in new england and to the inﬂuences which still prevail in and around her peaceful hills and gentle streams the inﬂuences of sturdy stock which has sent so many good and brave men to the west the upbuilding of the country and the upholding of what is best in puritan tradition he gladly acknowledged he owed much that was strong and enduring while he gloried in the west and remained loyal to the section which gave him birth and in which he chose to cast his lot he was not the less proud of his new england blood and not the less conscious of the beneﬁts of new the project gutenberg ebook of little book of western verse by eugene field https his boyhood was similar to that of other boys brought up with the best surroundings in massachusetts village where the college atmosphere prevailed he had his boyish pleasures and his trials his share of that queer mixture of worldliness and almost austere puritanism which is yet characteristic of many new england families the sabbath was veritable day of judgment and in later years he spoke humorously of the terrors of those sessions in church and though he never failed to acknowledge the beneﬁts he had derived from an enforced study of the bible if i could be grateful to new england nothing else he would say i should bless her forevermore pounding with the bible and the and in proof of the earnestness of this decla ration he spent many hours in boston year or two ago trying to ﬁnd one of those spellers that temporarily made lose my faith in the system of the universe it is easy at this day to look back three decades and note the characteristics which appeared trivial enough then but which clinging to him and developing had marked effect on his manhood and on the direction of his talents boy his fondness pets amounted to passion but unlike other boys he seemed to carry his pets into higher sphere and to give them personality each pet whether dog cat bird goat or had the family distrust of not only had name but it was his delight to fancy that each possessed peculiar dialect of human speech and each he addressed in the humorous manner conceived he ignored the names in common use domestic animals and chose or invented those more pleasing to his exuberant fancy this conceit was always with him and years afterward when his children took the place of his boyish pets he gratiﬁed his whim strange names by ignoring those designated at the baptismal font and substituting freakish titles of his own riotous fancy indeed it must have been tax on his imaginative powers when in childhood he was conducting poultry annex to the homestead each chicken was properly instructed to respond to peculiar call and finnikin minnikin winnikin dump poog boog seemed to recognize immediately the queer intonations of their master with an intellige nce that is not usually accorded to chickens with this love animal life was developed also that tenderness of heart which was so manifest in my brother daily actions one was then sized came into the house and throwing himself on the sofa sobbed half an hour one of the chickens hatched the day before had been crushed under his foot he was walking in the and murderer could have felt more keenly the pangs of remorse the other boys looked on curiously at this exhibition of feeling and it was indeed an unusual outburst but it was strongly characteristic of him through life and nothing would so excite his anger cruelty to an animal while every neglected friendless dog or persecuted cat always found in him champion and friend in illustration of this humane instinct it is recalled that few weeks before he died lady visiting the house found his room swarming with ﬂies in response to her exclamation of astonishment he explained that day or two before he had seen poor ozen ﬂy on the outside and he had been moved by kindly impulse to open the window and admit her and this he added is what i get it that ungrateful creature is you perceive the grandmother of eight thousand nine hundred and ﬂies that the birds that ﬂew about his house in buena park knew his voice has been demonstrated more than once he would keep bread crumbs scattered along the the beneﬁt he explained of the blue jays and the robins who were not in their the project gutenberg ebook of little book of western verse by eugene field https health or were too overcome by the heat to make customary exertion if the jays were particularly noisy he would go into the yard and expostulate with them in tone of friendly reproach whereupon the family afﬁrms they would apparently apologize and ﬂy away once he maintained at considerable expense thoroughly hopeless and useless donk ey and it was his custom when returning from the ofﬁce at any hour of the night to go into the back yard and say poor old don in bass voice that carried block away whereupon old don would lift up his own voice with melancholy bray of welcome that would shake the windows and start the neighbors from their slumbers old don is passing his declining years in an old kentucky home and the robins and the blue jays they return with the spring will look in vain the friend who fed them at the window the family dog at amherst which was immortalized many years later with the legged fyce and which was known in his day to hundreds of students at the college on account of his surpassing lack of beauty rejoiced originally in the honest name of fido but my brother rejected this name commo nplace and unworthy and straightway named him dooley on the presumption that there was something hibernian in his face it was to dooley that he wrote his ﬁrst poem parody on had i wings like dove song then in great vogue near the head of the village stree t was the home of the emersons large frame house now standing more than century and in the great yard in front stood the magniﬁcent elms which are the glory of the connecticut valley many times the boys returning from school would linger to cool off in the shade of these glorious trees and it was on one of these occasions that my brother put into the mouth of dooley his maiden ef fort in verse had i wings like dove i would ﬂy away from this world of ﬂeas i ﬂy all round miss emerson yard and light on miss emerson trees even this startling parody which was regarded by the boys veritable stroke of genius failed to impress the adult villagers with the conviction that poet was budding yet how much of quiet humor and lively imagination is betrayed by these four lines how easy it is now to look back at the small boy and picture him sympathizing with his little friend tormented by the heat and the pests of his kind and making him sigh the rest that seemed to lurk in the rustling leaves of the stately elms perhaps it was not astonishing poetry even child but was there not something in the fancy the sentiment and the rhythm which bespoke far more than ordinary appreciation is it not this same quality of alert and instinctive sympathy which has run through eugene field writings and touched the spring of popular af fection dooley went to the dog heaven many years ago finnikin and poog and boog and the scores of boyhood friends that followed them have passed to their pythagorean reward but the boy who ﬁrst found in them the delight of companionship and the kindlings of imagination retained all the youthful impulses which made him nearly half century the lover of animal life and the gentle singer of the faithful and the good comradeship was the indispensable factor in my brother life it was strong in his youth it grew to be an imperative necessity in later years in the theory that it is sometimes good to be alone he had little or faith even when he was at work in his study when it was almost essential to thought that he should be undisturbed he was never quite content unless aware the project gutenberg ebook of little book of western verse by eugene field https presence of human beings near at hand betrayed by their voices it is customary to think of poet wandering off in the great solitudes standing alone in contemplation of the wonderful work of nature on the cliffs overlooking the ocean in the paths of the forest or on the mountain side my brother was not of this order that he was primarily and essentially poet of humanity and not of nature does not argue that he was insensible to natural beauty or natural grandeur nobody could have been more keenly susceptible to the inﬂuences of nature in their temperamental effect and perhaps this may explain that he did not love nature the less but that he prized companionship more if nature pleased him he longed friend to share his pleasure if it appalled him he turned from it with repugnance and fear throughout his writings may be found the most earnest appreciation of the joyousness and loveliness of beautiful landscape but he would share it intellectually with his readers so it was necessity that he could not seek it alone an actuality in his boyhood in the full glory of perfect day he loved to ramble through the woods and meadows and delighted in the azure tints of the berkshire hills and later in life he was keen to notice and admire the soft harmonies of landscape but with change in weather or with the approach of storm the poet would be lost in the timidity and distrust of child companionship with him meant cheerfulness his horror of gloom and darknes s was almost morbid from the tragedies of life he instinctively shrank and large was his sympathy and generous and genuine his affection he was often prompted to run from suffering and to betray what must have been constitutional terror of distress he did not hesitate to acknowledge this characteristic and sought to atone it by writing the most tender and touching lines to those to whom he believed he owed gift of comfort and strength his private letters to friends in adversity or bereavement were beautiful in their simplicity and honest and outspoken love he was not ashamed to let his friends see how much he thought of them and even if the emotional quality which asserts itself in the nervous and artistic temperament made him realize that he could not trust himself that same quality gave him personality marvelous in its magnetism both boy and man he made friends everywhere and that he retained them to the last speaks the and genuineness of his nature to two weaknesses he frankly confessed that he was inclined to be superstitious and that he was afraid of the dark one of these he stoutly defended asserting that he who was not fearful in the dark was dull clod utterly devoid of imagination from his earliest childhood my brother was devourer of fairy tales and he continually stored his mind with fantastic legends which found vent in new shapes in his verses and prose tales in the ceiling of one of his dens led into the attic and this door was open he seriously contemplated closing it because he said he fancied that quee r things would come down in the night and spirit him away it is not to be inferred that he thus remained in condition of actual fear but it is true that he was imaginative to the degree of acute nervousness and like child associated light with safety and darkness with the uncanny and the supernatural it was after all the better his songs that it was so else they might not have been ﬁlled with that cheery optimism which praised the happiness of sunlight and warmth and sought to lift humanity from the darkness of despondency this weakness or intellectual virtue he pleasantly regarded it was perhaps rather stronger in him man than in his boyhood he has himself declared that he wrote seein things the project gutenberg ebook of little book of western verse by eugene field https more to solace his own feelings than to delineate the sufferings of childhood however aptly it may describe them and when he put into rhythm that any color so long it red is the color that suits best he spoke not only poet but man red conveyed to him the idea of warmth and cheeriness and seemed to express to him in color his temperamental demand all through his life he pandered to these feelings instead of seeking to repress them to this extent there was little of the puritan in his nature and he believed that happiness comes largely from within so he felt that it is not philosophy to avoid far possible whatever may cloud and render less acceptable one own existence the literary talent of my brother is not easily traceable to either branch of the family in fact it was tacitly accepted that he would be lawyer his father and grandfather had been before him but the futility of this arrangement was soon manifest and surely man less temperamentally equipped the law ever lived it has been said of the fields speaking generally of the new england division that they were well adapted to be eithe r musicians or actors though the talent music or mimicry has been in case carried out of private life save in my brother public readings eugene had more than boy share of musical talent but he never cultivated it preferring to use the ﬁne voice with which he was endowed recitation of which he was always fond acting was his strongest boyish passion even child he was wonderful mimic and thereby the delight of his playmates and the terror of his teachers he organized stock company among the small boys of the village and gave performances in the barn of one of the less scrupulous neighbors but whether pins or pennies memory does not suggest he assigned the parts and always reserved himself the eccentric character and the low comedy caring nothing the heroic or the sentimental one of the plays performed was lester wallack rosedale with eugene in the dual role of the low comedian and the heavy villain at this time also he delighted in monologue s imitations of eccentric types or what sol smith russell calls comics word which always amused eugene and which he frequently used this fondness parlor readings and private theatricals he carried through college remaining steadfast to the comics until few years ago when he began to give public readings and discovered that he was capable of higher and more effective work it was in fact his versatility that made him the most accomplished and the most popular author in america before he went into journalism the more sedat of his family connections were in constant fear lest he should adopt the profession of the actor and he held it over them threat on one occasion failing to get coveted appropriation from the executor of the estate he said calmly to the worthy man very well i must have money my living expenses if you can not advance it to out of the estate i shall be compelled to go on the stage but i can not keep my own name i have decided to assume yours and shall have lithographs struck off at once they will read gray banjo and specialty artist the appropriation was immediately forthcoming it is in sense depreciatory of my brother attainments in life to say that he gave evidence of precocity in his studies in childhood on the contrary he was somewhat slow in development though this was due not so much to lack of natural learned easily and quickly when so to fondness the hundred diversions which occupy boy time he possessed marked talent caricature and not small part of the study hours was devoted to amusing pictures of his teachers his playmates and his pets this habit of drawing which was wholly without instruction he always preserved and it was his honest opinion even at the height of his success in authorship that he would have been the project gutenberg ebook of little book of western verse by eugene field https caricaturist than writer until he was thirty years of age he wrote legible hand but about that time he adopted the microscopic penmanship which has been so widely reproduced using the purpos very pens with his manuscript he took the greatest pains often going to inﬁnite trouble to illuminate his letters among his friends these letters are held curiosities of literature hardly more the quaint sentiments expressed than the queer designs in colored inks which embellished them he was specially fond of drawing weird elves and gnomes and would spend an hour or two decorating with these comical ﬁgures letter he had written in ten minutes he was fastidious with the manuscript the ofﬁce if it had been specimen copy exhibition and it was always understood that his manuscript should be returned to him after it had passed through the printers hands in this way all the original copies of his stories and poems have been preserved and those which he did not give to friends souvenirs have been bound his children taste literary composition might not have passed doubtless it did pass so many years unnoticed had he been deﬁcient in other talents and had he devoted himself exclusively to writing but boy he was fond though in less degree than many boys of athletic sports and his youthful desire theatrical entertainments pen caricaturing and dallying with his pets took up much of his time yet he often gave way to fondness composition and there is in the family possession sermon which he wrote before he was ten years of age in which he showed the results of those arduous sabbath days in the old congregational and at one time when yet very young he was at the head of ﬂourishing boys paper while at another fresh from the inspiration of romance in new york weekly he prepared series of tales of adventure which unhappily have not been preserved in his college days he was one of the associate editors of the university magazine and while at that time he had serious thought of devoting his life to literature his talents in that direction were freely confessed from my father whose studious habits in life had made him not only eminent at the bar but profoundly conversant with general literature he had inherited taste reading and it was this omnivorous passion books that led my brother to say that his education had only begun when he fancied that it had left off in boyhood he contracted that fascinating but highly injurious habit of reading in bed which he subsequently extolled with great fervor and he grew older the habit increased upon him until he was obliged to admit that he could not enjoy literature unless he took it horizontally if friend expostulated with him advising him to give up tobacco reading in bed and late hours he said and what have we left in life if we give up all our bad habits that the poetic instinct was always strong within him there has never been room to question but perhaps the reasons before assigned it was tardy in making its way outward years his mind lay fallow and receptive awaiting the occasion which should develop the true inspiration of the poet he was accustomed to speak of himself and too modestly merely versiﬁer but his own experience should have contradicted this estimate his ﬁrst efforts at verse were singularly halting in mechan ical construction and he was well past his year before he gave to the world any verse worthy the name what might be called the curse of comedy was on him and it was not until he threw off that yoke and gave expression to the better and the sweeter thoughts within him that with bion the voice of song ﬂowed freely from the heart it seems strange that man who became master of the art of mechanism in verse should have been deﬁcient in this particular at period comparatively late but it the project gutenberg ebook of little book of western verse by eugene field https the theory of gradual development and marks the phases of life through which with his character of many sides he was compelled to pass he was nearly thirty when he wrote christmas treasures the ﬁrst poem he deemed worthy and very properly of preservation and the publication of this tender commemoration of the death of child opened the springs of sentiment and love childhood destined never to run dry while life endured in journalism he became immediately successful not so much adapta bility to the treadmill of that calling the bright ness and distinctive character of his writing he easily established reputation humorist and while he fairly deserved the title he often regretted that he could not entirely shake it off his powers of perception were phenome nally keen and he detected the peculiarities of people with whom he was thrown in contact almost at glance while his gift of mimicry was such that after minute interview he could burlesque the victim to the life even emphasizing the small details which had been apparently too minute to attract the special notice of those who were acquaintances of years standing this faculty he carried into his writing and it proved immensely valuable with his quick appreciation of the ludicrous and his power of delineating personal peculiarities his sketches were remarkable their resemblances even when he was indulging apparently in the wildest ﬂights of imagination it is to be regretted that much of his newspaper work covering period of twenty years was necessarily so full of purely local color that its brilliancy could not be generally appreciated it is if an artist had painted wondrous picture clever enough in the general view but full of signiﬁcance hidden to the world equally facile was he in the way of adaptation he could write hoax worthy of poe and one of his humors of imagination was sufﬁciently subtle and successful to excite comment in europe and america and to call an explanation and denial from distinguished englishman he lived in denver only few weeks when he was writing verse in miners dialect which has been rightly placed at the head of that style of composition matter where he wandered he speedily became imbued with the spirit of his surroundings and his quickly and accurately gathered impressions found vent in his pen whether he was in martin lane in london with mynheer von der bloom in amsterdam or on the schnellest zug from hanover to leipzig at the time of my brother arrival in chicago in was then in his year had performed an immense amount of newspaper work but had done little or nothing of permanent value or with any real literary signiﬁcance but despite the fact that he had lived up to that time in the smaller cities he had large number of acquaintances and certain following in the journalistic and artistic world of which from the very moment of his entrance into journalism he never had been deprived his immense fund of good humor his powers his admirable equipment an entertainer and the wholehearted way with which he threw himself into life and the pleasures of living attracted men to him and kept him the centre of the multitude that prized his fascinating companionship his fellows in journalism furthermore had been quick to recognize his talents and man was more widely copied the technical expression goes his early years in chicago did not differ materially from those of the previous decade but the enlar ged scope gave greater play to his fancy and more opportunity his talents master of satire the publication of the denv er primer and culture garland while adding to his reputation humorist happily did not satisfy him he was now past the age of and great psychical revolution was coming the project gutenberg ebook of little book of western verse by eugene field https still on the sunny side of midd le life he was wearying of the cup of pleasure he had drunk so joyously and was drawing away from the multitude and toward the companionship of those who loved books and bookish things and who could sympathize with him in the aspirations the better work the consciousness of which had dawned it was now that he began to apply himself diligently to the preparation higher effort and it is to the credit of journalism which has so many sins to answer that in this he was encouraged beyond the usual fate of men who become slaves to that calling and yet though from this time he was privileged to be regarded one of the sweetest singers in american literature and incomparably the noblest bard of childhood though the grind of journalism was measurably taken from him he chafed under the conviction that he was condemned to mingle the prosaic and the practical with the fanciful and the ideal and that having given hostages to fortune he must conform even in measure to the requirements of position too lucrative to be cast aside from this time also his physical condition which never had been robust began to show the effects of sedentary life but the warning of long siege of nervous dyspepsia was suffered to pass unheeded and ﬁve or six years he labored prodigiously his mind expanding and his intellect growing more brilliant the vital powers decayed it would seem that with the awakening of the consciousness of the better powers within him with the realization that he was destined place in literature my brother felt quasi remorse the years he fancied he had wasted he was too severe with himself to understand that his comparative tardiness in arriving at the earnest thoughtful stage of lifework was the inexorable law of gradual development which must govern the career of man of his temperament with his exuberant vitality and his showy talents it was serious mistake but it was not the less noble one and now also the inﬂuences of home crept little closer into his heart his family life had not been without its tragedies of bereavement and the death of his oldest boy in germany had drawn him even nearer to the children who were growing up around him much of his tenderest verse was inspired by affection his family and some great shock is often essential to the revolution in buoyant nature so it seemed to require the recurring tragedies of life to draw from him all that was noblest and sweetest in his sympathetic soul had the angel of death never hovered over the crib in my brother home had he never known the pangs and the which come when the little voice is stilled and the little chair is empty he could not have written the lines which voice the great cry of humanity and the hope of reunion in immortality beyond the grave the ﬂood of appeals platform readings from cities and towns in all parts of the united states came too late his physical strength and his ambition earlier in life he would have delighted in this form of travel and entertainment but his nature had wonderfully changed and strong were the ﬁnancial inducements he was loath to leave his family and circle of intimate friends and the home he had just acquired all of the time which he allotted recreation he devoted to working aroun d his grounds in arranging and rearranging his large library and in the disposition of his curios years he had been an indefatigable collector and he took boyish pleasure not only in his souvenirs of long journeys and distinguished men and women but in the queer toys and trinkets of children which seemed to give him inspiration much that was effective in childhood verse to the careless observer the immense array of weird dolls and absurd toys in his meant little more than an the project gutenberg ebook of little book of western verse by eugene field https the anomalous but those who were near to him knew what connecting link they were between him and the little children of whom he wrote and how each trumpet and drum each spinster doll each little toy dog each little tin soldier played its part in the poems he sent out into the world writer ever made more persistent and consistent use of the material by which he was surrounded or put higher literary value on the little thing s which go to make up the sum of human existence of the spiritual development of my brother much might be said in conviction and in tenderness he was not man who discussed religion freely he was associated with religious denomination and he professed creed beyond the brotherhood of mankind and the inﬁnitude of god love and mercy in childhood he had been reared in much of the austerity of the puritan doctrine of the relation of this life to the hereafter and much of the hardness and severity of christianity still interpreted in many parts of new england was forced upon him is not unusual in such cases he rebelled against this conception of god and god day even while he confessed the intellectua l advantages he had reaped from frequent compulsory communion with the bible and he many times declared that his children should not be brought up to regard religion and the sabbath bugbear what evolution was going on in his mind at the turning point in his life who can say who shall look into the silent soul of the poet and see the hope and conﬁdence and joy that have come from out the chaos of strife and doubt yet who can read the verses telling over and over the beautiful story of bethlehem the glory of the and the comfort that comes from the teacher and doubt that in those moments he walked in the light of the love of god it is true that man living in christia n nation who is stirred by poetic instinct can fail to recognize and pay homage to that story of wonderful sweetness the coming of the the redemption of the world it is true that in commemoration the poet may speak while the man within is silent but it is hardly true that he whose generous soul responded to every principle of christ the teacher pleadin g humanity would sing over and over that tender song of love and sacriﬁce mere poetic inspiration he slept my brother soul was called who shall say that it was not summoned by that same angel song that awakened little boy blue who shall doubt that the smile of supreme peace and rest which lingered on his face after that noble spirit had departed spoke the victory he had won the hope and belief that had been justiﬁed and the happiness he had gained to have been with my brother in the last year of his life to have seen the sweetening of character already lovable to an unusual degree to know now that in his unconscious preparation the life beyond he was drawing closer to those he loved and who loved him this is the tenderest memory the most precious heritage not to have seen him in that year is never to realize the full beauty of his nature the complete development of his nobler self the perfect abandonment of all that might have been ungenerous and intemperate in one even less conscious of the weakness of mortality he would say when chided public expression of kind words to those not wholly deserving that he had felt the sting of harshness and ungraciousness and never again would he use his power to inﬂict suffering or wound the feelings of man or child who is there to wonder then that the love of all went out to him and that the other triumphs of his life were nothing in comparison with the grasp he maintained on popular affection the day after his death lady was purchasing ﬂowers to send in sympathy the mourning family when she was approached by little girl the project gutenberg ebook of little book of western verse by eugene field https asked what she was going to with so many roses when she replied that she intended sending them to field the little one said that she wanted so much to send field rose adding pathetically that she had money deeply touched by the child sorrowful earnestness the lady picked out yellow rose and gave it to her and when the cofﬁn was lowered to the grave wealth of wreaths and designs was strewn around to mark the spot but down below the hand of the silent poet held only little yellow rose the tribute of child who did not know him in life but in whose heart nestled the love his songs had awakened and the magnetism of his great humanity had stirred few hours after his spirit had gone crippled boy came to the house and begged permission to go to the chamber the wish was granted and the boy hobbled to the bedside who he was and in what manner my brother had befriended him none of the family knew but he painfully picked his way down stairs the tears were streaming over his face and the onlookers forgot their own sorrow in contemplation of his grief the morning of the funeral while the family stood around the cofﬁn the letter at buena park came into the room and laying bunch of letters at the foot of the bier said reverently there is your last mail mr field then turning with tears in his eyes if apologizing an intrusion he added he was always good to and i
