born in bristo l on the 20th of november his three months before his son birth had been subchaunter in bristol cathedral and had held the mastership in local free school we are told that he was fond of reading and music that he made collection of roman coins and believed in magic or so he said studying the black art in the pages of cornelius agrippa with all the culture and learning that raised him above his class his father and grandfathers before him more than hundred years had been sextons to the church of mary redclif fe he is described dissipated brutal fellow lastly he appears to have been proud and of chatterton mother little need be said gentle and rather foolish she was devoted to her two children mary and his sister junior by two years thomas the poet of these mary seems to have inherited the colourless charact er of her mother but thomas must always have been remarkable we have the fullest accounts of his childhood and the details that might with another be set down chronicles of the nursery will be seen to have their importance in the case of this boy who set himself consciously to be famous when he was eight wrote ﬁne imaginative verse before he was thirteen and killed himself aged seventeen and nine months thomas then was moody baby dull small boy who knew few of his letters at four and was was his impenetrability to the age of ﬁve from the project gutenberg ebook of the rowley poems by thomas chatterton https of which his father had been master he was moreover till the age of six and half so frequently subject to long ﬁts of abstraction and of apparently causeless crying that his mother and grandmother feared his reason and thought him absolute fool we are told also by his there is incongruity in the two he early displayed taste and would preside over his playmates their master and they his hired servants at seven and half he dissipated his mother fear that she had borne fool by rapidly learning to read in great black bible characteristically objected to read in small book in very short time from this he appears to have devoured eagerly the contents of every volume he could lay his hands on he had thirst knowle dge at any kind of information and the merest child read with careless voracity books of heraldry history astronomy theology and such other subjects would repel most children and perhaps one may say most men at the age of eight we hear of him reading day or long they would let him conﬁdent that he was going to be famous and promising his mother and sister great deal of ﬁnery their care of him when the day of his fame arrived before he was nine he was nominated colston hospital local school where the bluecoat dress was worn and at which the rs were taught but very little else so that the boy disappointed of the hope of knowledge complained he could work better at home to this period we should probably assign the delightful story of chatterton and friendly potter who promised to give him an earthenware bowl with what inscription he pleased upon writing presumably intended to be his bowl or chatterton said the small boy to the friendly potter angel with wings and trumpet to trum pet my name over the world at ten he was making progress in arithmetic and it should be mentioned that he himself with mechanical pursuits so that if anything was out of order in the hous he was set to mend it at school he read during play hours and made few friends but those were fellows his sister tells us while at home he had appropriated to himself small attic where he would read write and draw number of which are preserved in the british museum knights and churches and heraldic designs in red and yellow ochre charcoal and lead in this attic too he had at what date is number of writings on parchment which had rather singular history in the muniment room of mary redclif fe the church in which chatterton ancesto rs had served sextons there were six or seven great oak chests of which one greater than the others and secured by fewer than six locks was traditionally called cofre after william canynge the younger with whose name the erection and completion of mary were especially associated these had contained deeds and papers dealing with parochial matte rs and the affairs of the church but some years before chatterton birth the vestry had determ ined to examine these documents some of which may have been old the building itself the keys had in the course of time been lost and the vestrymen accordingly broke open the chests and removed to another place what they thought of value leaving canynge coffer and its fellows gutted and open but by means void of all their ancient contents such parchments remained chatterton father carrie d away whole armfuls at time using some to cover his scholars books and giving others to his wife who made them into and dress patterns in the house to which chatterton had moved upon her husband death there was still sufﬁcient number of these old manuscripts to make considerable trove the boy who then nine or ten years old had ﬁrst learnt to read in and was in few years to the project gutenberg ebook of the rowley poems by thomas chatterton https which should pass ﬁfteenth century with many antiqua ries it was doubt on blank pieces of these parchments that he inscribed the matter of the few rowley documents which he ever showed originals we have the account of certain thistlethwaite one of the lads with whom chatterton had made friends at school that his friend thomas in the summer of 1764 told him was in possession of some old mss which had been found deposited in chest in redclif fe church and that he had lent some or one of them to thomas usher at colston an earnest and thoughtful man fond of poetry and great friend of chatterton day or two after this thistlethwaite wrote to dean milles i saw phillips who produced on parchment or vellu m which i am conﬁdent was elenoure and juga 1 kind of pastoral eclogue afterwards published in the town and country magazine may the parchment or vellu m appeared to have been closely pared round the margin what purpose or by what accident i know not the writing was yellow and pale manifestly i conceive occasioned by age this was the beginning of the rowley might be metaphorically described motley ediﬁce half castle and half cathedral to which chatterton all his life was continually adding columns and buttresses domes and spires pediments and minarets in the shape of more poems by thomas rowley secular priest of john bristol or by his patron the muniﬁcent william canynge many times mayor of the same city or by sir thibbot gorges knight of ancient family with literary tastes or by good bishop carpenter of worcester or john iscam canon of august ine abbey also in bristol together with plays or portions of plays which they saxon epic of songs and friendly letters in rhyme or prose in short this clever imaginative lad had evolved before he was sixteen such mass of literary and matter of one kind or another that his ﬁctitious circle of men of taste and learning living in the dark and unenlightened age of lydgate and the other tedious may with study become extraordinarily familiar and near to us and was certainly to chatterton himse lf quite real and vivid the dull actualities of colston hospital and the bristol of his proper century chatterton own circle of acquaintance was far less brilliant his principal patrons were henry burgum and geor ge catcott pair of pewterers the former vulgar and uneducated but very ambitious to be thought man of good birth and education the latter credulous selﬁsh and none too scrupulous fellow antiquary of whom there is the most delightfully absurd description in boswell johnson the biographer relates that in the year 1776 johnson and he were on visit to bristol and were induced by catcott to climb the steep ﬂight of stairs which led to the muniment room in order to see the famous cofre whereupon when the ascent had been accomplished catcott out with triumphant air of lively simplicity i make johnson convert to the view then still largely obtaining that rowley poems were written in the ﬁfteenth century and he pointed to the wondrous chest there said he bouncing conﬁdent credulity there is the very chest itself after which demonstration boswell remarks was more to be said it was to such men these that chatterton read his poems another of his audience was barrett surgeon who collected materi als history of bristol which when published after the death was found to contain contributions supplied by chatterton in the unmistakable and unique evidence about old bristol miraculously preserved in rowley the project gutenberg ebook of the rowley poems by thomas chatterton https hear also of michael clayﬁeld distiller one of the very few men in bristol whom chatterton admired and respected of baker the poet bedfellow at colston whom chatterton wrote love poems cyrano bergerac did christian neuvillette to the address of certain miss conventional silly stuff but roxane was probably not very critical of catcott brother the rev catcott who had ﬁne library and was the author of treatise on the deluge of smith schoolfellow of palmer an engraver and number of names the most part baker thistlethwaite and few more were contemporaries of the poet but the rest of the circle consisted mainly of men who had reached middle perhaps who condescended to clever adolescence whom chatterton certainly mocked bitterly enough in satires which he wrote apparently his own private satisfaction but whom he nevertheless took considerable pains to conciliate being men of substance who could lend books and now and then reward the muse with ﬁve shillings burgum the poet invented and pretended to derive from numerous authorities some of which are wholly imaginary magniﬁcent pedigree showing him descended from simon seyncte lyse alias senliz earl of northampton who had come over with the conqueror to this he appended portion of poem not included in this edition entitled the of the cnyghte composed by john bergham about it was some years before burgum applied to the college of heralds to have his pedigree ratiﬁed but when he did so he was informed that there had never been ber gham entitled to bear arms with second instalment of the genealogical table were copies of the poems called the tournament and the gouler usurer requiem which are printed in this volume burgum was completely taken in and exulting in his dignity acknowledged the announcement of his splendid birth with present of ﬁve shillings it is worthy of notice that the pedigree made mention of certain radclif fe chatterton chatterton but burgum suspicions were not aroused by the circumstance in july 1765 that is to say when the boy was aged about 13 the authorities of colston hospital apprenticed him to john lambert bristol attorney he had chosen the calling himself but it was not long before the life became intolerable to him it was arranged that he should board with lambert and the attorney made him share bedroom with the and eat his meals in the kitchen further though his sister has recorded that the work was light the practice being inconsiderable lambert always tore up any writing of chatterton that he could ﬁnd if it did not relate to his business stuff he would say nevertheless he admitted that his apprentice was always to be found at his desk he often sent the footman in to see and doubt on some of these occasions chatterton was copying the legal precedents of which 370 folio pages neatly written in handwriting remain to this day evidence of legitimate industry at other times he was certainly composing poems by rowley perhaps at this point it would be well to give some account of chatterton method in the production of ancient writings first it seems he wrote the matter in the ordinary english of his day then he would with the help of an and dictionary which he had laboriously compiled himself out of the vocabulary to speght chaucer bailey universal etymological dictionary and kersey dictionarium translate the work into what he probably thought was very fair imitation of ﬁfteenth century language his spelling professor skeat characterizes debased kind which prevails in chevy chase and the battle of otterbourn in percy reliques only little more disguised the project gutenberg ebook of the rowley poems by thomas chatterton https reliques were not published till 1765 but it is natural to suppose that chatterton when he was squandering all he got on books and learning and the lord knows what and thereby involving himself in some little debt would have bought the volume very soon after its publication finally to the production of original we have two accounts one of which represents the rubbing parchment upon dirty ﬂoor after smearing it with ochre and saying was the way to antiquate it the other even more explicit is the testimony of local chemist one rudhall who was some time close friend of chatterton the incident in which rudhall appears is worth relating at length in the month of september 1768 an event of some importance occurred at new bridge that had been built across the avon to supersede structure dating from the reign of the second henry being formally thrown open trafﬁc at the time when this was the general talk of the city chatterton had left with the editor of felix farley bristol journal description of the passing over the old bridge taken from an ancient manuscript this account was in the best rowleian manner with strange spelling and uncouth words but the most part quite intelligible to the ordinary reader the editor accordingly published it payment being asked and great curiosity was aroused in consequence where had this most interesting document come from were there others like it the bristol antiq uaries rather large body were all agog with excitement ultimately they discovered that the unknown contributor of whom the editor could say nothing more than that his was subscribed dunclinus bristoliensis was thomas chatterton the attorney apprentice now the amazing credulity of these learned people is one of the least comprehensible circumstances of our poet strange life on being asked how he had come by his mss he refused at ﬁrst to give any answer then he said he was employed to transcribe some old writings by gentleman whom he had supplied with poetry to send to lady the gentleman was in love excuse being suggested doubt by the case of miss hoyland and his friend baker finally when we can only conclude this explanation was disproved or disbelieved he announced that the account was copied from manuscript his father had taken from rowley chest and this explanation was considered perfectly satisfactory yet it seemed obvious that the antiquaries would demand to see the manuscript and chatterton contrary to his usual practice of secrecy called upon his friend rudhall and having made him promise to tell nothing of what he should show him took piece of parchment the size of half sheet of foolscap paper wrote on it in character which the other did not understand it was unlike english and ﬁnally held what he had written over candle to give it the of antiquity which it did by changing the colour of the ink and making the parchment appear and little contracted rudhall who kept his secret till 1779 when he bartered it to be given to the poet mother at that time in great poverty believed that one was shown or asked to see this document why it is impossible to say the present volume contains reproduction 2 in black and white of the original of chatterton of canynges feast this was written in red ink the parchment is stained with brown except one corner and the ﬁrst line written in legal texting hand the ageing of his manuscript of the vita burtoni to take further instance was effected by smearing the middle of it with glue or varnish this document was also written partly in an attorney regular engrossing 3 hand during the next four years chatterton the project gutenberg ebook of the rowley poems by thomas chatterton https quantity of ancient documents including ælla tragycal enterlude the ﬁnest of the longer rowleian songe to ælla and the bristowe tragedy the authorship of which last he appears in an unguarded moment to have acknowledged to his mother he told her also that he had himself written one of the two poems onn oure ladies chyr one chatterton could not remember 4 but if it was the ﬁrst of the two printed in this edition 275 it was strange coincidence indeed that led him to repudiate the antiquity of the only two rowley poems which are really at all like fessor skeat convenient expression the two battles of hastings were written during this period and it appears that barrett the surgeon on being shown the ﬁrst poem was once very insistent in asking the original whereupon chatterton in momentary panic confessed he had written the verses friend but he had at home he said the copy of what was really the translation of turgot urgot was saxon monk of the tenth rowley the secular priest of the ﬁfteenth this was the second battle of hastings printed in this book again this strange explanation so laboured and so patently disingenuous was accepted without comment though probably not believed and if it appears matter surprise that there should ever have been any controversy about the authorship of the rowley writings in view of the lad admission that he had written three such signal pieces the bristowe tragedy the ﬁrst battle of hastings and onn oure ladies chyr che it must be considered that the production of the greater part of the poems by poorly educated boy not turned seventeen would naturally appear circumstance more surprising than that such boy should tell lie and claim some of them his own with his acknowledged work with rowley chatterton by dint of continued application was making good progress in 1769 he had become frequent contributor to the town and country magazine to which he sent articles on heraldry imitations of ossian whom he very much admired and various other paper s and in december of this year he wrote to dodsley the publisher acquainting him that he could copies of several ancient poems and an interlude perhaps the oldest dramatic piece extant wrote by one rowley priest in bristol who lived in the reign of henry the sixth and edward the fourth if these pieces would be of any service to dodsley copies should be sent the publisher returned answer chatterton waited two mont hs then wrote again and enclosed specimen passage from ælla he could procure copy of this work he wrote upon payment of guinea to the present owner of the again dodsley lay low and said nothing and so the incident closed dodsley having failed him chatterton next took the bolder step of writing to horace walpole who must have been much in his mind some years before his sending the letter some one has made the ingenious suggestion that consideration of walpole delicate connoisseurship sensibly coloured chatterton account of the life of mastre william canynge more than this his delight in the his content with what may be termed purely impressionistic view of the past was singularly akin to the bristol poet own outlook on these matters walpole had further some three years before this time indulged in the very harmless literary fraud of publis hing his castle of otranto translation from mediæval italian only confessing his own authorship upon the publication of the second edition to walpole then chatterton addressed short letter enclosing some verses by john iscam and manuscript on the ryse of peyncteyning yn englande wroten by rowleie 1469 mastr canynge 5 with the suggestion that it might be of service to walpole the project gutenberg ebook of the rowley poems by thomas chatterton https edition of his truly entertaining anecdotes of painting this drew from the connoisseur one of the politest letters 6 that have been written in english in which the simple and elegant sentences expressed with very charming courtesy the interest and curiosity of its author he gave his correspondent thousand thanks would not be sorry to print at his private press of rowley poems and reads strangely in the light of what i would by means borrow and detain your now chatterton peyncteyning yn englande is the clumsiest fraud of all the rowley compositions with the single exception of letter from the secular priest which exhibits the exact style and language of foe robinson crusoe 7 professor skeat has pointed out that the words which occur with tolerable frequency in the ryse begin almost without exception with the letter and concludes that chatterton had read in an old english glossary probably somners farther than ah walpole however not the happiness of understanding the saxon language and it was not until after he had received second letter from chatterton enclosing more rowleian matter both prose and verse that he consulted his friends gray and mason who at once detected the forgery if seems certain elinour and juga was among the pieces sent it was inevitable that gray should recognize lines of that poem striking if unconscious reminiscence of his own elegy in country chur chyar now walpole had some years before introduced ossian poems to the world and his reputation critic had suffered when their authenticity was generally disputed accordingly he wrote chatterton stiff letter suggesting that he should have made fortune he might unbend himself with the studies consonant to his inclination and in this one must suppose that he was actuated by very natural irritation at having been duped second time by an expositor of antique poetry rather than by any snobbish contempt his correspondent who had frankly confessed himself an attorney apprentice chatterton then wrote twice to have his returned asserting at the same time his conﬁdence in the authenticity of the rowley documents walpole some reason returned answer to either application but left paris where he stayed six weeks returning to ﬁnd another letter from chatterton written with considerable dignity and last formal demand to have his manuscript returned whereupon amazed at the boy impertinence the great man snapped up both letters and poems and returned them in blank is to say without word of apology or explanation he might have acted otherwise if he had been more generous spirit but an attempt had been made to impose upon him which had in part succeeded and he can hardl y be blamed showing his resentment by neglecting to return the forgeries one may notice in passing that when chatterton more than year later committed suicide there were not wanting great many persons absurd enough to accuse walpole of having driven him to his contemptible suggestion yet the connoisseur credit certainly suffers from the fact that he gave currency to false account of the transaction in the hope of concealing his ﬁrst credulity 8 we now come to the circumstance which procured chatterton release from his irksome threat of suicide he had often been heard to speak approvingly of suicide and there is story which has however little authority that once in company of friends he drew pistol from his pocket put it to his head and exclaimed if one had but the courage to pull the trigger this not in fact very well the gloomy depression of spirit which alternated with those outbursts of feverish energy in which his poems were composed and he had much to make him miserable when with change of mood he lost his buoyancy and conﬁdence of ultimate fame and success his ambition was boundless and his audience was limited in numbers in understanding he was proud the the project gutenberg ebook of the rowley poems by thomas chatterton https who on bitter day rejected the friendly offer of cloak with the words gentleman does not feel the cold and his pride was continually fretted he was keenly conscious of the indignity of his position in lambert kitchen he seems to have been pressed money and though he not owe ﬁve pounds altogether he probably smarted under the thought that all his hard work all the long nights of study and composition in the moonlight which helped his thought could not earn him even this comparatively small sum again he was not restrained from contemplation of suicide by any scruples of he has left his views expressed in an article written some few days before his death he believed in daemon or conscience which prompted every man to follow good and avoid evil ferent men different held justiﬁed when life became intolerable with him therefore it would be crime wilson suggests too that the boy who had read theology orthodox and the reverse held to the common eighteenth century view that death was annihilation and this may well have been the case one thing at any rate is certain that chatterton on the 14th of april 1770 left on his desk number of pieces of paper ﬁlled with jumble of satiric verse mocking prose and directions the construction of mediæval tomb to cover the remains of his father and himself part of this strange document was headed in legal is the last will and testament of thomas chatterton and contained the declaration that the testator would be dead on the evening of the following the feast of the resurrection the bundle was dated and endorsed this wrote between 11 and 2 saturday in the utmost distress of mind now while one need not doubt that the distress was perfectly genuine it is tolerably certain that chatterton intended his master to ﬁnd what he had written and draw his own conclusions to the desirability of dismissing his apprentice the attorney who is represented timid irritable and 9 did in fact ﬁnd the document was thoroughly frightened and gave the boy his release he was now free to starve or earn living by his doubt he represented the alternative to his mother he must go to london where he would certainly make his fortune he had been supplying four or ﬁve london journals of good standing with free contributions some time past and had received it appears great encouragement from their editors he gained his point and started out the great city his letters show that he called upon four editors the very day he arrived these were edmunds of the middlesex journal fell of the freeholders magazine hamilton of the town and country magazine and same to whom he had sent portion of ælla the annual register he had received he wrote encouragement from them all approved of his design he should soon be settled fell told him later that the great and notorious wilkes that his writings could not be the work of youth and expressed desire to know the author this may or may not have been true but it is certain that fell was not the only newspaper proprietor who was ready to exchange little cheap ﬂattery articles by chatterton that would never be paid 10 we know very little about chatterton life in that little presents some extraordinarily vivid pictures he lodged at ﬁrst with an aunt ballance in shoreditch where he refused to allow his room to be swept he said hated brooms he objected to being called tommy and asked his aunt she had ever heard of poet being called tommy you see he was still boy she assured him that she knew nothing about poets and only wished he would not set up being gentleman he had the appearance of being much older than he was though one who knew him when he was at colston hospital described him the project gutenberg ebook of the rowley poems by thomas chatterton https light curly hair and face round an apple his eyes were grey and sparkled when he was interested or moved he was much admirably express ive phrase he had the same ﬁts of absentmindedness which characterized him child would often look stedfastly in person face without speaking or seeming to see the person quarter of an hour or more till it was quite frightful we have accounts of his sitting up writing nearly the whole of the night and his cousin was almost afraid to share room with him to be sure he was spirit and never slept 1 1 he wrote political letters in the style of signing them decimus or probus kind of vague libellous ranting which will always serve to voice the discontent of the inarticulate he wrote antiquarian or burlesque he furbished up his old satires on the worthies of bristol he wrote songs and comic opera and was miserabl y paid when he was paid at all none of his work written in these veins has any value literature but the skill with which this mere lad not eighteen years old gauged the taste of the town and imitated all branches of popular literature would probably have parallel in the history of journalism should such history ever come to be written his letters to his mother and sister were always gay and contained glowing accounts of his progress but in reality he must have been miserably poor and in july he changed his lodgings to the house of angel sacque maker in brook street holborn the dead season of august was coming on and probably he wanted to conceal his growing embarrassment from his aunt who might have sent word of it to his mother at bristol his opera was is spirited and well written this he was paid ﬁve pounds which enabled him to send box of presents to his mother and sister bought with money he had earned he had dreamed of this since he was eight but his balade of charitie the most ﬁnished of all the rowley refused by the town and country magazine about month before the end which came on august 24th he was starving and still too proud to accept the invitations of his landlady and of friendly chemist to take various meals with them he was offended at the good landlady suggestion that he should dine with her expressions seemed to hint to hint he was in cloak thomas chatterton he could have borrowed money and gone back to bristol but there are many precedents beaten generalissimos falling on their swords rather than return home defeated and disgraced how could he return he had set out so conﬁdently had boasted not little of his powers and had satirized all the good people in bristol haut en bas think of the jokes and commiserations of burgum catcott and the rest here you are again boy but of course we knew it would come to this he could not endure to hear that accordingly on friday the 24th august 1770 he tore up his manuscripts locked his door and poisoned himself with arsenic southey byron and others have supposed that chatterton was mad it has been suggested that he was the victim of suicidal mania all the evidence that there is goes to show that he was not he was very shrewd and practical all his imaginative dreaming of past and this at least may be said that chatterton suicide was the logical end to very remarkably consistent the project gutenberg ebook of the rowley poems by thomas chatterton https character has suffered good deal from three accusations vehemently urged by maitland and his predecessors the ﬁrst is that the boy was the second that he was freethinker the third that he was to examine these in turn the ﬁrst admi ts of denial question of fact but justiﬁcation may be pleaded which some will accept complete exculpation and others perhaps will hardly comprehend chatterton could only produce poetry in his vein his imagination failed him in modern english one who has any appreciation of rowley poems will consider that the african eclogues are moment comparable with them if he was to write at all he must produce antiques and it happened interest had been aroused in ancient poetry largely by the publication of percy reliques and of the spurious ossian appearing at this juncture then ancient writings taken from an old chest his poems would be read and their value appreciated while one would trouble to make out the professed by any means easy an attorney apprentice probably if an adequate audience had been secured in his lifetime chatterton would have revealed the secret when it had served its walpole confessed to the authorship of otranto only when that book had run into second edition to the second count of the indictment defence is urged chatterton was too honest and too intelligent to accept traditional dogmatics without examination finally he was in the sense in which that objectionable expression is used rather he was an ascetic who studied and wrote poetry half through the night who ate little he slept and would make his dinner off tart and glass of water he was devoted to his mother and sister and to his poetry and what spare time was not occupied with the latter he seems to have spent largely with the former the attempt to represent him sort of provincial don in the precocious licence of few of his acknowledged writings he has even given it some colour himse can not be reconciled with the recorded facts of his life equally ill judged is that picture which is presented by professor masson and other writers less truant schoolboy pathetic ﬁgure who had petulantly cast away from

method of antiquating something has already been said he made himself an antique lexicon out of the glossary to speght chaucer and such words were marked with capital standing in the dictionaries of kersey and bailey now even had his authorities been well informed which they were not by any means and had chatterton never misread or misunderstood them which he very frequent ly did it was impossible that his work should have been anything better than mosaic of curious old words of every period and any dialect old english middle english and elizabethan english south of england or scots phras es taken from the border were grist rowley mill it is only fair to say that he seldom invented word outright but he altered and modiﬁed with free hand professor skeat indeed estimates that of the words contained in milles glossary to the rowley poems only seven percent are genuine old words correctly used the professor in his modernized edition is continually pointing out with kindly reluctance that such and such word never bore the meaning ascribed to because instance bailey had explained teres major smooth muscle of the arm it was not the project gutenberg ebook of the rowley poems by thomas chatterton https legitimate inference of chatterton that tere singular form meant muscle and could be translated only occasionally does one ﬁnd the note written with an obviously sincere pleasure word is correctly used of course it was impossible that chatterton should have produced even colourable imitation of poetry at time when even malone all his acknowledged reputation an english not quote chaucer so to make his lines scan the rowley poems and percy reliques mark the beginning of that renascence of our older poetry so conspicuous in the time of lamb and hazl itt before this epoch was the augustan age much too well satisﬁed with its own literature to concern itself with an unfashionable past but after all however absurd from any historical point of view the language and metres of the may be at least he invented practicable language which admirably conveyed his impression of the latest period of the middle which began with the death of chaucer chatterton poetry is pageant staged by an impressionist it can not be submitted to close examination and it is all wrong historically yet it presents complete picture with an artistic charm that must be judged on its own merits an illusion is successfully conveyed of dim remote age when an people lived only to be picturesque to kill one another in tourneys to rear with painful labour beautiful elaborate cathedrals and yet had so much time on their hands that they could pass half their lives cracking unhallo wed sconces in the holy land and in that part of their ample leisure which they devoted to study spell but if any one still anxious literal truth should not the impression false the medium that conveys it were the middle ages really like that is it not fact that the average baron stayed at home in his castle devising abomina ble schemes to wring money or its equivalent from miserable and peasants one can only be answered with another question pierrot like man and has it been put beyond question that

is worth anybody while to read to begin with there are all the volumes and pamphlets concerning themselves with the question whether the rowley poems were written by chatterton or by rowley or by both chatterton adding matter of his own to existing poems written in the ﬁfteenth century or by neither it may be said that these problems were not conclusively and ﬁnally solved till professor skeat

compilatio n of all previous accounts very well digested and arranged moreover the professor has the most part left the facts to tell their own story and thus his book is free from such absurdit ies

this collection have some time excited much curiosity the supposed productions of thomas rowley priest of bristol in the reigns of henry vi and edward iv they are here faithfully printed from the most authentic mss that could be procured of which particular description is given in the introductory account of the several pieces contained in this volume subjoined to this preface nothing more therefore seems necessary at present than to inform the reader shortly of the manner in which these poems were ﬁrst brought to light and of the authority upon which they are ascribed to the persons whose names they bear this can not be done so satisfactorily in the words of geor ge catcott of bristol to whose very laudable zeal the publick is indebted the most considerab le part of the following collection his account of the matter is this the ﬁrst discovery of certain mss having been deposited in redclift church above three centuries ago was made in the year 1768 at the time of opening the new bridge at bristol and was owing to publication in farley weekly journal 1 october 1768 containing an account of the ceremonies observed at the opening of the old bridge taken it was said from very antient this excited the curiosity of some persons to enquire after the original the printer farley could give account of it or of the person who brought the copy but after much enquiry it was discovered that the person who brought the copy was youth between 15 and 16 years of age whose name was thomas chatterton and whose family had been sextons of redclift church near 150 years his father who was now dead had also been master of the in the young man was at ﬁrst very unwilling to discover from whence he had the original but after many promises made to him he was at last prevailed on to acknowledge that he had received this together with many other mss from his father who had found them in large chest in an upper room over the chapel on the north side of redclift church soon after this catcott commenced his acquaintance with young chatterton 1 and partly presents partly purchases procured from him copies of many of his mss in in prose and verse other copies were disposed of in the same way to william barrett an eminent surgeon at bristol who has long been engaged in writing the history of that city barrett also procured from him several fragments some of considerable length written upon vellum 2 which he asserted to be part of his original mss in short in the space of about eighteen months from october 1768 to april 1770 besides the poems now published he produced many compositions in prose and verse under the names of rowley canynge would nearly ﬁll such another volume in april 1770 chatterton went to london and died there in the august following so that the whole history of this very extraordinary transaction can not now probably be known with any certainty whatever may have been his part in it whether he was the author or only the copier he constantly asserted of all these productions he appears to have kept the secret entirely to himself and not to have put it in the power of any other person to bear certain testimony either to his fraud or to his veracity the project gutenberg ebook of the rowley poems by thomas chatterton https question therefore concerning the authenticity of these poems must now be decided by an examination of the fragments upon vellum which barrett received from chatterton part of his original and by the internal evidence which the several pieces afford if the fragments shall be judged to be genuine it will still remain to be determined how far their genuineness should serve to authenticate the rest of the collection of which copies older than those made by chatterton have ever been produced on the other hand if the writing of the fragments shall be judged to be counterfeit and forged by chatterton it will not of necessity follow that the matter of them was also forged by him and still less that all the other compositions which he professed to have copied from antient were merely inventions of his own in either case the decision must ﬁnally depend upon the internal evidence it may be expected perhaps that the editor should give an opinion upon this important question but he rather chooses many reasons to leave it to the determination of the unprejudiced and intelligent reader he had long been desirous that these poems should be printed and therefore readily undertook the charge of superintending the edition this he has executed in the manner which seemed to him best suited to such publication and here he means that his task should end whether the poems be really antient or modern the compositions of rowley or the forgerie s of chatterton they must always be considered most singular literary curiosity footnote 1 the history of this youth is so intimately connected with that of the poems now published that the reader can not be too early apprized of the principal circumstances of his short life he was born on the 20th of november 1752 and educated at on augustin back where nothing more was taught than reading writing and accounts at the age of fourteen he was articled clerk to an attorney with whom he continued till he left bristol in april though his education was thus conﬁned he discovered an early turn towards poetry and english antiquities particularly heraldry how soon he began to be an author is not known in the town and country magazine march 1769 are two letters probably from him they are dated at bristol and subscribed with his usual signature the ﬁrst contains short extracts from two written three hundr ed years ago by one rowley monk concerning dress in the age of henry ii the other ethelgar saxon poem in bombast prose in the same magazine may 1769 are three communications from bristol with the same signature viz cerdick translated from the saxon in the same style with ethelgar observations upon saxon heraldry with drawings of saxon atchievements and juga written three hundr ed years ago by rowley secular priest this last poem is reprinted in this volume in the subsequent months of 1769 and 1770 there are several other pieces in the same magazine which are undoubtedly of his composition in april 1770 he left bristol and came to london in hopes of advancing his fortune by his talents writing of which by this time he had conceived very high opinion in the prosecution of this scheme he appears to have almost entirely depended upon the patronage of set of gentlemen whom an eminent author long ago pointed out not the very worst judges or rewar ders of merit the booksellers of this great city at his ﬁrst arrival indeed he was so unlucky to ﬁnd two of his expected mæcenases the one in the king bench and the the project gutenberg ebook of the rowley poems by thomas chatterton https newgate but this little disappointment was alleviated by the encouragement which he received from other quarters and on the 14th of may he writes to his mother in high spirits upon the change in his situation with the following sarcastic reﬂection upon his former patrons at bristol to they rate literary lumber so low that i believe an author in their estimation must be poor indeed but here matters are otherwise had rowley been londoner instead of bristowyan i could have lived by copying his works in letter to his sister dated 30 may he informs her that he is to be employed in writing voluminous history of london to appear in numbers the beginning of next winter in the mean time he had written something in praise of the lord mayor

virgil appendix when these poems were ﬁrst printed it was thought best to leave the question of their authenticity to the determination of the impartial public the editor contented himself with intimating his opinion pref xii xiii that the external evidence on both sides was so defective to deserve but little attention and that the ﬁnal decision of the question must depend upon the internal evidence to shew that this opinion was not thrown out in order to mislead the enquiries and judgements of the readers i have here drawn together some observations upon the language 1 of the poems attributed to rowley which i think will be sufﬁcient to prove 1st that they were not written in the xv century and 2dly that they were written entirely by thomas chatterton the proof of the second proposition would in effect carry with it that of the ﬁrst but notwithstanding i choose to treat them separately and to begin with the the project gutenberg ebook of the rowley poems by thomas chatterton https shall premise only one postulatum which is that poets of the same age and country use the same language allowances being made certain varieties which may arise from the local situation the rank in life the learning the affectation of the writers and from the different subjects and forms of their compositions 2 this being granted i have nothing to but to prove that the language of the poems attributed to rowley when every proper allowance has been made is totally different from that of the other english writers of the xv century in many material particulars it would be too tedious to go through them all and therefore i shall only take notice of such can be referred to three general heads the ﬁrst consisting of words not used by any other writer the second of words used by other writers but in different sense and the third of words inﬂected in manner contrary to grammar and custom under the ﬁrst head i would recommend the following words to the reader

the same writer at any time should use heie and theie indifferently in these poems thyssen ii lette thyssen menne who haveth sprite of love i can not believe that thyssen was ever in use the plural

taken notice of below many other instances of the most unwarrantable anomalies might be produce d under this head but i think i have said enough to prove that the language of these poems is totally different from that of the other english writers of the xv century and consequ ently that they were not written in that century which was my ﬁrst proposition i shall now endeavour to prove from the same internal evidenc of the language that they were written entirely by thomas chatterton this purpose it will only be necessary to have recourse to those interpretations of words by way of glossary which were confessedly written by him 4 it will soon appear if i am not much mistaken that the author of the glossary was the author of the poems whoever will take the pains to examine these interpretations will ﬁnd that they are almost all taken from skinner etymologicon linguæ anglicanæ 5 in many cases where the words are really ancient the interpretations are perfectly right and so far chatterton can only be considered in the light of commentator who avails himself of the best assistances to explane any genuine author but in many other instances where the words are either not ancient or not used in their ancient sense the interpretations are totally unfounded and fantastical and at the same time the words can not be altered or amended consis tently with any rules of criticism nor can the interpretations be varied without destroying the sense of the passage in these cases i think there is just ground believing that the words well their interpretations came from the hand of chatterton especially they may be proved very often to have taken their rise either from blunders of skinner himself or from such mistakes and misapprehensions of his meaning chatterton from haste and ignorance was very likely to fall into i will state ﬁrst some instances of words and interpretations which have evidently been derived from blunders of skinner all boon iii see before

probable that the author of the poems was misled by him than that really ancient writer mould have been guilty of so egregious blunder aumeres iii is explained by chatterton to mean borders of gold and silver and aumere in æ 398 and ch seems to be used in the same sense of border of garment and so skinner has by mistake explain ed the word in that passage of chaucer which has been mentioned

without pretending to determine the precise meaning of bawsin i think i may venture to say that there is older or better authority rendering it large than skinner exp magnus grandis brondeous ii furious chatterton bronded 2 brondeynge æ burlie bronde fury anger chatterton see also 2 all these uses of bronde and its supposed derivatives are taken from skinner bronde exp furia though in another place he explains burly brand i believe rightly to mean magnus ensis it should be observed that the phrase burly brand if used in its true sense would still have been liable to suspicion it does not appear in any work that i am acquainted with prior to the testament of creseide scottish composition written many years after the time of the supposed rowley burled armed chatterton so skinner burled exp armatus bysmare bewilder ed curious chatterton bysmarelie le curiously chatterton see also ver bismarde it is evident i think that all these words are originally derived from skinner who has very absurdly explained bismare to mean curiosity the true meaning has been stated above calke cast chatterton calked i cast out ejected chatterton this word appears to have been formed upon misapprehension of the following article in skinner calked exp cast credo cast up chatterton did not attend to the difference between casting out and casting up casting up ﬁgures in calculation that the latter was skinner meaning may be collected from his next article calked calculated ch the frankeleynes tale it the project gutenberg ebook of the rowley poems by thomas chatterton https too i think that in both articles skinner refers by mistake to line of the frankelein tale which in the common editions stands thus ful subtelly he had calked al this where calked is mere misprint calculed the reading of the mss see the late edit ver it would be easy to add many more instances of words either not ancient or not used in their ancient sense which repeatedly occur in these poems and must be construed according to those fanciful signiﬁcations which skinner has ascribed to them how that should have happened unless either skinner had read the poems which i presume nobody can suppose or the author of the poems had read skinner i can not see it is against all odds that two men living at the distance of two hundred years one from the other should accidentally agree in coining the same words and in afﬁxing to them exactly the same meaning i proceed to state some instances of words and interpretations which are evidently founded upon misapprehensions of passages in skinner alyse le allow chatterton see before till i meet with this word in this sense in some approved author i shall be of opinion that it has been formed from mistaken reading of the following article in skinner alised authori dict angl apud folum occurrit exp allowed ab alised in the gothic types used by skinner f might be easily mistaken long best oiker æ deceiver chatterton see also æ this word also seems plainly to have originated from mistake in reading skinner bestwike ab berpican spican deciper fallere prodere spica proditor deceptor chatterton in his hurry read this bestoike and formed noun from it accordingly blake æ 178 naked chatterton blakied iii naked original chatterton see before skinner has the following article blake and bare videtur ex contextu prorsus nuda sort bleak and bare dum enim nudi fumus eóque aeri expositi præ frigore pallescimus ch sol col i chatterton has caught hold of nuda which in skinner is the exposition of bare if it belonged to blake hancelled cut off destr oyed chatterton hancelled from erthe these normanne hyndes shalle bee skinner has the same word which he thus explains hanceled exp cut off credo dici proprie vel primario faltem tantum prima portione feu segmento quod ad tentandam feu explorandam rem abscindimus ut ubi dicimus to hansell pasty or gammon of bacon chatterton who had neither inclination nor perhaps ability to make himself master of so long piece of latin appears to have looked further than the two english words at the the project gutenberg ebook of the rowley poems by thomas chatterton https this explanation and understanding cut off to mean destr oyed he has used hancelled in the same sense shap æ fate chatterton æ ged chatterton shap haveth nowe ymade hys woes to emmate stylle mormorynge atte yer shap there ys ne house athrow thys ged isle i never was able to conceive how shap should have been used in the english language to signiﬁe fate till i observed the following article in skinner shap now is my shap nunc mihi fato præstitutum est now is it shapen to ab sceapan i suppose that the word fato in the latin led chatterton to understand now is my shap to mean now is my fate the passage to which skinner refers is in the knight tale of chaucer ver now is shape eternally to dwelle not only in pur gatorie but in helle but in the edit of 1602 which skinner appears to have made use of it is written now is shap the putting of my was probably mistake of the printer skinner explanation shews that he read i fancy the generality of readers will be satisﬁed by the foregoing quotations that the author of these poems had not only read skinner but has also misapprehended and misapplied what he found in him if more instances should be wanted comparison of the words explained by chatterton with the same or similar words explained by skinner will furnish them in abundance 6 i shall therefore conclude this appendix with short view of the preceding argument it has been proved that the poems attributed to rowley were not written in the xv century and it follows of course that they were written at subsequent period by some impostor who endeavoured to counterfeit an author of that century it has been proved that this impostor lived since skinner and that the same person wrote the interpretations of words by way of glossary which are subjoined to most of the poems it has also been proved that chatterton wrote those interpretations of words whether any thing further be necessary to prove that the poems were entirely written by chatterton is left to the reader judgement if he should stick at the word entirely which may possibly seem to carry the conclusion little beyond the premisses he is desired to reﬂect that the poems having been proved to be forgery since the time of skinner and to have been written in great part by chatterton it is inﬁnitely more probable that the remainder was also written by him than by any other perso the great difﬁculty is to conceive that youth like chatterton should ever have formed the plan of such an imposture and should have executed it with so much perseverance and ingenuity but if we allow i think we must that he was the author of those pieces to which he subjoined his interpretations i can see reason whatever supposing that he had any assistance in the rest the internal evidence is strong that they are all from one hand and external evidence there is none that i have been able the project gutenberg ebook of the rowley poems by thomas chatterton https with which ought to persuade us that single line of verse or prose purporting to be the work of rowley existed before the time of cha tter ton footnote 1 i have chosen this part of the internal evidence because the arguments which it furnishes are not only very decisive but also lie within moderate compass the same reason of brevity i have conﬁned my observations to part only of this part viz to words considered with respect to their signiﬁcations and inﬂexions complete examination of this subject in all its parts would be work of length footnote 2 of these varieties all except the ﬁrst are more properly varieties of style than of language the local situation of writer may certainly produce provincial dialect which will often differ essentially from the language used at the same time in other parts of the same country but this can only happen in the case of persons of education and totally illiterate and such persons seldom write it is unnecessary however to discuss this point very accurately nobody i believe will contend that the poems attributed to rowley are written in any provincial dialect if there should be few words in them which are now more common at bristol than at london it should be remembered that chatterton was of bristol footnote 3 it is not surprizing that chatterton should have been ignorant of peculiarity of the english language which appears to have escaped the observation of professed editor of chaucer urry has very frequently lengthened verbs in the singular number by adding n to them without any authority i am persuaded even from the errors of former editions or mss it might seem invidious to point out living writers of acknowledged learning who have slipped into the same mistake in their imitations of chaucer and spenser footnote 4 this is point so material to the following argument that though it has never hitherto i believe been made question it ought not perhaps to be assumed without some proof it may be said that chatterton was only the transcriber of the glossary well of the poems if to such an attention we were to answer that chatterton always declared himself the author of the glossaries we should be told perhaps that with equal truth he always declared rowley to have been the author of the poems but not to insist upon the very different weight which the same testimony might be allowed to have in the two cases it has happened luckily that the glossary to the poem entitled englysh metamorphosis see p 196 was written down by chatterton extemporally without the assistance of any book at the desire and in the presence of barrett whoever will compare that glossary with the others will have doubt of their being all from the same hand footnote 5 printed at london mdclxxi the part which chatterton seems to have chieﬂy consulted is that which begins at sign u u u u and is entitled etymologicon vocum omnium antiquarum anglicarum quæ usque w ilhelmo v ictore invaluerunt footnote 6 i will state shortly some of those words which have been cited above either not ancient or not used in their ancient sense with their corresponding articles in skinner abessie humility humiliatus sk aborne burnished burnish sk it was usual with chatterton to preﬁx to words of all sorts without any regard the project gutenberg ebook of the rowley poems by thomas chatterton https or propriety see in the alphabetical gloss aboune abreave acome aderne adygne agrame agreme alest abounde this word chatterton has not interpreted but the context shews that it is used in the sense of good so that i suspect it was taken from the following article in skinner abone fr abonnir bonum facere abredynge upbraiding exp upbraid sk acrool faintly exp murmurar sk see the remark upon aborne adente adented fastened annexed conﬁger conjunger sk aluste has interpretation but it is used in the sense of raise perhaps it may have been derived from mistaken reading of alust which is explained by skinner to mean tollere see the remarks upon alyse and bestoiker 328 derne dernie woeful lamentable cruel dirus crudelis sk droorie modesty modestia sk fons fonnes fancys devices devises sk knopped fastened chained congealed tied sk lithie humble humble sk but in truth i not believe that there is any such word skinner probably found it in his edition of chaucer cuckow and nightingale ver where the mss have lither wicked which is undoubtedly the right reading end of the project gutenberg ebook the rowley
