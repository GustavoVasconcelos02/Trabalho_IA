time seemed to stand still universal astonishment and confusion fell upon ﬂock of sheep perplexed by strange dogs but now though never before was lucy day so black with absence darkness death christmas is gone spring comes swiftly the almond trees ﬂourish easter will soon be here life breaks into beauty again and we realize that man may bring hell itself into the world but that nature ever patiently waits to be his natural paradise yet still kind of instinctive blindness blots out the prospect of the future until the long horror of the war is gone from our minds we shall be able to think of nothing that has not its background chaotic darkness like every obsession it gnaws at thought follows us into our dreams and returns with the morning but there have been other wars and humanity after learning best it may their brutal lesson has survived them just the young soldier leaves home behind him and accepts hardship and danger to the manner born so when he returns again life will resume its old quiet wont nature is not idle even in the imagination it is man salvation to forget less than it is his salvation to remember and it is wise even in the midst of the conﬂict to look back on those that are past and to prepare the returning problems of the future when whitman wrote his democratic vistas the long embittered war between the northern and southern states of america was thing only of yesterday it is headlong amorphous tangled meadow of leaves of grass in prose but it is cogent it was when it was written to the ostent of the senses and eyes he writes the influences which stamp the world history are wars uprisings or downfalls of dynasties these of course play their part yet it may be single new thought imagination abstract principle put in shape by some great literatus and projected among mankind may duly cause changes growths removals greater than the longest and bloodiest war or the most stupendous merely political dynastic or commercial overturn the literatus who realized this had his own message in mind and yet justly those who might point to the worldly prosperity and material comforts of his country and ask are not these better indeed than any utterances even of greatest rhapsodic artist or literatus he has his by walt whitman https he surveys the new york of 1870 its façades of marble and iron of original grandeur and elegance of design in his familiar catalogical jargon and shutting his eyes to its glow and grandeur inquires in return are there indeed men here worthy the name are there perfect women is there pervading atmosphere of beautiful manners are there arts worthy freedom and rich people is there great moral and religious only justiﬁcation of great material one we ourselves in good time shall have to face and to answer these questions they search our keenest hopes of the peace that is coming and we may be fortiﬁed perhaps by the following queer proof of history repeating itself never in the old world was thoroughly upholster exterior appearance and show mental and other built entirely on the idea of caste and on the suf ficiency of mere outside were glibness verbal intellect more the test the loftily elevated head and than they are on the surface of our republican states this day the writers of time hint the mottoes of its gods the word of the modern say these voices is the word culture whitman had very tender regard the germany of his time he fancied that the germans were like the chinese only less graceful and reﬁned and more brutish but neither had he any particular affection any relic of europe never again will we trust the moral sense or abstract friendliness of single government of the old world he accepted selectio ns from its literature the new american adam but even its greatest poets were not america and though he might welcome even juvenal it was use and not worship we have to learn he insists that the best culture will always be that of the manly and courageous instincts and loving perceptions and of respect in our children rests every hope and promise and therefore in their mothers disengage yourselves from parties these savage and wolﬁsh parties alarm hold yourself judge and master over all of them only faith can save us the faith in ourselves and in our which is of the true faith in goodness and in god the idea of the mass of men so fresh and free so loving and so proud ﬁlled this poet with singular awe passionately he pleads the dignity of the common people it is the average man of land that is important to win the people back to proud belief and conﬁdence in life to rapture in this wonderful world to love and was his burning desire i demand races of orbic bards he rhapsodizes sweet democratic despots to dominate and even destroy the future vistas the throes of birth are upon us allons camarado he could not despair must i indeed learn to chant the cold dirges of the bafﬂed he asks himself in aps but wildest shuttlecock of criticism though he is he has never yet been charged with looking only on the dark side of things once he says once before the war alas i dare not say how many times the mood has come i too was ﬁll with doubt and gloom his part in it soothed mellowed deepened his great nature he had himself witnessed such misery cruelty and abomination it is best just now perhaps not to read about one fact alone is enough that over ﬁfty thousand federal soldiers perished of starvation in southern prisons malarial fever contracted in camps and hospitals had wrecked his health during he visited he says eighty to hundred thousand sick and wounded soldiers comprehending all slighting none rebel or compatriot it made difference i loved the young man he cries again and again pity and fatherliness were in his face his heart was full of them gosse has described the old gray he saw him in 1884 in his bare littered room in camden shared by kitten and canary he sat with very curious pose of the head thrown backward if resting it one vertebra lower down the spinal column than other people and thus tilting his face little upwards with his head so poised and the whole man fixed in contemplation of the interlocutor he seemed to pass into state of absolute passivity the glassy eyes half closed the lar ge knotted hands spread out before him he resembled in fact nothing so much great old grey angora tom alert in repose serenely blinking under his combed waves of hair with eyes inscrutably dreaming i stood in dull deserted mickle street by walt whitman https more my heart was full of af fection this beautiful old man this old rhapsodist in his empty room glorified by patience and philosophy whitman was then in portrait of thirty years before there is just wraith of that feline dream perhaps but it is face of rare grace and beauty that looks out at us of profound kindness and compassion and in the eyes not so much penetration visionary absorption such was the man to whom nothing was unclean nothing too trivial except pale poetlings lisping cadenzas piano who then apparently thronged new york to take to himself intensest indomitablest of individualists he exulted in all that appertains to that forked radish man this contentious soul of mine he exclaims ecstatically viva the attack i have been born the same the war was born i lull nobody and you will never understand maybe i am and i have written impromptu and shall let it all go at that let at least be human human indeed he was tender host of everyman of his idolized if somewhat overpowering american democracy man in the street in his swarms poor crazed faces in the state asylu m prisoners in sing sing prostitute whose dead body reminded him not of lost soul but only of sad forlorn and empty mattered not he opened his heart to them one and all i see beyond each mark that wonder kindred soul the bullet could never kill what you really are dear friend the moon gives you light and the bugles and drums give you music and my heart my soldiers my veterans my heart gives you love yours you he exclaims welding in phrase his unparalleled egotism his beautiful charity yours you who ever you are mine it is the essence of philosophy and of religion all the wonders of heaven and earth are signiﬁcant only because of the in the centre this was the secret of his tender unassuming ministrations he had none of that shrinking timidity that fear of intrusion that uneasiness in the presence of the tragic and the pitiful which so often numb and oppress those who would willingly give themselves and their best to the needy and suffering but whose intellect misgives them he was that formidable phenomenon dreamer of action but he possessed sovran good sense food and rest and clean clothes were his scrupulous preparation his visits he always assumed cheerful an appearance possible armed with bright new and bills the wounded he found were often broke and the sight of little money helped their spirits with books and stationery and tobacco one twist of good strong green tea another good or jar of sparkling but innocent blackberry and cherry syrup small bottle of pickle or large handsome apple he would make friends what i have i also give you he cried from the bottom of his grieved tempestuous heart he would talk or write sit silent in mute and tender kindness long long i gazed leaning my chin in my hands passing sweet hours immortal and mystic hours with you dearest tear not word vigil of silence love and death vigil you my son and my soldier and how many mother must have blessed the stranger who could bring such last news of son this and now like many other noble and good men after serving his country soldier he has yielded up his young life at the very outset in her service such things are there is text doeth all things meaning of which after due time appears to the soul it is only love that can comfort the loving he forced nothing on these friends of day so many of them near their last farewell poor wasted young man asks him to read chapter in the new testament and whitman chooses that which describes christ cruciﬁxion he ask to read the following chapter also how christ rose again i read very slowly he was feeble it pleased him very much yet the tears were in his eyes he ask if i enjoy religion i said not my dear in the way you mean yet maybe it is the same thing this is only one of many such serene intimacies in whitman experiences of the war through them we reach to an understanding of poet who chose not signal and beautiful episodes out of the past nor the rare moments of existence theme but took all life within and around him in vast bustling america his poetic province like benign barbaric sun he surveys the world ever at noon i am the man i suffer i was there he cries in the song of myself i not despise you priests all times the world over he could not despise anything not even his because he himself was everything his verse sometimes seems mere verbiage but it by walt whitman https santa claus bagful of things and he could penetrate to the essenti al reality he tells in his aps how one daybreak he arose in camp and saw three still forms stretched out in the eastern radiance how with light ﬁngers he just lifted the blanket from each cold face in turn the ﬁrst elderly gaunt and are you my dear comrade the next with cheeks yet are you sweet boy the oung man i think i know you i think this face is the face of the christ himself dead and divine and brother of all and here again he lies true poetry focuses experience not merely transmits it it must redeem it ever from transitoriness and evanescence whitm an incontinently pours experience out in cataract but in spite of his habitual publicity he was at heart of shy brooding impassioned devotional type in spite of his arrogant virility he was to the end of his life an entranced child he came into the world saw and babbled his deliberate method of writing could have had other issue subject would occur to him kind of tag he would scribble it down on scrap of paper and drop it into drawer day by day this ﬁrst impulse would evoke fresh poemets until at length the accumulation was exhaustive then he merely gutted his treasury and the ode was complete it was only when sense and feeling attained sort of ecstasy that he succeeded in distilling the true essence that is poetry and in enstopping it in crystal phial of form the prose of his specimen days indeed is often nearer to poetry than his verse much of the time he sleeps or half sleeps i often come and sit by him in perfect silence he will breathe ten minutes softly and evenly young babe asleep poor youth so handsome athletic with profuse beautiful shining hair one time i sat looking at him while he lay asleep he suddenly without the least start awaken open his eyes gave long steady look turning his face very slightly to gaze long clear silent slight turn back and went into his doze again little he knew poor boy the heart of the stranger that hover near the western star venus in the earlier hours of evening has never been so lar ge so clear it seems if it told something if it held rapport indulgent with humanity with us americans the sky dark blue the transparent night the planets the moderate west wind the elastic temperature the miracle of that great star and the young and swelling moon swimming in the west suf fused the soul then i heard slow and clear the deliberate notes of bugle come up out of the silence firm and faithful floating along rising falling leisurely with here and there note sounding tattoo steady rain dark and thick and warm he writes again two days after gettysbur the cavalry camp is ceaseless ﬁeld of observation to this forenoon there stood the horses tether together dripping steaming chewing their hay the men emer ge from their tents dripping also the ﬁres are there is poetic poise in this brief vivid statement apart from its bare economy of means it is the lump await ing the leaven less than is cavalry crossing ford to this supreme spectator an apple orchard in may even the white house in moonlight more and less than these rendered up their dignity life and beauty their true human signiﬁcance but in aps the witness is not always so satisfactory the secret has evaporated in the effort to make poetry or to inject moral to play the universal bard there creeps into the words tinge of the raw and the grotesque the poet has the look of cowboy off the stage tanned with but again and again the secret creeps back and some lovely emanation of poetry is added to it look down fair moon and bathe this scene pour softly down night nimbus floods on faces ghastly swollen purple on the dead on their backs with arms toss wide pour down your unstinted nimbus sacred by walt whitman https this called reconciliation word over all beautiful the sky beautiful that war and all its deeds of carnage must in time be utterly lost that the hands of the sisters death and night incessantly softly wash again and ever again this soil world my enemy is dead man divine myself is dead i look where he lies and still in the cof draw near bend down and touch lightly with my lips the white face in the cof fin the bonds of rhyme shackled him deprived him of more than freedom he is like wild bird that suddenly perceives the bars of its small cage across the blue of the sky and yet the ﬁner his poems are the nearer they approach to deﬁnite rhythmical design one has only to compare captain my captain with hushed be the camps to perceive this curious paradox they are both of them memories of his beloved lincoln whom he had many times seen with that peculiarly close and transatlantic curiosity of his riding at on grey horse with his escort of cavalry behind him through the streets of in black somewhat rusty and dusty with black stiff hat almost ordinary in attire the commonest man that heroic face too he had pierced and caught from it the deep subtle indirect expression that only the master of the old world could have seized and immortalized and in yet another mem ory of this great american whitman attains to his best and highest when lilacs last in the doorway bloom it is one of the most beautiful of poems of the purest intuition of consummate if unconscious artistry whose voice is it that rings and echoes now low and tender now solemn and desolate now clear full victorious out of its cloistral solitude of the mourner himself of heedless nature of the immortal soul of man or just bird the shy and hidden sweet small hermit thrush the last division of his life fond epic his cosmic inventory whitman planned it was to be devoted to the chaunting of songs of death and immortality the soldier to whom he read of christ resurrection talked of death to him and said he did not fear it he talked to man who did not enjoy religion in the way christian means to whom the mystery of easter is an reliance but whitman not only did not fear death the thought of it was to him the strangest of raptures the reverie of child dreaming of distant mother soon to come again death and immortality were but two aspects of the same blessed hope to this man who poured out his life in tur gid fount of ecstatic joy in living and i saw askant the armies i saw in noiseless dreams hundreds of borne through the smoke of the battles and
