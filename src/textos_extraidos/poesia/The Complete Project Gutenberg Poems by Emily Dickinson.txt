verses of emily dickinson belong emphatically to what emerson long since called the poetry of the portfolio produced absolutely without the thought of publication and solely by way of expression of the writer own mind such verse must inevitably forfeit whatever advantage lies in the discipline of public criticism and the enforced conformity to accepted ways on the other hand it may often gain something through the habit of freedom and the unconventional utterance of daring thoughts in the case of the present author there was absolutely choice in the matter she must write thus or not at all recluse by temperament and habit literally spending years without setting her foot beyond the doorstep and many more years during which her walks were strictly limited to her father grounds she habitually concealed her mind like her person from all but very few friends and it was with great difﬁculty that she was persuaded to print during her lifetime three or four poems yet she wrote verses

is published to meet the desire of her personal friends and especially of her surviving sister it is believed that the thoughtful reader will ﬁnd in these pages quality more suggestive of the poetry of william blake than of anything to be elsewhere found of wholly original and profound insight into nature and life words and phrases exhibiting an extraordinary vividness of descriptive and imaginative power yet often set in seemingly whimsical or even rugged frame they are here published they were written with very few and superﬁcial changes although it is fair to say that the titles have been assigned almost invariably by the editors in many cases these verses will seem to the reader like poetry torn up by the roots with rain and dew and earth still clinging to them giving freshness and fragrance not otherwise to be conveyed in other cases in the few poems of shipwreck or of mental conﬂict we can only wonder at the gift of vivid imagination by which this recluse woman can delineate by few touches the very crises of physical or mental struggle and sometimes again we catch glimpses of lyric strain sustained perhaps but line or two at time and making the reader regret its sudden cessation but the main quality of these poems is that of extraordinary grasp and insight uttered with an uneven vigor sometimes exasperating seemingly wayward but really unsought and

once more poems by emil y dickinson second series edited by two of her friends mabel loomis todd and higginson pref ace the eagerness with which the ﬁrst volume of emily dickinson poems has been read shows very clearly that all our alleged modern artiﬁciality does not prevent prompt appreciation of the qualities of directness and simplicity in approaching the greatest themes life and love and death that irresistible one of her best critics has called it piercing at once the very core of thought has found response wide and sympathetic it has been unexpected even to those who knew best her compelling power this second volume while open to the same criticism to form with its predecessor shows also the same shining beauties although emily dickinson had been in the habit of sending occasional poems to friends and correspondents the full extent of her writing was by means imagined by them her friend must at least have suspected it in letter dated 5th september 1884 she wrote my dear friend what portfolios full of verses you must have it is cruel wrong to your day and generation that you will not give them light if such thing should happen that i should outlive you i wish you would make your literary legatee and executor surely after you are what is called dead you will be willing that the poor ghosts you have left behind should be cheered and pleased by your verses will

in little fascicules each of six or eight sheets while many of them bear evidence of having been thrown of f at white heat still more had received thoughtful revision there is the frequent addition of rather perplexing af fording lar ge choice of words and phrases and in the copies which she sent to friends sometimes one form sometimes another is found to have been used without important exception her friends have generously placed at the disposal of the editors any poems they had received from her and these have given the obvious advantage of comparison among several renderings of the same verse to what further rigorous pruning her verses would have been subjected had she published them herself we can not know they should be regarded in many cases merely the ﬁrst strong and suggestive sketches of an artist intended to be embodied at some time in the ﬁnished picture emily dickinson appears to have written her ﬁrst poems in the winter of in letter to one of the present editors the april following she says i made verse but one or two until this winter the handwriting was at ﬁrst somewhat like the delicate running italian hand of our elder gentlewomen but she advanced in breadth of thought it grew bolder and more abrupt until in her latest years each letter stood distinct and separate from its fellows in most of her poems particularly the later ones everything by way of punctuation was discarded except numerous dashes and all important words began with capitals the ef fect of page of her more recent manuscript is exceedingly quaint and strong the simile given in the present volume is from one of the earlier transition periods although there is nowhere date the handwriting makes it possible to arrange the poems with general chronologic accuracy rule the verses were without titles but country burial thunder the and few others were named by their author frequently at the end only in the accompanying note if sent to friend the variation of readings with the fact that she often wrote in pencil and not always clearly have at times thrown good deal of responsibility upon her editors but all interference not absolutely inevitable has been avoided the very roughness of her rendering is part of herself and not lightly to be touched it seems in many cases that she intentionally avoided the smoother and more usual rhymes like impressionist pictures or wagner rugged music the very absence of conventional form challenges attention in emily dickinson exacting hands the especial intrinsic ﬁtness of particular order of words might not be sacriﬁced to anything virtually extrinsic and her verses all show strange cadence of inner rhythmical music lines are always daringly constructed and the appears frequently indeed to an unrecognized sense more elusive than hearing emily dickinson scrutinized everything with clear frankness every subject was proper ground legitimate study even the sombre facts of death and burial and the unknown life beyond she touches these themes sometimes lightly sometimes almost humorously more often with weird and peculiar power but she is never by any chance frivolous or trivial and while one critic has said she may exhibit toward god an emersonian it was because she looked upon all life with candor unprejudiced it is rare she had tried society and the world and found them lacking she was not an invalid and she lived in seclusion from disappointment her life was the normal blossoming of nature introspective to high degree whose best thought could not exist in pretence storm wind the wild march sky sunsets and dawns the birds and bees butterﬂies and ﬂowers of her garden with few trusted human friends were sufﬁcient companionship the coming of the ﬁrst robin was jubilee beyond crowning of monarch
