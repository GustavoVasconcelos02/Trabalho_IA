p age and comp any incorpora ted mdcccxcix colonial pr ess electrotyped and printed by simonds boston pref ace the numerous collections of american verse share i think one fault in common they include too much whether this has been bid popularity concession to philistia i can not say but the fact remains that all anthologies of american poetry are so far i know more or less uncritical the aim of the present book is different in case has poem been included because it is widely known the purpose of this compilation is solely that of preserving in attractive and permanent form about one hundred and ﬁfty of the best lyrics of america i am quite aware of the danger attending such exacting honor at best an editor judgment is only personal and the realization of this fact gives small difﬁdence in attempting to decide what american lyrics are best worthy of preservation that every reader of the american treasury will ﬁnd some favorite poem omitted there can be little doubt but the effort made in this book towards careful estimate of our lyrical poetry is at any rate i feel sure in good direction there appear in the index of stedman poets of america the names of over three hundred native writers american verse in the last half century has been extraordinarily proliﬁc it would seem that the time has come in the course of our national literature proving all things and holding fast that which is good the fact that the title of this compilatio n instantly calls to mind that of palgrave scholarly collection of english lyrics need not prove disadvantage to the book if the purpose which led to the choice of name is understood the verse of single century produced in new country should not be expected to equal the poetic wealth of an old and intellectual nation but if american poetry can not hope to rival the poetry of the mother country it may at least be compared with it and the fact of such comparative point of view will aid rather than hinder the student of our native poetry in estimating its the project gutenberg ebook of the golden treasury of american songs and lyrics edited by frederic lawrence knowles https verse has suffered at the hands both of its admirers and its enemies injudicious praise less than supercilious contempt has reacted unfavorably on the fame of our poets again and again has some minor versiﬁer been hailed the america n keats or the american burns really excellent poets though distinctly poets of second rank have been elevated amid the blare of critical trumpets to the company of wordsworth and milton all this is unproﬁtable and silly but not much better is the attitude of certain critics who patronize everything in the english language which has been written outside of england though america has leaving poe out of distinctly new notes to english poetry it has added certainly not few true ones nation need never apologize its literature when it has produced such go on bust of dante ichabod the chambered nautilus and the w aterfowl my method of arrangement is roughly chronological the first book which is shorter than the others might be called the book of bryant the second of longfellow and the third of aldrich since the periods must of course overlap this division of the poems can be at most only suggestive i have made it part of my design to grant to the better known poets larger number of lyrics than those given later and younger men i have paid regard to that purely conventional idea of proportion that would assign to ﬁve or six writers dozen selections each and to another set of poets in proportion to their popular fame half that number we can safely leave the ﬁnal adjustment of all rival claims to time the best critic in the meanwhile having the more modest aim of selecting irrespective of contemporary judgments whatever is best suited to our purpose word more should be said about the title i have not interpreted the term lyric so rigidly to exclude sonnets ballads elegiac verse or even pieces of almost pure description if i had held to the strictest sense of lyric this book would never have been compiled i suspect nothing will strike the reader more forcibly than the fact that despite the excellence of the poems included there is notable lack of pure singing quality such things pinkney health and holmes old ironsides are the exception the poems are composed cleverly but they not quite sing themselves to their own music the best american verse while not insincere is seldom wholly spontaneous this is not saying that much spontaneous verse has not been written in this country much has been but the singer voice has too often been uncultivated and the product inartistic the names of many popular poets are entirely omitted in case however was this probably due to oversight i have gone over carefully wide ﬁeld of verse not without ﬁnding much to admire but never quite happening upon that ﬁnal touch of successful achievement where art and inspiration join i am especially sorry to leave unrepresented imaginative possibly than any american poet except utter contempt technique in the ordinary sense places him wholly outside my present purpose i wish to acknowledge various favors kindly shown by professor winchester professor barrett wendell and scudder thanks are also due aldrich the privilege of including the six poems from his

seeking new home this poem of whittier is almost his highest achievement lowell said in writing of the quaker poet appleton cyclopedia of american biography vi many of his poems such example the bees in which description and sentiment mutually inspire each other are ﬁne any in the language i often think however that whittier will live longest by his hymns and poems of purely religious devotion i

the rhodora has conciseness and unity too rare in emerson poetry which beautiful in details is strangely uneven we sigh we think what an unrivalled lyric poet emerson would have been had he been

than spontaneous his religious poetry presents in the main rather striking similarity to the work of geor ge herbert the dickinson has much of the witchcraft and subtlety of william blake many verses of the shy recluse whom higginson so happily has introduced to the world are not only daring and unconventional but recklessly deﬁant of form but her editor has well said when thought takes one breath
