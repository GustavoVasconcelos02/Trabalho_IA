of this fact is to be sought not in the writings of critics but in those of poets themselves the majority of the following poems are to be considered experiments they were written chieﬂy with view to ascertain how far the language of conversation in the middle and lower classes of society is adapted to the purposes of poetic pleasure readers accustomed to the gaudiness and inane phraseology of many modern writers if they persist in reading this book to its conclusion will perhaps frequently have to struggle with feelings of strangeness and aukwardness they will look round poetry and will be induced to enquire by what species of courtesy these attempts can be permitted to assume that title it is desirable that such readers their own sakes should not suffer the solitary word poetry word of very disputed meaning to stand in the way of their gratiﬁcation but that while they are perusing this book they should ask themselves if it contains natural delineation of human passions human characters and human incidents and if the answer be favourable to the author s wishes that they should consent to be pleased in spite of that most dreadful enemy to our pleasures our own codes of decision readers of superior judgment may disapprove of the style in which many of these pieces are executed it must be expected that many lines and phrases will not exactly suit their taste it will perhaps appear to them that wishing to avoid the prevalent fault of the day the author has sometimes descended too low and that many of his expressions are too familiar and not of sufﬁcient dignity it is apprehended that the more conversant the reader is with our elder writers and with those in modern times who have been the most successful in painting manners and passions the fewer complaints of this kind will he have to make an accurate taste in poetry and in all the other arts sir joshua reynolds has observed is an acquired talent which can only be produced by severe thought and long continued intercourse with the best models of composition this is mentioned not with so ridiculous purpose to prevent the most inexperienced reader from judging himself but merely to temper the rashness of decision and to suggest that if poetry be subject on which much time has not been bestowed the judgment may be erroneous and that in many cases it necessarily will be so the tale of goody blake and harry gill is founded on authenticated fact which happened in warwickshire of the other poems in the collection it may be proper to say that they are either absolute inventions of the author or facts which took place within his personal observation or that of his friends the poem of the thorn the reader will soon discover is not supposed to be spoken in the author s own person the

thou my dearest friend my dear dear friend and in thy voice i catch the language of my former heart and read my former pleasures in the shooting lights of thy wild eyes oh yet little while may i behold in thee what i was once my dear dear sister and this prayer i make knowing that nature never did betray the heart that loved her tis her privilege through all the years of this our life to lead from joy to joy she can so inform the mind that is within us so impress with quietness and beauty and so feed with lofty thoughts that neither evil tongues rash judgments nor the sneers of selﬁsh men nor greetings where kindness is nor all the dreary intercourse of daily life shall er prevail against us or disturb our chearful faith that all which we behold is full of blessings therefore let the moon shine on thee in thy solitary walk and let the misty mountain winds be free to blow against thee and in after years when these wild ecstasies shall be matured into sober pleasure when thy mind shall be mansion all lovely forms thy memory be all sweet sounds and harmonies oh then if solitude or fear or pain or grief should be thy portion with what healing thoughts of tender joy wilt thou remember and these my exhortations nor perchance if i should be where i more can hear thy voice nor catch from thy wild eyes these gleams of past existence wilt thou then get that on the banks of this delightful stream we stood together and that i so long worshipper of nature hither came unwearied in that service rather the project gutenberg book of lyrical ballads 1798 by wordsworth and coleridge
