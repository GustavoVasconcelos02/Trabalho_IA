hall has been carefully described in pamphlet by heyn the building was rectangular with opposite doors mainly west and east and hearth in the middle of th single room row of pillars down each side at some distance from the walls made space which was raised little above the main ﬂoor and was furnished with two rows of seats on one side usually south was the midway between the doors opposite this on the other raised space was another seat of honor at the banquet soon to be described hrothgar sat in the south or chief seat and beowulf opposite to him the scene ﬂying see below was thus very effectively set planks on trestles the board of later english literature formed the tables just in front of the long rows of seats and were taken away after banquets when the retainers were ready to stretch themselves out sleep on the benches 1b fire was the usual end of these halls see 781 below one thinks of the splendid scene at the end of the nibelungen of the nialssaga of saxo s story of

the north sea and the baltic rude representations of warriors show the boar on the helmet quite lar ge the helmet itself 5a either merely paved the strata via of the romans or else thought of sort of mosaic an extravagant touch like the reckless waste of gold on the walls and roofs of hall 6a the nicor says bugge is hippopotamus walrus says ten brink but that water who covers the space from old

the are not altogether good in this long passage which describes the rejoicings of the day after but the present shift from the riders on the road to the folk at the hall is not very violent and is of piece with the general style 14a unferth beowulf s sometime opponent in the ﬂyting 15a there is horrible inconsistency here such the critics strive and cry about in spite of the ruin that grendel and beowulf had made within the hall the framework and roof held ﬁrm and swift repairs made the interior habitab le tapestries were hung on the walls and willing hands prepared the banquet 15b from its formal use in other places this phrase to take cup in hall or on the ﬂoor would seem to mean that beowulf stood up to receive his gifts drink to the donor and say thanks 15c kenning sword 15d hrothgar

feud lay is chanted or recite d and the epic poet counting on his readers familiarity with the story fragment of it still exists simply gives the headings 16e the exact story to which this episode refers in summary is not to be determined but the following account of it is reasonable and has good support among scholars finn frisian chieftain who nevertheless has castle outside the frisian border marries hildeburh danish princess and her brother hnaef with many other danes pays finn visit relations between the two peoples have been strained before something starts the old feud anew and the visitors are attacked in their quarters hnaef is killed so is son of hildeburh many fall on both sides peace is patched up stately funeral is held and the surviving visitors become in way vassals or liegemen of finn going back with him to frisia so matters rest while hengest is now leader of the danes but he is set upon revenge his former lord hnaef probably he is killed in feud but his clansmen guthlaf and oslaf gather at their home force of sturdy danes come back to frisia storm finn s stronghold kill him and carry back their kinswoman hildeburh 16f the enemies must be the frisians 16g battleﬁeld hengest is the prince s thane companion of hnaef folcwald s son is finn 16h that is finn would govern in all honor the few danish warriors who were left provided of course that none of them tried to renew the quarrel or avenge hnaef their fallen lord if again one of finn s frisians began quarrel he should die by the sword 16i beowulf by anonymous https 16j the high place chosen the funeral see description of beowulf s at the end of the poem 16k wounds 17a that is these two danes escaping home had told the story of the attack on hnaef the slaying of hengest and all the danish woes collecting force they return to frisia and kill finn in his home 17b nephew to hrothgar with whom he subsequently quarrels and elder cousin to the two young sons of hrothgar and wealhtheow their natural guardian in the event of the king s death there is something ﬁnely feminine in this speech of wealhtheow s apart from its somewhat irregular and irrelevant sequence of topics both she and her lord probably distrust hrothulf but she bids the king to be of good cheer and turning to the suspect heaps affectiona assurances on his probity my own hrothulf will surely not forget these favors and beneﬁts of the past but will repay them to the orphaned boy 19a they had laid their arms on the benches near where they slept 20a he surmises presently where she is 20b the connection is not difﬁcult the words of mourning of acute grief are said and according to germanic sequence of thought inexorable here the next and only topic is revenge but is it possible hrothgar leads up to his appeal and

statesmanlike forecast of the outcome of certain policies at the danish court talk of interpolation here is absurd both beowulf and hygelac know and the folk whom the beowulf was put together also knew froda was king of the heathoba rds probably the langobards once near neighbors of angle and saxon tribes on the continent and had fallen in ﬁght with the danes hrothgar will set aside this feud by giving his daughter and wife to the young king ingeld son of the slain froda but beowulf on general principles and from his observation of the particular case foretells trouble note 28b play of

frankish territory between 512 and 520 the subsequent course of events gathered from hints of this epic is partly told in scandinavian legend 29d the chronology of this epic scholars have worked it out would make beowulf well over ninety years of age when he ﬁghts the dragon but the ﬁfty years of his reign need not be taken historical fact 29e the text is here hopelessly illegible and only the general drift of the meaning can be rescued one thing we have the old myth of dragon who guards hidden treasure but with this runs the story of some noble last of his race who hides all his wealth within this barrow and there chants his farewell to life s glories after his death the dragon takes possession of the hoard and watches over it condemned or banished man desperate hides in the barrow discovers the treasure and while the dragon sleeps makes off with golden beaker or the like and carries it propitiation to his master the dragon discovers the loss and exacts fearful penalty from the

rewarded by gift of the slain man s weapons 34b both wiglaf and the sword did their duty the following is one of the classic passages illustrating the comitatus the most conspicuous germanic
