shakspere society the chaucer society etc preface to the fourth edition the favor with which the successive editions of beówulf have been received during the past thirteen years emboldens the editors to continue the work of revision in fourth issue the most noticeable feature of which is considerable body of explanatory notes now the ﬁrst time added these notes mainly concern themselves with new textual readings with here and there grammatical geographical and archæological points that seemed worthy of explanation parallelisms and parallel passages are constantly compared with the view of making the poem illustrate and explain itself few emendations and textual changes are suggested by the editors with all possible difﬁdence numerous corrections have been made in the glossary and list of names and the valuable parts of former appendices have been embodied in the notes the notes the editors are much indebted to the various german periodicals mentioned on page 1 16 to the recent publications of professors earle and hall to mr brooke and to the socin edition of beówulf change has been made in the system of accentuation though few errors in quantity have been corrected the editors are looking forward to an eventual ﬁfth edition in which an entirely new text will be presented october the project gutenberg ebook of beowulf https to the third edition this third edition of the american issue of beówulf will the editors hope be found more accurate and useful than either of the preceding editions further corrections in text and glossary have been made and some additional new readings and suggestions will be found in two brief appendices at the back of the book students of the metrical system of beówulf will ﬁnd ample material their studies in sievers exhaustive essay on that subject beiträge x socin edition of heyne beówulf called the ﬁfth edition has been utilized to some extent in this edition though it unfortunately came too late to be freely used while it repeats many of the omissions and inaccuracies of heyne fourth edition it contains much that is valuable to the student particularly in the notes and commentary students of the poem which has been subjected to much searching criticism during the last decade will also derive especial help from the contributions of sievers and kluge on difﬁcult questions appertaining to it wülker new edition in the grein bibliothek is of the highest value however one may dissent from particular textual views laid down in the text paul and braune beiträge contain varied miscellany of hints corrections and suggestions principally embodying the views of kluge cosijn sievers and bugge some of the more important of which are found in the appendices to the present and the preceding edition holder and zupitza sarrazin and hermann möller kiel 1883 heinzel anzeiger alterthum x gering zacher zeitschrift xii brenner eng studien ix and the contributors to anglia have assisted materially in the textual and metrical interpretation of the poem the subject of quantity has been discussed in several able essays by sievers sweet ten brink anzeiger alterthum kluge beiträge xi and others but so much is uncertain in this ﬁeld that the editors have left undisturbed the marking of vowels found in the text of their original edition while indicating in the appendices the now accepted views of scholars on the quantity of the personal pronouns mê wê þû þê gê hê the adverb nû etc perhaps it would be best to banish absolutely all attempts at marking quantities except in cases where the has them marked an approximately complete bibliography of beówulf literature will be found in wülker grundriss and in garnett translation of the poem james harrison rober t sharp washingt on and lee university lexingt on may note to the second revised edition the editors feel so encouraged at the kind reception accorded their edition of beówulf 1883 that in spite of its many shortcomings they have determined to prepare second revised edition of the book and thus endeavor to extend its sphere of usefulness about twenty errors had notwithstanding vigilant crept into the text errors in single letters accents and punctuation these have the project gutenberg ebook of beowulf https and it is hoped that the text has been rendered generally accurate and trustworthy in the list of names one or two corrections have been made and in the glossary numerous mistakes in gender classiﬁcation and translation apparently unavoidable in ﬁrst edition have been rectiﬁed wherever these mistakes concern single letters or occupy very small space they have been corrected in the plates where they are longer and the expense of correcting them in the plates would have been very great the editors have thought it best to include them in an appendix of corrections and additions which will be found at the back of the book students are accordingly referred to this appendix important longer corrections and additions it is believed that the value of the book has been much enhanced by an appendix of recent readings based on late criticisms and essays from the pens of sievers kluge cosijn holder wülker and sweet perplexed student in turning to these suggested readings will often ﬁnd great help in unravelling obscure or corrupt passages the objectionable ä and æ the short and the long diphthong have been retained in the revised edition owing to the impossibility of removing them without entirely recasting the plates in conclusion the editors would acknowledge their great indebtedness to the friends and critics whose remarks and criticisms have materially aided in the correction of the text to profs scott baskervill price and hart to bright and to the authorities of cornell university the loan of periodicals necessary to the completeness of the revision while the second revised edition still contains much that might be improved the editors can not but hope that it is an advance on its predecessor and that it will continue its work of extending the study of old english throughout the land june note the present work carefully edited from heyne fourth edition paderborn 1879 is designed primarily college classes in saxon rather than independent investigators or seekers after restored or ideal text the need of an american edition of beówulf has long been felt hitherto students have had either to send to germany text or secure with great trouble one of the scarce and expensive english editions heyne ﬁrst edition came out in 1863 and was followed in 1867 and 1873 by second and third edition all three having essentially the same text so many important contributions to the beówulf literature were however made between 1873 and 1879 that heyne found it necessary to put forth new edition 1879 in this new last edition the text was subjected to careful revision and was fortiﬁed by the views contributions and criticisms of other zealous scholars in it the collation of the unique beówulf v itellius 15 cottonian mss of the british museum made by kölbing in herrig archiv bd 56 1876 was followed wherever the present condition of the had to be discussed and the researches of bugge bieger and others on single passages were made use of the discussion of the metrical structure of the poem occurring in the second and third editions was omitted in the fourth owing to the many controversies in which the subject is still involved the present editor has thought it best to the same the project gutenberg ebook of beowulf https the subject of old english metrik is under going steady illumination through the labors of schipper and others some errors and misplaced accents in heyne text have been corrected in the present edition in which in the general revision of the text the editor has been most kindly aided by garnett late principal of john college maryland in the preparation of the present school edition it has been thought best to omit heyne notes they concern themselves principally with conjectural emendations substitutions of one reading another and discussions of the condition of the until wülker text and the photographic of the original are in the hands of all scholars it will be better not to introduce such matters in the school room where they would puzzle without instructing convenience of reference the editor has added to each ﬁt of the poem with view to facilitate knowledge of its episodes washingt on and lee university lexingt on june note ii the editors now have the pleasure of presenting to the public complete text and tolerably complete glossary of beówulf the edition is the ﬁrst published in america and the ﬁrst of its special kind presented to the english public and it is the initial volume of library of poetry to be edited under the same auspices and with the coöperation of distinguished scholars in this country among these scholars may be mentioned professors f march of lafayette college price of columbia college and baskervill of vanderbilt university in the preparation of the glossary the editors found it necessary to abandon literal and exact translation of heyne several reasons and among others from the fact that heyne seems to be wrong in the translation of some of his illustrative quotations and even translates the same passage in two or three dif ferent ways under dif ferent headings the orthography of his glossary dif fers considerably from the orthography of his text he fails to discriminate with due nicety the meanings of many of the words in his vocabulary while criticism more recent than his latest edition 1879 has illustrated or overthrown several of his renderings the references were found to be incorrect in innumerable instances and had to be veriﬁed in every individual case so far this was possible few only which resisted all ef forts at veriﬁcation having to be indicated by an interrogation point the references are exceedingly numerous and the labor of verifying them was naturally great to many passages in the glossary where heyne translation could not be trusted with entire certainty the editors have added other translations of phrases and sentences or of special words and in this they have been aided by careful study of the text and comparison and utilization of the views of kemble and professor garnett who takes grein his foundation many new references have been added and the various passages in which heyne fails to indicate whether given verb is weak or strong or fails to point out the number of the illustrative form have been corrected and made to harmonize with the general plan of the work numerous misprints in the project gutenberg ebook of beowulf https have also been corrected and brief glossary to the fragment prepared by dr wm hand browne and supplemented and adapted by the editor has been added the editors think that they may without immodesty put forth themselves something more than the claim of being of translation the present edition is so far they were able to make it so an adaptation correction and extension of the work of the great german scholar to whose loving appreciation of the epic all students of old english owe debt of gratitude while following his usually sure and cautious guidance and in the main appropriating his results they have thought it best to deviate from him in the manner above indicated whenever it seemed that he was wrong the careful reader will notice at once the marks of interrogation which point out these deviations or which introduce point of view illustrative of or supplementary to the one given by the german editor doubt the editors are wrong themselves in many places beówulf is most difﬁcult poem their view may at least be defended by reference to the original text which they have faithfully and constantly consulted good many cognate modern english words have been introduced here and there in the glossary with view to illustration and other addenda will be found between brackets and parenthetical marks it is hoped that the present edition of the most famous of old english poems will something to promote valuable and interesting study james harrison washington and lee
