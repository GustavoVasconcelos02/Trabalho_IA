last day and like moon in secret it is shining there my half shines in the sky general sign of the troth with the dead i pledged myself to keep turning its broken edge to the dark it shines indeed like the sign of lover who turns to the dark amores by lawrence https sleep against my heart the inviolate sleep breaks still in darkened waves whose breaking echoes the wondering world of my wakeful day till i lost in the midst of the places i knew so well before dissolute many years have i still to burn detained like candle flame on this body but i enshrine darkness within presence which sleeps contained in my flame of living her soul enfolded in mine and through these years while i burn on the fuel of life what matter the stuf f i lick up in my living flame seeing i keep in the inviolate night where she dreams my dreams ever the same submergence when along the pavement palpitating flames of life people flicker round i get my bereavement the gap in the great constellation the place where star used to be nay though the is blown out like candle and all the heavens are wandering in disarray yet when pleiads of people are deployed around and i see the street long outstretched milky way when people flicker down the pavement i get my amores by lawrence https enkindled spring this spring it comes bursts up in bonfires green wild puf fing of emerald trees and bushes lifting in wreaths of smoke between where the wood fumes up and the watery flickering rushes i am amazed at this spring this conflagration of green fires lit on the soil of the earth this blaze of growing and sparks that puf f in wild gyration faces of people streaming across my gaze and i what fountain of fire am i among this leaping combustion of spring my spirit is tossed about like shadow buf feted in the throng of flames shadow that gone astray and is lost reproach had i but known yesterday helen you could dischar ge the ache out of the cloud had i known yesterday you could take the tur gid electric ache away drink it up with your proud white body lovely white lightning is drunk from an agonised sky by the earth i might have hated you helen but since my limbs gushed full of fire since from out of my blood and bone poured heavy flame to you earth of my atmosphere stone of my steel lovely white flint of desire you have name earth of my swaying atmosphere substance of my inconstant breath i can not but cleave to amores by lawrence https since you have drunken up the drear painful electric storm and death is washed from the blue of my eyes i see you beautiful you are strong and passive and beautiful i come like winds that uncertain hover but you are the earth i hover over the hands of the betrothed her tawny eyes are onyx of thoughtlessness hardened they are like gems in ancient modesty yea and her mouth prudent and crude caress means even less than her many words to though her kiss betrays also this this only consolation that in her lips her blood at climax clips two wild dumb paws in anguish on the lonely fruit of my heart ere down rebuked it slips i know from her hardened lips that still her heart is hungry yet if i put my hand in her breast she puts away like saleswoman whose mart is endangered by the pilferer on his quest but her hands are still the woman the lar ge strong hands heavier than mine yet like leverets caught in steel when i hold them my still soul understands their dumb confession of what her sort must feel never her hands come nigh but they lift like heavy birds from the morning stubble to settle upon like sleeping birds like birds that shift uneasily in their sleep disturbing my mettle how caressingly she lays her hand on my knee how strangely she tries to disown it it sinks in my flesh and bone and forages into how it stirs like subtle stoat whatever she thinks and often i see her clench her fingers amores by lawrence https and thrust her fists suppressed in the folds of her skirt and sometimes how she grasps her arms with her bright big hands if surely her arms did hurt and i have seen her stand all unaware pressing her spread hands over her breasts she would crush their mounds on her heart to kill in there the pain that is her simple ache her strong hands take my part the part of man to her she crushes them into her bosom deep where i should lie and with her own strong span closes her arms that should fold in sleep ah and she puts her hands upon the wall presses them there and kisses her bright hands then lets her black hair loose the darkness fall about her from her bands and sits in her own dark night of her bitter hair knows of what to she the same betrothed young lady who loves and takes care of her womanly virtue and of my good name excursion i wonder can the night go by can this shot arrow of travel fly with light sheer into the sky of dawned without ever sleep delivering us from each other or loosing the dolorous unfruitful sorrow what is it then that you can see that at the window endlessly you watch the red sparks whirl and flee and the night look through your presence peering lonelily there oppresses so i can hardly bear to share the train with you you hurt my privacy i wish i could put you away from amores by lawrence https i suf focate in this intimacy all that i love you how i have longed this night in the train yet now every fibre of cries in pain to god to remove you but surely my soul best dream is still that one night pouring down shall swill us away in an utter sleep until we are one yet closely bitten in to is this armour of stif f reluctancy that keeps impounded so dear love when another night pours on us lift your fingers white and strip naked touch light light light all over i ache most earnestly your touch yet i can not move however much i would be your lover night after night with blemish of day unblown and unblossomed has withered away come another night come new night say will you pluck apart will you open the amorous aching bud of my body and loose the burning flood that would leap to you from my heart perfidy hollow rang the house when i knocked on the door and i lingered on the threshold with my hand upraised to knock and knock once more listening the sound of her feet across the floor hollow my heart the lamps stretched down the road with shadows drifting underneath with music of soft melodious feet quickening my hope i hastened to meet the light of her eyes the golden lamps down the street went out the last car trailed the night behind and i in the darkness wandered about with flutter of hope and of doubt in the dying lamp of my amores by lawrence https two brown ponies trotting slowly stopped at trough to drink the dark van drummed down the distance slowly while the city stars so dim and holy drew nearer to search through the streets hastening car swept shameful past i saw her hid in the shadow i saw her step to the curb and fast run to the silent door where last i had stood with my hand uplifted she clung to the door in her haste to enter entered and quickly cast it shut behind her leaving the street aghast spiritual woman close your eyes my love let make you blind they have taught you to see only mean arithmetic on the face of things cunning algebra in the faces of men and god like geometry completing his circles and working cleverly i kiss you over the eyes till i kiss you blind if i any one could then perhaps in the dark you have got what you want to find you discovered so many bits with your clever eyes and i kaleidoscope that you shake and shake and yet it wo come to your mind now stop carping at god how i hate you you fear i shall swindle you you think if you take i am that that will abate you somehow sad so intrinsic so spiritual yet so cautious you must have all in your will and your i hate amores by lawrence https ting round clouds roll in the arms of the wind the round earth rolls in clasp of blue sky and see where the budding hazels are thinned the wild anemones lie in undulating shivers beneath the wind over the blue of the waters ply white ducks living flotilla of cloud and look you floating just thereby the drake stems proud like abraham whose seed should multiply in the lustrous gleam of the water there scramble seven toads across the silk obscure leaves seven toads that meet in the dusk to share the darkness that interweaves the sky and earth and water and live things everywhere look now through the woods where the spurts like storm of emerald snow look see great bay stallion dances skirts the bushes sumptuously going outward now in the spring

enjoys the open blossoms they straw their beauty his taking boon boon and i lift my aching arms to you and i lift my anguished avid breast and i weep very pain of you and fling myself at the doors of sleep rest and i toss through the troubled night you dreaming your yielded mouth is given to mine feeling your strong breast carry on into the peace where sleep is stronger even than wine brother and sister the shorn moon trembling indistinct on her path frail scar upon the pale blue sky draws towards the downward slope some sorrow hath worn her down to the quick so she faintly fares along her way without knowing why she creeps persistent down the sky long amores by lawrence https some say they see though i have never seen the dead moon heaped within the new moon arms surely the fragile fine young thing had been too heavily burdened to mount the heavens so but my heart stands still new strong dread alarms might young girl be heaped with such shadow of woe since death from the mother moon has pared us down to the quick and cast us forth like shorn thin moons to travel an uncharted way among the myriad thick strewn stars of silent people and luminous litter of lives which sorrows like mischievous dark mice chavel to nought diminishing each star glitter since death has delivered us utterly naked and white since the month of childhood is over and we stand alone since the beloved faded moon that set us alight is delivered from us and pays heed though we moan in sorrow since we stand in bewilderment strange and fearful to sally forth down the sky long range we may not cry to her still to sustain us here we may not hold her shadow back from the dark oh let us here get let us take the sheer unknown that lies before us bearing the ark of the covenant onwards where she can not go let us rise and leave her now she will never know after many ys i wonder if with you it is with if under your slipping words that easily flow about you garment easily your violent heart beats to and fro long have i waited never once confessed even to myself how bitter the separation now being come again how make the best reparation if i could cast this clothing of f from if i could lift my naked self to amores by lawrence https or if only you would repulse wound would be good it would let the ache come through but that you hold still so kindly cold aloof my flaming heart will not allow yea but i loathe you that you should withhold your pleasure now blue the earth again like ship steams out of the dark sea over the edge of the blue and the sun stands up to see us glide slowly into another day slowly the rover vessel of darkness takes the rising tide i on the deck am startled by this dawn confronting who am issued amazed from the darkness stripped and quailing here in the sunshine delivered from haunting the night unsounded whereon our days are shipped feeling myself undawning the day light playing upon i who am substance of shadow i all compact of the stuf f of the night finding myself all wrongly among the crowds of things in the sunshine jostled and racked i with the night on my lips i sigh with the silence of death and what i care though the very stones should cry unreal though the clouds shine in conceit of substance upon who am less than the rain i not know the darkness within them what are they but shrouds the clouds go down the sky with wealthy ease casting shadow of scorn upon my share in death but i hold my own in the midst of them darkling defy the whole of the day to extinguish the shadow i lift on the breeze yea though the very clouds have vantage over amores by lawrence https enjoying their glancing flight though my love is dead i still am not homeless here i tent by day of darkness where she sleeps on her perfect bed and i know the host the minute sparkling of darkness which vibrates untouched and virile through the grandeur of night but which when dawn crows challenge assaulting the vivid motes of living darkness bursts fretfully and is bright runs like fretted into light stirred by conflict to shining which else were dark and whole with the night runs to fret of speed like racing wheel which else were aslumber along with the whole of the dark swinging rhythmic instead of is chafed to anger bursts into rage like thunder which else were silent grasp that held the heavens arrested beating thick with wonder leaps like fountain of blue sparks leaping in jet from out of obscurity which erst was darkness sleeping runs into streams of bright blue drops water and stones and stars and myriads of eyes and crops of floury grain and all the hosts of day all lovely hosts of ripples caused by fretting the darkness into play she bade follow to her garden where the mellow sunlight stood in cup between the old grey walls i did not dare to raise my face i did not dare look up lest her bright eyes like sparrows should fly in my windows of discovery and shrill sin so with downcast mien and laughing voice i followed followed the swing of her white dress that rocked in lilt along i watched the amores by lawrence https of her feet they flew space then paused to press the grass deep down with the royal burden of her and gladly i of fered my breast to the tread of her i like to see she said and she crouched her down she sunk into my sight like settling bird and her bosom couched in the confines of her gown like heavy birds at rest there softly stirred by her measured breaths i like to see said she the put out his tongue at she laughed she reached her hand out to the flower closing its crimson throat my own throat in her power strangled my heart swelled up so full if it would burst its in my throat choke in my own crimson i watched her pull the gor ge of the gaping flower till the blood did float over my eyes and i was her lar ge brown hand stretched over the windows of my mind and there in the dark i did discover things i was out to find my grail brown bowl twined with swollen veins that met in the wrist under whose brown the amethyst i longed to taste i longed to turn my heart red measure in her cup i longed to feel my hot blood burn with the amethyst in her cup then suddenly she looked up and i was blind in day till she took her eyes away so she came down from above and emptied my heart of love so i held my heart aloft to the cuckoo that hung like dove and she settled soft it seemed that i and the morning world were pressed to take this reiver bird who was weary to have furled her wings in us we were weary to receive her this bird this rich sumptuous central grain this mutable witch this one refrain this laugh in the fight this clot of night this core of delight she spoke and i closed my amores by lawrence https to shut hallucinations out i echoed with surprise hearing my mere lips shout the answer they did devise again i saw brown bird hover over the flowers at my feet i felt brown bird hover over my heart and sweet its shadow lay on my heart i thought i saw on the clover brown bee pulling apart the closed flesh of the clover and burrowing in its heart she moved her hand and again i felt the brown bird cover my heart and then the bird came down on my heart on nest the rover cuckoo comes and shoves over the brim each careful part of love takes possession and settles her down with her wings and her feathers to drown the nest in heat of love she turned her flushed face to the glint of moment see she laughed if you also can make them yawn i put my hand to the dint in the flower throat and the flower gaped wide with woe she watched she went of sudden intensely still she watched my hand to see what i would fulfil i pressed the wretched throttled flower between my fingers till its head lay back its fangs poised at her like weapon my hand was white and keen and i held the choked flower in its pangs of mordant anguish till she ceased to laugh until her pride flag smitten cleaved down to the staf she hid her face she murmured between her lips the low word i let the flower fall but held my hand afloat towards the slips of blossom she fingered and my fingers all put forth to her she did not move nor i my hand like snake watched hers that could not fly then i laughed in the dark of my heart i did exult like sudden chuckling of music i bade her eyes meet mine i opened her helpless eyes to consult their fear their shame their joy that underlies defeat in such battle in the dark of her eyes my heart was fierce to make her laughter amores by lawrence https till her dark deeps shook with convulsive thrills and the dark of her spirit wavered like water thrilled with light and my heart leaped up in longing to plunge its stark fervour within the pool of her twilight within her spacious soul to grope in delight and i not care though the lar ge hands of revenge shall get my throat at last shall get it soon if the joy that they are searching to avenge have risen red on my night harvest moon which even death can only put out and death i know is better than passing bell mournfull y to and fro to and fro the trees are waving what did you say my dear the leaves are suddenly shaken child asleep still shakes in the clutch of yes my love i hear one lonely bell one only the afternoon is braving why not let it ring the roses lean down when they hear it the tender mild flowers of the fall to the it is such little thing wet bird walks on the lawn call to the boy to come and look yes it is over now call to him out of the silence call him to see the starling shaking its head it walks in the ah who knows how he can not see it i can never show it him how it disturb him darling head it walked i can never call him to never he is not whatever shall come to pass look at the wet amores by lawrence https trouble and shame i look at the swaling sunset and wish i could go also through the red doors beyond the bar i wish that i could go through the red doors where i could put of f my shame like shoes in the porch my pain like garments and leave my flesh discarded lying like luggage of some departed traveller gone one knows not where then i would turn round and seeing my f body lying like lumber i would laugh with joy elegy since i lost you my darling the sky has come near and i am of it the small sharp stars are quite near the white moon going among them like white bird among and the sound of her gently rustling in heaven like bird i hear and i am willing to come to you now my dear pigeon lets itself of f from cathedral dome to be lost in the haze of the sky i would like to come and be lost out of sight with you and be gone like foam i am tired my dear and if i could lift my feet my tenacious feet from of f the dome of the earth to fall like breath within the breathing wind where you are lost what rest my love what rest amores by lawrence https evening when you went how was it you carried with you my missal book of fine flamboyant hours my book of turrets and of bowers and skies of gold and ladies in bright tissue now underneath twilight heaped beyond the withering snow of the shorn fields stands rubble of stunted houses all is reaped and garnered that the golden daylight yields dim lamps like yellow poppies glimmer among the shadowy stubble of the under farther of f the scythe of night is swung and little stars come rolling from their husk and all the earth is gone into dust of greyness mingled with fume of gold covered with aged lichens pale with must and all the sky has withered and gone cold and so i sit and scan the book of grey feeling the shadows like blind man reading all fearful lest i find the last words bleeding with wounds of sunset and the dying day firelight and nightf all the darkness steals the forms of all the queens but oh the palms of his two black hands are red inflamed with binding up the sheaves of dead hours that were once all glory and all queens and i remember all the sunny hours of queens in hyacinth and skies of gold and morning singing where the woods are scrolled and diapered above the chaunting flowers here lamps are white like snowdrops in the grass the town is like churchyard all so still and grey now night is here nor will another torn red sunset come to amores by lawrence https mystic blue out of the darkness fretted sometimes in its sleeping jets of sparks in fountains of blue come leaping to sight revealing secret numberless secrets keeping sometimes the darkness trapped within wheel runs into speed like dream the blue of the steel showing the rocking darkness now and out of the invisible streams of bright blue drops rain from the showery heavens and bright blue crops sur ge from the under to their ladder and all the manifold blue and joyous eyes the rainbow arching over in the skies new sparks of wonder opening in surprise all these pure things come foam and spray of the sea of darkness abundant which shaken mysteriously breaks into dazzle of living dolphins that leap from the sea of midnight shake it to fire so the secret
