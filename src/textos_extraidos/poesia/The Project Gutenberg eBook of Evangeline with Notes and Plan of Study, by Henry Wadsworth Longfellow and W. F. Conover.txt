into the wider realms of introduction fraught with much consequence since the manner of it is likely to have considerable bearing on the pupil future in this subject it is certainly important that the most be made of the opportunity we believe that the common lack of interest and effort in school work is often due to an absence of deﬁnite and visible ends and of proper directions the reaching of those ends pupils not object to work and hard work with something tangible what they object to is groping in the dark something that may turn is too frequently the case in their study of piece of
