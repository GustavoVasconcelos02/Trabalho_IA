murmuring prayer bowed all together to the holy west bowed all together thro the golden hush the breathing hush the solemn scented hush the holy holy hush of eventide and in among the ferns that crowned the hill with waving green and whispers of the wind boy and girl carelessly linking hands into their golden dream drifted away on that rich afternoon of scent and song old michael oaktree died it was not much he wished but indeed i think he longed to see the light of summer once again blossoming the far blue hills i know he used to like his wooden bench placed in the sun outside the cottage door where in the listening stillness he could hear across the waving that crowned his crumbling garden wall the long low sigh of supreme peace that whispers to the hills the sacred consolation of the sea he did not hope much he longed to live until the winter came again he said but on the last sweet eve of may he died i wandered sadly through the dreaming lanes down to the cottage on that afternoon i had known old michael oaktree now so many years so many happy years when i was little he had carried high on his back to see the harvest home and given many ride upon his wagon among the dusty scents of sun and hay he showed how to snare the bulky trout that lurked under the bank of yonder brook indeed he taught many country craft i was apt to learn and i learnt i loved the teacher of that homely lore deep in my boyish heart he shared the glad inﬂuence of the suns and winds and waves giving my childhood what it hungered the rude of the primal man he had retained his childhood death

toilers after truth are weaned too soon from earth dark arms and naked barbarous breast too soon too soon we leave the golden feast fetter the dancing limbs and pluck the crown of roses from the dreaming brow we pass our lives in most laborious idleness we have lost the meaning of the world we have gone out into the night too soon we have mistaken all the means of grace and over our small power to learn and the years move so swiftly over us we have so little time to live in worlds unrealised and unknown realms of joy we are so old before we learn how vain our ef fort was how fruitlessly we cast our bread upon the waters and how weak our hearts were but our chance desires how strong then in the dark our sense of light decays we can not cry to god once we cried lost in the gloom our faith perhaps our love lies dead with years that never can return but michael oaktree was man whose love had never waned through all his eighty years his faith was hardly faith he seemed part of all that he believed in he had lived in constant conversation with the sun the wind the silence and the heart of peace in absolute communion with the power that rules all action and all tides of thought and all the secret courses of the stars the power that still establishes on earth desire and worship through the radiant laws of duty love and beauty through these through three portals of the gate the soul of man attains inﬁnity and enters into godhead so he gained on earth of nirvana not the void of eastern dream but the desire and goal of all of us whether thro lives innumerable by slow degrees we near the death divine or from this breaking body of earthly death we ﬂash at once to god 150 151 the project gutenberg ebook of the new morning by alfred noyes https simple love and simple faith this man attained height above the hope of kings yet i softly shut the little gate and walked across the garden all the scents of mingling blossom ached like inmost pain deep in my heart

streak of sunset to the moon strange rose upon starlit grave strange smile upon dead man lips chime of melancholy mute death but strong love uttered in plangent tones of honeysuckle jasmine jonquils and aromatic musky leaves lilac and lilies to the porch at last i tapped and entered and was drawn into the bedroom of the dying man who lay propped up with pillows quietly gazing through his open casement far beyond the whispers of the he saw the mellow light of eventide hallow the west once more and he gazed i think i never saw so great peace on any human face there was sound except the slumbrous pulsing of clock the whisper of the garden and far of f the sacred consolation of the sea his wife sat at his she had passed her eightieth year her only child was dead she had been wedded more than sixty years and she sat gazing with the man she loved quietly out into that unknown deep butterﬂy ﬂoated into the room and back again pausing awhile to bask and wink its painted fans on the warm sill bird piped in the roses and there came into the childless mother ears sound of happy laughing children far away 152 153 the project gutenberg ebook of the new morning by alfred noyes https michael oaktree took his wife thin hand between his big rough hands his eyes grew dark and he turned to her and died he spoke two words of perfect faith and come soon then in all the world there was sound except the slumbrous pulsing of clock the whisper of the leaves and far away the inﬁnite compassion of the sea but i softly passed out of the porch and walked across the garden all the scents of mingling blossoms ached like inmost joy distinct more but like one heavenly choir pealing one mystic music still and strange voices of the holy seraphim one voice of adoration mute love stronger than death and pure with wedded tones of honeysuckle jasmine jonquils and aromatic musky leaves lilac and lilies to the garden gate then indeed i knew how closely knit to stars and ﬂowers we are how many means of grace there are those that never lose their sense of membership in this divine body of god those that all their days have walked in quiet communion with the life that keeps the common secret of the sun the wind the silence and the heart of man there is one god one love one everlasting mystery of incarnation one creative passion behind the veil we have obscured god face with partial truths the cause of all our sorrow and sin our wars of force and thought in this unheavened world yet by the battle of our partial truths the past against the present and the swift moment of passing joy against the deep eternal love ever the weaker truth falls to the stronger till once more we near the enfolding splendour of the whole our god has been too long partial god we are all made in his image
