the aegean april 23 1915 introduction i rupert brooke was both fair to see and winning in his ways there was at the ﬁrst contact both bloom and charm and most of all there was life to use the word his friends describe him by he was vivid this vitality though manifold in expression is felt primarily in his sensations surprise mingled with delight one after one like tasting sweet food this is life ﬁrst ﬁne rapture it makes him patient to name over those myriad things each of which seems like fresh discovery curious but potent and above all common that he loved he the great lover lover of what then why of white plates and cups ringed with blue lines and the like through thirty lines of exqu isite words and he is captivated by the multiple brevity of these vignettes of sense keen momentary ecstatic with the morning dip of youth in the wonderful stream the poem is catalogue of vital sensations and dear names well all these have been my loves the spring of these emotions is the natural body but it sends pulsations far into the spirit the feeling rises in direct observation but it is soon aware of the outlets of the sky he sees objects practically unrelated and links them in strings or he sees them pictorially or he sees pictures immersed it were in an atmosphere of thought when the process is complete the thought suggests the picture and is its origin then the great lover revisits the bottom of the monstrous world and imaginatively and thoughtfully recreates that strange under whose glooms and gleams and muds are well known to him strong and delighted swimmer or at the last drifts through the dream of south sea lagoon still with philosophical question in his mouth yet one can hardly speak of completion these are real ﬁrst ﬂights what we have in this volume is not so much work of art an artist in his birth trying the wings of genius the poet loves his element he clings to mortality to life not thought or he puts it to the concrete let the abstract go pack there little comfort in the wise he ends but in the unfolding of his precocious spirit the literary control comes uppermost his boat ﬁnding its keel swings to the helm of mind how should it be otherwise youth in college air intellectual primacy showed itself to him in many wandering loves ﬁne lover that he was but in the end he was an intellectual lover and the magnet seems to have been especially powerful in the ghosts of the men of wit donne marvell erudite lords of language poets in another world than ours less ample ether less divine air our fathers thought but poets of eternity quintessential drop of intellect is apt to be in poetic blood how platonism fascinates the poets like shining bait rupert brooke will have none of it but at turn of the verse he is back at it examining tasting refusing in those alternate drives of the thought in his south sea idyl clever tennis play how he slips from phenomenon to idea and reverses happy with either it seems were dear charmer away how bravely he tries to free himself from the cling of earth at the the collected poems of rupert brooke by rupert brooke https the great lover how little he succeeds his muse knew only earthly tongues so far he understood why this persistent cling to mortality with its cry against death and its heaped anathemas on the transformations of decay it is the old story once more the vision of the ﬁrst poets the world that passes away the poetic eye of keats saw it beauty that must die and joy whose hand is ever at his lips bidding adieu the reﬂective mind of arnold meditated it the world that seems to lie before us like land of dreams so various so beautiful so new hath really neither joy nor love nor light nor certitude nor peace nor help pain so rupert brooke but the best i known stays here and changes breaks grows old is blown about the winds of the world and fades from brains of living men and dies nothing remains and yet oh never doubt but somewhere i shall wake again the light returning shall give back the golden hours ocean windless level again best of all in the last word still may time hold some golden space where i unpack that scented store of song and flower and sky and face and count and touch and turn them musing upon them he can not forego his sensations that box of compacted sweets he even forefeels ghostly landscape where two shall go wandering through the night alone so the faith that broke its chrysalis in the ﬁrst disillusionment of boyhood in second best beautiful with the burden of greek lyricism ends triumphant with the spirit still unsubdued proud then and laughing go to greet death friend so go with unreluctant tread but in the disillusionment of beauty and of love there is an older tone with what bitter savor with what grossness of diction caught from the elizabethan and satirical elements in his culture he spends anger in words he reacts he rebels he storms dozen poems hardly exhaust his gall it is not merely that beauty and joy and love are transient now but in their going they are corrupted into their opposites ugliness pain indifference and his anger once stilled by speech what lassitude follows life in this volume is hardly less evide nt by its ecstasy than by its collapse it is book of youth sensitive vigorous sound but it is the fruit of intensity and bears the traits the search solitude the relief from crowds the open door into nature the sense of ﬂight and escape the repeated thought of safety the insistent fatigue the cry sleep all these bear confession in their faces flight town and country the voice are eloquent of what they leave untold and the climax of retrospect and i should sleep and i should sleep or the sestet of waikiki or the whole fainting sonnet entitled memory belong to the nadir of vitality at moments weariness set in like spiritual tide i associate too with such the collected poems of rupert brooke by rupert brooke https at least his visions of the arrested moment in tea sort of trance state or in the pendant sonnet analogous moods are not infrequent in the great poets rupert brooke seems to have faltered nervously at times these poems mirror faithfully such moments but even when the image of life imaginative or real falters so how essentially vital it still is and clothed in an exquisite body of words like the traditional rainbow hues of the dying ﬁsh i can not express too strongly my admiration of the literary sense of this young poet and my delight in it all these have been my loves he says if i may repeat the phrase but he seems to have loved the words much the things dear names he adds the born man of letters speaks there so when his pulse is at its lowest he can not forget the beautiful surface of his south sea idyls or of versiﬁed english gardens and lanes he cared much the expression the thing which is what makes man of letters so ﬁxed is this habit that his art truly is independent of his bodily state in his poems of collaps in those of ecstasy he seems to equally master of his mood like those poets who are all time his literary skill in verse was ripe how long so ever he might have to live ii to come then to art which is above personality what of that art is at most but the mortal relic of genius yet it is true of it that like ozymandias statue nothing beside remains rupert brooke was already perfected in verbal and stylistic execution he might have grown in variety richness and signiﬁcance in scope and in detail doubt but an artisan in metrical word s and pauses he was past apprenticeship he was still restless experimenter but in much he was master in the brief stroke of description which he inherited from his early attachment to the concrete in the rush of words especially verbs in the concatenation of objects the ﬂow of things masse through his verse still with the impulse of the bright speed he had at the source in his theatrical impersonation of abstractions in the funeral of youth where once the abstract and the concrete are happily fused in all these there are the elements and in the last there is the perfection of mastery one thing he knew how to end it is with him dramatic secret the brief stroke does this work time and time again in his verse nowhere better than in at dead youth funeral all were there all except only love love had died long ago the poem is like vision of an old time masque the sweet lad rhyme ardour the sunlight on his greying hair beauty pale in her black she stood alone how vivid the lines owe something to his eye costume staging but mere picture writing it is ﬁrm if carved on an obelisk and he reconciled concrete and abstract here so he had left his short breath in those earlie r lines behind and had come into the long sweep and open water of great style and light on waving grass he knows not when and feet that ran but where he can not tell or and feel who have laid our groping hands away and see longer blinded by our eyes or more brieﬂy in wise majestic melancholy train and this and evening hush broken by homing wings such lines these apart from their beauty are in the best manner of english poetic style so in many minor ways he shufﬂed contrast and climax and the like adept in the handling of poetic rhetoric that he had come to be but in three ways he was conspicuously successful in his art the ﬁrst of these they are all in the larger forms of art is the dramatic sonnet by which i not mean merely sonnet in dialogue or advancing by simple contrast but one in which there may be these things but also there is tragic reversal or its equivalent not to consider it too curiously the collected poems of rupert brooke by rupert brooke https the hill this sonnet is beautiful in action and diction its eloquence speeds it on with lift the situation is the very crest of life then we shall go down with unreluctant tread into the darkness proud we were and laughed that had such brave true things to say and then you suddenly cried and turned away the dramatic sonnet in english has not gone beyond that beauty brevity tragic effect nor i add unspoken loyalty to reality reality was perhaps what he most dearly wished here he achieved it in many another sonnet he won the laurel but if i were to venture to choose it is in the dramatic handling of the sonnet that he is most individual and characteristic the second great success of his genius formally considered lay in the narrative idyl either in the miltonic way of ﬂashing bits of english country landscape before the eye in grantchester or by applying essentially the same method to the water world of ﬁshes or the south sea world both on philosophic background these are all master poems of kaleidoscopic beau ty and charm where the brief pictures play in and out of woven veil of thought irony mood with delightful intellectual pleasuring he thoroughly enjoys doing the poetical magic such bits of english retreats or paciﬁc paradises so full of idyllic charm exquisite in image and movement are among the rarest of poetic treasures the thought of milton and of marvell only adds an old world charm to the most modern of the works of the muses what lightness of touch what ease of movement what brilliancy of hue what vivacity throughout even in retrospect what actuality and the third success is what i should call the melange that is the method of indiscrimination by which he gathers up experience and pours it out again in language with full disregard of its relative values his good taste saves him from what in another would be shipwreck but this indifference to values this apparent lack of selection in material while at times it gives huddled ﬂow more than anything else moderni zes the verse it yields too an effect of abundant vitality and it makes facile the change from grave to gay and the like the melange i call it is rather an innovation in english verse and to be found only rarely it exists however and especially it was dear to keats in his youth it is by excellent taste and by style that the poet here overcomes its early difﬁculties in these three formal ways besides in minor matters it appears to that rupert brooke judged by the most orthodox standards had succeeded in poetry iii but in his ﬁrst notes if i may indulge my private taste i ﬁnd more of the intoxication of the god these early poems are the lyrical cries and luminous ﬂares of dawn doubt but they are incarnate of youth capital among them is blue evening it is original and complete in its whispering embraces of sense in the terror of seizure of the spirit in the tranquil euthanasia of the end by the touch of speechless beauty it seems to true symbol of life whole and entire it is beautiful in language and feeling with an extraordinary clarity and rise of power and above all though rare in experience it is real young poet poem but it has quality never captured by perfect art poem poets doubt but that is the best kind so too the poem entitled sleeping out charms and stirs with its golden clangors and crying ﬂames of emotion it mounts up to the white one ﬂame to the laughter and the lips of light it is like holy italian picture remote inaccessible

pronounce either to suit rhyme end of poems london october rupert br ooke biographical note any biographical account of rupert brooke must of necessity be brief yet it is well to know the facts of his romantic career and to see him far may be through the eyes of those who knew him the writer was unfortunately not of this number in order the better to appreciate his work he was born at rugby on august 3 1887 his father william brooke being an assistant master at the school here brooke was educated and in 1905 won prize poem called the bastille which has been described ﬁne ﬂuent stuff he took keen interest in every form of athletic sport and played both cricket and football the school though he afterwards dropped both these games he developed sound tennis player was great walker and found joy in swimming like byron and swinburne especially by night he delighted in the russian ballet and went again and again to good revue in 1906 he went up to king college cambridge where he made innumerable friends and was considered one of the leading intellectu als of his day among his peers being james elroy flecker himself poet of small achievement who died at davos only few months ago ivan lake the editor of the contemporary at cambridge tells that although the two men moved in different sets they frequented the same literary circles brooke however seldom if ever spoke at the union but was member of the cambridge fabian society and held the posts of secretary and president in turn his socialism was accompanied by passing phase of vegetarianism and with the ferment of youth working headily within him he could hardly escape the charge of being crank but crank if little thing makes revol utions and brooke youthful extravagances were utterly untinged with decadence he took his classical tripos in 1909 and after spending some time student in munich returned to live near cambridge at the old vicarage in the lovely hamlet grantchester it was there writes raglan somerset in letter i am privileged to quote that i used to wake him on sunday mornings to bathe in the dam above byron pool his bedroom was always littered with books english french and german in wild disorder about his bathing one thing stands out time after time he would try to dive he always failed and came absolutely ﬂat but seemed to like it although it must have hurt excessively this was only the collected poems of rupert brooke by rupert brooke https was learning later he became an accomplished diver then we used to go back and feed sometimes in the orchard and sometimes in the old vicarage garden on eggs and that particular brand of honey referred to in the chester poem in those days he always dressed in the same way cricket shirt and trousers and stockings in fact mobile toes were subject the admiration of his friends brooke occupied himself mainly with writing poems remarkable happy spontaneity such characterized the work of brown the manx poet appeared in the an the review the the revie w and the gazette students of the problem page in the westminster knew him brilliant competitor who infused the purely academic with the very spirit of youth to all who knew him the man himself was at least important his work to his talk i quote again from somerset he was spendthrift i mean that he never saved anything up those writer fellows so often he was quite inconsequent and just rippled on but was always ready to attack careless thinker on the other hand he was extremely tolerant of fools even bad poets who are the worst kind of fools or rather the hardest to bear but that was kindness of heart of his personal appearance good deal has been said one who knew him writing in one of the daily papers said that to look at he was part of the youth of the world he was one of the handsomest englishmen of his time his moods seemed to be merely disguise the radiance of an early summer day edward thomas speaks of him golden young apollo who made friends admirers adorers wherever he went he stretched himself out drew his ﬁngers through his waved fair hair laughed talked indolently and admired much he was admired he was tall broad and easy in his movements either he stooped or he thrust his head forward unusually much to look at you with his steady blue eyes on nevinson who in ﬂeeting editorial capacity sent brooke to come and discuss his poems he made similar impression suddenly he came an astonishing apparition in any newspaper ofﬁce loose hair of deep smooth ruddy face eyes not gray or but of living blue really like the sky and frankly open ﬁgure not very tall but ﬁrm and strongly made giving the sense of weight rather than of speed and yet so ﬁnely fashioned and healthy that it was impossible not to think of the line about spirit he was dressed just in the ordinary way except that he wore low blue collar and blue shirt and tie all uncommon in those days evidently he did not want to be conspicuous but the whole ef fect was almost ludicrously beautiful notions of height are always comparative and it will be noticed that nevinson and thomas differ in their ideas edward marsh however brooke executor and one of his closest friends indeed the friend of all young poets tells that he was about six feet so that all doubt on this minor point may be set at rest he had been in munich berlin and in italy and in may 1913 he left england again wander year passing through the united states and canada on his way to the south seas perhaps some of those who met him in boston and elsewhere will some day contribute their quota to the bright record of his life his own letters to the gazette though naturally of unequal merit were full of humorous delight in the new world in one of his travel papers he described the city of quebec having the radiance and repose of an immortal that in so many words wrote walter la mare brings back his living remembrance with him there was happy shining impression that he might have just come that very moment from another planet one well within the solar system but little more like utopia than ours not even stevenson it would seem excited greater enthusiasm among his friends and between the two men an interesting paral lel might be drawn brooke made pilgrimage to stevenson home in samoa and his life in the paciﬁc found full and happy expression in his verse his thoughts however turned longingly to england the land where men with splendid hearts may go and he reappeared from the ends of the earth among his friends apparently little changed one who gaily and laughingly goes to bed and gaily and laughingly comes down next morning after perfectly refreshing sleep then came the war well if armageddon on he said i suppose one shoul d be there it was characteristic way of putting it he obtained commission in the hood battalion of the royal naval division in september and was quickly ordered on the disastrous if heroic expedition the collected poems of rupert brooke by rupert brooke https here he had his ﬁrst experience of war lying some days in trenches shelled by the distant german guns then followed strange retreat by night along roads lit by the glare of burning towns and swarming with pitiful crowd s of belgian refugees yet walter la mare said of him when he returned from antwerp ulysses himself at the end of his voyagings was not more quietly accustomed to the shocks of novelty on brooke on many other young men to whom the gift of has perhaps been denied the war had swiftly maturing inﬂuence much of the impetuosity of youth fell away from him the boy who had been rather proud of his independent views friend relates how at the age of twelve he sat on the platform at meeting grew suddenly it seem ed into man ﬁlled with the love of life indeed but inspi red most of all with the love of england fortunately himself and us brooke patriotism found passionate voice in the sonnets which are rightly given pride of place in the 1914 section of this volume clement shorter who gives us the skeleton of bibliography that is all too brief draw s special attention to numbers quarterly publication issued in gloucestershire to which brooke contributed in february april august and december of last year his fellow poets being lascelles abercrombie john drinkwater and wilfrid wilson gibson he spent the winter in training at blandford camp in dorsetshire and sailed with the british mediterranean expeditionary force on the last day of february he had presentiment of his death but he went so many others have gone unstumbling unreluctant strong unknowing borne by will not his that lifts that grows sweeps out to darkness triumphing in his goal out of the fire out of the little room there is an end appointed my soul he never reached the dardanelles he went ﬁrst to lemnos and then to egypt early in april he had touch of sunstroke from which he recovered but he died from on board french hospital ship at scyros on friday april 23rd died england on the day of michael and saint geor ge he was buried at night by torchlight in an olive grove about mile inland if you go there writes stephen graham you will ﬁnd little wooden cross with just his name and the date of his birth and his death marked on it in black few days later the news of his death was published in the imes with the following appreciation writes rupert brooke is dead telegram from the admiral at lemnos tells us that this life has closed at the moment when it seemed to have reached its springtime voice had become audible note had been struck more true more thrilling more able to justice to the nobility of our youth in arms engaged in this present war than any other more able to express their thoughts of and with power to carry comfort to those who watch them so intently from afar the voice has been swiftly stilled only the echoes and the memory remain but they will linger during the last few months of his life months of preparation in gallant comr adeship and open air the told with all the simple force of genius the sorrow of youth about to die and the sure triumphant consolations of sincere and valiant spirit he expected to die he was willing to die the dear england whose beauty and majesty he knew and he advanced toward the brink in perfect serenity with absolute conviction of the rightness of his country cause and heart devoid of hate fellowmen the thoughts to which he gave expression in the very few incomparable war sonnets which he has left behind will be shared by many thousands of young men moving resolutely and blithely forward into this the hardest the cruellest and the of all the wars that men have fought they are whole history and revelation of rupert brooke himself joyous fearless versatile deeply instructed with classic symmetry of mind and body ruled by high undoubting purpose he was all that one would wish england noblest sons to be in days when sacriﬁce but the most precious is acceptable and the most precious is that which is most freely prof fered many probably guessed at the time was the rt hon winston spencer churchill personal friend and warm admirer of the poet many other tributes followed notably from an anonymous writer in the from walter la mare edward thomas holbrook jackson jack collings squire james douglas drinkwater gibson and lascelles abercrombie from most of these writers i have already quoted at some length but space must yet be found the last three the surviving members of the brilliant quartette who the collected poems of rupert brooke by rupert brooke https numbers drinkwater wrote follows there can have been man of his years in england who had at once so impressive personality and so inevitable an appeal to the affection of every one who knew him while there has not been i think so grievous loss to poetry since the death of shelley some of us who knew him may live to be old men but life is not likely to give us any richer memory than his and the passion and shapely zest that are in his work will pass safely to the memory of posterity wilfrid gibson tribute took the form of short poem called the going he gone i not understand i only know that he turned to go and waved his hand in his young eyes sudden glory shone and i was dazzled by sunset glow and he was gone lascelles abercrombie now perhaps the greatest of our younger poets and warm personal friend of brooke wrote at greater length the worst friend and enemy is but death if these poor limbs die safest of all so ended two of the ﬁve sonnets with the common title which rupert brooke wrote while he was in training between the antwerp expedition and sailing the aegean these sonnets are incomparably the ﬁnest utterance of english poetry concerning the great war we knew the splendid promise of rupert brooke earlier poetry these sonnets are the brief perfection of his achievement they are much more than that they are among the few supreme utterances of english patriotism it was natural perhaps that they should leave all else that has been written about the war so far behind it is not so much that they are the work of talent scarcely in its own way to be equalled day it was much more that they were the work of poet who had his material the feeling that he was giving up everything to ﬁght england the feeling i think that he was giving his life england reading these ﬁve sonnets now it seems if he had in them written his own epitaph i believe he thought so himself few words he said in my last talk with him makes believe that now at any rate the history of literature so full of fate exquisite ironies has nothing more poignantly ironic and nothing at the same time more beautifully appropriate than the publication of rupert brooke noble few swift weeks before the death they had imagined and had already made lovely each one of these ﬁve sonnets faces in quiet exultation the thought of death of death england and understands seldom even english poetry has understood the unspeakable beauty of the thought these laid the world away poured out the red sweet wine of youth gave up the years to be of work and joy and that unhoped serene that men call age and those who would have been their sons they gave their immortality i am strangely mistaken if the accent of the noblest english poetry does not speak to us in those lines and again if i should die think only this of that there some corner of foreign field that is ever england there shall be in that rich earth richer dust concealed dust whom england bore shaped made aware gave once her flowers to love her ways to roam body of england breathing breathing english air washed by the rivers blest by suns of home this this music this beauty this courage was rupert brooke but it is we may be sure his immortality it is not yet tolerable to speak of personal loss the name seemed to stand magical vitality that must be safe safe yes if these poor limbs die safest of all what poetry has lost in him can not be judged by any one who has not read those last sonnets now his farewell to england and the world i am not underrating the rest of his work there was an intellectual keenness and brightness in it ﬁre of imagery and in the best sense wit the like of which had not been known or known only in snatches in our literat ure since the best days of the later elizabethans and it was all penetrated by mastering passion the most elemental of all passions the passion life the collected poems of rupert brooke by rupert brooke https been so great lover he cries and artfully leads us on to think he means the usual passion of young poet career but it is just life he loves and not in any abstract sense but all the inﬁnite little familiar details of life catalogued with delighted jest this was profoundly sincere one ever loved life more wholly or more minutely and he celebrated his love exquisitely often unfor gettably through all his earlier poetry getting further intensity from long sojourn in the south seas but this passion life had never had seriously to ﬁght its rights and joys like all great lovers of life he had pleased himself with the thought of death and after death not insincerely by any means but simply because this gave ﬁner relish to the sense of being alive platonism which offers delightful games such subtle wit his he especially liked to play with it was one more element in the life of here and now the life of mortal thought and sense and spirit inﬁnitely varying and by him inﬁnitely loved and then came 1914 and his passion life had suddenly to face the thought of voluntary death but there was struggle instantly the passion life became one with the will to die and now it has become death itself but ﬁrst rupert brooke had told the world once more how the passion beautiful life
