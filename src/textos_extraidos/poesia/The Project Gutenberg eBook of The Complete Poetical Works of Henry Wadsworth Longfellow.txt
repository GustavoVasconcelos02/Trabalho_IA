children ran and ur ged on the oxen while in their little hands they clasped some fragments of playthings thus to the gaspereau mouth they hurried and there on the piled in confusion lay the household goods of the peasants all day long between the shore and the ships did the boats ply all day long the wains came laboring down from the village late in the afternoon when the sun was near to his setting echoed far the fields came the roll of drums from the churchyard thither the women and children thronged on sudden the opened and forth came the guard and marching in gloomy procession followed the but patient acadian farmers even pilgrims who journey afar from their homes and their country sing they go and in singing get they are weary and wayworn so with songs on their lips the acadian peasants descended down from the church to the shore amid their wives and their daughters foremost the young men came and raising together their voices sang with tremulous lips chant of the catholic missions sacred heart of the saviour inexhaustible fountain fill our hearts this day with strength and submission and patience then the old men they marched and the women that stood by the wayside joined in the sacred psalm and the birds in the sunshine above them mingled their notes therewith like voices of spirits departed down to the shore evangeline waited in silence not overcome with grief but strong in the hour of af fliction calmly and sadly she waited until the procession approached her and she beheld the face of gabriel pale with emotion team then filled her eyes and eagerly running to meet him clasped she his hands and laid her head on his shoulder and whispered gabriel be of good cheer if we love one another nothing in truth can harm us whatever mischances may happen smiling she spake these words then suddenly paused her father saw she slowly advancing alas how changed was his aspect gone was the glow from his cheek and the fire from his eye and his

evangeline sat with her father and in the flickering light beheld the face of the old man haggard and hollow and wan and without either thought or emotion the face of clock from which the hands have been taken vainly evangeline strove with words and caresses to cheer him vainly of fered him food yet he moved not he looked not he spake not but with vacant stare ever gazed at the flickering benedicite murmured the priest in tones of compassion more he fain would have said but his heart was full and his accents faltered and paused on his lips the feet of child on threshold hushed by the scene he beholds and the awful presence of sorrow silently therefore he laid his hand on the head of the maiden raising his tearful eyes to the silent stars that above them moved on their way unperturbed by the wrongs and sorrows of mortals then sat he down at her side and they wept together in silence suddenly rose from the south light in autumn the moon climbs the crystal walls of heaven

with the speed of the whirlwind or the loud bellowing herds of buf faloes rush to the river such was the sound that arose on the night the herds and the horses broke through their folds and fences and madly rushed the meadows overwhelmed with the sight yet speechless the priest and the maiden gazed on the scene of terror that reddened and widened before them and they turned at length to speak to their silent companion lo from his seat he had fallen and stretched abroad on the motionless lay his form from which the soul had departed slowly the priest uplifted the lifeless head and the maiden knelt at her father side and wailed aloud in her terror then in swoon she sank and lay with her head on his bosom through the long night she lay in deep oblivious slumber and when she woke from the trance she beheld multitude near her faces of friends she beheld that were mournfully gazing upon her pallid with tearful eyes and looks of saddest compassion still the blaze of the burning village illumined the landscape reddened the sky overhead and gleamed on the faces around her and like the day of doom it seemed to her wavering senses then familiar voice she heard it said to the people let us bury him here by the sea when happier season brings us again to our homes from the unknown land of our exile then shall his sacred dust be piously laid in the churchyard such were the words of the priest and there in haste by the having the glare of the burning village funeral torches but without bell or book they buried the farmer of and the voice of the priest repeated the service of sorrow

and every stroke of the oar now brought him nearer and nearer then in his place at the prow of the boat rose one of the oarsmen and signal sound if others like them peradventure sailed on those gloomy and midnight streams blew blast on his bugle wild through the dark colonnades and corridors leafy the blast rang breaking the seal of silence and giving tongues to the forest soundless above them the banners of moss just stirred to the music multitudinous echoes awoke and died in the distance over the watery floor and beneath the reverberant branches but not voice replied answer came from the darkness and when the echoes had ceased like sense of pain was the silence then evangeline slept but the boatmen rowed through the midnight silent at times then singing familiar canadian such they

the grim alligator thus ere another noon they emer ged from the shades and before them lay in the golden sun the lakes of the atchafalaya in myriads rocked on the slight undulations made by the passing oars and resplendent in beauty the lotus lifted her golden crown above the heads of the boatmen faint was the air with the odorous breath of magnolia blossoms and with the heat of noon and numberless sylvan islands fragrant and thickly embowered with blossoming hedges of roses near to whose shores they glided along invited to slumber soon by the fairest of these their weary oars were

unhappy and restless sought in the western wilds oblivion of self and of sorrow swiftly they glided along close under the lee of the island but by the opposite bank and behind screen of palmettos so that they saw not the boat where it lay concealed in the willows all undisturbed by the dash of their oars and unseen were the sleepers angel of god was there none to awaken the slumbering maiden swiftly they glided away like the shade of cloud on the prairie after the sound of their oars on the tholes had died in the distance from magic trance the sleepers awoke and the maiden said with sigh to the friendly priest father felician something says in my heart that near gabriel wanders is it foolish dream an idle and vague superstition or has an angel passed and revealed the truth to my spirit then with blush she added alas my credulous fancy unto ears like thine such words these have meaning but made answer the reverend man and he smiled he answered daughter thy words are not idle nor are they to without meaning feeling is deep and still and the word that floats on the surface is the tossing buoy that betrays where the anchor is hidden therefore trust to thy heart and to what

skies cloud with edges of silver floated the boat with its dripping oars on the motionless water filled was evangeline heart with inexpressible sweetness touched by the magic spell the sacred

shadow and sunshine ran near the tops of the trees but the house itself was in shadow and from its ascending and slowly expanding into the evening air thin blue column of smoke rose in the rear of the house from the garden gate ran pathway through the great groves of oak to the skirts of the limitless prairie into whose sea of flowers the sun was slowly descending full in his track of light like ships with shadowy canvas hanging loose from their spars in motionless calm in the tropics stood cluster of trees with tangled cordage of grapevines just where the woodlands met the flowery surf of the prairie mounted upon his horse with spanish saddle and stirrups sat herdsman arrayed in gaiters and doublet of deerskin broad and brown was the face that from under the spanish sombrero gazed on the peaceful scene with the lordly look of its master round about him were numberless herds of kine that were grazing quietly in the meadows and breathing the vapory freshness that uprose from the river and spread itself over the landscape slowly lifting the horn that hung at his side and expanding fully his broad deep chest he blew blast that resounded wildly and sweet and far through the still damp air of the evening suddenly out of the grass the long white horns of the cattle rose like flakes of foam on the adverse currents of ocean silent moment they gazed then bellowing rushed the prairie and the whole mass became cloud shade in the distance then the herdsman turned to the house through the gate of the garden saw he the forms of the priest and the maiden advancing to meet him suddenly down from his horse he sprang in amazement and forward rushed with extended arms and exclamations of wonder when they beheld his face they recognized basil the blacksmith hearty his welcome was he led his guests to the garden there in an arbor of roses with endless question and answer gave they vent to their hearts and renewed their friendly embraces laughing and weeping by turns or

said his voice grew blithe he said it be of good cheer my child it is only he departed foolish boy he has left alone with my herds and my horses moody and restless grown and tried and troubled his spirit could longer endure the calm of this quiet existence thinking ever of thee uncertain and sorrowful ever ever silent or speaking only of thee and his troubles he at length had become so tedious

hunting furs in the forests on rivers trapping the beaver therefore be of good cheer we will follow the fugitive lover he is not far on his way and the fates and the streams are against him up and away and through the red dew of the morning we will follow him fast and bring him back to his prison then glad voices were heard and up from the banks of the river borne aloft on his comrades arms came michael the fiddler long under basil roof had he lived like god on olympus having other care than dispensing music to mortals far renowned was he his silver locks and his fiddle long live michael they cried our brave acadian minstrel they bore him aloft in triumphal procession and straightway father felician advanced with evangeline greeting the old man kindly and oft and recalling the past while basil enraptured hailed with hilarious joy his old companions and gossips laughing loud and long and embracing mothers and daughters much they marvelled to see the wealth of the cidevant blacksmith all his domains and his herds and his patriarchal demeanor much they marvelled to hear his tales of the soil and the climate and of the prairie whose numberless herds were his who would take them each one thought in his heart that he too would go and likewise thus they ascended the steps and crossing the breezy veranda entered the hall of the house where already the supper of basil waited his late return and they rested and feasted together over the joyous feast the sudden darkness descended all was silent without and illuming the landscape with silver fair rose the dewy moon and the myriad stars but within doors brighter than these shone the faces of friends in the glimmering lamplight then from his station aloft at the head of the table the herdsman poured forth his heart and his wine together in endless profusion lighting his pipe that was filled with sweet natchitoches tobacco thus he spake to his guests who listened and smiled they listened welcome once more

homesteads burning your dwellings and barns and stealing your farms and your cattle speaking these words he blew wrathful cloud from his nostrils while his huge brown hand came thundering down on the table so that the guests all started and father felician astounded suddenly paused with pinch of snuf f to his nostrils but the brave basil resumed and his words were milder and gayer only beware of the fever my friends beware of the fever it is not like that of our cold acadian climate cured by wearing spider hung round one neck in nutshell then there were voices heard at the door and footsteps approaching sounded upon the stairs and the floor of the breezy veranda it was the neighboring creoles and small acadian planters who had been summoned all to the house of basil the herdsman merry the meeting was of ancient comrades and neighbors friend clasped friend in his arms and they who before were strangers meeting in exile became straightway friends to each other drawn by the gentle bond of common country together but in the neighboring hall strain of music proceeding from the accordant strings of michael melodious fiddle broke up all further speech away like children delighted all things gotten beside they gave themselves to the maddening whirl of the dizzy dance it swept and swayed to the music dreamlike with beaming eyes and the rush of fluttering garments meanwhile apart at the head of the hall the priest and the herdsman sat conversing together of past and present and future while evangeline stood like one entranced within her olden memories rose and loud in the midst of the music heard she the sound of the sea and an irrepressible sadness came her heart and unseen she stole forth into the garden beautiful was the night behind the black wall of the forest tipping its summit with silver arose the moon on the river fell here and there through the branches tremulous gleam of the moonlight like the sweet thoughts of love on darkened and devious spirit nearer and round about her the manifold flowers of the garden poured out their souls in odors that were their prayers and confessions unto the night it went its way like silent carthusian fuller of fragrance than they and heavy with shadows and hung the heart of the maiden the calm and the magical moonlight seemed to inundate her soul with indefinable longing through the garden gate and beneath the shade of the passed she along the path to the edge of the measureless prairie silent it lay with silvery haze upon it and gleaming and floating away in mingled and infinite numbers over her head the stars the thoughts of god in the heavens shone on the eyes of man who had ceased to marvel and worship save when blazing comet was seen on the walls of that temple if hand had appeared and written upon them upharsin and the soul of the maiden between the stars and the wandered alone and she cried gabriel my beloved art thou so near unto and yet i can not behold thee art thou so near unto and yet thy

whispered the oaks from oracular caverns of darkness and from the moonlit meadow sigh responded t bright rose the sun next day and all the flowers of the garden bathed his shining feet with their tears and anointed his tresses with the delicious balm that they bore in their vases of crystal farewell said the priest he stood at the shadowy threshold see that you bring us the prodigal son from his fasting and famine and too the foolish virgin who slept when the bridegroom was coming farewell answered the maiden and smiling with basil descended down to the river brink where the boatmen already were waiting thus beginning their journey with morning and sunshine and gladness swiftly they followed the flight of him who was speeding before them blown by the blast of fate like dead leaf over the desert not that day nor the next nor yet the day that succeeded found they trace of his course in lake or forest or river nor after many days had they found him but vague and uncertain rumors

guides the maiden and basil followed his flying steps and thought each day to him sometimes they saw or thought they saw the smoke of his rise in the morning air from the distant plain but at nightfall when they had reached the place they found only embers and ashes and though their hearts were sad at times and their bodies were weary hope still guided them on the magic fata mor gana

of sorrow and patience great her sorrow she was shawnee woman returning home to her people from the far of the cruel camanches where her canadian husband coureur had been murdered touched were their hearts at her story and warmest and friendliest welcome gave they with words of cheer and she sat and feasted among them on the buf and the venison cooked on the embers but when their meal was done and basil and all his companions worn with the long day march and the chase of the deer and the bison stretched themselves on the ground and slept where the quivering flashed on their swarthy cheeks and their forms wrapped up in their blankets then at the door of evangeline tent she sat and repeated slowly with soft low voice and the charm of her indian accent all the tale of her love with its pleasures and pains and reverses much evangeline wept at the tale and to know that another hapless heart like her own had loved and had been disappointed moved to the depths of her soul by pity and woman compassion yet in her sorrow pleased that one who had suf fered was near her she in turn related her love and all its disasters mute with wonder the shawnee sat and when she had ended still was mute but at length if mysterious horror passed through her brain she spake and repeated the tale of the mowis mowis the bridegroom of snow who won and wedded maiden but when the morning came arose and passed from the wigwam fading and melting away and dissolving into the sunshine till she beheld him more though she followed far into the forest then in those sweet low tones that seemed like weird incantation told she the tale of the fair lilinau who was wooed by phantom that through the pines her father lodge in the hush of the twilight breathed like the evening wind and whispered love to the

pain and indefinite terror the cold poisonous snake creeps into the nest of the swallow it was earthly fear breath from the region of spirits seemed to float in the air of night and she felt moment that like the indian maid she too was pursuing phantom with this thought she slept and the fear and the phantom had vanished early upon the morrow the march was resumed and the shawnee said they journeyed along on the western slope of these mountains dwells in his little village the black robe chief of the mission much he teaches the people and tells them of mary and jesus loud laugh their hearts with joy and weep with pain they hear him then with sudden and secret emotion evangeline answered let us go to the mission there good tidings await us thither they turned their steeds and behind spur of the mountains just the sun went down they heard murmur of voices and in meadow green and broad by the bank of river saw the tents of the christians the tents of the jesuit mission under towering oak that stood in the midst of the village knelt the black robe chief with his children crucifix fastened high on the trunk of the tree and overshadowed by grapevines looked with its agonized face on the multitude kneeling beneath it this was their rural chapel aloft through the intricate arches of its aerial roof arose the chant of their vespers mingling its notes with the soft susurrus

embrace him often his lips had essayed to speak imploring pardon all the old friendship came back with its tender and grateful emotions but his pride overmastered the nobler nature within him pride

she am i so much to blame that yesterday when you were pleading warmly the cause of another my heart impulsive and wayward pleaded your own and spake out getful perhaps of decorum certainly you can give speaking so frankly saying what i ought not to have said yet now i can never unsay it there are moments in life when the heart is so full of emotion that if by chance it be shaken or into its depths like pebble drops some careless word it overflows and its secret spilt on the ground like water can never be gathered together yesterday i was shocked when i heard you speak of miles standish praising his virtues transforming his very defects into virtues praising his courage and strength and even his fighting in flanders if by fighting alone you could win the heart of woman quite overlooking yourself and the rest in exalting your hero therefore i spake i did by an irresistible impulse you will give i hope the sake of the friendship between us which is too true and too sacred to be so easily broken thereupon answered john alden the scholar the friend of miles standish i was not angry with you with myself alone i was angry seeing how badly i managed the matter i had in my

the land with delight and memories sweet of the garden ah by these words i can see again interrupted the maiden how very little you prize or care what i am saying when from the depths of my heart in

more to is your friendship than all the love he could give were he twice the hero you think him then she extended her hand and alden who eagerly grasped it felt all the wounds in his heart that were aching and bleeding so sorely healed by the touch of that hand and he said with voice full of feeling yes we must ever be friends and of all who of fer you friendship let be ever the first the truest

wish almost it had remained untold my friends torquemada awful ghost came to in the dreams i dreamed and in the darkness glared and gleamed like great lighthouse on the coast the student laughing said

the legend beautiful thou stayed i must have ﬂed that is what the vision said in his chamber all alone kneeling on the ﬂoor of stone prayed the monk in deep contrition his sins of indecision prayed greater in temptation and in trial it was noonday by the dial and the monk was all alone suddenly if it lightened an unwonted splendor brightened all within him and without him in that narrow cell of stone and he saw the blessed vision of our lord with light elysian like vesture wrapped about him like garment round him thrown not cruciﬁed and slain not in agonies of pain not with bleeding hands and feet did the monk his master see but in the village street in the house or halt and lame and blind he healed when he walked in galilee in an attitude imploring hands upon his bosom crossed

look intent on the blessed vision bent slowly from his cell departed slowly on his errand went at the gate the poor were waiting looking through the iron grating with that terror in the eye that is only seen in those who amid their wants and woes hear the sound of doors that close and of feet that pass them by grown familiar with disfavor grown familiar with the savor of the bread by which men die but they knew not why like the gate of paradise seemed the convent sate to rise like sacrament divine seemed to them the bread and wine in his heart the monk was praying thinking of the homeless poor what they suffer and endure what we see not what we see and the inward voice was saying whatsoever thing thou doest to the least of mine and lowest that thou doest unto unto but had the vision come to him in beggar clothing come mendicant imploring would he then have knelt adoring or have listened with derision and have turned away with loathing thus his conscience put the question full of troublesome suggestion at length with hurried pace towards his cell he turned his face and beheld the convent bright with supernatural light like luminous cloud expanding over ﬂoor and wall and ceiling but he paused with feeling at the threshold of his door the vision still was standing he left it there before when the convent bell appalling from its belfry calling calling summoned him to feed the poor through the long hour intervening it had waited his return and he felt his bosom burn comprehending all the meaning when the blessed vision said hadst thou stayed i must have ﬂed

the sun shines into the ancient hall and makes glory round his hair the stretched beneath his chair groans in his sleep if in pain then wakes and yawns and sleeps again so silent is it everywhere so silent you can hear the mouse run and rummage along the beams behind the wainscot of the wall and the old man rouses from his dreams and wanders restless through the house if he heard strange voices call his footsteps echo along the ﬂoor of distant passage and pause awhile he is standing by an open door looking long with sad sweet smile into the room of his absent son there is the bed on which he lay there are the pictures bright and gay horses and hounds and seas there are his powder and gun and his in shape of fan the chair by the window where he sat with the clouded mat looking out on the pyrenees looking out on mount marbore and the seven valleys of lavedan ah he turns away and sighs there is mist before his eyes at night whatever the weather be wind or rain or starry heaven just the clock is striking seven those who look from the windows see the village curate with lantern and maid come through the gateway from the park and cross the courtyard damp and dark ring of light in ring of shade and now at the old man side he stands his voice is cheery his heart expands he gossips pleasantly by the blaze of the ﬁre of fagots about old days and cardinal mazarin and the fronde and the cardinal nieces fair and fond and what they did and what they said when they heard his eminence was dead and after pause the old man says his mind still coming back again to the one sad thought that

gallant company but among them is nowhere seen the brave young baron of castine he hath tarried behind i ween in the beautiful land of acadie and the father paces to and fro through the chambers of the old chateau waiting waiting to hear the hum of wheels on the road that runs below of servants hurrying here and there the voice in the courtyard the step on the stair waiting some one who doth not come but letters there are which the old man reads to the curate when he comes at night word by word an acolyte repeats his prayers and tells his beads letters full of the rolling sea full of young man joy to be abroad in the world alone and free full of adventures and wonderful scenes of hunting the deer through forests vast in the royal grant of pierre du gast of nights in the tents of the tarratines of madocawando the indian chief and his daughters glorious queens and beautiful beyond belief and so soft the tones of their native tongue the words are not spoken they are sung and the curate listens and smiling says ah yes dear friend in our young days we should have liked to hunt the deer all day amid those forest scenes and to sleep in the tents of the tarratines but now it is better sitting here within four walls and without the fear of losing our hearts to indian queens man is ﬁre and woman is tow and the somebody comes and begins to blow then gleam of distrust and vague surmise shines in the father gentle eyes on glimmers and vanishes again but naught he answers he only sighs and moment bows his head then their custom is they play their little gain of lansquenet and another day is with the dead another day and many day and many week and month depart when fatal letter wings its way across the sea like bird of prey and strikes and tears the old man heart lo the young baron of castine swift the wind is and wild has married dusky tarratine has married madocawando child the letter drops from the father hand though the sinews of his heart are wrung he utters cry he breathes prayer malediction falls from his tongue but his stately ﬁgure erect and grand bends and sinks like column of sand in the whirlwind of his great despair dying yes dying his latest breath of parley at the door of death is blessing on his wayward son lower and lower on his breast sinks his gray head he is at rest longer he waits any one many year the old chateau lies tenantless and desolate rank grasses in the courtyard grow about its gables caws the crow only the porter at the gate is left to guard it and to wait the coming of the rightful heir other life or sound is there more

through its showers he swept across the lombard plain beleaguering with his warlike train pavia the country pride and boast the city of the hundred towers thus heralded the tale began and thus in sober measure ran the poet tale charlemagne olger the dane and desiderio king of the lombards on lofty tower stood gazing northward the rolling plains league after league of harvests to the foot of the alps and saw approach mighty army thronging all the roads that led into the city and the king said unto olger who had passed his youth hostage at the court of france and knew the emperor form and face is charlemagne among that host and olger answered and still the innumerable multitude flowed onward and increased until the king cried in amazement surely charlemagne is coming in the midst of all these knights and olger answered slowly not yet he will not come so soon then much disturbed king desiderio asked what shall we if he approach with still greater army and olger answered when he shall appear you will behold what manner of man he is but what will then befall us i know not then came the guard that never knew repose the paladins of france and at the sight the lombard king with

indiscriminate ire that tangled and perplexed his thoughts but like hospitable host when strangers landed on the coast heated himself with ﬁre and hugged them in his arms and pressed their bodies to

then returned in haste but still essayed to tread the footprints she herself had made and she passed across the lighted space the emperor saw his daughter emma face he started not he did not speak or moan but seemed one who hath been turned to stone and stood there like statue nor awoke out of his trance of pain till morning broke till the stars faded and the moon went down and the towers and

he had not hidden himself nor ﬂed how should he pass the rainy day but in his barn with hens and hay or mending harness cart or sled now having come he needs must stay and tell his tale well they the landlord answered only these are logs from the dead of the old orchard planted here by the ﬁrst howe of sudbury nor oak nor maple has so clear ﬂame or burns so quietly or leaves an ash so clean and white thinking by this to put aside the impending tale that terriﬁed when suddenly to his delight the theologian interposed saying that when the door was closed and they had stopped that draft of cold unpleasant night air he proposed to tell tale apart from that the student had just told apart and yet akin showing that the human heart beats on forever of old well beneath the fold of quaker kerchief within sendal or silk or cloth of gold and without preface would begin and then the clamorous clock struck eight deliberate with sonorous chime slow measuring out the march of time like some grave consul of old rome in jupiter temple driving home the nails that marked the year and date thus interrupted in his rhyme the theologian needs must wait but quoted horace where he sings the dire necessity of things that drives into the roofs sublime of houses of the great the adamantine nails of fate when ceased the little carillon to herald from its wooden tower the important transit of the hour the theologian hastened on content to be all owed at last to sing his idyl of the past the theologian tale elizabeth i ah how short are the days how soon the night overtakes us in the old country the twilight is longer but here in the forest suddenly comes the dark with hardly pause in its coming hardly moment between the two lights the day and the lamplight yet how grand is the winter how spotless the snow is and perfect thus spake elizabeth haddon at nightfall to hannah the housemaid in the kitchen that served kitchen and parlor by the window she sat with her work and looked on landscape white the great white sheet that peter saw in his vision by the four corners let down and descending out of the heavens covered with snow were the forests of pine and the fields and the meadows nothing was dark but the sky and the distant delaware flowing down from its native hills peaceful and bountiful river the project gutenberg ebook of the complete poetical works of henry wadsworth longfellow https then with smile on her lips made answer hannah the housemaid beautiful winter yea the winter is beautiful surely if one could only walk like fly with one feet on the ceiling but the great delaware river is not like the thames we saw it out of our upper windows in rotherhithe street in the borough crowded with masts and sails of vessels coming and going here there is nothing but pines with patches of snow on their branches there is snow in the air and see it is falling already all the roads will be blocked and i pity joseph breaking his way through the drifts with his sled and oxen and then too how in all the world shall we get to meeting on but elizabeth checked her and answered mildly reproving surely the lord will provide unto the snow he sayeth be thou on the earth the good lord sayeth he is it giveth snow like wool like ashes scatters the hoar so she folded her work and laid it away in her basket meanwhile hannah the housemaid had closed and fastened the shutters spread the cloth and lighted the lamp on the table and placed there plates and cups from the dresser the brown rye loaf and the butter fresh from the dairy and then protecting her hand with holder took from the crane in the chimney the steaming and simmering kettle poised it aloft in the air and filled up the earthen teapot made in delft and adorned with quaint and wonderful figures then elizabeth said lo joseph is long on his errand i have sent him away with hamper of food and of clothing the poor in the village good lad and cheerful is joseph in the right place is his heart and his hand is ready and willing thus in praise of her servant she spake and hannah the housemaid laughed with her eyes she listened but governed her tongue and was silent while her mistress went on the house is far from the village we should be lonely here were it not friends that in passing sometimes tarry and make us glad by their coming thereupon answered hannah the housemaid the thrifty the frugal yea they come and they tarry if thy house were tavern open to all are its doors and they come and go like the pigeons in and out of the holes of the over the hayloft cooing and smoothing their feathers and basking themselves in the sunshine but in meekness of spirit and calmly elizabeth answered all i have is the lord not mine to give or withhold it i but distribute his gifts to the poor and to those of his people who in journeyings often surrender their lives to his service his not mine are the gifts and only so far can i make them mine in giving i add my heart to whatever is given therefore my excellent father first built this house in the clearing though he came not himself i came the lord was my guidance leading here this service we must not grudge then to others ever the cup of cold water or crumbs that fall from our table thus rebuked season was silent the penitent housemaid and elizabeth said in tones even sweeter and softer dost thou remember hannah the great in london when i was still child how we sat in the silent assembly the project gutenberg ebook of the complete poetical works of henry wadsworth longfellow https upon the lord in patient and passive submission one spake till at length young man stranger john estaugh moved by the spirit rose if he were john the apostle speaking such words of power that they bowed our hearts strong wind bends the grass of the fields or grain that is ripe the sickle thoughts of him have been oft borne inward upon wherefore i not know but strong is the feeling within that once more i shall see face i have never gotten ii she spake they heard the musical jangle of first far of f with dreamy sound and faint in the distance then growing nearer and louder and turning into the farmyard till it stopped at the door with sudden creaking of runners then there were voices heard of two men talking together and to herself she listened upbraiding said hannah the housemaid it is joseph come back and i wonder what stranger is with him down from its nail she took and lighted the great tin lantern pierced with holes and round and roofed like the top of lighthouse and went forth to receive the coming guest at the doorway casting into the dark network of glimmer and shadow over the falling snow the yellow sleigh and the horses and the forms of men looming gigantic then giving joseph the lantern she entered the house with the stranger youthful he was and tall and his cheeks aglow with the night air and he entered elizabeth rose and going to meet him if an unseen power had announced and preceded his presence and he had come one whose coming had long been expected quietly gave him her hand and said thou art welcome john estaugh and the stranger replied with staid and quiet behavior dost thou remember still elizabeth after so many years have passed it seemeth wonderful thing that i find thee surely the hand of the lord conducted here to thy threshold i journeyed along and pondered alone and in silence on his ways that are past finding out i saw in the seemingly weary with travel wayfarer who by the wayside paused and waited forthwith i remembered queen candace eunuch how on the way that goes down from jerusalem unto gaza reading esaias the prophet he journeyed and spake unto philip praying him to come up and sit in his chariot with him so i greeted the man and he mounted the sledge beside and we talked on the way he told of thee and thy homestead how being led by the light of the spirit that never deceiveth full of zeal the work of the lord thou hadst come to this country and i remembered thy name and thy father and mother in england and on my journey have stopped to see thee elizabeth haddon wishing to strengthen thy hand in the labors of love thou art doing and elizabeth answered with confident voice and serenely looking into his face with her innocent eyes she answered surely the hand of the lord is in it his spirit hath led thee out of the darkness and storm to the light and peace of my fireside then with stamping of feet the door was opened and joseph entered bearing the lantern and carefully blowing the light out rung it up on its nail and all sat down to their supper the project gutenberg ebook of the complete poetical works of henry wadsworth longfellow https underneath that roof was distinction of persons but one family only one heart one hearth and one household when the supper was ended they drew their chairs to the fireplace spacious profuse of flame and of firewood lord of forests unfelled and not gleaner of fagots spreading its arms to embrace with inexhaustible bounty all who fled from the cold exultant laughing at winter only hannah the housemaid was busy in clearing the table coming and going and hustling about in closet and chamber then elizabeth told her story again to john estaugh going far back to the past to the early days of her childhood how she had waited and watched in all her doubts and besetments comforted with the extendings and holy sweet inflowings of the spirit of love till the voice imperative sounded and she obeyed the voice and cast in her lot with her people here in the desert land and god would provide the issue meanwhile joseph sat with folded hands and demurely listened or seemed to listen and in the silence that followed nothing was heard while but the step of hannah the housemaid walking the floor overhead and setting the chambers in order and elizabeth said with smile of compassion the maiden hath light heart in her breast but her feet are heavy and awkward inwardly joseph laughed but governed his tongue and was silent then came the hour of sleep death counterfeit nightly rehearsal of the great silent assembly the meeting of shadows where man speaketh but all are still and the peace and rest are unbroken silently over that house the blessing of slumber descended but when the morning dawned and the sun uprose in his splendor breaking his way through clouds that encumbered his path in the heavens joseph was seen with his sled and oxen breaking pathway through the drifts of snow the horses already were harnessed and john estaugh was standing and taking leave at the threshold saying that he should return at the meeting in may while above them hannah the housemaid the homely was looking out of the attic laughing aloud at joseph then suddenly closing the casement the bird in peeps out of its window then disappears again and closes the shutter behind it iii now was the winter gone and the snow and robin the redbreast boasted on bush and tree it was he it was he and other that had covered with leaves the babes in the wood and blithely all the birds sang with him and little cared his boasting or his babes in the wood or the cruel uncle and only sang the mates they had chosen and cared the nests they were building with them but more sedately and meekly elizabeth haddon sang in her inmost heart but her lips were silent and songless thus came the lovely spring with rush of blossoms and music flooding the earth with flowers and the air with melodies vernal then it came to pass one pleasant morning that slowly up the road there came cavalcade of pilgrims men and women wending their way to the quarterly the project gutenberg ebook of the complete poetical works of henry wadsworth longfellow https the neighboring town and with them came riding john estaugh at elizabeth door they stopped to rest and alighting tasted the currant wine and the bread of rye and the honey brought from the hives that stood by the sunny wall of the garden then remounted their horses refreshed and continued their journey and elizabeth with them and joseph and hannah the housemaid but they started elizabeth lingered little and leaning over her horse neck in whisper said to john estaugh tarry awhile behind i have something to tell thee not to be spoken lightly nor in the presence of others them it concerneth not only thee and it concerneth and they rode slowly along through the woods conversing together it was pleasure to breathe the fragrant air of the forest it was pleasure to live on that bright and happy may morning then elizabeth said though still with certain reluctance if impelled to reveal secret she fain would have guarded i will longer conceal what is laid upon to tell thee i have received from the lord char ge to love thee john estaugh and john estaugh made answer surprised by the words she had spoken pleasant to are thy converse thy ways thy meekness of spirit pleasant thy frankness of speech and thy soul immaculate whiteness love without dissimulation holy and inward adorning but i have yet light to lead voice to direct when the lord work is done and the toil and the labor completed he hath appointed to i will gather into the stillness of my own heart awhile and listen and wait his guidance then elizabeth said not troubled nor wounded in spirit so is it best john estaugh we will not speak of it further it hath been laid upon to tell thee this thou art going away across the sea and i know not when i shall see thee more but if the lord hath decreed it thou wilt return again to seek here and to find and they rode onward in silence and entered the town with the others iv ships that pass in the night and speak each other in passing only signal shown and distant voice in the darkness so on the ocean of life we pass and speak one another only look and voice then darkness again and silence now went on of old the quiet life of the homestead patient and unrepining elizabeth labored in all things mindful not of herself but bearing the burdens of others always thoughtful and kind and untroubled and hannah the housemaid diligent early and late and rosy with washing and scouring still of old disparaged the eminent merits of joseph and was at times reproved her light and frothy behavior her shy looks and her careless words and her evil surmisings being pressed down somewhat like cart with sheaves overladen she would sometimes say to joseph quoting the scriptures meanwhile john estaugh departed across the sea and departing carried hid in his heart secret sacred and precious filling its chambers with fragrance and seeming to him in its the project gutenberg ebook of the complete poetical works of henry wadsworth longfellow https ointment of spikenard that filled all the house with its odor lost days of delight that are wasted in

hand that trembled little promising to be kind and true and faithful in all things such were the of john and elizabeth estaugh and not otherwise joseph the honest the diligent servant sped in his bashful wooing with homely hannah the housemaid when he asked her the question she answered nay and then added but thee may make believe and see what will come of it joseph interlude pleasant and winsome tale the student said though somewhat pale and quiet in its coloring if it caught its tone and air from the gray suits that quakers wear yet worthy of some german bard hebel or voss or eberhard who love of humble themes to sing in humble verse but more true than was the tale i told to you the theologian made reply and with some warmth that i deny is invention of my own but something well and widely known to readers of riper age writ by the skilful hand that wrote the indian tale of hobomok and philothea classic page i found it like waif aﬂoat or dulse uprooted from its rock on the swift tides that ebb and ﬂow in daily papers and at ﬂood bear freighted vessels to and fro but later when the ebb is low leave long waste of sand and mud it matters little quoth the jew the cloak of truth is lined with lies sayeth some proverb old and wise and love is master of all arts and puts it into human hearts the strangest things to say and and here the controversy closed abruptly ere was well begun the sicilian interposed with lordl ings listen every one that listen may unto tale that merrier than the nightingale tale that can not boast forsooth single rag or shred of truth that does not leave the mind in doubt to the with it or without naked falsehood and absurd mortal ever told or heard therefore i tell it or maybe simply because it pleases the sicilian tale the monk of the project gutenberg ebook of the complete poetical works of henry wadsworth longfellow https on time some centuries ago in the hot sunshine two franciscan friars wended their weary way with footsteps slow back to their convent whose white walls and spires gleamed on the hillside like patch of snow covered with dust they were and torn by briers and bore like sumpter upon their backs the badge of poverty their beggar sacks the first was brother anthony spare and silent man with pallid cheeks and thin much given to vigils penance fasting prayer solemn and gray and worn with discipline if his body but white ashes were heaped on the living coals that glowed within simple monk like many of his day whose instinct was to listen and obey different man was brother timothy of lar ger mould and of coarser paste rubicund and stalwart monk was he broad in the shoulders broader in the waist who often filled the dull refectory with noise by which the convent was disgraced but to the gave but little heed by reason he had never learned to read now they passed the outskirts of wood they saw with mingled pleasure and surprise fast tethered to tree an ass that stood lazily winking his lar ge limpid eyes the farmer gilbert of that neighborhood his owner was who looking supplies of fagots deeper in the wood had strayed leaving his beast to ponder in the shade soon brother timothy espied the patient animal he said thus our needs doth providence provide we lay our wallets on the creature back this being done he leisurely untied from head and neck the halter of the jack and put it round his own and to the tree stood tethered fast if the ass were he and bursting forth into merry laugh he cried to brother anthony way and drive the ass before you with your staf f and when you reach the convent you may say you left at farm half tired and half ill with fever night and day and that the farmer lent this ass to bear our wallets that are heavy with good fare now brother anthony who knew the pranks of brother timothy would not persuade or reason with him on his quirks and cranks but being obedient silently obeyed and smiting with his staf f the ass the project gutenberg ebook of the complete poetical works of henry wadsworth longfellow https drove him before him over hill and glade safe with his provend to the convent gate leaving poor brother timothy to his fate then gilbert laden with fagots his fire forth issued from the wood and stood aghast to see the ponderous body of the friar standing where he had left his donkey last trembling he stood and dared not venture nigher but stared and gaped and crossed himself full fast being credulous and of little wit he thought it was some demon from the pit while speechless and bewildered thus he gazed and dropped his load of fagots on the ground quoth brother timothy be not amazed that where you left donkey should be found poor franciscan friar and crazed standing demure and with halter bound but set free and hear the piteous story of brother timothy of i am sinful man although you see i wear the consecrated cowl and cape you never owned an ass but you owned changed and transformed from my own natural shape all the deadly sin of gluttony from which i could not otherwise escape than by this penance dieting on grass and being worked and beaten an ass think of the ignominy i endured think of the miserable life i led the toil and blows to which i was inured my wretched lodging in windy shed my scanty fare so grudgingly procured the damp and musty straw that formed my bed but having done this penance my sins my life man and monk again begins the simple gilbert hearing words like these was and fell down apace before the friar upon his bended knees and with suppliant voice implored his grace and the good monk now very much at ease granted him pardon with smiling face nor could refuse to be that night his guest it being late and he in need of rest upon hillside where the olive thrives with figures painted on its walls the cottage stood and near the humming hives made murmurs of far waterfalls place where those who love secluded lives might live content and free from noise and brawls like claudian old man of verona here measure by fruits the year the project gutenberg ebook of the complete poetical works of henry wadsworth longfellow https coming to this cottage of content they found his children and the buxom wench his wife dame cicely and his father bent with years and labor seated on bench repeating over some obscure event in the old wars of milanese and french all welcomed the franciscan with sense of sacred awe and humble reverence when gilbert told them what had come to pass how beyond question cavil or surmise good brother timothy had been their ass you should have seen the wonder in their eyes you should have heard them cry alas alas have heard their lamentations and their sighs all believed the story and began to see saint in this af flicted man forthwith there was prepared grand repast to satisfy the craving of the friar after so rigid and prolonged fast the bustling housewife stirred the kitchen fire then her two barnyard fowls her best and last were put to death at her express desire and served up with salad in bowl and flasks of country wine to crown the whole it would not be believed should i repeat how hungry brother timothy appeared it was pleasure but to see him eat his white teeth flashing through his russet beard his face aglow and flushed with wine and meat his roguish eyes that rolled and laughed and leered lord how he drank the country wine if the village vintage were divine and all the while he talked without surcease and told his merry tales with jovial glee that never flagged but rather did increase and laughed aloud if insane were he and wagged his red beard matted like fleece and cast such glances at dame cicely that gilbert now grew angry with his guest and thus in words his rising wrath expressed good father said he easily we see how needful in some persons and how right mortification of the flesh may be the indulgence you have given it after long penance clearly proves to your strength against temptation is but slight and shows the dreadful peril you are in of relapse into your deadly sin morning with the rising sun go back unto your convent nor refrain from fasting and from scour ging you run great danger to become an ass again since monkish flesh and asinine are one the project gutenberg ebook of the complete poetical works of henry wadsworth longfellow https therefore be wise nor longer here remain unless you wish the scour ge should be applied by other hands that will not spare your hide when this the monk had heard his color fled and then returned like lightning in the air till he was all one blush from foot to head and even the bald spot in his russet hair turned from its usual pallor to bright red the old man was asleep upon his chair then all retired and sank into the deep and helpless imbecility of sleep they slept until the dawn of day drew near till the cock should have crowed but did not crow they had slain the shining chanticleer and eaten him supper you know the monk was up betimes and of good cheer and having breakfasted made haste to go if he heard the distant matin bell and had but little time to say farewell fresh was the morning the breath of kine odors of herbs commingled with the sweet balsamic exhalations of the pine haze was in the air presaging heat uprose the sun above the apennine and all the misty valleys at its feet were full of the delirious song of birds voices of men and bells and low of herds all this to brother timothy was naught he did not care scenery nor here his busy fancy found the thing it sought but when he saw the convent walls appear and smoke from kitchen chimneys upward caught and whirled aloft into the atmosphere he quickened his slow footsteps like beast that scents the stable league of f at least and he entered though the convent gate he saw there in the court the ass who stood twirling his ears about and seemed to wait just he found him waiting in the wood and told the prior that to alleviate the daily labors of the brotherhood the owner being man of means and thrift bestowed him on the convent gift and thereupon the prior many days revolved this serious matter in his mind and turned it over many dif ferent ways hoping that some safe issue he might find but stood in fear of what the world would say if he accepted presents of this kind employing beasts of burden the packs that lazy monks should carry on their the project gutenberg ebook of the complete poetical works of henry wadsworth longfellow https to avoid all scandal of the sort and stop the mouth of cavil he decreed that he would cut the tedious matter short and sell the ass with all convenient speed thus saving the expense of his support and hoarding something time of need so he despatched him to the neighboring fair and freed himself from cumber and from care it happened now by chance some might say others perhaps would call it destiny gilbert was at the fair and heard bray and nearer came and saw that it was he and whispered in his ear ah lackaday good father the rebellious flesh i see has changed you back into an ass again and all my admonitions were in vain the ass who felt this breathing in his ear did not turn round to look but shook his head if he were not pleased these words to hear and contradicted all that had been said and this made gilbert cry in voice more clear i know you well your hair is not deny it you are the same franciscan friar and timothy by name the ass though now the secret had come out was obstinate and shook his head again until crowd was gathered round about to hear this dialogue between the twain and raised their voices in noisy shout when gilbert tried to make the matter plain and flouted him and mocked him all day long with laughter and with jibes and scraps of song if this be brother timothy they cried buy him and feed him on the tenderest grass thou canst not too much one so tried to be twice transformed into an ass so simple gilbert bought him and untied his halter and mountain and morass he led him homeward talking he went of good behavior and mind content the children saw them coming and advanced shouting with joy and hung about his neck not gilbert but the ass him danced and wove green garlands to deck his sacred person again it chanced their childish feelings without rein or check could not discriminate in any way donkey from friar of orders gray brother timothy the

one day when simple kindness is misunderstood little flagellation may good his many vices need not here be told among them was habit that he had of flinging up his heels at young and old breaking his halter running of f like mad and meadow wood and wold and other misdemeanors quite bad but worst of all was breaking from his shed at night and ravaging the so brother timothy went back once more to his old life of labor and distress was beaten worse than he had been before and now instead of comfort and caress came labors manifold and trials sore and his toils increased his food grew less until at last the great consoler death ended his many suf ferings with his breath great was the lamentation when he died and mainly that he died impenitent dame cicely bewailed the children cried the old

saying things that made one think of courts and kings and lords and ladies of high degree so that not having been at court seemed something very little short of treason or majesty such an accomplished knight was he his dwelling was just beyond the town at what he called his careless of fortune smile or frown and weary grown of the world and its ways he wished to pass the rest of his days in private life and calm retreat but double life was the life he led and while professing to be in search of godly course and willin g he said nay anxious to join the puritan church he made of all this but small
