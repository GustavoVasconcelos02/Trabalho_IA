imprecations rang through the house of prayer and high the heads of the others rose with his arms uplifted the ﬁgure of basil the blacksmith on stormy sea spar is tossed by the billows flushed was his face and distorted with passion and wildly he shouted down with the tyrants of england we never have sworn them allegiance death to these foreign soldiers who seize on our homes and our harvests more

in the hearts of his people sank they and sobs of contrition succeeded the passionate outbreak and they repeated his prayer and said father forgive them then came the evening service the tapers

souls with devotion translated rose on the ardor of prayer like elijah ascending to heaven meanwhile had spread in the village the tidings of ill and on all sides wandered wailing from house to house the women and children long at her father door evangeline stood with her right hand shielding her eyes from the level rays of the sun that descending lighted the village street with mysterious

stood the tankard of ale and the cheese fresh brought from the dairy and at the head of the board the great of the farmer thus did evangeline wait at her father door the sunset threw the long shadows of trees the broad ambrosial meadows ah on her spirit within deeper shadow had fallen and from the ﬁelds of her soul fragrance celestial ascended charity meekness love and hope and giveness and

overcome by emotion gabriel cried she aloud with tremulous voice but answer came from the graves of the dead nor the gloomier grave of the living slowly at length she returned to the tenantless house of her father smouldered the ﬁre on the hearth on the board stood the supper untasted empty and drear was each room and haunted with phantoms of terror sadly echoed her step on the stair and the ﬂoor of her chamber in the dead of the night she heard the whispering rain fall loud on the withered leaves of the by the window keenly the lightning ﬂashed and the voice of the echoing thunder told her that god was in heaven and governed the world he created the project gutenberg ebook of evangeline tale of acadie by henry wadsworth longfellow https then she remembered the tale she had heard of the

the soon the yellow ﬁelds in silent and mournful procession came from the neighboring hamlets and farms the acadian women driving in ponderous wains their household goods to the pausing and looking back to gaze once more on their dwellings ere they were shut from sight by the winding road and the woodland close at their sides their children ran and ur ged on the oxen while in their little hands they clasped some fragments of playthings thus to the gaspereau mouth they hurried and there on the piled in confusion lay the household goods of the peasants all day long between the shore and the ships did the boats ply all day long the wains came laboring down from the village late in the afternoon when the sun was near to his setting echoed far the ﬁelds came the roll of drums from the churchyard thither the women and children thronged on sudden the opened and forth came the guard and marching in gloomy procession followed the but patient acadian farmers even pilgrims who journey afar from their homes and their country sing they go and in singing get they are weary and wayworn so with songs on their lips the acadian peasants descended down from the church to the shore amid their wives and their daughters foremost the young men came and raising together their voices sang they with tremulous lips chant of the catholic missions sacred heart of the saviour inexhaustible fountain fill our hearts this day with strength and submission and patience then the old men they marched and the women that stood by the wayside joined in the sacred psalm and the birds in the sunshine above them mingled their notes therewith like voices of spirits departed down to the shore evangeline waited in silence not overcome with grief but strong in the hour of afﬂiction calmly and sadly she waited until the procession approached her and she beheld the face of gabriel pale with emotion tears then ﬁlled her eyes and eagerly running to meet him clasped she his hands and laid her head on his shoulder and whispered gabriel be of good cheer if we love one another nothing in truth can harm us whatever mischances may happen smiling she spake these words then suddenly paused her the project gutenberg ebook of evangeline tale of acadie by henry wadsworth longfellow https saw she slowly advancing alas how changed was his aspect gone was the glow from his cheek and the ﬁre from his eye and his footstep heavier seemed with the weight of the heavy heart in his bosom but with smile and sigh she clasped his neck and embraced him speaking words of endearment where words of comfort availed not thus to the gaspereau mouth moved on that mournful procession there disorder prevailed and the tumult and stir of embarking busily plied the freighted boats and in the confusion wives were torn from their husbands and mothers too late saw their children left on the land extending their arms with wildest entreaties so unto separate ships were basil and gabriel carried while in despair on the shore evangeline stood with her father half the task was not done when the sun went down and the twilight deepened and darkened around and in haste the reﬂuent ocean fled away from the

priest consoling and blessing and cheering like unto shipwrecked paul on melita desolate thus he approached the place where evangeline sat with her father and in the ﬂickering light beheld the face of the old man haggard and hollow and wan and without either thought or emotion the face of clock from which the hands have been taken vainly evangeline strove with words and caresses to cheer him vainly of fered him food yet he moved not he looked not he spake not but with vacant stare ever gazed at the ﬂickering benedicite murmured the priest in tones of compassion more he fain would have said but his heart was full and his the project gutenberg ebook of evangeline tale of acadie by henry wadsworth longfellow https faltered and paused on his lips the feet of child on threshold hushed by the scene he beholds and the awful presence of sorrow silently therefore he laid his hand on the head of the maiden raising his eyes full of tears to the silent stars that above them moved on their way unperturbed by the wrongs and sorrows of mortals then sat he down at her side and they wept together in silence suddenly rose from the south light in autumn the moon climbs the crystal walls of heaven

with tangled cordage of just where the woodlands met the ﬂowery surf of the prairie mounted upon his horse with spanish saddle and stirrups sat herdsman arrayed in gaiters and doublet of deerskin

in the meadows and breathing the vapory freshness that uprose from the river and spread itself over the landscape slowly lifting the horn that hung at his side and expanding fully his broad deep chest he blew blast that resounded wildly and sweet and far through the still damp air of the evening suddenly out of the grass the long white horns of the cattle rose like ﬂakes of foam on the adverse currents of ocean silent moment they gazed then bellowing rushed the prairie and the whole mass became cloud shade in the distance then the herdsman turned to the house through the gate of the garden

he is not far on his way and the fates and the streams are against him up and away and through the red dew of the morning we will follow him fast and bring him back to his prison then glad voices were

mortals far renowned was he his silver locks and his ﬁddle long live michael they cried our brave acadian minstrel they bore him aloft in triumphal procession and straightway father felician advanced

of the prairies whose numberless herds were his who would take them each one thought in his heart that he too would go and likewise thus they ascended the steps and crossing the airy veranda entered the hall of the house where already the supper of basil waited his late return and they rested and feasted together over the joyous feast the sudden darkness descended all was silent without and illuming the landscape with silver fair rose the dewy moon and the myriad stars but within doors brighter than these shone the faces of friends in the glimmering lamplight then from his station aloft at the head of the table the herdsman poured forth his heart and his wine together in endless profusion lighting his pipe that was ﬁlled with sweet natchitoches tobacco thus he spake to his guests who

round one neck in nutshell then there were voices heard at the door and footsteps approaching sounded upon the stairs and the ﬂoor of the breezy veranda it was the neighboring creoles and small acadian planters who had been summoned all to the house of basil the herdsman merry the meeting was of ancient comrades and neighbors friend clasped friend in his arms and they who before were strangers meeting in exile became straightway friends to each other drawn by the gentle bond of common country together but in the neighboring hall strain of music proceeding from the accordant strings of michael melodious ﬁddle broke up all further speech away like children delighted all things gotten beside they gave themselves to the maddening whirl of the dizzy dance it swept and swayed to the music dreamlike with beaming eyes and the rush of ﬂuttering garments meanwhile apart at the head of the hall the priest and the herdsman sat conversing together of past and present and future while evangeline stood like one entranced within her olden memories rose and loud in the midst of the music heard she the sound of the sea and an irrepressible sadness came her heart and unseen she

maiden and smiling with basil descended down to the river brink where the boatmen already were waiting thus beginning their journey with morning and sunshine and gladness swiftly they followed the ﬂight of him who was speeding before them blown by the blast of fate like dead leaf over the desert not that day nor the next nor yet the day that succeeded found they trace of his course in lake or forest or river nor after many days had they found him but vague and uncertain rumors alone were their guides through wild and desolate country till at the little inn of the spanish town of adayes

basil and all his companions worn with the long day march and the chase of the deer and the bison stretched themselves on the ground and slept where the quivering flashed on their swarthy cheeks and their forms wrapped up in their blankets then at the door of evangeline tent she sat and repeated slowly with soft low voice and the charm of her indian accent all the tale of her love with its pleasures and pains and reverses much evangeline wept at the tale and to know that another hapless heart like her own had loved and had been disappointed moved to the depths of her soul by pity and woman compassion yet in her sorrow pleased that one who had suf fered was near her she in turn related her love and all its disasters mute with wonder the shawnee sat and when she had ended still was mute but at length if mysterious horror passed through her brain she spake and repeated the tale of the mowis mowis the bridegroom of snow who won and wedded maiden but when the morning came arose and

incantation told she the tale of the fair lilinau who was wooed by phantom that through the pines her father lodge in the hush of the twilight breathed like the evening wind and whispered love to the maiden till she followed his green and waving plume through the forest and never more returned nor was seen again by her people silent with wonder and strange surprise evangeline listened to the soft ﬂow of her magical words till the region around her seemed like enchanted ground and her swarthy guest the enchantress slowly over the tops of the ozark mountains the moon rose lighting the little

hearts with joy and weep with pain they hear him then with sudden and secret emotion evangeline answered let us go to the mission there good tidings await us thither they turned their steeds and behind spur of the mountains just the sun went down they heard murmur of voices and in meadow green and broad by the bank of river saw the tents of the christians the tents of the jesuit mission under towering oak that stood in the midst of the village knelt the black robe chief with his children cruciﬁx fastened high on the trunk of the tree and overshadowed by looked with its agonized face on the multitude kneeling beneath it this was their rural chapel aloft through the intricate arches of its aerial roof arose the chant of their vespers mingling its notes with the soft susurrus and sighs of the branches silent with heads uncovered the travellers nearer approaching knelt on the swarded ﬂoor and joined in the evening devotions but when the service was done and the benediction had fallen forth from the hands of the priest like seed from the hands of the sower slowly the reverend man advanced to the strangers and bade them welcome and when they replied he smiled with benignant expression hearing the homelike sounds of his mother in the forest and with words of kindness conducted them into his wigwam there upon mats and skins they reposed and on cakes of the feasted and slaked their thirst from the water of the teacher soon was their story told and the priest with solemnity answered not six suns have risen and set since gabriel seated on this mat by my side where now

evangeline said and her voice was meek and submissive let remain with thee my soul is sad and afﬂicted so seemed it wise and well unto all and betimes on the morrow mounting his mexican steed with his indian guides and companions homeward basil returned and evangeline stayed at the mission slowly slowly slowly the days succeeded each other days and weeks and months and the ﬁelds of maize that were springing green from the ground when stranger she came now waving above her lifted their slender shafts with leaves interlacing and forming cloisters mendicant crows and granaries pillaged by

and passed and the winter gabriel came not blossomed the opening spring and the notes of the robin and bluebird sounded sweet upon wold and in wood yet gabriel came not but on the breath of the summer winds rumor was wafted sweeter than song of bird or hue or odor of blossom far to the north and east it said in the michigan forests gabriel had his lodge by the banks of the saginaw river and with returning guides that sought the lakes of lawrence saying sad farewell evangeline went from the mission when over weary ways by long and perilous marches she had attained at length the depths of the michigan forests found she the hunter lodge deserted and fallen to ruin thus did the long sad years glide on and in seasons and places divers and distant far was seen the wandering maiden now in the

stranger and her ear was pleased with the thee and thou of the quakers it recalled the past the old acadian country where all men were equal and all were brothers and sisters so when the fruitless search the disappointed endeavor ended to recommence more upon earth uncomplaining thither leaves to the light were turned her thoughts and her footsteps from mountain top the rainy mists of the morning roll away and afar we behold the landscape below us with shining rivers and cities and hamlets so fell the mists from her mind and she saw the world far below her dark longer but all illumined with love and the pathway which she had climbed so far lying smooth and fair in the distance gabriel was not gotten within her heart was his image clothed in the beauty of love and youth last she beheld him only more beautiful made by his deathlike silence and absence into her thoughts of him time entered not it was not over him years had power he was not changed but transﬁgured he had become to her heart one who is dead and not absent patience and abnegation of self and devotion to others this was the lesson life of trial and sorrow had taught her so was her love dif fused but like to some odorous spices suffered waste nor loss though ﬁlling the air with aroma other hope had she none nor wish in life but to follow meekly with reverent steps the sacred feet of her saviour thus many years she lived sister of mercy frequenting lonely and wretched roofs in the crowded lanes of the city where distress and want concealed themselves from the sunlight where disease and sorrow in garrets languished neglected night after night when the world was asleep the watchman repeated loud through the gusty streets that all was well in the city high at some lonely window he saw the light of her taper day after day in the gray of the dawn slow through the suburbs plodded the german farmer with ﬂowers and fruits the market met he that meek pale face returning home from its watchings then it came to pass that pestilence fell on the city presaged by wondrous signs and mostly by ﬂocks of wild pigeons darkening the sun in their ﬂight with naught in their craws but an the project gutenberg ebook of evangeline tale of acadie by henry wadsworth longfellow https and the tides of the sea arise in the month of september flooding some silver stream till it spreads to lake in the meadow so death ﬂooded life and its natural mar gin spread to brackish lake the silver stream of existence wealth had power to bribe nor beauty to charm the oppressor but all perished alike beneath the scour ge of his anger only alas the poor who had neither friends nor attendants crept away to die in the almshouse home of the homeless then in the suburbs it stood in the midst of meadows and woodlands now the city surrounds it but still with its gateway and wicket meek in the midst of splendor its humble walls seem to echo softly the words of the lord the poor ye always have with you thither by night and by day came the sister of mercy the dying looked up into her face and thought indeed to behold there gleams of celestial light encircle her forehead with splendor such the artist paints the brows of saints and apostles or such hangs by night city seen at distance unto their eyes it seemed the lamps of the city celestial into whose shining gates erelong their spirits would enter thus on sabbath morn through the streets deserted and silent wending her quiet way she entered the door of the almshouse sweet on the summer air was the odor of ﬂowers in the garden and she paused on her way to gather the fairest among them that the dying once more might rejoice in their fragrance and beauty then she mounted the stairs to the corridors cooled by the east wind distant and soft on her ear fell the chimes from the belfry of christ church while intermingled with these across the meadows were wafted sounds of psalms that were sung by the swedes in their church at wicaco soft descending wings fell the calm of the hour on her spirit something within her said at length thy trials are ended and with light in her looks she entered the chambers of sickness noiselessly moved about the assiduous careful attendants moistening the feverish lip and the aching brow and in silence closing the sightless eyes of the dead and concealing their faces where on their pallets they lay like drifts of snow by the roadside many languid head upraised evangeline entered turned on its pillow of pain to gaze while she passed her presence fell on their hearts like ray of the sun on the walls of prison and she looked around she saw how death the consoler laying his hand upon many heart had healed it forever many familiar forms had disappeared in the vacant their places were or ﬁlled already by strangers suddenly if arrested by fear or feeling of wonder still she stood with her colorless lips apart while shudder ran through her frame and gotten the ﬂowerets dropped from her the project gutenberg ebook of evangeline tale of acadie by henry wadsworth longfellow https and from her eyes and cheeks the light and bloom of the morning then there escaped from her lips cry of such terrible anguish that the dying heard it and started up from their pillows on the pallet before her was stretched the form of an old man long and thin and gray were the locks that shaded his temples but he lay in the morning light his face moment seemed to assume once more the forms of its earlier manhood so are wont to be changed the faces of those who are dying hot and red on his lips still burned the ﬂush of the fever if life like the hebrew with blood had besprinkled its portals that the angel of death might see the sign and pass over motionless senseless dying he lay and his spirit exhausted seemed to be sinking down through inﬁnite depths in the darkness darkness of slumber and death forever sinking and sinking then through those realms of shade in multiplied reverberations heard he that cry of pain and through the hush that succeeded whispered gentle voice in accents tender and gabriel my beloved and died away into silence then he beheld in dream once more the home of his childhood green acadian meadows with sylvan rivers among them village and mountain and woodlands and walking under their shadow in the days of her youth evangeline rose in his vision tears came into his eyes and slowly he lifted his eyelids vanished the vision away but evangeline knelt by his bedside vainly he strove to whisper her name the accents unuttered died on his lips and their motion revealed what his tongue would have spoken vainly he strove to rise and evangeline kneeling beside him kissed his dying lips and laid his head on her bosom sweet was the light of his eyes but it suddenly sank into darkness when lamp is blown out by gust of wind at casement all was ended now the hope and the fear and the sorrow all the aching of heart the restless unsatisﬁed longing all the dull deep pain and constant anguish of patience and she pressed once more the lifeless head to her bosom meekly she bowed her own and murmured father i thank thee still stands the forest primeval but far away from its shadow side by side in their nameless graves the lovers are sleeping under the humble walls of the little catholic churchyard in the heart of the city they lie unknown and unnoticed daily the tides of life go ebbing and ﬂowing beside them thousands of throbbing hearts where theirs are at rest and forever thousands of aching brains where theirs longer are busy thousands of toiling hands where theirs have ceased from their labors thousands of weary feet where theirs have completed their journey the project gutenberg ebook of evangeline tale of acadie by
