hermes empty left his golden throne bent warm on amorous theft from high olympus had he stolen light on this side of jove clouds to escape the sight of his great summoner and made retreat into forest on the shores of crete somewhere in that sacred island dwelt nymph to whom all hoofed satyrs knelt at whose white feet the languid tritons poured pearls while on land they wither and adored fast by the springs where she to bathe was wont and in those meads where sometime she might haunt were strewn rich gifts unknown to any muse though fancy casket were unlock to choose ah what world of love was at her feet so hermes thought and celestial heat burnt from his winged heels to either ear that from whiteness the lily clear blush into roses his golden hair fallen in jealous curls about his shoulders bare from vale to vale from wood to wood he flew breathing upon the flowers his passion new and wound with many river to its head to find where this sweet nymph prepar her secret bed in vain the sweet nymph might nowhere be found and so he rested on the lonely ground pensive and full of painful jealousies of the and even the very trees there he stood he heard mournful voice such once heard in gentle heart destroys all pain but pity thus the lone voice spake when from this wreathed tomb shall i awake when move in sweet body fit life and love and pleasure and the ruddy strife of hearts and lips ah miserable the god glided silently round bush and tree in his speed the taller grasses and weed until he found palpitating snake bright and in dusky brake she was gordian shape of

inquired thou serpent surely high inspired thou beauteous wreath with melancholy eyes possess whatever bliss thou canst devise telling only where my nymph is fled where she doth breathe bright planet thou hast said return the snake but seal with oaths fair god i swear said hermes by my serpent rod and by thine eyes and by thy starry crown light flew his earnest words among the blossoms blown then thus again the brilliance feminine too frail of heart this lost nymph of thine free the air invisibly she strays about these thornless wilds her pleasant days she tastes unseen unseen her nimble feet
