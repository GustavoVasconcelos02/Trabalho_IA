excessive use of light and darkness poetry and poverty genius and stupidity that there should be some uncertainty about dates and incidents is great matter but that misrepresentations of character or

income of year clare though t he could live without working and all biographers have tallied in the melodramatic legend neither wife nor children ever came to see him except the youngest son who came once during his asylum days to these attractive exaggerations there are the best of grounds giving the lie john clare was born on the 13th of july 1793 in small cottage degraded in popular tradition to mud hut of the parish of helpston between peterborough and stamford this cottage is standing almost it was when clare lived there so that those who care to so may examine martin description of narrow wretched hut more like prison than human dwelling in face of the facts clare father labourer named parker clare was man with his wits about him whether educated or not and ann his wife is recorded to have been woman of much natural ability and precise habits who thought the world of her son john of the other children little is known but that there were two who died young and one girl who was alive in clare himself wrote sonnet in the london magazine june 1821 to twin sister who died in infancy parker clare man with some reputation wrestler and chosen thrash ing corn on account of his strength sometimes shared the fate of almost all farm labourers of his day and was compelled to accept parish relief at time can he have been many shillin gs to the good but it was his determination to have john educated to the best of his power john clare therefore attended until he was seven thence he is believed to have gone to where he made progress enough to receive on leaving the warm praise of the schoolmaster and the advice to continue at he did his aim he notes later on was to write copperplate but there are evidences that he learned much more than penmanship out of school he appears to have been happy imaginative child alert mild mischief the rest of the village boys but with something solitary and romantic in his disposition one day indeed at very early age he went off to ﬁnd the horizon and little later while he tended sheep and cows in his on helpston common he made friends with curious old lady called granny bains who taught him old songs and ballads such poems childhood and remembrances prove that clare early life was not mere drudgery and despair i never had much relish the pastimes of youth instead of going out on the green at the town end on winter sundays to play football i stuck to my corner stool poring over book in fact i grew so fond of being alone at last that my mother was fain to force into company the neighbours had assured her mind that i was better than i used to be very fond of ﬁshing and of sunday morning i have been out before the sun delving worms in some old dunghill and steering off across the the project gutenberg ebook of poems chieﬂy from manuscript by john clare https till i came to the meadow and then the year used to be crowned with its holidays thick the boughs on harvest home it is probable that the heavy work which he is said to have done child was during the long holiday at harvesttime when he was twelve or thirteen he certainly became er and in this employment he saw farm labourer fall from the top of his loaded wagon and break his neck time his reason seemed af fected by the sight at clare struck up friendship with an son to the beneﬁt of both in 1835 one of many sonnets was addressed to this excellent soul turnill we toiled together all the day and lived like hermits from the boys at play we read and walked together round the ﬁelds not the beauty that the journey but muddied ﬁsh and bragged oer what we caught and talked about the few old books we bought though low in price you knew their value well and i thought nothing could their worth excel and then we talked of what we wished to buy and knowledge always kept our pockets dry we went the nearest ways and hummed song and snatched the pea pods we went along and often stooped hunger on the way to eat the sour grass in the meadow hay one of these few old books was thomson seasons which gave direction to the poetic instincts of clare already manif esting themselves in scribbled verses in his books read mark learn clare might opportunity came him to enter profession after i had done with going to school it was proposed that i should be bound apprentice to shoemaker but i rather disliked this bondage i whimpered and turned sullen eye on every persuasion till they gave my will neighbour then offered to learn his be stone mason i disliked this i was then sent to drive the plough at woodcroft castle of oliver cromwell memory though bellairs the mistress was woman and though the place was very good one living my mind was set against it from the ﬁrst one of the disagreeable things was getting up so early in the morning and another was getting wetshod every morning and in wet weather the moat used to overﬂow the that led to the porch and there was but one way to the house we were obliged to wade up to the knees to get in and i staid here one month and then on coming home to my parents they could not persuade to return they now gave up all hopes of doing any good with and fancied that i should make nothing but soldier but luckily in this dilemma neighbour at the blue bell francis gregory wanted to drive plough and i suited him he made proposals to hire h it had my consent my parents readily agreed to there he spent year in light work with plenty of leisure his books and his long reveries in lonely favourite places his imagination grew intensely and in his weekly errand to at maxey ghosts rose out of swamp the project gutenberg ebook of poems chieﬂy from manuscript by john clare https him till he dropped this stage was hardly ended when one day on his road he saw young girl named mary joyce with whom he instantly fell in love this crisis occurred when clare was almost sixteen the fate of john clare hung in the balance six months then mary father disturbed principally by the chance that his daughter might be seen talking to this erratic youngster put an end to their meetings from this time with intervals of tranquillity clare was to suffer the slow torture of remorse until at length delibe rately yielding himself up to his amazing imagination he held conversation with mary john clare mary his ﬁrst wife though she had not lived unwed and had not been in her grave years but this was not yet and we must return to the boy clare now terminating his year hiring at the blue bell it was time him to take up some trade in good earnest accordingly in an evil hour disguised fortunate one he was apprenticed to the head garden er at burghley park the head gardener was in practice sot and after much drunken wild bravado not remarkable in the lad clare considering his companions and traditions there came the impulse to escape with the result that clare and companion were shortly afterwards working in nursery garden at rent both the nursery garden and the silver trent are met again in the poems composed in his asylum days but the time being they meant little to him and he suddenly departed through the snow arrived home at helpston he lost some time in ﬁnding farm work and in writing verses sharing loft at night with labourer he would rise at all hours to note down new ideas it was not unnatural in the labourer to request him to go and his poeting elsewhere clare was already producing work of value none the less nothing could be kept from his neighbours who looked askance on his ways of thinking and writing while candid friend to whom he showed his manuscripts directed his notice to the study of grammar troubled by these ill omens he comforted himself in the often intoxicat ed friendship of the bad men of the village who under the mellowing inﬂuences of old ale roared applause he recited his ballads this life was soon interrupted when the country was clare tells us in the fears of invasion and every mouth was ﬁlled with the terror which buonaparte had spread in other countries national scheme was set on foot to raise raw army of volunteers and to make the matter plausible letter was circulated said to be written by the prince regent i forget how many were demanded from our parish but remember the panic which it created was very great great name rises in the world without creating crowd of little mimics that glitter in borrowed rays and great lie was ever yet put in circulation without herd of little lies multiplying by instinct it were and crowding under its wings the papers that were circulated assured the people of england that the french were on the eve of invading it and that it was deemed necessary by the regent that an army from eighteen to should be raised immediately this was the great lie and then the little lies were soon at its heels which assured the people of helpston that the french had invaded and got to london and some of these little lies had the impudence to swear that the french had even reached northampton the people were at their doors in the evening to talk over the rebellion of when the rebels reached derby and even listened at intervals to fancy they heard the french rebels at northampton knocking it down with their cannon i never gave much credit to popular stories of any sort so i felt concern at these stories though i could not say much my valour if the tale had proved true we had crossgrained sort of choice left us which was to be found to be drawn and go take on volunteers the bounty of two guineas i accepted the latter and went with the project gutenberg ebook of poems chieﬂy from manuscript by john clare https son clarke to peterborough to be sworn on and prepared to join the regiment at oundle the morning we left home our mothers parted with us if we were going to botany bay and people got at their doors to bid us farewell and greet us with job comfort they doubted we should see helpston more i confess i wished myself out of the matter when we got to oundle the place of quartering we were drawn out into the ﬁeld and more motley multitude of lawless fellows was never seen in oundle hardly out of it there were of us we were drawn up into line and sorted out into companies i was one of the shortest and therefore my station is evident i was in that mixed multitude called the battalion which they nicknamed what reason i can not tell the light company was called and the grenadier s who felt great an enmity against each other ever they all felt against the french in 1813 he read among other things the eikon basilike and turned his hand to odd jobs they presented themselves his life appears to have been comfortable and little dull year or two ﬂirtation ambitions and his violin took their turns amiably enough at length he went to work in several miles from helpston and wrote only less poems than he read one day in the autumn of 1817 he was dreaming yet new verse s when he ﬁrst saw patty his she was then eighteen years old and modestly beautiful moment clare forgot mary joyce and though the courtship ultimately took more prosaic turn there is denying the fact that he was in love with patty turner the daughter of the small farmer who held walkherd lodge in the case of clare poetry was more than ever time went on autobiography and it is noteworthy that among the many love lyrics addressed to mary joyce there are not wanting af fectionate tributes to his faithful wife patty maid of walkherd meet again by the wilding in the and i would go to patty cot and patty came to each knew the other very thought under the hawthorn and i be true patty sake and she be true mine and i this little ballad make t be her valentine not long after seeing patty clare was informed by the owner of the that his wages would now be seven shillings week instead of nine he therefore left this master and found similar work in the village of pickworth where being presented with shoemaker bill he entered into negotiations with market deeping bookseller regarding proposals publishing by subscription collection of original triﬂes on miscellaneous subjects religious and moral in verse by john clare of helpstone three hundred proposals were printed with specimen sonnet well chosen to intrigue the religious and moral and yet the tale of intending subscribers stood adamantly at seven on the face of it then clare had lost one pound had worn himself out with distributing his prospectuses and further had been dischar ged from the doing so in working hours his ambitions indeed set all employers and acquaintances against him and he found himself at the age of the project gutenberg ebook of poems chieﬂy from manuscript by john clare https to ask parish relief in this extremity even the idea of enlist ing once more crossed his brain then that of travelling to yorkshire employment and at last the prospectus which had done him so much damage turned benefactor with few friends clare was drinking success to his when there appeared two real gentlemen from stamford one of these bookseller named drury had chanced on the prospectus and wished to see more of clare poetry soon afterwards he promised to publish selection with corrections and communicated with his relative john taylor who with his partner hessey managed the publishing business in fleet street while this new prospect was opening upon clare he succeeded in obtaining work once more near the home of patty their proceeded despite the usual thunderstorms and the dangerous rivalry of certain dark lady named betty sell the bookseller drury though his appearance was in such critical days timely clare was not paragon of virtue without clare knowing it he acquired the legal copyright of the poems probably by the expedient of dispensing money at convenient specious philanthropy will be shown at the same time he allowed clare to open book account which proved at length to be special advantage and further with striking astuteness he found constant difﬁculty in returning originals in note written some ten years later clare regrets that ned drury has got my early vol of mss i lent it him at ﬁrst but like all my other mss elsewhere i could never get it he has copies of all my mss except those written the calendar nevertheless through drury clare was enabled to meet his publisher taylor and his inﬂuential friend of the quarterly octavius gilchrist before the end of by 1818 there is doubt clare had read very deeply and even had some idea of the classical authors through translations it is certain that he knew the great english writers probable that he possessed their works what appears to be list of books which he was anxious to sell in his hardest times inclu des some curious titles with some familiar ones there are cobb poems fawke poems broom hoole and so on there are also cowley warton milton waller and life of chatterton nor can he have been devoid of miscellaneous learning after the perusal of watson electricity aristotle works gasse voyages nature display and the european magazine ﬁne heads and plates his handwriting at this time was bold and hasty his opinions to judge from his uncompromising notes to drury respecting the text of the poems almost cynical and decidedly his own tact was essential if you would patronize clare you might broaden his opinions but you dared not assail them thus the friendly gilchrist high churchman hardly set eyes on clare before condemning clare esteem dissenting minister holland who understood the poet and the poetry it was some time before gilchrist set eyes on clare again the year 1820 found clare unemployed once more but the said holland arrived before long with great news in the beginning of january clare brieﬂy puts it my poems were published after long anxiety of nearly two years and all the reviews except phillips waste paper magazine spoke in my favour most assuredly they did the literary world gaping drouth had seen an announcement then an account of john clare an agricultural labourer and poet during the previous autumn the little cloud bigger than man hand in little while seemed to usurp the whole in other terms three editions of poems descriptiveof rural life and scenery were sold between january 16 and the last of march while this fever was raging among the london coteries critical fashionable intellectual even the country folk round helpston came to the conclusion that clare was something of the project gutenberg ebook of poems chieﬂy from manuscript by john clare https in the course of the publication says clare i had ventured to write to lord milton to request leave that the volume might be dedicated to him but his lordship was starting into italy and forgot to answer it so it was dedicated to nobody which perhaps might be well soon it was out my mother took one to milton when his lordship sent note to tell to bring ten more copies on the following sunday i went and after sitting awhile in the servants hall where i could eat or drink nothing thought his lordship sent and instantly explained the reasons why he did not answer my letter in quiet unaffected manner which set at rest he told he had heard of my poems by parson mossop of helpston who i have since heard took hold of every opportunity to speak against my success or poetical abilities before the book was published and then when it came out and others praised it instantly turned round to my side lady milton also asked several questions and wished to name any book that was favourite expressing at the same time desire to give one but i was confounded and could think of nothing so i lost the present in fact i did not like to pick out book fear of seeming on her kindness or else shakespeare was at my tongue end lord fitzwilliam and lady fitzwilliam too talked to and noticed kindly and his lordship gave some advice which i had done well perhaps to have noticed better than i have he bade beware of booksellers and warne d not to be fed with promises on my departure they gave handful of most that i had ever possessed in my life together i almost felt i should be poor was such is clare description of an incident which has been rendered in terms of insult other invitations followed the chief practical result being an annuity of ﬁfteen pounds promised by the marquis of exeter men of rank and talent wrote letters to clare or sent him books some found their way to helpston and others sent tracts to show him the way to heaven and now at last clare was well enough of f to marry patty before the birth of their ﬁrst child anna maria before his marriage probably clare was desired to spend few days with his publisher taylor in london in smock and gaiters he felt most uncertain of himself and borrowed large overcoat from taylor to disguise his dress over and above this question of externals he instinctively revolted against being exhibited meeting lord radstock sometime admiral in the royal navy at dinner in taylor house clare gained generous if somewhat religiose friend with the instant result that he found himself trotting from one to the other he endured this with patience thinking possibly of the cat killed by kindness and incidentally radstock introduced him to the strangely lady emmers on who was to be faithful thoughtful friend to his family many years to come in another direction soon after clare return to helpston the retired admiral did him great service opening private subscription list his beneﬁt it was found possible to purchase navy 5 per cents on the 28th april and further navy 5 per cents month or so later this stock held by trustees yielded clare dividend of 15s at ﬁrst but in 1823 this income dwindled to 15s and by 1832 appears to have fallen to 10s to the varying amount thus derived and to the given yearly by the marquis of exeter stamford doctor named of clare most energetic in adding another annuity of settled upon the poet by lord spencer but in the conside ration of these bounties it is just to examine the actual ﬁnancial effect of clare ﬁrst book the publishers own account furnished only through clare repeated demands in 1829 or thereabouts has sobering tale to tell but so far biographer has condescended to examine the project gutenberg ebook of poems chieﬂy from manuscript by john clare https the ﬁrst edition clare got nothing against him is entered the item cash paid clare copyright drury but this money if actually paid had been paid in against him also is charged curious commission 5 while drury and taylor acknowledge sharing proﬁts of odd on the second and third editions clare got nothing but to his account is char ged the which taylor and hessey subscribed to his fund commission advertising sundries and deductions allowed to agents account further of the receipts and drury and taylor ostensibly take over apiece the fourth edition not being exhausted the account is not closed but advertising has already swollen to and there is sign that clare beneﬁts penny piece small wonder that at the foot of these ﬁgures he has written how can this be i never sold the poems any money i had of drury was given on account of proﬁts to be here it seems i have got nothing and am brought in minus twenty pounds of which i never received it seems that by the sale of these four thousand copies i have lost that drury told that copies had been printed tho only are accounted had clare noticed further an arithmetical discrepancy which apparently shortened his credit balance by some he might have been still more sceptical not being overweighted therefore with instant wealth clare returned to helpston determined to continue his work in the ﬁelds but fame opposed him all sorts and conditions of lydia whites leo hunters stigginses and jingles crowded to the cottage demanding to see the northamptonshire peasant and often wasting hours of his time one day example the inmates of whole located at stamford visited the unha ppy poet and even more congenial visitors who cheerf ully hurried him off to the tavern parlour were the ruin of his work yet he persevered writing his poems only in his leisure until the harvest of 1820 was done then in order to keep his word with taylor who had agreed to produce new volume in the spring of 1821 he spent six months in the most energetic literary labour writing several poems day he roamed the ﬁeld or sat in lea close oak he would sit till late in the night sifting recasting and transcribing his library by his own enterprise and by presents from many friends was greatly enlar ged and he already knew not only the literature of the past but also that of the present in his letters to taylor are mentioned his appreciations of keats poor keats you know how i reverence him shelley hunt almo st every other contemporary classic nor was he afraid to criticize scott with freedom in letter to scott friend sherwell remarking also that wordworth sonnet on westminster bridg had equal in the language but disagreeing with his af fected godliness taylor and hessey their part did not seem to produce the new volume of poems perhaps because clare would not allow any change except in the jots and tittles of his work perhaps thinking that the public had had surfeit of sensation at length in the autumn of 1821 the village minstrel made its appearance in two volumes costing twelve shillings with the bait of steel engravings ﬁrst an unusually ﬁne likeness of clare from the painting by hilton the second an imaginative study of clare cottage not without representation of the blue bell the village cross and the church the book was reviewed less noisily and sale of mere 800 copies in two months was regarded very modiﬁed success meanwhile the project gutenberg ebook of poems chieﬂy from manuscript by john clare https writing the london magazine and cherry tells us that he contributed almost regularly some time substantial addition was made to his income clare tells us in note on cash account dated 1827 in this cash account there is nothing allowed my three years writing the london magazine i was to have year to insist in the ﬁnancial affairs of clare may seem blatant or otiose actually the treatment which he underwent was leading inﬂuence in his career he was grateful enou gh to radstock raising subscription fund he may have been grateful to taylor and hessey subscribing of his own money but what hurt and embittered him was to see this sum and the others invested him under trustees indeed what man would not if possessed of any independence of mind strongly oppose such amby methods it is possible to take more sinister view of taylor and hessey and their reluctance ever to provide clare with statement of account but in the matter of clare funded property folly alone need be considered in october 1821 notably clare saw an excellent opportunity the future of his family small freehold of six or seven acres with pleasant cottage named bachelor hall where clare had spent many an evening in comfort and even in revelry was mortgaged to jew two hundred pounds the tenants offered clare the whole property on condition that he paid off the mortgage small holdings were rare in that district of great landowners and this to clare was the chance of lifetime he applie d therefore to lord radstock two hundred pounds from his funded property radstock replied that the funded property was vested in trustees who were restricted to paying the interest to him it would have been thought clare difﬁcult matter radstock to have advanced that small amount and he rightly concluded that his own strength of character and common sense were distrusted by his patrons not overwhelmed by this he now applied to his publisher taylor offering to sell his whole literary output ﬁve years at the price of two hundred pounds taylor was not enthusiastic these writings he urged might be worth more or might be worth less in the ﬁrst case clare in the second himself would lose on the affair besides there were and legal niceties to beware of let not clare be ambitious but remain in the state in which god had placed him thus the miserable ofﬁciousness went on and if clare time found some comfort in the glass who can blame him in his own words enemies he cared nothing from his friends he had much to fear he was thrown back among all the cold apathy of killing kindness that had numbed him years in may 1822 clare spent brief holiday in london meeting there the strong men of the london magazine lamb hood and therest from his clothes the london group called him the green man lamb took singular interest in him and was wont to address him clarissimus and princely clare another most enthusiastic acquaintance was painter named rippingille who had begun life the son of farmer at king lynn and who was now thoroughly capable of taking clare into the most bohemian corners of london suddenly however news came from helpston recalling the poet from these perambulations and he returned in haste to ﬁnd his second daughter born eliza louisa of emmerson and lord radstock at this time clare appears to have been writing ballads of truly rustic sort perhaps in the light of his universal title the northamptonshire peasant poet he would now moreover collect such old ballads and songs his father and mother or those who worked with the project gutenberg ebook of poems chieﬂy from manuscript by john clare https chance to sing but was often disappointed to ﬁnd that those who knew fragments seemed ashamed to acknowledge it and those who were proud of their knowledge in such things knew nothing but the senseless balderdash that is brawled over and sung at country feasts statutes and fairs where the most senseless jargon passes the greatest excellence and rudest indecency the ﬁnest wit none the less he recovered sufﬁcient material to train himself into the manner of these old and beautiful recollections but whatever he might write or edit he was unlikely to ﬁnd publishers willing to bring out the village minstrel had barely passed the ﬁrst thousand and the second edition was not melting away literature after all was not money and to increase clare anxiety and dilemma came illness in the early months of 1823 he made journey to stamford to ask the help of his old friend gilchrist gilchrist was already in the throes of his last sickness and clare took his leave without word of his own difﬁculties arriving home he fell into worse illness than before but the spring came on he rallied and occasionally walked to stamford to call on his friend who likewise seemed beginning to mend on the 30th of june clare was received with the news gilchrist is dead clare relapsed into curious condition which appeared likely to overthrow his life or his reason when taylor most fortunately came to see him and procured him the best doctor in peterborough this doctor not only bafﬂed clare disease but rousing attention wherever he could in the neighbourhood was able to provide him with good food and even some old port from the cellar of the bishop of peterborough at last on the advice of the good doctor and the renewed invitation of taylor clare made third pilgrimage to london and this time stayed from the beginning of may till the middle of july passing the ﬁrst three weeks in peaceful contemplation of london crowds he was well enough then to attend london magazine dinner where quincey swam into his ken and the next week similar gathering where coleridge talked three hours clare sat next to charles elton and gained staunch friend who shortly afterwards sent him letter in verse with request that he should sit to rippingille his portrait his touch will hue by hue combine thy thoughtful eyes that steady shine the temples of shakesperian line the quiet smile to reynolds he seemed very quiet and worthy yet enthusiastic man geor ge darley too was impressed by clare the man and some time was to be one of the few serious critics of clare the poet allan cunningham showed like sympathy and still more active interest less familiar character the journalist henry van dyk perhaps did clare more practical good than either with these good effects of clare third visit to town another may be noted certain darling attended him throughout and persuaded him to give up drink this he did the real trouble at helpston was to discover employment already clare was supporting his wife his father and mother and three young children farmers were unwilling to employ clare indeed insulted him if he applied to them and his reticence perhaps lost him situations in the gardens of the marquis of exeter and then of the earl the project gutenberg ebook of poems chieﬂy from manuscript by john clare https spite of disappointments he wrote almost without pause sometimes making poems in the manner of elder poets with the intention of mild literary forgery sometimes writing in his normal vein the lately announced new shepherd calendar and almost daily preparing two series of articles on natural history and on british birds curious proof of the facility with which he wrote verse is afforded by the great number of rhymed descriptions of birds their nests and eggs which this period produced though he sat down resolved to write prose notes and found his facts running into metre even against his will if not yet embroiled in schemes enough clare planned and began burlesque novel an autobiogra phy and other prose papers while he kept diary which should have been published clare had been forced into literary career and one ever worked more conscientiously or more bravely those who had at ﬁrst urged him to write can scarcely be acquitted of desertion now but the more and the better clare wrote the less grew the actual prospect of production success and independence on the 9th of march 1825 clare wrote in his diary i had very odd dream last night and take it an ill omen i thought i had one of the proofs of the new poems from london and after looking at it awhile it shrank through my hands like sand and crumbled into dust three days afterwards the proof of the shepherd calendar arrived at helpston the ill omen was to be proved true but not yet clare continued to write and to botanize and being already forgotten by his earlier friends was contented with the company of two notable local men edward artis the archaeologist who discovered ancient durobrivae and henderson who assisted clare in his these two pleasant companions were in the service of earl fitzwilliam it was perhaps through their interest that clare weathered the hards hips of 1825 so well and equally although the shep herd calendar seemed suspended did clare old patron radstock endeavour to keep his spirits up writing repeatedly to the publisher in regard to clare account the hope of business agreement was destroyed by the sudden death of radstock the best friend says clare i have met with not long after this misfortune clare returned to ﬁeld work the period of harvest then through the winter concentrated his energy on his poetry nor was poetry his only production through his friend van dyk he was enabled to contribute prose pieces to the london press in june 1826 his fourth child was born and clare entreated taylor to bring out the shepherd calendar feeling that he might at least receive money enough the comfort of his wife and his baby but taylor felt otherwise recommending clare to write the annuals which now began to ﬂourish this clare at last persuaded himself to payment was tardy and in some cases imaginary and the time being the annuals were not the solution of his perplexities he therefore went back to the land and borrowing the small means required rented at length few acres with but poor results the publication of clare ﬁrst book had been managed with excellent strategy taylor had left nothing to chance and the public responded he had planned the independence of clare may have displeased the publisher at any rate his enthusiasm dwindled and further to jeopardize clare chances it occurred that in 1825 taylor and hessey came to an end the partners separating omens were indeed bad the shepherd calendar which two years after its announcement in june 1827 made its unobtrusive appearance there were very few reviews and the book sold hardly at all yet this was conspicuously ﬁner work than clare had done before even that beautiful frontispiece of wint taylor wrote did not the project gutenberg ebook of poems chieﬂy from manuscript by john clare https the forgotten poet slaving at his found that his dream had come true meanwhile allan cunningham had been inquiring into this and early in 1828 wrote to clare urging him to come to london and interview the publisher an invitation

allan cunningham who heartily approved of his plan to call on taylor telling him to request full statement of account the next day when clare was on the point of making the demand taylor led across the trail with an unexpected offer recommending clare to buy the remain ing copies of his shepherd calenda r from him at each that he might sell them in his own district clare asked time to reﬂect week later against the wish of allan cunningham he accepted the scheme clare had had another object in coming to town darling had done him so much good on previous occasion that he wished to consult him anew on the 25th of february 1828 clare wrote to his wife emmerson doctor ward told last night that there was little or nothing the matter with yet i got sleep the whole of last night already it appears had coldness and dilemma unsettled him that they had not subdued him and that his home life was in the main happy and affectionate and of great an importanc to him any of his aspirations is to be judged from his poems and his letters of 1828 and thereabouts they show him the very opposite of the feeble neurotic who has so often been bewo rded under his name 20 stra tford place march 21st my

rectors who held it unbecoming to see poems hawked about one day having walked seven milesinto peterborough and having sold books anywhere he trudged home to ﬁnd patty in the pains of labour and now had to go back to peterborough fast he might doctor now there were nine living beings dependent on clare at length he altered his plan of campaign and advertised that his poems could be had at his cottage with some success about this time clare was invited to write the spirit of the age and still he supplied brief pieces to the hated but unavoidable annuals letters too from several towns in east anglia summoning john clare with his bag of books at least promised him some slight revenue actually he only went to one of these places namely boston where the mayor gave banquet in his honour and enabled him to sell several among the younger men similar feast was proposed but clare declined afterwards reproaching himself bitterly on discovering that they had hidden ten pounds in his wallet on his return home not only himself but the rest of the family in turn fell ill with fever so that the spring of 1829 found clare out of work and faced with heavy intellectually john clare was in 1828 and 1829 probably at his zenith he had ceased long since to play the poetic ploughman he had gained in his verses something more ardent and stirring than he had shown in the shepherd calendar and the long ﬁght it was nothing less against and obstruction now began to manifest itself in poems of regret and of soliloquy having long written others pleasure he now wrote his own nature i would not wish the burning blaze of fame around restless world the thunder and the storm of praise in crowded tumults heard and hurled there had been few periods of mental repose since his brain and his poetic genius by this long discipline and fashioning were now triumphant together the declen sion from this high estate might have been more abrupt but the change in his fortunes he had again with gentleness demanded his accounts from his publisher and when in august 1829 these accounts actually arrived disputed several points and gained certain concessions payment was made from the editors of annuals and with these reliefs came the chance him to rent small farm and to work on the land of earl fitzwilliam his working hours were long and his mind was forced to be idle this salutary state of affairs lasted through 1830 until happiness seemed the only possibility before him what poems he wrote occurred suddenly and simply the project gutenberg ebook of poems chieﬂy from manuscript by john clare https his six in numbe growing up in more comfor t and in more prospect than he had ever enjoyed but he reckoned not with illness in short illness reduced clare almost to farming not only added nothing but made encroachment on his small stipen in despair he ﬂung himself into ﬁeld labour again and was carried home nearly dead with fever friends there were not wanting to send food and medicine parson mossop having long ago been converted to clare did much him even so the landlord distrained rent and clare applied to his old friend henderson the botanist at milton park lord milton came by and clare was encouraged to tell him his trouble his intense phrases and bearing were such that the nobleman at once promised him new cottage and plot of ground at the same time he expressed his hope that there would soon be another volume of poems by john clare this hope was the spark which ﬁred dangerous train perhaps clare once again fell into his exhausting habit of poetry all the day and every day he decided to publish new volume by subscription the new cottage was in the village of northborough three miles from helpston it was indeed luxurious in comparison with the old stooping house where clare had spent nearly forty years but there was more in that old house than mere stone and timber clare began to look on the coming change with terror delayed the move day after day to the distress of poor patty and when at last news came from milton park that the earl was not content with such strange hesitation and when patty had her household on the line of march he followed in the rear walking mechanically with eyes half shut if in dream there was delay in his i left mine own old home of homes green ﬁelds and every pleasant place the summer like stranger comes i pause and hardly know her face i miss the hazel happy green the bluebell quiet hanging blooms where envy sneer was never seen where staring malice never comes this and many other verses not the least pathetic in our language were written by john clare on june 20th 1832 on the occasio n of his moving out of small and crowded cottage in village street to roomy romantic farmhouse standing in its own grounds was this ingratitude ask rather is the dyer hand subdued to what it works in clare rapidly proceeded with his new collection of poems destined never to appear in his lifetime in thick oblong divided into four sections to receive tales in verse poems ballads and songs and sonnets he copied his best work in hand smal l but clear and with rare freedom from slips of the pen his proposals reprinted with comment in the athenaeum of 1832 were in these terms the proposals publishing these fugitives being addressed to friends furthe r apology is necessary than the plain statement of facts necessity is said to be the mother of invention but there is very little need of invention truth and the truth is that difﬁculty has grown up like tree of the forest and being longer able to conceal it i meet it in the best way possible the project gutenberg ebook of poems chieﬂy from manuscript by john clare https to publish them my own beneﬁt and that of numerous and increasing family it were false delicacy to make an idle parade of independence in my situation and it would be unmanly to make troublesome appeal to favours public or private like public petitioner friends neither expect this from or wish to it to others though it is partly owing to such advice that i was induced to come forward with these proposals and if they are successful they will render beneﬁt and if not they will not cancel any obligations that i may have received from friends public and private to whom my best wishes are due and having said this much in furtherance of my intentions i will conclude by explaining them proposals publishing in 1 volume 8vo the midsummer cushion or cottage poems by john clare 1st the book will be printed on ﬁne paper and published soon sufﬁcient number of subscribers are procured to defray the expense of publishing 2nd it will consist of number of fugitive triﬂes some of which have appeared in different periodicals and of others that have never been published 3rd money is requested until the volume shall be delivered free of expen to every subscriber 4th the price will not exceed seven shillings and sixpence and it may not be so much the number of pages and the expense of the book will be regulated by the publisher in his new home clare was time troubled with visitors to most he was aloof but sometimes he spoke freely of his affairs one visitor who found him in the communicative mood chanced to be the editor of magazine the alfred the denials of clare frankly given to rumours of his new beneﬁts variously estimated between two hundred and thousand year were to this gentleman meat and drink and the alfred october the 5th 1832 contained violent manifesto condemning publishers and patrons in the most ﬁery fashion and apparently inspired by the poet himself this did his cause much damage and clare wrote to the perpetrator in anger there never was more scandalous insult to my feelings than this ofﬁcious i am beggar my income is and though i have had ﬁnal settlement with taylor i expect to have one directly clare ended by demanding recantation none was forthcoming and the effect on patrons and poet was unfortunate indeed yet still he could write of himself in this uncoloured style i am ready to laugh with you at my own vanity i sit sometimes and wonder over the little noise i have made in the world until i think i have written nothing yet to deserve any praise at all so the spirit of fame of living little after life like noise on conspicuous place urges my blood upward into unconscious melodies and striding down my orchar d and homestead i hum and sing inwardly these little madrigals and then go in and pen them down thinking them much better things than they are i look over them again and then the charm vanishes into the vanity that i shall something better ere i die and so in spite of myself i rhyme on and write nothing but little things at last with the gear that emmerson kindness and activity had provided clare kept his garden and ground in order yet the winter of 1832 was time of great hardship and foreboding his youngest son charles was born on the 4th of january 1833 the event the project gutenberg ebook of poems chieﬂy from manuscript by john clare https nerve more terribly perhaps than anything before had done and he went out into the ﬁelds late in the day his daughter anna found him lying unconscious and month he had to keep his bed if to prove the prove rb it never rains but it pours subscribers to his new volume hung back and when spring had come they numbered in all clare submitted the work to the publishers great and small but the best offer that he got depended on his providing in advance the necessary steel engravings and now clare lost all his delight in lonely walks but sitting in his study wrote curious paraphrases of the psalms the proverbs and the book of job his manner towards those round him became apathetic and silent even the news brought by his prescribed clare to his other subscribers now were more than two hundred seemed to sound meaningless in his ears but even these danger seemed discounted by the and cheerfulness which clare soon afterwards regained and ashamed of his misjudgment smith came to the conclusion that he need visit clare more an attack of insanity immediately followed during which clare did not know his wife his children or himself from this heavy trance he awoke bitterly aware of his peril he wrote at once to taylor again and again you must excuse my writing but i feel that if i not write now i shall not be able what i wish is to get under darling advice or to have his advice to go somewhere i have not been from home this and can not get anywhere if i could but go to london i think i should get better how would you advise to come i dare not come up by myself you think one of my children might go with thank god my wife and children are all taylor wrote once in mildly sympathetic words but probably thought that clare was makin g much ado about nothing and here at least was the opportunity patron to save poet from ﬁve pounds nothing was done and clare sat in his study writing more and more paraphrases of the old testament together with series of sonnets of grotesque rustic sort not resembling any other poems in our language the midsummer cushion had been set aside but clare had submitted many of the poems together with hundreds more to whittaker largely through the recommendations of emmerson the publishers decided to print volume from these picking principally those poems which had already shown themselves respectable by appearing in the annuals one even written in 1820 the autumn robin was somehow chosen to the exclusion of such later poems remembrances and the fallen elm with faults like these the selection was nevertheless distinctly beautiful book of verse in march 1834 clare deﬁnitely received forty pounds the copyright and ﬁnally in july 1835 appeared this his last book the rural muse its success was ted in spite of magniﬁcent eulogy by christopher north in blackwood and of downright welcome by the athenaeum the new monthly and other good judges there was slow sale several months but clare there was little chance of new remuneration this he could regard calmly while the book was in the press he had received from the literary fund present of ﬁfty pounds clare malady slowly increased the exact history of this decline is almost lost yet we may well believe that the death of his mothe r on the 18th of december 1835 was day of double blackness him the winter over patty made great ﬁght his reason and at last persuaded him to go out walks whic h checked the decline now he became so passionately fond of being that he could not be made to stop single day at home in one the project gutenberg ebook of poems chieﬂy from manuscript by john clare https roving walks he met his old friend marsh the wife of the bishop of peterborough few nights later her guest he sat in the peterborough theatre watching the merchant of venice so vivid was his imaginatio doubtless the strolling players were not in themselves he at last began to shout at shylock and try to attack him on the stage when clare returned to helpston the change in him terriﬁed his wife and yet he rallied and walked the ﬁelds and sitting on the taught his sons to trim the two in his garden into circles and cones the positive signs of derangement which he had given so far were not after all conclusive he had seen mary joyce pass by he had spoken to her occasionally he third person had watched and discussed the doings of john clare and this lost sweetheart he had surprised one or two people by calling mountains one day too at parson mossop house he had suddenly pointed to ﬁgures moving up and down under these circumstances market deeping doctor named skrimshaw certiﬁed him mad and on similar grounds almost any one in the world might be clapped into an asylum hallucinations ceased few month s but clare had difﬁculty in keeping outside interference at bay earl fitzwilliam in his position of landlord proposed to send the man who called mountains at once to the northampton asylum when the summer came unfortunately clare mind seemed suddenly to give way and preparations were being made his admission to the county asylum when letters came from taylor and other old friends in london proposing to place him in private hands clare was taken accordingly on the 16th of july 1837 to fair mead house highbeach in epping forest allen the mild founder of this excellent asylum had few doubts to the condition of clare mind and assure d him an eventual recovery with the ﬁfty other patients so he dealt with clare keeping him away from books and making him work in the garden and the ﬁelds poetry it is said was made impossible him paper being taken away from him but it is not conceivable that clare could live apart from this kindest of companions many months together soon he was allowed to go out into the forest at his will often taking his new acquaintance thomas campbell the son of the poet on these his hallucinations not appear to have diminished although they changed he was now convinced that mary joyce was his true was his second wife he had known william shakespeare and many other great ones in person why such men wordsworth campbell and byron were allowed to steal john clare best poems and to publish them their own he could not imagine john clare was not only noble by nature but by blood on such rumoured eccentricities did the popular notion of his madness rest it would seem that anything he said was taken down in evidence against him how dared he be ﬁgurative on the other hand miss mitford records ﬁgurative conversations not so easily explained his account

home out of essex on foot leaving epping forest early on july 20 1841 and dragging himself along almost without pause until july of this amazing journey he himself wrote an account mary clare which is printed in full in martin life it is both in style and in subject an extraordinary document the ﬁrst night he says i lay down with my head towards the north to show myself the in the morning on the third day i satisﬁed my hunger by eating the grass on the roadside which seemed to taste something like bread i was hungry and eat heartily till i was satisﬁed in fact the meal seemed to good and there was little to notice the road very often looked stupid myself at last between peterborough and helpston cart met with man woman and boy in it when nearing the woman jumped out and caught fast

somewhat restored clare mind and it was patty hope and aim to keep him in his cottage though she attempted to keep paper from him he contrived to write verse paraphrases of the prophetical books sometimes putting in between song to mary or stanza of nature poetry at the end of august round the edges of local newspaper he wrote the draft of letter to allen of highbeach which in the almost complete absence of documents this period is an important expression my dear sir having left the forest in hurry i had not time to take my leave of you and your family but i intended to write and that before now but dullness and disappointment prevented i found your words true on my return here having neither friends nor home left but it is called the poet cottage i claimed lodging in it where i now am one of my fancies i found here with her family and all well they met on this side werrington with horse and cart and found all but knocked up i had travelled from essex to northamptonshire without ever eating or drinking all the one pennyworth of beer which was given by farm servant near an odd house called the plough one day i eat grass to keep on my feet but on the last day i chewed tobacco and never felt hungry afterwards where my poetical fancy is i can not say the people in the neighbourhood tell that the one called mary has been dead these eight years but i can be miserably happy in any situation and any place and could have staid in yours on the forest if any of my friends had noticed or come to see but the greatest annoyance in such places yours are those servants styled keepers who often assumed much authority over if i had been their prisoner and not liking to quarrel i put up with it till i was weary of the place altogether so i heard the voice of freedom and started and could have travelled to york with penny loaf and pint of beer i should not have been fagged in body only one of my old shoes had nearly lost the sole before i started and let in the water and silt the ﬁrst day and made crippled and lame to the end of my journey the project gutenberg ebook of poems chieﬂy from manuscript by john clare https had eleven books sent from how parsons

deceitful and the ﬁrst woman when there was man but her husband found out mean s to cuckold him by the aid and assistance of the devil women being more righteous now and men more plentiful they have found out more godly way to it without the devil s assistance and the man who possesses woman possesses losses without gain the worst is the road to ruin and the best is nothing like good cow man i never did woman has long sickened i should like to be to myself few years and lead the life of hermit but even there i should wish her whom i am always thinking almost every song i write has some

worked her hardest to keep clare out of future asylums but it seems that her wishes were overridden allen let it be known through the gentleman magazine and other publications that clare would in the ordinary way almost certainly recover but the local doctors knew better on the authority of an anonymous patron the doctor skrimshaw who had previously found clare insane now paid him another visit and with certain william page also of market deeping condemned him to be shut up after years addic ted to poetical prosings then one day keepers came and vain struggle and the northborough cottage saw john clare more he was now in the asylum at northampton and the minds of northamptonshire noblemen need longer be troubled that poet was wandering in miserable happiness under their park the project gutenberg ebook of poems chieﬂy from manuscript by john clare https far the madness of clare had been rather an exaltation of mind than collapse forsaken mainly by his emm erson letters ceased in 1837 by the new generation of writers and of readers hated by his neighbours wasted with hopeless love he had encouraged life of imagination and ideals imagination overpowered him until his perception of realities failed him he could see mary joyce or talk with her he had family of by her but if this was madness there was method in it but now the blow fell imprisonment life down went john clare into idiocy the ludicrous with the terrible and even from this desperate abyss he rose earl fitzwilliam paid clare maintenance in the northampton asylum but at the ordinary rate poor people the asylum authorities at least seemed to have recognized clare man out of the common treating him gentleman patient and allowing the ﬁrst twelve go when he wished into northampton where he woul d sit under the portico of all saints church in meditation what dreams were these sometimes his face would brighten up if illuminated by an inward sun overwhelming in its glory and beauty sane intervals came in which he wrote his poems and these poems were of serenity and richness not surpassed in his earlier work including instance graves of infants may 1844 the sleep of spring 1844 invitation to eternity 1848 and before 1854 but little news of him went farther aﬁeld than the town of northampton and the poems remained in manuscript glimpse of clare in these years is left us by jesse hall who an admirer of his poems called on him in may 1848 it was very ﬁne day he said we could go and have walk in the grounds of the institution we discussed many subjects and i found him very rational there being very little evidence of derangeme i asked permission him to come to my hotel the next day we spent few hours together i was very sorry to ﬁnd great change in him from the previous day and i had ample evidence of his reason being dethroned his conversation being disconnected and many of his remarks displaying imbecility but at times he spoke rationally and to the point to hall to almost every other casual visitor clare gave several manuscript poems letter to his wife dated july 19th 1848 gives fresh insight into his condition my dear wife i have not written to you long while but here i am in the

in the asylum to amuse himself he read and wrote continually in 1850 his portrait was painted and his death reported in 1854 he assisted miss baker in her glossary of northamptonshire words and phrases providing her with all his asylum manuscripts and specially contributing some verses on customs at this time an edition of his poems was projected and the idea met with much interest among those who yet remembered clare but it faded and was gone the harmless lunatic was at length conﬁned to the asylum grounds and to the distresses of his mind began to be added those of the ageing body hope even now was not dead and poor versiﬁer but good samaritan who saw him in 1857 printed some lines in the london journal november 2lst asking the aid of heaven to restore clare to his home and his poetry he seems to have writt en little at that time gentleman who was in posit ion to judge wrote also that in the spring of 1860 his mind was calmer than it had been years and that he was induced to write verses once more but clare was years old it was perhaps too late to release him and perhaps he had grown past the desire of liberty on the 7th of march he wrote to patty asking after all his children and some of his friends and sending his love to his father and mother so long since dead signing himself your loving husband till death john clare on the 8th he wrote note to hopkins why i am

nothing from home to come here i shall be glad to see you when you come in the course of 1860 he was photographed and that the northampton folk still took an interest in their poet is proved by the sale of these likenesses copies could be seen in the shops until recent years but that clare might have been set at large seems not to have occurred to those who in curiosity purchased his portrait visitor named john plummer went to the asylum in 1861 and found clare reading in the window recess of very comfortable room time had dealt kindly with him he wrote it was in vain that we strove to arrest his attention he merely looked at us with vacant gaze moment and then went on reading his book this was possibly rather the action of sanity than of insanity yet plummer did his best in once

became patriarchal in appearance and his powers failed more rapidly until he could walk longer was procured him that he might still enjoy the garden and the open air on good friday in 1864 he was

from manuscript by john clare https his soul seemed with the free he died so quietly his last years had been spent in some degree of happiness and from ofﬁcials and patients he had received gentleness and sympathy and even homage it has been said not once nor twice but many times that in the asylum he was never visited by his wife nor by any of his children except the youngest son charles who came once that any one should condemn patty her absence is surely presumptuous in the extreme she was now keeping her home together with the greatest difﬁculty nor can it be known what deeper motives inﬂuenced relationships between wife and husband even if the name of mary joyce meant nothing that the children came to see their father whenever they could the letters given above signify but if the

not having fulﬁlled his mission of total eclipse that spoke there willis perhaps the howitts and few more worthies came brief hours to see clare rather phenomenon than poet but clare who had sat with elia and his assembled host who had held his own with the ﬁnest brains of his time and had written such cornucopia of genuine poetry now lying useless in his cottage at northborough can not but have regarded the northampton asylum the shipwreck of his own esteems clare was buried on may 25th 1864 where he had wished to be in the churchyard at helpston the letter informing clare of his death was delivered at the wrong address and did not eventually reach her at northborough before clare cofﬁn arrived at helpston scarcely giving her time to attend the funeral the next day indeed had the sexton at helpston been at home the bearers would have urged him to arrange the funeral at once in his absence they left the cofﬁn in an inn parlour the night and scandal was barely prevented curious superstition grew up locally that it was not clare body which was buried in that cofﬁn and among those who attended the last rite not one but found it almost impossible to connect this episode with those days forty years before when so many notable man was seen making through helpston village the cottage of the eager brilliant unwearying young poet who was the talk of london after such long

all the ﬁnest inﬂuen ces in life and in literature he devoted himself to poetry in every way imagination colou r melody and affection were his by nature where he lacked was in dramatic impulse and in passion and sometimes his incredible facility in verse which enabled him to complete poem after poem without pause or verbal difﬁculty was not his best friend he possesses technique of his own his rhymes are based on pronunciation the northamptonshire pronunciation to which his the project gutenberg ebook of poems chieﬂy from manuscript by john clare https been trained and thus he accurately
