this is fine country william men women and ghosts by amy lowell https this is book of stories that reason i have excluded all purely lyrical poems but the word stories has been stretched to its fullest application it includes both narrative poems properly so called tales divided into scenes and few pieces of less obvious import in which one might say that the dramatis personae are air clouds trees houses streets and such like things it has long been favourite idea of mine that the rhythms of libre have not been sufﬁciently plumbed that there is in them power of variation which has never yet been brought to the light of experiment i think it was the piano pieces of debussy with their strange likeness to short vers libre poems which ﬁrst showed the close kinship of music and poetry and there ﬂashed into my mind the idea of using the movement of poetry in somewhat the same way that the musician uses the movement of music it was quite evident that this could never be done in the strict pattern of metrical form but the ﬂowing ﬂuctuating rhythm of vers libre seemed to open the door to such an experiment first however i considered the same method applied to the more pronounced movements of natural objects if the reader will turn to the poem roxbury garden he will ﬁnd in the ﬁrst two sections an attempt to give the circular movement of hoop bowling along the ground and the up and down elliptical curve of ﬂying shuttlecock from these experiments it is but step to the ﬂowing rhythm of music in the cremona violin i have tried to give this ﬂowing changing rhythm to the parts in which the violin is being played the effect is farther heightened because the rest of the poem is written in the seven line chaucerian stanza and by deserting this ordered pattern the undulating line of vers libre i hoped to produce something of the suave continuous tone of violin again in the violin parts themselves the movement constantly changes will be quite plain to any one reading these passages aloud in the cremona violin however the rhythms are fairly obvious and regular i set myself far harder task in trying to transcribe the various movements of stravinsky three pieces string quartet several musicians who have seen the poem think the movement accurately given these experiments lead to believe that there is here much food thought and matter study and i hope many poets will follow in opening up the still hardly explored possibilities of vers libre good many of the poems in this book are written in polyphonic prose form about which i have written and spoken so much that it seems hardly necessary to explain it here let hastily add however that the word prose in its name refers only to the typographical arrangement in sense is this prose form only read it aloud gentle reader i beg and you will see what you will see purely dramatic form i know none better in the whole range of poetry it enables the poet to give his characters the vivid real effect they have in play while at the same time writing in the one last innovation i have still to mention it will be found in spring day and more fully enlar ged upon in the series towns in colour in these poems i have endeavoured to give the colour and light and shade of certain places and hours stressing the purely pictorial effect and with little or reference to any other aspect of the places described it is an enchanting thing to wander through city looking its unrelated beauty the beauty by which it captivates the sensuous sense of seeing i have always loved aquariums but years i went to them and looked and looked at those swirling shooting looping patterns of ﬁsh which always deﬁed transcription to paper until i hit upon the unrelated method the result is in an aquarium i think the ﬁrst thing which turned in this direction was john gould fletcher london excursion in some imagist poets i here record my men women and ghosts by amy lowell https the substance of the the poems are

she held her gaping bodice to conceal her breast i must demand your instant absence everard but new returned will hardly care guests adieu eunice you mad his brain began to reel xxxvi he tried again to take her tried to twist her arms about him truly she had said nothing should ever part them in mist she pushed him from her clasped her aching head in both her hands and rocked and sobbed aloud oh where is everard what does this mean so lately come to leave thus alone but gervase had not seen sir everard then gently to her bowed and sickening spirit he told of her proud surrender to him he could hear her moan xxxvii then shame swept over her and held her numb hiding her anguished face against the seat at last she rose woman and trailed away with feet gervase looked after her but feared to pass the barrier set between them all his rare joy broke to than that unreal and standing lonely there his swollen heart burst out and on the grass he flung himself and wept he knew alas the loss

the balance straight it was such poor amends which she could make rousing hopes to gall him with their unfulfilment tragical it was and she must leave him desolate xli hard silence he had forced upon his lips long and long and would have done so still had not she pressed her finger tips against her heavy eyes then with forced will she wrote that he might come sealed with the arms of crowe and frampton twined her heart felt lighter when this was done it seemed her constant care might some day cease to fright her illness could be crime and dreadful harms did come from too much sunshine her alarms would lessen when she saw him standing there xlii simple and kind brother just returned from journeying and he would treat her so she knew his honest heart and if there burned spark in it he would not let it show but when he really came and stood beside her underneath the fruitless cherry boughs he seemed tired man gaunt he made her more vows nor did he mention one thing he had tried to put into his letter war supplied him topics and his mind seemed occupied xliii daily they met and gravely walked and talked he read her more verses and he stayed only until their conversation balked

nap her husband stirred and muttered seeing that charlotta rose and softly climbed up the stairs and in her little room found sighing comfort with moon in bloom but even rainy windows by moon may give but poor content to loneliness and it was hard young charlotta so to strive and down her eagerness and learn to live in placid quiet while her husband slept charlotta in her upper chamber wept herr altgelt was man gentle and unambitious that alone had kept him back he played few men can drawing out of his instrument tone so and palpitant it shone like bright thread of sound hung in the air afloat and swinging upward slim and fair above all things above charlotta his wife herr altgelt loved his violin fine cremona pattern stradivari life was flowering out of early discipline when this was fashioned of pine the belly was the back of broadly curled maple the head made thick and sharply whirled the slanting youthful through the belly of fine vigorous pine mellowed each note and blew

mitres which point straight up the corners each curve and joint clear and bold and thin such was herr theodore violin seven the gone with his best violin the rain being stopped frau lotta in the kitchen sat alone watching the embers which the fire dropped the china shone upon the dresser topped by polished copper vessels which her skill kept brightly burnished it was very men women and ghosts by amy lowell https an air from hummed in her head herr altgelt had been practising before the night performance charlotta had plead with him to stay with her even at the door she begged him not to go i implore you this evening theodore she had said leave them and stay with instead silly poppet theodore pinched her ear you like to have our good elector turn out i think but theodore something queer ails oh but notice how they burn my cheeks the thunder worried you stern and cold and only love your work i know but theodore this evening not go but he had gone hurriedly at the end she had kept him talking now she sat alone again always alone the trend of all her thinking brought her back to that she wished to banish what would life be what she was young and loved while he was moved only by music each day that was proved each day he rose and practised while he played she stopped her work and listened and her heart swelled painfully beneath her bodice swayed and longing she would hide from him her smart well lottchen will that then what start she gave and she would run to him and cry and he would gently chide her fie dear fie i glad i played it well but such taking you hear the thing enough before i done and she would draw away from him still shaking had he but guessed she was another one another violin her strings were aching stretched to the touch of his bow hand again he played and she almost broke at the strain where was the use of thinking of it now sitting alone and listening to the clock she best make haste and knit another row three hours at least must pass before his knock would startle her it always was shock she so long before that when it came her hearing almost tore she caught herself just starting in to listen what nerves she had rattling like brittle sticks she wandered to the window the glisten of bright moon was tempting snuffed the wicks of her two candles still she could not fix to anything the moon in broad swath beckoned her out and down the against the house her hollyhocks stood high and black their shadows doubling them the night was white and still with moonlight and sigh of blowing leaves was there and the dim flight of insects and the smell of aconite and stocks and marvel of peru she flitted along the path where blocks of shadow pitted the even flags she let herself go dreaming of theodore her husband and the tune from swam through her mind but seeming of sudden the clear moon showed her inopportune indeed but here he was whistling and striding lotta squeezed in between the currants hiding the best laid plans of mice and men alas the stranger came indeed but did not men women and ghosts by amy lowell https instead he leant upon the folding his arms and whistling lotta state crouched in the prickly currants on wet grass was far from pleasant still the stranger stayed and lotta in her currants watched dismayed he seemed proper fellow standing there in the bright moonshine his cocked hat was laced with silver and he wore his own brown hair tied but unpowdered his whole bearing graced fine cloth coat and ruffled shirt and chased charlotta looked but her position was hardly easy when would his volition suggest his walking on and then that tune bars from gone over and over and murdered what fortune had brought him there to stare about him so ach gott im himmel why will he not go thought lotta but the young man whistled on and seemed in great hurry to be gone charlotta crouched among the currant bushes watched the moon slowly dip from twig to twig if theodore should chance to come and blushes streamed over her he would not care fig he only laugh she pushed aside sprig of leaves and peered then she uprose amid her bushes sir said she pray whose garden you suppose you watching why you stand there i really must insist upon your leaving is unmannerly to stay so long the young man gave twist and turned about and in the amethyst moonlight he saw her like nymph from the green bushes which had been her prison he swept his hat off in hurried bow your pardon madam i had idea i was not quite alone and that is how i came to stay my trespass was not sheer impertinence i thought one was here and really gardens cry to be admired especially it seemed required and may i beg to introduce myself heinrich marohl of munich and your name charlotta told him and the artful elf promptly exclaimed about her husband fame so lotta slowly came to conversation with him when she went into the house she found the evening spent theodore arrived quite wearied out and teased with all excitement in him burned away it had gone well he said the audience pleased and he had played his very best but afterwards he had been forced to stay and practise with the stupid ones his head ached furiously and he must get to bed part second herr altgelt played and the four strings of his violin were spinning like bees on day in spring the notes rose into the wide which slanted through the window they lay like coloured beads they knocked together and parted and started to dance skipping tripping each one slipping under and over the others so that the polychrome fire streamed like men women and ghosts by amy lowell https or comet tail behind them then wail and dropped from off the end of the bow and the dancing stopped scent of lilies filled the room long and slow each large white bloom breathed sound which was holy perfume from blessed censer and the hum of an organ tone and they waved like fans in hall of stone over bier standing there in the centre alone each lily bent slowly it was blown like smoke they rose from the then faded swifter bowing jumbled the notes like wavelets flowing in splashing pashing rippling motion between broad meadows to an ocean wide day and blue flower where every hour gulls dipped and scattered and squawked and squealed and over the marshes the angelus pealed and the prows of the were spattered with spray and away couple of frigates were starting to race to java with all sails set topgallants and royals and stunsails and jibs and wide moonsails and the shining rails were polished so bright they sparked in the sun all the sails went up with run they call hanging johnny they call hanging johnny so hang boys hang and the sun had set and the high moon whitened and the ship heeled over to the breeze he drew her into the shade of the sails and whispered tales of voyages in the china seas and his arm around her held and bound her she almost swooned with the breeze and the moon and the slipping sea and he beside her touching her the ship careening with the white moon steadily shining over her and her lover theodore still her lover then quiver fell on the crowded notes and slowly floated single note which spread and spread till it filled the room with shimmer like gold and noises shivered throughout its length and tried its strength they pulled it and tore it and the stuff waned thinner but still it bore it then wide rent split the arching tent and balls of fire spurted through spitting yellow and mauve and blue one by one they were quenched they fell only the blue burned steadily paler and paler it grew herr altgelt stopped well lottachen my dear what you say i think i in good trim now let have dinner what this my love you very sweet i wonder how it happens i the winner of so much sweetness but i think you thinner you like bag of feathers on my knee why lotta child you almost strangling men women and ghosts by amy lowell https i glad you going out this afternoon the days are getting short and i so

should know more if gebnitz finds out then his wife will pack yes shut the door at once i did not feel it cold i am dunce frau altgelt tied her bonnet on and went into the streets bright crisp autumn wind flirted her skirts and hair turbulent audacious wind it was now close behind pushing her bonnet forward till it twined the strings across her face then from in front slantingly swinging at her with shunt until she lay against it struggling pushing dismayed to find her clothing tightly bound around her every fold and wrinkle crushing itself upon her so that she was wound in draperies clinging those found sucking about sea nymph on the frieze of some old grecian temple in the breeze the shops and houses had quality of hard and dazzling colour something sharp and buoyant like white puffing sails at sea the city streets were twanging like harp charlotta caught the movement skippingly she blew along the pavement hardly knowing toward what destination she was going she fetched up opposite jeweller shop where filigreed tiaras shone like crowns and necklaces of emeralds seemed to drop and then float up again with lightness browns of striped agates struck her like cold frowns amid the gaiety of topaz seals carved though they were with heads and arms and wheels row of pencils knobbed with quartz or sard delighted her and rings of every size turned smartly round like hoops before her eyes or jarred to spokes and flashing triangles and starred like rockets bursting on festal day charlotta could not tear herself away with eyes glued tightly on golden box whose rare enamel piqued her with its hue changeable iridescent shuttlecocks of shades and lustres always darting through its level superimposing sheet of blue charlotta did not hear footsteps approaching she started at the words am i encroaching oh heinrich how you frightened i men women and ghosts by amy lowell https we were to meet at three is it quite that it is not he answered but i caught the trick of missing you one thing is flat i can not go on this way life is what might best be conjured up by the word dearest when will you come lotta to quell his effervescence pointed to the gems within the window asked him to admire bracelet or buckle but one stems uneasily the burning of fire heinrich was chafing pricked by his desire little by little she wooed him to her mood until at last he promised to be good but here he started on another tack to buy jewel which one would lotta choose she vainly urged against him all her lack of other trinkets should she dare to use ring or brooch her husband might accuse her of extravagance and ask to see strict accounting or still worse might be but heinrich would not be persuaded why should he not give her what he liked and in he went determined certainly to buy thing so beautiful that it would win her wavering fancy altgelt violin he would outscore by such handsome jewel that lotta could longer be so cruel pity charlotta torn in diverse ways if she went in with him the shopman might recognize her give her her name in days to come he could denounce her in her fright she almost fled but heinrich would be quite capable of pursuing by and by she pushed the door and entered hurriedly it took some pains to keep him from bestowing pair of ruby earrings carved like roses the setting twined to represent the growing tendrils and leaves upon her who supposes i could obtain such things it simply closes all comfort so he changed his mind and bought slight gift he could find locket frosted over with seed pearls oblong and slim wearing at the neck or hidden in the bosom their joined curls should lie in it and further to bedeck his love heinrich had picked whiff fleck the merest puff of thin linked chain to hang it from lotta could not refrain from weeping they sauntered down the street she did not want the locket yet she did to have him love her she found very sweet but it is hard to keep love always hid then there was something in her heart which chid her told her she loved theodore in him that all these meetings were foolish whim she thought of theodore and the life they led so near together but so little mingled the great clouds bulged and bellied overhead and the fresh wind about her body tingled the crane of large warehouse creaked and jingled charlotta held her breath very fear about her in the street she seemed to hear they call hanging johnny they call hanging johnny so hang boys hang men women and ghosts by amy lowell https and it was theodore under the racing skies who held her and who whispered in her ear she knew her heart was telling her lies beating and hammering he was so dear the touch of him would send her in queer swoon that was half an ecstasy and yearning theodore she wandered slowly turning street after street heinrich wished it so he had some aim she had forgotten what their progress was confused and very slow but at the last they reached lonely spot garden far above the highest shot of soaring steeple at their feet the town spread open like laid down lotta was dimly conscious of the rest vaguely remembered how he clasped the chain about her neck she treated it in jest and saw his face cloud over with sharp pain then suddenly she felt though strain were put upon her collared like slave leashed in the meshes of this thing he gave she seized the flimsy rings with both her hands to snap it but they held with odd persistence her eyes were blinded by two strands of hair which had been loosened her resistance melted within her from remotest distance misty unreal his face grew warm and near and giving way she knew him very dear long he held her and they both gazed down at the wide city and its blue bridged river from wooing he jested with her snipped the blown strands of her hair and tied them with sliver cut from his own head but she gave shiver when opening the locket they were placed under the glass commingled and enlaced when will you have it so with us he sighed she shook her head he pressed her further heinrich theodore loves and she tried to free herself and rise he held her so clipped by his arms she could not move nor go but you love he whispered with his face burning against her through her kerchief lace frau altgelt knew she toyed with fire knew that what her husband lit this other man fanned to hot flame she told herself that few women were so discreet she who ran danger since she knew what things to ban she opened her house door at five short before her husband knock part third the sparked and hummed with lights and people gebnitz was to sing that rare soprano all the fiddles strummed with tuning up the made ring of reedy bubbling noises and the sting of sharp red brass pierced every patting from muffled tympani made dark slatting across the silver shimmering of flutes bassoon grunted and an oboe wailed the like great lutes and mutterings of double basses trailed away to silence while loud hailed their thin bright colours down in such scatter they lost themselves amid the general men women and ghosts by amy lowell https frau altgelt in the gallery alone felt lifted up into another world before her eyes thousand candles shone in the great chandeliers maze of curled and powdered periwigs past her eyes swirled she smelt the smoke of candles guttering and caught the glint of jewelled fans fluttering all round her in the boxes red and gold the house like rubies set in filigree filliped the candlelight about and bold young sparks with unblushingly ogled fair beauties in the balcony an officer went by his steel spurs jangling behind charlotta an old man was wrangling about he had bought and lost three drunken soldiers had to be ejected frau altgelt eyes stared at the vacant post of she at once detected the stir which brought him but she felt neglected when with glance about him or her way he lifted up his violin to play the curtain went up perhaps if so charlotta never saw it go the famous fraeulein gebnitz singing only came to her like the ringing of bells at festa which swing in the air and nobody realizes they are there they jingle and jangle and clang and bang and never soul could tell whether they rang the plopping of guns and rockets and the chinking of silver to spend in one pockets and the shuffling and clapping of feet and the loud flapping of flags with the drums the military comes it famous tune to walk to and i wonder where they off to to the beating of the drums but the rhythm changes though mist were curling and twisting over the landscape moment rhythmless tuneless fog encompasses her then her senses jog to the breath of stately minuet herr altgelt violin is set in tune to the slow sweeping bows and retreats and advances to curtsies brushing the waxen floor the court dances long and peaceful like warm summer nights when stars shine in the quiet river and against the lights blundering insects knock and the clock booms twice through the shrill sounds of flutes and horns in the lamplit grounds pressed against him in the mazy wavering of country dance with her short breath quavering she leans upon the beating throbbing music laughing sobbing feet gliding after sliding feet the ballroom she feels the air lifting her hair and the lapping of water on the stone stair he is there he is there twang harps and squeal you thin violins that the dancers may dance and never discover the old stone stair leading down to the river with the branches hanging over her and her men women and ghosts by amy lowell https theodore still her lover the evening passed like this in half faint delirium with waking intervals which were the under the restraint of large company the constant calls oranges or syrops from the stalls outside the talk the passing to and fro lotta sat ill at ease incognito she heard the gebnitz praised the tenor lauded the music vaunted most excellent the scenery and the costumes were applauded the latter it was whispered had been sent from italy the herr direktor spent fortune on them so the gossips said charlotta felt lightness in her head when the next act began her eyes were swimming her prodded ears were aching and confused the first notes from the orchestra sent skimming her outward consciousness her brain was fused into the music theodore music used to hear him play she caught his single tone all she noticed they two were alone part fourth frau altgelt waited in the chilly street hustled by lackeys who ran up and down shouting their coachmen names forced to retreat pace or two by lurching chairmen thrown rudely aside by linkboys boldly shown the ogling rapture in two bleary eyes thrust close to hers in most unpleasant wise escaping these she hit liveried arm was sworn at by this glittering gentleman and ordered off however great harm came to her but she looked trifle wan when theodore her belated guardian emerged she snuggled up against him trembling half out of fear half out of the assembling of all the thoughts and needs his playing had given had she enjoyed herself he wished to know oh theodore ca you feel that it was heaven heaven my lottachen and was it so gebnitz was in good voice but all the flow of her last aria was spoiled by klops wretched flutist she was mad hops he was so simple so charlotta altgelt knew not what to say to bring him to her dream his lack of tact kept him explaining all the homeward way how this thing had gone well that badly stay theodore she cried at last you know to nothing was real it was an ecstasy and he was heartily glad she had enjoyed herself so much and said so but it good to be got home again he was employed in looking at his violin the wood was old and evening air did it good but when he drew up to the table tea something about his wife vivacity struck him hectic worried him in short he talked of this and that but watched her close tea over he endeavoured to extort the cause of her excitement she arose and stood beside him trying to compose herself all whipt to quivering curdled life and he poor fool misunderstood his men women and ghosts by amy lowell https suddenly broken through her anxious grasp her love crashed on him there amazed he felt her fling against him clasp her arms about him weighing down his chair sobbing out all her hours of despair theodore woman needs to hear things proved unless you tell i feel i not loved theodore went under in this tearing wave he yielded to it and its headlong flow filled him with all the energy she gave he was youth again and this bright glow this living vivid joy he had to show her what she was to him laughing and crying she asked assurances there denying over and over again her questions till he quite convinced her every now and then she kissed him shivering though doubting still but later when they were composed and when she dared relax her probings lottachen he asked how is it your love has withstood my inadvertence i was made of wood she told him and doubt she meant it truly that he was sun and grass and wind and sky to her and even if conscience were unruly she salved it by neat sophistries but why suppose her insincere it was lie she said heinrich was much forgot though he never been within earshot but theodore hands in straying and caressing fumbled against the locket where it lay upon her neck what is this thing i pressing he asked let bring it to the light of day he lifted up the locket it should stay outside my dear your mother has good taste to keep it hidden surely is waste pity again charlotta straight aroused out of her happiness the locket brought chilly jet of truth upon her soused under its icy spurting she was caught and choked and frozen suddenly she sought the clasp but with such art was this contrived her fumbling fingers never once arrived upon it feeling twisting round and round she pulled the chain quite through the locket ring and still it held her neck encompassed bound chafed at the sliding meshes such thing to hurl her out of joy gilded string binding her folly to her and those curls which lay entwined beneath the clustered pearls again she tried to break the cord it stood unclasp it theodore she begged but he refused and being in happy mood twitted her with her inefficiency then looking at her very seriously i think charlotta it is well to have always about one what mother gave she has taken the great pains to send this jewel to you from dresden it will be ingratitude if you not intend to carry it about you constantly with her fine taste you can not disagree the locket is most beautifully designed he opened it and there the curls were twined charlotta heart dropped beats like men women and ghosts by amy lowell https she burned moment flaming then she froze her face was jerked by little nervous twitches she heard her husband asking what are those put out her hand quickly to interpose but stopped the gesture astounded at the calm way the question was propounded pretty fancy dear i declare indeed i will not let you put it off lovely thought yours and your mother hair charlotta hid gasp under cough never with my connivance shall you doff this charming gift he kissed her on the cheek and lotta suffered him quite crushed and meek when later in their room she lay awake watching the moonlight slip along the floor she felt the chain and wept theodore sake she had loved heinrich also and the core of truth unlovely startled her wherefore she vowed from now to break this double life and see herself only theodore wife part fifth it was easy matter to convince heinrich that it was finished hard to say that though they could not meet he saw her wince she still must keep the locket to allay suspicion in her husband she would pay him from her savings bit by oath he swore at that was startling to them both her resolution taken frau altgelt adhered to it and suffered regret she found her husband all that she had felt his music to contain her days were set in his though she were an amulet cased in bright gold she joyed in her confining her eyes put out her with shining charlotta was so gay that old dull tasks were furbished up to seem like rituals she baked and brewed one who only asks the right to serve her daily manuals of prayer were duties and her festivals when theodore praised some dish or frankly said she had knack in making up bed so autumn went and all the mountains round the city glittered white with fallen snow it was winter over the hard ground herr altgelt footsteps came each one blow on the swept flags behind the currant row charlotta stood to greet him but his lip only flicked hers his was first again this evening he had got important news the opera ordered from young mozart was arrived that old despot the bishop of salzburg had let him come himself to lead it and the parts still hot from copying had been tried over never had any music started such fever the orchestra had cheered till they were hoarse the singers clapped and clapped the town was made with such great attraction through the course of carnival time in what utter shade all other cities would be left the trade in music would all drift here naturally in his excitement he forgot his tea lotta was forced to take his cup and put it in his hand but still he rattled men women and ghosts by amy lowell https sipping at intervals the new catgut strings he was using gave out such tone the maestro had remarked it and had gone out of his way to praise him lotta smiled he was happy little child from that day on herr altgelt more and more absorbed himself in work lotta at first was patient and but it wore upon her when two weeks had brought burst of loving from him then she feared the worst that his short interest in her was light flared up an instant only in the night was the opera name name that poor charlotta learnt to hate herr altgelt worked so hard he seldom came home his tea and it was very late past midnight sometimes when he knocked his state was like flabby orange whose crushed skin is thin with pulling and all dented in he practised every morning and her heart followed his bow but often she would sit while he was playing quite withdrawn apart absently fingering and touching it the locket which now seemed to her bit of some gone youth his music drew her tears and through the notes he played her dreading ears heard heinrich voice saying he had not changed beer merchants had ecstasies to take their minds off love so far her thoughts had ranged away from her stern vow she chanced to take her way one morning quite by mistake along the street where heinrich had his shop what harm to pass it since she should not stop it matters nothing how one day she met him on bridge and blushed and hurried by nor how the following week he stood to let her pass the pavement narrowing suddenly how once he took her basket and once he pulled back rearing horse who might have struck her with his hoofs it seemed the oddest luck how many times their business took them each right to the other then at last he spoke but she would only nod he got speech from her next time he treated it in joke and that so lightly that her vow she broke and answered so they drifted into seeing each other before there was fleeing christmas was over and the carnival was very near and tripping from each tongue was talk of the new opera each flaunted it out in bills what airs were sung what singers hired pictures of the young maestro were sale the town was mad only charlotta felt depressed and sad each day now brought struggle her will and heinrich her love theodore and him sometimes she wished to kill herself to solve her problem score of reasons heinrich tempted her he bore her moods with patience and so surely urged himself upon her she was slowly merged into his way of thinking and to fly with him seemed easy but next morning would the stradivarius undo her mood then she would realize that she must men women and ghosts by amy lowell https always to theodore and she would try to convince heinrich she should never leave and afterwards she would go home and grieve all thought in munich centered on the part of january when there would be given by wolfgang mozart the was fixed and all seats even those almost at the ceiling which were driven behind the highest gallery were sold the inches of the theatre went gold herr altgelt was shadow worn so thin with work he hardly printed black behind the candle he and his old violin made up one person he was not unkind but dazed outside his playing and the rind the pine and maple of his fiddle guarded part of him which he had quite discarded it woke in the silence of nights in little lights like flickering fluttering spurting sputtering fading and lighting together till lotta sat up in bed with wonder and the faint grey patch of the window shone upon her sitting there alone theodore slept the was last rehearsal day was called noon so early morning meant herr altgelt only time in which to play his part alone drawn like monk who spent himself in prayer and fasting theodore went into the kitchen with weary word of cheer to lotta careless if she heard lotta heard more than his spoken word she heard the vibrating of strings and wood she was washing the dishes her hands all suds when the sound began long the span of white road snaking about hill the orchards are filled with cherry blossoms at butterfly poise hawthorn buds are cracking and in the distance shepherd is clacking his shears the wool from his sheep the notes are asleep lying adrift on the air in level lines like sunlight hanging in pines and pines strung and threaded all imbedded in the of the hazy pines straight lines and stems long straight stems pushing up to the cup of blue blue sky stems growing misty with the many of them mist of the trees and these notes the back is maple and the belly is pine the rich notes twine though weaving in and out of leaves broad leaves flapping slowly like elephants men

man with number and set him to wag his legs and his arms at the word of command or the blow of whistle he certainly damned fit only if little gold lace and an upturned moustache can set him to face

booming and swooping looping round corners sliding over the whipping and veering and careering over the roofs like thousand clattering horses spruggins had been dining in the city spruggins was none too steady in his gait and the wind played ball with spruggins and laughed it whistled past him it rolled him along the street with his little feet on the flags of the sidewalk and his muffler and his blown straight out behind him it bumped him against area railings and chuckled in his ear when he said ouch sometimes it lifted him clear off his little patting feet and bore him in triumph over three grey flagstones and quarter the moon dodged in and out of clouds winking it was all very unpleasant spruggins and when the wind flung him hard against his own front door it was relief although the breath was quite knocked out of him the in front of the house flared up and the keyhole was big barn door the flickered away to sputtering blue star and the keyhole went out with it such stabbing and jabbing and sticking and picking and poking and pushing and prying with that key and there is denying that spruggins rapped out an oath or two them out to real roll but the door opened at last and spruggins blew through it into his own hall and slammed the door to so hard that the knocker banged five times before it stopped spruggins struck light and lit candle and all the time the moon winked at him through the window why could you find the keyhole spruggins taunted the wind i can find the keyhole and the wind thin wire darted in and seized the candle flame and knocked it over to one side and pummelled it but spruggins held the candle so close that it singed his chin and ran and stumbled up the stairs in surprisingly agile manner the wind through the keyhole kept saying spruggins spruggins behind him the fire in his bedroom burned brightly the room with its crimson bed and window curtains was red and glowing carbuncle it was still and warm there was wind here the windows were fastened and moon the curtains were drawn the candle flame stood up like pointed pear in wide brass dish spruggins sighed with content he was safe at home the fire and yellow roses in the black basket of the and the bed with its crimson hangings seemed great peony wide open and placid spruggins slipped off his and his muffler he slipped off his coat and his flowered waistcoat he put on flannel and tied peaked under his chin he wound his large gold watch and placed it under his pillow then he tiptoed over to the window and pulled back the men women and ghosts by amy lowell https there was the moon dodging in and out of the clouds but behind him was his quiet candle there was the wind whisking along the street the window rattled but it was fastened did the wind say spruggins all spruggins heard was dying away down the street he dropped the curtain and got into bed martha had been in the last thing with the the bed was warm and spruggins sank into feathers with the familiar ticking of his watch just under his head spruggins dozed he had forgotten to put out the candle but it did not make much difference the fire was so bright too bright the red and yellow roses pricked his eyelids they scorched him back to consciousness he tried to shift his position he could not move something weighed him down he could not breathe he was gasping pinned down and suffocating he opened his eyes the curtains of the window were flung back the fire and the candle were out and the room was filled with green moonlight and pressed against the was wide round face solemnly dropping one eyelid after the other the watch under his pillow the face at the window it was not the fire roses which had pricked him it was the winking eyes spruggins tried to bounce up he could not his heart flapped up into his mouth and fell back dead on his chest was fat pink pig on the pig blackamoor with ten pound weight cap his mustachios kept curling up and down like angry snakes and his eyes rolled round and round with the pupils coming into sight and disappearing and appearing again on the other side the holsters at his were two port bottles and curved hung at his belt scimitar while fork and keg of spirits were strapped to the saddle behind he dug his spurs into the pig which trampled and snorted and stamped its cloven feet deeper into spruggins then the green light on the floor began to undulate it heaved and hollowed it rose like tide full of claws and scales and wriggles the air above his bed began to move it weighed over him in mass of draggled feathers not one lifted to stir the air they drooped and dripped with smell of port wine and brandy closing down slowly trickling drops on the suddenly the window fell in with great scatter of glass and the moon burst into the room spruggins it rolled toward him green ball of flame with two eyes in the center red eye and yellow men women and ghosts by amy lowell https dropping their lids slowly one after the other spruggins tried to scream but the blackamoor leapt off his pig with cry drew his scimitar and plunged it into spruggins mouth spruggins got up in the cold dawn and remade the fire then he crept back to bed by the light which seeped in under the window curtains and lay there shivering while the bells of george the martyr chimed the quarter after seven the paper windmill the little boy pressed his face against the and looked out at the bright sunshiny morning the of the square glistened like mica in the trees breeze danced and pranced and shook drops of sunlight like falling golden coins into the brown water of the canal down stream slowly drifted long string of galliots piled with crimson cheeses the little boy thought they looked if they were roc eggs blocks of big ruby eggs he said oh with delight and pressed against the window with all his might the golden cock on the top of the gleamed his beak was open like pair of scissors and narrow piece of blue sky was wedged in it cried the little boy ca you hear through the window gold cocky you should crow when you see the eggs of your cousin the great roc but the golden cock stood stock still with his ﬁne tail blowing in the wind he could not understand the little boy he said cocorico when he said anything but he was hung in the air to swing not to sing his eyes glittered to the bright west wind and the crimson cheeses drifted away down the canal it was very dull there in the big room outside in the square the wind was playing tag with some fallen leaves man passed with dogcart beside him full of smart new milkcans they rattled out gay tune have some milk your tea cream your coffee to drink thick and smooth and sweet and white and the man sabots beat an accompaniment plop trop milk your tea plop trop drink it it was very pleasant out there but it was lonely here in the big room the little boy gulped at tear it was queer how dull all his toys were they were so still nothing was still in the square if he took his eyes away moment it had changed the milkman had disappeared round the corner there was only an old woman with basket of green stuff on her head picking her way over the shiny stones but the wind pulled the leaves in the basket this way and that and displayed them to beautiful advantage the sun patted them condescendingly on their ﬂat surfaces and they seemed sprinkled with silver the little boy sighed he looked at his disordered toys on the ﬂoor they were motionless and their colours were dull the dark wainscoting absorbed the sun there was none left toys the square was quite empty now only the wind ran round and round it spinning away over in the corner where street opened into the square the wind had stopped stopped running that is it never stopped spinning it whirred and whirled and gyrated and turned it burned like great coloured sun it hummed and buzzed and sparked and darted there were ﬂashes of blue and long smearing lines of saffron and quick jabs of green and over it all was sheen like myriad cut diamonds round and round it went the huge and the little boy head reeled with watching it the whole square was ﬁlled with its rays blazing and leaping round after one another faster and faster the little boy could not speak he could only gaze staring in amaze the was coming down the square nearer and nearer it came great disk of spinning ﬂame it was opposite the window now and the little boy could see it plainly but it was men women and ghosts by amy lowell https than the wind which he saw man was carrying huge frame on his shoulder and stuck in it were many little painted paper windmills each one scurrying round in the breeze they were bright and beautiful and the sight was one to please anybody and how much more little boy who had only stupid motionless toys to enjoy the little boy clapped his hands and his eyes danced and whizzed the circling windmills made him dizzy closer and closer came the windmill man and held up his big fan to the little boy in the window of the ambassador house only pane of glass between the boy and the windmills they slid round before his eyes in rapidly revolving splendour there were wheels and wheels of little thick one clear perfect spin the windmill vend or dipped and raised them again and the little boy face was glued to the oh what glorious wonderful plaything rings and rings of windy colour always moving how had any one ever preferred those other toys which never stirred nursie come quickly look i want windmill see it is never still you will buy one wo you i want that silver one with the big ring of blue so servant was sent to buy that one silver ringed with blue and smartly it twirled about in the servant hands he stood moment to pay the vendor then he entered the house and in another minute he was standing in the nursery door with some crumpled paper on the end of stick which he held out to the little boy but i want ed windmill which went round cried the little boy that is the one you asked master charles nursie was bit impatient she had mending to see it is silver and here is the blue but it is only blue streak sobbed the little boy i wanted blue ring and this silver does sparkle well master charles that is what you wanted now run away and play with it i am very busy the little boy hid his tears against the friendly on the ﬂoor lay the motionless crumpled bit of paper on the end of its stick but far away across the square was the windmill vendor with his big wheel of whirring splendour it spun round in blaze like whirling rainbow and the sun gleamed upon it and the wind whipped it until it seemed maze of spattering diamonds cocorico crowed the golden cock on the top of the that is something worth crowing but the little boy did not hear him he was sobbing over the crumpled bit of paper on the ﬂoor the red lacquer of crimson lacquer long since brought in some fast from china quaintly wrought with bossed and carven flowers and fruits in blackening gold the slender shaft all twined about and thickly scrolled with vine leaves and young twisted tendrils whirling curling flinging their new shoots over the four wings and swirling out on the three wide feet in golden lumps and streams petals and apples in high relief and where the seams are worn with handling through the polished crimson sheen long streaks of black the under lacquer shine out clean four desks adjustable to suit the heights of players sitting to viols or standing up to sing four layers of music to serve every instrument are there and on the apex large golden pear it burns in red and yellow dusty smouldering lights when the sun flares the old with its flights and skips upon the crystal knobs of dim sideboards legless and mouldy and hops glint to glint on hoards of scythes and spades and so the old tools are little candles throwing brightness round in pools with oriental splendour red and gold the dust covering its flames like smoke and thinning gust of brighter sunshine makes the colours leap and range the strange old seems to strike out and change to stroke and tear the darkness with sharp golden claws to dart forked vermilion tongue from open jaws to puff out bitter smoke which chokes the sun and fade back to still faint outline obliterate in men women and ghosts by amy lowell https creeping up the ladder into the loft the boy stands watching very still prickly and hot with joy he sees the dusty slit by streaks of red he sees it split and stream and all about his head spikes and spears of gold are licking pricking flicking scratching against the walls and furniture and nicking the darkness into sparks chipping away the gloom the boy nose smarts with the pungence in the room the wind pushes an elm branch from before the door and the sun widens out all along the floor filling the with white straightforward light so not one blurred outline can tease the mind to fright all ye works of the lord bless ye the lord praise him and magnify him ever let the earth bless the lord yea let it praise him and magnify him ever ye mountains and hills bless ye the lord praise him and magnify him ever all ye green things upon the earth bless ye the lord praise him and magnify him ever the boy will praise his god on an altar builded fair will heap it with the works of the lord in the morning air spices shall burn on it and by their pale smoke curled like shoots of all the green things the god of this bright world shall see the boy desire to pay his debt of praise the boy turns round about seeking with careful gaze an altar meet and worthy but each table and chair has some defect each piece is needing some repair to perfect it the chairs have broken legs and backs the tables are uneven and every highboy lacks handle or drawer the desks are bruised and worn and even wide sofa has its cane seat torn only in the gloom far in the corner there the lacquer is elegant and rare clear and slim of line with its four wings outspread the sound of old quartets tenuous faint thread hanging and floating over it it stands black and gold and crimson in one twisted scheme candle on the bookcase feels draught and wavers stippling the walls with dancing shades and quavers grown colossal jigs about the ceiling and shadows strangely altered stain the walls revealing eagles and rabbits and weird faces pulled awry and hands which fetch and carry things incessantly under the eastern window where the morning sun must touch it stands the and on each one of its broad platforms is pyramid of stones and metals and dried flowers and pine and hemlock cones an oriole nest with the four eggs neatly blown the rattle of rattlesnake and three large brown butternuts uncracked six butterflies impaled with green luna moth freshly scaled some sunflower seeds wampum and shell blue jay feather all together piled the stand will hold more the boy with humming head looks once again blows out the light and creeps to bed the boy keeps solemn vigil while outside the wind blows gustily and clear and slaps against the blind he hardly tries to sleep so sharp his ecstasy it burns his soul to emptiness and sets it free adoration only worship dedicate his unsheathed soul is naked in its novitiate the hours strike below from the clock on the stair the boy is white flame suspiring in prayer morning will bring the sun the golden eye of him whose splendour must be veiled by starry cherubim whose feet shimmer like crystal in the streets of heaven like an open rose the sun will stand up even fronting the and when the casement glows with the morning then the fire which men women and ghosts by amy lowell https from the sun will fall upon the altar and ignite the spices and his sacrifice will burn in perfumed light over the the ghosts of sounds will swim and accorded to hymn the boy will see the faintest breath of angels wings fanning the smoke and voices will flower through the strings he dares farther vision and with scalding eyes waits upon the daylight and his great emprise the cold grey light of dawn was whitening the wall when the boy by sleeplessness started his ritual he washed all shivering and pointed like flame he threw the shutters open and in the the morning glimmered like tarnished venice glass he took his chinese pastilles and put them in mass upon the mantelpiece till he could seek plate worthy to hold them burning alas he had been late in thinking of this need and now he could not find platter or saucer rare enough to ease his mind the house was not astir and he dared not go down into the lest some door should be blown and slam before the draught he made he went out the light was growing yellower and still he looked about flash of almost crimson from the gilded pear upon the startled him waiting there the sun would rise and he would meet it unprepared labelled fool in having missed what he had dared he ran across the room took his pastilles and laid them on the pear most carefully displayed to light with ease then stood little to one side focussed and painstakingly tried to hold it angled so the bunched and prismed rays should leap upon each other and spring into blaze sharp wheeling edge of disked carnation flame and cutting upward slowly the round sun came the arrowed fire caught the and glanced split to multitude of pointed spears and lanced deeper hotter flame it took the incense pile which welcomed it and broke into little smile of yellow flamelets creeping crackling thrusting up golden lily in lacquer cup ye fire and heat bless ye the lord praise him and magnify him ever ye winter and summer bless ye the lord praise him and magnify him ever ye nights and days bless ye the lord praise him and magnify him ever ye lightnings and clouds bless ye the lord praise him and magnify him ever moment so it hung seeming chalice foamed with sunrise the boy woke from his dreaming spike of flame had caught the card of butterflies the oriole nest took fire soon all four galleries where he had spread his treasures were become one tongue of gleaming brutal fire the boy instantly swung his pitcher off the and turned it upside down the flames drooped back and sizzled and all his senses grown acute by fear the boy grabbed the quilt from his bed and flung it over all and then with aching head he watched the early sunshine glint on the remains of his holy offering the lacquer stand had stains ugly and charred all over and where the golden pear had been deep black hole gaped miserably his dear treasures were puffs of ashes only the stones were there winking in the brightness the clock upon the stair struck five and in the kitchen someone shook grate the boy began to dress it was getting men women and ghosts by amy lowell https day bath the day is and fair and there is smell of tulips and narcissus in the air the sunshine pours in at the window and bores through the water in the in lathes and planes of it cleaves the water into ﬂaws like jewel and cracks it to bright light little spots of sunshine lie on the surface of the water and dance dance and their reﬂections wobble deliciously over the ceiling stir of my ﬁnger sets them whirring reeling i move foot and the planes of light in the water jar i lie back and laugh and let the water the ﬂawed beryl water ﬂow over the day is almost too bright to bear the green water covers from the too bright day i will lie here awhile and play with the water and the sun spots the sky is blue and high crow ﬂaps by the window and there is whiff of tulips and narcissus in the air breakfast table in the sunlight the breakfast table is decked and white it offers itself in ﬂat surrender tendering tastes and smells and colours and metals and grains and the white cloth falls over its side draped and wide wheels of white glitter in the silver hot and spinning like they whirl and my eyes begin to smart the little white dazzling wheels prick them like darts placid and peaceful the rolls of bread spread themselves in the sun to bask stack of butter pyramidal shout orange through the white scream ﬂutter call yellow yellow yellow coffee steam rises in stream clouds the silver with mist and twists up into the sunlight revolved involuted suspiring higher and
