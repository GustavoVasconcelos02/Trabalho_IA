complete by percy bysshe shelley and https bysshe shelley volume 1 oxford edition including materials never before printed in any edition of the poems edited with textual notes by thomas hutchinson editor of the oxford wordsworth pref ace this edition of his poetical works contains all shelley ascertained poems and fragments of verse that have hitherto appeared in print in preparing the volume i have worked far possible on the principle of recognizing the editio princeps the primary textual authority i have not been content to reprint shelley recension of 1839 or that of any subsequent editor of the poems the present text is the result of fresh collation of the early editions and in every material instance of departure from the wording of those originals the rejected reading has been subjoined in footnote again in the case of julian and maddalo has appeared to be good reason superseding the authorit y of the editio princeps the fact is announced and the substituted exemplar indicated in the prefatory note in the case of few pieces extant in two or more versions of debatable authority the alternative text or texts will be found at the end of the relevant work but it may be said once all that this does not pretend to be variorum edition in the proper sense of the textual apparatus does not claim to be exhaustive thus i have not thought it necessary to cumber the footnotes with every minute grammatical correction introduced by shelley apparently on her own authority into the texts of 1839 nor has it come within the scheme of this edition to record every conjectural emendation adopted or proposed by rossetti and others in recent times but it is hoped that up to and including the editions of 1839 at least important variation of the text has been overlooked whenever reading has been adopted on manuscript authority reference to the particular source has been added below i have been chary of gratuitous interference with the punctuation of the manuscripts and early editions in this direction however some revision was indispensable even in his most carefully ﬁnished fair copy shelley under thus in the exquisite autograph hunt of julian and maddalo buxton forman the most conservative of editors ﬁnds it necessary to supplement shelley punctuation in fewer than places and sometimes punctuates capriciously in the very act of transcribing his mind was apt to stray from the work in hand to higher thing s he would lose himself in contemplating those airy abstractions and lofty visions of which alone he greatly cared to sing to the neglect and detriment of the merely external and formal element of his song shelley recked little of the jots and tittles of literary craftsmanship he committed many small sin against the rules the project gutenberg ebook of the complete poetical works of percy bysshe shelley complete by percy bysshe shelley and https and certainly paid but halting attention to the nice distinctions of punctuation thus in the early editions comma occasionally plays the part of semicolon colons and semicolons seem to be employed interchangeably semicolon almost invariably appears where nowadays we should employ the dash and lastly the dash itself becomes point of all work replacing indifferently comma s colons semicolons or periods inadequate and sometimes haphazard it is however shelley punctuation so far it goes is of great value an index to his metrical or at times it may be to his rhetorical in shelley hands punctuation serves rather to mark the rhythmical pause and onﬂow of the verse or to secure some declamatory effect than to indicate the structure or elucidate the sense this reason the original pointing has been retained save where it tends to obscure or pervert the poet meaning amongst the editor notes at the end of the volume 3 the reader will ﬁnd lists of the punctual variations in the longer poems by means of which the supplementary points now added may be identiﬁed and the original points which in this edition have been deleted or else replaced by others ascertained in the order of their occurrence in the use of capitals shelley practice has been followed while an attempt has been made to reduce the number of his inconsistencies in this regard to have reproduced the spelling of the manuscripts would only have served to divert attention from shelley poetry to my own ingenuity in disgusting the reader according to the rules of editorial punctilio i adapt phrase or two from the preface to the revolt of islam shelley was neither very accurate nor always consistent in his spelling he was to say the truth indifferent about all such matters indeed to one absorbed in the spectacle of world travailing lack of the gospel of political justice the study of orthographical niceties must have seemed an occupation bedlam ites distinguished critic and editor of shelley professor dowden aptly observes in this great poet is not of an age but all time irregular or antiquated forms such and the like can only serve to distract the reader attention and mar his enjoyment of the verse accordingly shelley eccentricities in this kind have been discarded and his spelling reversed in accordance with modern usage all weak whether indicatives or participles have been printed with ed rather than t participial adjectives and substantives such alone excepted in the case of which has two both employed by shelley see an example of the longer form the hymn to mercury 18 5 where rhymes with line 1 the shorter form rhyming to occurs more frequently with the long vowel of the the other with of course wherever this takes place whether indicated by corresponding change in the spelling or not t not ed is properly etc the forms discarded under the general rule laid down above are such etc like that of from have not hesitated to print the longer form and the shorter after henry sweet example in order clearly to indicate the pronunciation intended by shelley in the editions the two are confounded under the one spelling in few cases shelley spelling though unusual or obsolete has been retained thus in and one or two more words the ae will be found and still appears shelley seems to have uniformly written here the word is so printed whenever it is employed trisyllable elsewhere the ordinary spelling has been adopted not little has been written about revolt of islam 3 21 5 which has been described deliberately coined by shelley better warrant than the exigency of the rhyme there can be little doubt the project

third person singular of the present or here the verbal substantive the editor of shelley enters upon goodly heritage the accumulated gains of series of distinguished predecessors shelley two editions of 1839 form the nucleus of the present volume and her notes are here reprinted in full but the arrangement of the poems differs to some extent from that followed by in respect of queen mab which is here placed at the head of the juvenilia instead of at the forefront of the poems of shelley maturity in 1862 slender volume of poems and fragments entitled relics of shelley was published by richard garnett precious sheaf gleaned from the manuscripts preserved at boscombe manor the relics constitute salvage second only in value to the posthumous poems of to the growing mass of shelley verse yet more material was added in 1870 by william michael rossetti who edited moxon the complete poetical works published in that year to him we owe in particular revised and greatly enlar ged version of the fragmentary drama of charles i but though not seldom successful in restoring the text rossetti pushed revision beyond the bounds of prudence freely correcting grammatical errors rectifying small

blind with the aid of material furnished by garnett enabled in the words of buxton forman supply omissions make authoritative emendations and controvert erroneous changes in rossetti work and in the more cautiously edited text of his later edition published by moxon in 1878 may be traced the inﬂuence of her strictures six years later appeared variorum edition in which the ﬁrst time shelle y text was edited with scientiﬁc exactness of method and with due respect the authority of the original editions it would be difﬁcult indeed to the gains which have accrued to the lovers of shelley from the strenuous labours of harry buxton forman he too has enlar ged the body of shelley poetry forman most notable addition is the second part of the daemon of the world which he printed privately in 1876 and included in his library edition of the poetical works published in the same year see the list of editions etc at the end of volume 3 but important his editions undoubtedly are it may safely be afﬁrmed that his services in this direction constitute the least part of what we owe him he has vindicated the authenticity of the text in many places while in many others he has succeeded with the

fruits of careful scrutiny of the shelley manuscripts now lodged in the bodleian library locock succeeded in recovering several inedited fragments of verse and prose amon gst the poems chieﬂy

the text generally and the various quarters in which it lies open to conjectural emendation i can not better than quote the following succinct and luminous account from causerie on the shelley manuscripts in the bodleian library contributed by richard garnett to the columns of the speaker of december 19 1903 the textual point of view shelley works may be divided into three published in his lifetime under his own direction those also published in his lifetime but in his absence from the press and those published after his death the ﬁrst class includes queen mab the revolt of islam and alastor with its appendages published in england before his ﬁnal departure the continent and the cenci and adonais printed under his own eye at leghorn and pisa respectively except some provoking but corrigible misprints in the revolt of islam and one crucial passage in alastor these poems afford little material conjectural emendation the alexandrines now and then left in the middle of stanzas in the revolt of islam must remain untouched proceeding not from the printer carelessness but the author the second class poems printed during shelley lifetime but not under his immediate inspection comprise prometheus unbound and rosalind and helen together with the pieces which accompanied them epipsychidion hellas and swellfoot the tyrant the correction of the most important of these the prometheus was the least satisfactory shelley though speaking plainly to the publisher rather hints than expresses his dissatisfaction when writing to gisborne the corrector but there is pretty clear hint when on subsequent occasion he says to him i have received which is prettily printed and with fewer mistakes than any poem i ever published this also was probably not the project gutenberg ebook

ﬁrst published after his facsimiles have been published to prove that trelawny graphic description of the chaotic state of most of them was really in respect difﬁculty is much augmented by the fact that these pieces are rarely consecutive but literally disiecti membra poetae scattered through various notebooks in way to require piecing together well deciphering the editors of the posthumous poems moreover though diligent according to their light were neither endowed with remarkable acumen nor possessed of the wide knowledg requisite the full intelligence of so erudite poet shelley hence the perpetration of numerous mistakes some few of the manuscripts indeed such those of the witch of atlas julian and maddalo and the lines at naples were beautifully written out the press in shelley best hand but their very value and beauty necessitated the ordeal of transcription with disastrous results in several instances an entire line dropped out of the lines at naples and although julian and maddalo was extant in more than one very clear copy the printed text had several such errors least lead corrupt state of the text has stimula ted the ingenuity of numerous correctors who have suggested many acute and convincing emendations and some very speciou s ones which sustained scrutiny has proved untenable it should be needless to remark that success has in general been proportionate to the facili ties of access to the manuscripts which have only of late become generally available if shelley is less fortunate than most modern poets in the purity of his text he is more fortunate than many in the preservation of his manuscripts these have not regards fair proportion been destroyed or dispersed at auctions but were protected from either fate by their very character confused memoranda such they remained in the possession of shelley widow and passed from her to her son and daughter after sir percy shelley death lady shelley took the occasion of the erection of the monument to shelley at university college oxford to present certain of the manuscripts to the bodleian library and verse and sculpture form an imperishable memorial of his connection with the university where his residence was so brief and troubled garnett proceeds most important of the bodleian manuscripts is that of prometh eus unbound which says locock has the appearance of being an intermediate draft and also the ﬁrst copy made this should confer consider able authority on its variations from the accepted text this appears to have been printed from copy not made by shelley himself my he writes to ollier on september 6 1819 is now being transcribed an expression which he would hardly have used if he had himself been the copyist he wished the proofs to be sent to him in italy correction but to this ollier objected and on may 14 1820 shelley signiﬁes his acquiescence adding however in this case i shall repose trust in your care respecting the correction of the press gisborne will revise it he heard it recited and will therefore more readily seize any error this conﬁdence in the accuracy of gisborne verbal memory is touching from letter to gisborne on may 26 following it appears that the offer to correct came from him and that shelley sent him two little papers of corrections and additions which were probably made use of or the fact would have been made known in the case of additions this may satisfactorily account apparent omissions in the bodleian manuscript gisborne after all did not prove fully up to the mark it is to be regretted writes shelley to ollier on november 20 that the errors of the press are so numerous adding i shall send you the list of errata in day or two this was probably the list of errata written by shelley himself from

the project gutenberg ebook of the complete poetical works of percy bysshe shelley complete by percy bysshe shelley and https ace by shelley to first collected edition obstacles have long existed to my presenting the public with perfect edition of shelley poems these being at last happily removed i hasten to fulﬁl an important duty of giving the productions of sublime genius to the world with all the correctness possible and of at the same time detailing the history of those productions they sprang living and warm from his heart and brain i abstain from any remark on the occurrences of his private life except inasmuch the passions which they engendered inspired his poetry this is not the time to relate the truth and i should reject any colouring of the truth account of these events has ever been given at all approa ching reality in their details either regards himself or others nor shall i further allude to them than to remark that the errors of action committed by man noble and generous shelley may far he only is concerned be fearlessly avowed by those who loved him in the ﬁrm conviction that were they judged impartially his character would stand in fairer and brighter light than that of any contemporary whatever faults he had ought to ﬁnd extenuation among his fellows since they prove him to be human without them the exalted nature of his soul would have raised him into something divine the qualities that struck any one newly introduced to shelley were gentle and cordial goodness that animated his intercourse with warm affection and helpful sympathy the other the eagerness and ardour with which he was attached to the cause of human happiness and improvement and the fervent eloquence with which he discussed such subjects his conversation was marked by its happy abundance and the beautiful language in which he clothed his poetic ideas and philosophical notions to defecate life of its misery and its evil was the ruling passion of his soul he dedicated to it every power of his mind every pulsation of his heart he looked on political freedom the direct agent to effect the happiness of mankind and thus any hope of liberty inspired joy and an exultation more intense and wild than he could have felt any personal advantage those who have never experienced the workings of passion on general and unselﬁsh subjects can not understand this and it must be difﬁcult of comprehension to the younger generation rising around since they can not remember the scorn and hatred with which the partisans of reform were regarded some few years ago nor the persecutions to which they were exposed he had been from youth the victim of the state of feeling inspired by the reaction of the french revolution and believing ﬁrmly in the justice and excellence of his views it can not be wondered that nature sensitive impetuous and generous his should put its whole force into the attempt to alleviate others the evils of those systems from which he had himself suffered many advantages attended his birth he spurne d them all when balanced with what he considered his duties he was generous to imprudence devoted to heroism these characteristics breathe througho ut his poetry the struggle human weal the resolution ﬁrm to martyrdom the impetuous pursuit the glad triumph in good the determination not to despair were the features that marked those of his works which he regarded with most complacency sustained by lofty subject and useful aim in addition to these his poems may be divided into two classes purely imaginative and those which sprang from the emotions of his heart among the former may be classed the project gutenberg ebook of the complete poetical works of percy bysshe shelley complete by percy bysshe shelley and https witch of atlas adonais and his latest composition left imperfect the triumph of life in the ﬁrst of these particularly he gave the reins to his fancy and luxuriated in every idea it rose in all there is that sense of mystery which formed an essential portion of his perception of clinging to the subtler inner spirit rather than to the outward curious and metaphysical anatomy of human passion and perception the second class is of course the more popular appealing at once to emoti ons common to us all some of these rest on the passion of love others on grief and despondency others on the sentiments inspired by natural objects shelley conception of love was exalted absorbing allied to all that is purest and noblest in our nature and warmed by earnest passion such it appears when he gave it voice in verse yet he was usually averse to expressing these feelings except when highly idealized and many of his more beautiful effusions he had cast aside unﬁnished and they were never seen by till after i had lost him others instance rosalind and helen and lines written among the euganean hills i found among his papers by chance and with some difﬁculty urged him to complete them there are others such the ode to the skylark and the cloud which in the opinion of many critics bear purer poetical stamp than any other of his productions they were written his mind prompted listening to the carolling of the bird aloft in the azure sky of italy or marking the cloud it sped across the heavens while he ﬂoated in his boat on the thames poet was ever warmed by more genuine and unforced inspiration his extreme sensibility gave the intensity of passio n to his intellectual pursuits and rendered his mind keenly alive to every perception of outward objects well to his internal sensations such gift is among the sad vicissitudes of human life the disappointments we meet and the galling sense of our own mistakes and errors fraught with pain to escape from such he delivered up his soul to poetry and felt happy when he sheltered himself from the inﬂuence of human sympathies in the wildest regions of fancy his imagination has been termed too brilliant his thoughts too subtle he loved to idealize reality and this is taste shared by few we are willing to have our passing whims exalted into passions this gratiﬁes our vanity but few of us understand or sympathize with the endeavour to ally the love of abstract beauty and adoration of abstract good the to agathon kai to kalon of the socratic philosophers with our sympathies with our kind in this shelley resembled plato both taking more delight in the abstract and the ideal than in the special and tangible this did not result from imitation it was not till shelley resided in italy that he made plato his study he then translated his symposium and his ion and the english language boasts of more brilliant composition than plato praise of love translated by shelley to return to his own poetry the luxury of imagination which sought nothing beyond itself child burdens itself with spring ﬂowers thinking of use beyond the enjoyment of gathering them often showed itself in his verses they will be only appreciated by minds which have resemblance to his own and the mystic subtlety of many of his thoughts will share the same fate the metaphysical strain that characterizes much of what he has written was indeed the portion of his works to which apart from those whose scope was to awaken mankind to aspirations what he considered the true and good he was himself particularly attached there is much however that speaks to the many

not given him to attain this knowledge it must be remembered that there is the stamp of such inexperience on all he wrote he had not completed his year when he died the calm of middle life did not add the seal of the virtues which adorn maturity to those generated by the vehement spirit of youth through life also he was martyr to and constant pain wound up his nerves to pitch of susceptibility that rendered his views of life different from those of man in the enjoyment of healthy sensations perfectly gentle and forbearing in manner he suffered good deal of internal irritability or rather excitement and his fortitude to bear was almost always on the stretch and thus during short life he had gone through more experience of sensation than many whose existence is protracted i die he said on the eve of his unanticipated death i have lived to be older than my father the weight of thought and feeling burdened him heavily you read his sufferings in his attenuated frame while you perceived the mastery he held over them in his animated countenance and brilliant eyes he died and the world showed outward sign but his inﬂuence over mankind though slow in growth is fast augmenting and in the ameliorations that have taken place in the political state of his country we may trace in part the operation of his arduous struggles his spirit gathers peace in its new state from the sense that though late his exertions were not made in vain and in the progress of the liberty he so fondly loved he died and his place among those who knew him intimately has never been ﬁlled up he walked beside them like spirit of good to comfort and enlighten the darkness of life with irradiations of genius to cheer it with his sympathy and love any one once attached to shelley must feel all other

falsehood of the tale which his enemies whispered in the ear of the ignorant world his life was spent in the contemplation of nature in arduous study or in acts of kindness and affection he was an elegant scholar and profound metaphysician without possessing much scientiﬁc knowledge he was unrivalled in the justness and extent of his observations on natural objects he knew every plant by its

with deep emotion he made his study and of the shadowed copse the stream the lake and the waterfall ill health and continual pain preyed upon his powers and the solitude in which we lived particularly on our ﬁrst arrival in italy although congenial to his feelings must frequently have weighed upon his spirits those beaut iful and affecting lines written in dejection near naples were composed at such an interval but when in health his spirits were buoyant and youthful to an extraordinary degree such was his love nature that every page of his poetry is associated in the minds of his friends with the loveliest scenes of the countries which he inhabited in early life he visited the most beautiful parts of this country and ireland afterwards the alps of switzerland became his inspirers prometheus unbound was written among the deserted and ﬂower ruins of rome and when he made his home under the pisan hills their rooﬂess recesses harboured him he composed the witch of atlas adonais and hellas in the wild but beautiful bay of spezzia the winds and waves which he loved became his playmates his days were chieﬂy spent on the water the management of his boat its alterations and improvements were his principal occupation at night when the unclouded moon shone on the calm sea he often went alone in his little shallop to the rocky caves that bordered it and sitting beneath their shelter wrote the triumph of life the last of his productions the beauty but strangeness of this lonely place the reﬁned pleasure which he felt in the companionship of few selected friends our

consolation was in the praise and earnest love that each voice bestowed and each countenance demonstrated him we had lost i fondly hope ever his unearthly and elevated nature is pledge of the

all his poems which were scattered in periodical works are collected in this volume and i have added reprint of alastor or the spiri t of solitude the difﬁculty with which copy can be obtained is the cause of its republication many of the miscellaneous poems written on the spur of the occasion and never retouched i found among his manuscript books and have carefully copied i have subjoined whenever i have been able the date of their composition i not know whether the critics will reprehend the insertion of some of the most imperfect among them but i frankly own that i have been more actuated by the fear lest any monument of his genius should escape than the wish of presenting nothing but what was complete to the fastidious reader i feel secure that the lovers of shelley poetry who know how more than any poet of the present day every line and word he wrote is instinct with peculiar beauty will pardon and thank i consecrate this volume to them the size of this collection has

established fame might fail without disgrace it is an experiment on the temper of the public mind to how far thirst happier condition of moral and political society survives among the enlightened and reﬁned the tempests which have shaken the age in which we live i have sought to enlist the harmony of metrical language the ethereal combinations of the fancy the rapid and subtle transitions of human passion all those elements which essen tially compose poem in the cause of liberal and comprehensive morality and in the view of kindling within the bosoms of my readers virtuous enthusiasm those doctrines of liberty and justice that faith and hope in something good which neither violence nor misre presentation nor prejudice can ever totally extinguish among mankind this purpose i have chosen story of human passion in its most universal character diversiﬁed with moving and romantic adventures and appealing in contempt of all artiﬁcial opinions or institutions to the common sympathies of every human breast i have made attempt to recommend the motives which i would substitute those at present governing mankind by methodical and systematic argument i would only awaken the feelings so that the reader should see the beauty of true virtue and be incited to those inquiries which have led to my moral and political creed and that of some of the sublimest intellects in the world the poem therefore with the exception of the ﬁrst canto which is purely introductory is narrative not didactic it is succession of pictu res illustrating the growth and progress of individual mind aspiring after excellence and devoted to the love of mankind its inﬂuence in reﬁning and making pure the most daring and uncommon impulses of the imagination the understanding and the senses its impatience at the oppressions which are done under the sun its tendency to awaken public hope and to enlighten and improve mankind the rapid effects of the application of that tendency the awakening of an immense nation from their slavery and degradation to true sense of moral dignity and freedom the bloodless dethronement of their oppressors and the unveiling of the religious frauds by which they had been deluded into submission the tranquillity of successful patriotism and the universal toleration and benevolence of true phila nthropy the treachery and barbarity of hired soldiers vice not the object of punishment and hatred but kindness and pity the faithlessness of tyrants the confederacy of the rulers of the world and the restoration of the expelled dynasty by foreign arms the massacre and

meaner desires let not the failure be imputed to natural unﬁtness human sympathy in these sublime and animating themes it is the business of the poet to communicate to others the pleasure and the enthusiasm arising out of those images and feelings in the vivid presence of which within his own mind consists at once his inspiration and his reward the panic which like an epidemic transport seized upon all classes of men during the excesses consequent upon the french revolution is gradually giving place to sanity it has ceased to be believed that whole generations of mankind ought to consign themselves to hopeless inheritance of ignorance and misery because nation of men who had been dupes and slaves centuries were incapab le of conducting themselves with the wisdom and tranquillity of freemen so soon some of their fetters were partially loosened that their conduct could not have been marked by any other characters than ferocity and thoughtlessness is the historical fact from which liberty derives all its recommendations and falsehood the worst features of its deformity there is reﬂux in the tide of human things which bears the shipwrecked hopes of men into secure haven after

of the most important crises produced by this feeling the sympathies connected with that event extended to every bosom the most generous and amiable natures were those which participated the most extensively in these sympathies but such degree of unmingled good was expected it was impossible to realise if the revolution had been in every respect prosperous then misrule and superstition would

taught by the effect which i shall produce upon those whom i now address i have avoided i have said before the imitation of any contemporary style but there must be resemblance which does not depend upon their own will between all the writers of any particular age they can not escape from subjection to common inﬂuence which arises out of an inﬁnite combination of circumstances belonging to the times in which they live though each is in degree the author of the very inﬂuence by which his being is thus pervaded thus the tragic poets of the age of pericles the italian revivers of ancient learning those mighty intellects of our own country that succeeded the reformation the translators of the bible shakespeare spenser the dramatists of the reign of elizabeth and lord bacon milton stands alone in the age which he illumin ed the colder spirits of the interval that succeeded all resemble each other and differ from every other in their several classes in this view of things ford can more be called the imitator of shakespeare than shakespeare the imitator of ford there were perhaps few other points of resemblance between these two men than that which the universal and inevitable inﬂuence of their age produced and this is an inﬂuence which neither the meanest scribbler nor the sublimest genius of any can escape and which i have not attempted to escape i have adopted the stanza of spenser measure inexpressibly beautiful not because i consider it ﬁner model of poetical harmony than the blank verse of shakespeare and milton but because in the latter there is shelter mediocrity you must either succe ed or fail this perhaps an aspiring spirit should desire but i was enticed also by the brilliancy and magniﬁcence of sound which mind that has been nourished upon musical thoughts can produce by just and harmonious arrangement of the pauses of this measure yet there will be found some instances where i have completely failed in this attempt and one which i here request the reader to consider an erratum where there is left most inadvertently an alexandrine in the middle of stanza but in this in every other respect i have written fearlessly it is the misfortune of this age that its writers too thoughtless of immortality are exquisitely sensible to temporary praise or blame they write with the fear of reviews before their eyes this system of criticism sprang up in that torpid interval when poetry was not poetry and the art which professes to regulate and limit its powers can not subsist together longinus could not have been the contemporary of homer nor boileau of horace yet this species of criticism never presumed to assert an understanding of its own it has always unlike true science followed not preceded the opinion of mankind and would even now bribe with worthless adulation some of our greatest poets to impose gratuitous fetters on their own imaginations and becom unconscious accomplices in the daily murder of all genius either not so aspiring or not so fortunate their own i have sought therefore to write i believe that homer shakespeare and milton the project gutenberg ebook of the complete poetical works of

my peace i shall understand the expressive silence of those sagacious enemies who dare not trust themselves to speak i shall endeavour to extract from the midst of insult and contempt and maledictions those admonitions which may tend to correct whatever imperfections such censurers may discover in this my ﬁrst serious appeal to the public if certain critics were clear they are malignant how great would be the beneﬁt to be derived from their virulent writings it is i fear i shall be malicious enough to be amused with their paltry tricks and lame invectives should the public judge that my composition is worthless i shall indeed bow before the tribunal from which milton received his crown of immortality and shall seek to gather if i live strength from that defeat which may nerve to some new enterprise of thought which may not be worthless i can not conceive that lucretius when he meditated that poem whose doctrines are yet the basis of our metaphysical knowledge and whose eloquence has been the wonder of mankind wrote in awe of such censure the hired sophists of the impure and superstitious noblemen of rome might afﬁx to what he should produce it was at the period when greece was led captive and asia made tributary to the republic fast verging itself to slavery and ruin that multitude of syrian captives bigoted to the worship of their obscene ashtaroth and the unworthy successors of socrates and zeno found there precarious subsistence by administering under the name of freedmen to the vices and vanities of the great these wretched men were skilled to plead with superﬁcial but plausible set of sophisms in favour of that contempt virtue which is the portion of slaves and that faith in portents the most fatal substitute benevolence in the imaginations of men which arising from the enslaved communities of the east then ﬁrst began to overwhelm the western nations in its stream were these the kind of men whose disapprobation the wise and lucretius should have regarded with salutary awe the latest and perhaps the meanest of those who follow in his footsteps would disdain to hold life on such conditions the poem now presented to the public occupied little more than six months in the composition that period has been devo ted to the task with unremitting ardour and enthusiasm i have exercised watchful and earnest criticism on my work it grew under my hands i would willingly have sent it forth to the world with that perfection which long labour and revision is said to bestow but i found that if i should gain something in exactness by this method i might lose much of the newness and energy of imagery and language it ﬂowed fresh from my mind and although the mere composition occupied more than six months the thoughts thus arranged were slowly gathered in many years i trust that the reader will carefully distinguish between those opinions which have dramatic propriety in reference to the characters which they are designed to elucidate and such are properly my own the erroneous and degrading idea which men have conceived of supreme being instance is spoken against but not the supreme being itself the belief which some superstitious persons whom i have brought upon the stage enterta in of the deity injurious to the character of his benevolence is widely different from my own in recommending also great and important change in the spirit which anim ates the social institutions of mankind i have avoided all ﬂattery to those violent and malignant passions of our nature which are ever on the watch to mingle with and to alloy the

their competitors which incited the composition the agamemnonian story was exhibited on the athenian theatre with many variations dramas i have presumed to employ similar license the prometheus

according to this view of the subject was given in marriage to peleus and prometheus by the permission of jupiter delivered from his captivity by hercules had i framed my story on this model i should have done more than have attempted to restore the lost drama of aeschylus an ambition which if my preference to this mode of treating the subject had incited to cherish the recollection of the high comparison such an attempt would challe nge might well abate but in truth i was averse from catastrophe so feeble that of reconciling the champion with the oppressor of mankind the moral interest of the fable which is so powerfully sustained by the sufferings and endurance of prometheus would be annihilated if we could conceive of him unsaying his high language and quailing before his successful and perﬁdious adversary the only imaginary being resembling in any degree prome theus is satan and prometheus is in my judgement more poetical character than satan because in addition to courage and majesty and ﬁrm and patient opposition to omnipotent force he is susceptible of being described exempt from the taints of ambition envy revenge and desire personal aggrandisement which in the hero of paradise lost interfere with the interest the character of satan engenders in the mind pernicious casuistry which leads us to weigh his faults with his wrongs and to excuse the former because the latter exceed all measure in the minds of those who consider that magniﬁcent ﬁction with religious feeling it engenders something worse but prometheus is it were the type of the highest perfection of moral and intellectual nature impelled by the purest and the truest motives to the best and noblest ends this poem was chieﬂy written upon the mountainous ruins of the baths of caracalla among the

and the effect of the vigorous awakening spring in that divinest climate and the new life with which it drenches the spirits even to intoxica tion were the inspiration of this drama the imagery which i have employed will be found in many instances to have been drawn from the operations of the human mind or from those external actions by which they are expressed this is unusual in modern poetry although dante and shakespeare are full the project gutenberg ebook of the complete poetical works of percy bysshe shelley complete by percy bysshe shelley and https of the same kind dante indeed more than any other poet and with greater success but the greek poets writers to whom resource of awakening the sympathy of their contemporaries was unknown were in the habitual use of this power and it is the study of their works since higher merit would probably be denied to which i am willing that my readers should impute this singularity one word is due in candour to the degree in which the study of contemporary writings may have tinged my composition such has been topic of censure with regard to poems far more popular and indeed more deserve dly popular than mine it is impossible that any one who inhabits the same age with such writers those who stand in the foremo st ranks of our own can conscientiously assure himself that his language and tone of thought may not have been modiﬁed by the study of the productions of those extraordinary intellects it is true that not the spirit of their genius but the forms in which it has manifested itself are due less to the peculiarities of their own minds than to the peculiarity of the moral and intelle ctual condition of the minds among which they have been produced thus number of writers possess the form whilst they want the spirit of those whom it is alleged they imitate because the former is the endowment of the age in which they live and the latter must be the uncommunicated lightning of their own mind the peculiar style of intense and comprehensive imagery which distinguishes the modern literature of england has not been general power the product of the imitation of any particular writer the mass of capabilities remains at every period materially the same the circumstances which awaken it to action perpetually change if england were divided into forty republics each equal in population and extent to athens there is reason to suppose but that under institutions not more perfect than those of athens each would produce philosophers and poets equal to those who if we except shakespeare have never been surpassed we owe the great writers of the golden age of our literature to that fervid awakening of the public mind which shook to dust the oldest and most oppressive form of the christian religion we owe milton to the progress and development of the same spirit the sacred milton was let it ever be remembered republican and bold inquirer into morals and religion the great writers of our own age are we have reason to suppose the companions and forerunners of some unimagined change in our social condition or the opinions which cement it the cloud of mind is dischar ging its collected lightning and the equilibrium between institutions and opinions is now restoring or is about to be restored to imitation poetry is mimetic art it creates but it creates by combination and representation poetical abstractions are beautiful and new not because the portions of which they are composed had previous existence in the mind of man or in nature but because the whole produced by their combination has some intelligible and beautiful analogy with those sources of emotion and thought and with the contemporary condition of them one great poet is masterpiece of nature which another not only ought to study but must study he might wisely and easily determine that his mind should longer be the mirror of all that is lovely in the visible universe exclude from his contemplation the beautiful whic h exists in the writings of great contemporary the pretence of doing it would be presumption in any but the greatest the effect even in him would be strained unnatural and ineffectual poet is the

irritability of thought such with little intermission is my condit ion the hours devoted to study are selected with vigilant caution from among these periods of endurance it is not this that i think of travelling to italy even if i knew that italy would relieve but i have experienced decisive pulmonary attack and although at present it has passed away without any considerable vestige of its existence yet this symptom sufﬁciently shows the true nature of my disease to be consumptive it is to my advantage that this malady is in its nature slow and if one is sufﬁciently alive to its advances is susceptible of cure from warm climate in the event of its assuming any decided shape it would be my duty to go to italy without delay it is not mere health but life that i should seek and that not my own feel i am capable of trampling on all such weakness but the sake of those to whom my life may be source of happiness utility security and honour and to some of whom my death might be all that is the reverse in almost every respect his journey to italy was advantageous he left behind friends to whom he was attached but cares of thousand kinds many springing from his lavish generosity crowded round him in his native country and except the society of one or two friends he had compensation the climate caused him to consume half his existence in helpless suffering his dearest pleasure the free enjoyment of the scenes of nature was marred by the same circumstance he went direct to italy avoiding even paris and did not make any pause till he arrived at milan the ﬁrst aspect of italy enchanted shelley it seemed garden of delight placed beneath clearer and brighter heaven than any he had lived under before he wrote long descriptive letters during the ﬁrst year of his residence in italy which compositions are the most beautiful in the world and show how truly he appreciated and studied the wonders of nature and art in that divine land the poetical spirit within him speedily revived with all the power and with more than all the beauty of his ﬁrst attempts he meditated three subjects the groundwork lyrical dramas one was the story of tasso of this slight fragment of song of tasso remains the other was one founded on the book of job which he never abandoned in idea but of which trace remains among his papers the third was the prometheus unbound the greek tragedians were now his most familiar compani ons in his wanderings and the sublime majesty of aeschylus ﬁlled him with wonder and delight the father of greek tragedy does not possess the pathos of sophocles nor the variety and tenderness of euripides the interest on which he founds his dramas is often elevated above human vicissitudes into the mighty passions and throes of gods and such fascinated the abstract imagination of shelley we spent month at milan visiting the lake of during that interval thence we passed in succession to pisa leghorn the baths of lucca venice rome naples the project gutenberg ebook of the complete poetical works of percy bysshe shelley complete by percy bysshe shelley and https again to rome whither we returned early in march during all this time shelley meditated the subject of his drama and wrote portions of it other poems were composed during this interval and while at the bagni di lucca he translated plato symposium but though he diversiﬁed his studies his thoughts centred in the prometheus at last when at rome during bright and beautiful spring he gave up his whole time to the composition the spot selected his study was he mentions in his preface the mountainous ruins of the baths of caracalla these are little known to the ordinary visitor at rome he describes them in letter with that poetry and delicac y and truth of description which render his narrated impressions of scenery of unequalled beauty and interest at ﬁrst he completed the drama in three acts it was not till several months after when at florence that he conceived that fourth act sort of hymn of rejoicing in the fulﬁlment of the prophecies with regard to prometheus ought to be added to complete the composition the prominent feature of shelley theory of the destiny of the human species was that evil is not inherent in the system of the creation but an accident that might be expelled this also forms portion of christianity god made earth and man perfect till he by his fall death into the world and all our woe shelley believed that mankind had only to will that there should be evil and there would be none it is not my part in these notes to notice the arguments that have been urged against this opinion but to mention the fact that he entertained it and was indeed attached to it with fervent enthusiasm that man could be so perfectionized to be able to expel evil from his own nature and from the greater part of the creation was the cardinal point of his system and the subject he loved best to dwell on was the image of one warring with the evil principle oppressed not only by it but by the good who were deluded into considering evil necessary portion of humanity victim full of fortitude and hope and the spirit of triumph emanating from reliance in the ultimate omnipotence of good such he had depicted in his last poem when he made laon the enemy and the victim of tyrants he now took more idealized image of the same subject he followed certain classical authorities in ﬁguring saturn the good principle jupiter the usurping evil one and prometheus the regenerator who unable to bring mankind back to primitive innocence used knowledge weapon to defeat evil by leading mankind beyond the state wherein they are sinless through ignorance to that in which they are virtuous through wisdom jupiter punished the temerity of the titan by chaining him to rock of caucasus and causing vulture to devour his heart there was prophecy aﬂoat in heaven portending the fall of jove the secret of averting which was known only to prometheus and the god offered freedom from torture on condition of its being communicated to him according to the mythological story this referred to the offspring of thetis who was destined to be greater than his father prometheus at last bought pardon his crime of enriching mankind with his gifts by revealing the prophecy hercules killed the vulture and set him free and thetis was married to peleus the father of achilles shelley adapted the catastrophe of this story to his peculiar views the son greater than his father born of the nuptials of jupiter and thetis was to dethrone evil and bring back happier reign than that of saturn prometheus deﬁes the power of his enemy and endures centuries of torture till the hour arrives when jove blind to the real event but darkly

asia one of the oceanides is the wife of was according to other mythological interpretations the same venus and nature when the benefactor of mankind is liberated nature resumes the beauty of her prime and is united to her husband the emblem of the human race in perfect and happy union in the fourth act the poet gives furth er scope to his imagination and idealizes the forms of we know them instead of such they appeared to the greeks maternal earth the mighty parent is superseded by the spirit of the earth the guide of our planet through the realms of sky while his fair and weaker companion and attendant the spirit of the moon receives bliss from the annihilation of evil in the superior sphere shelley develops more particularly in the lyrics of this drama his abstruse and imaginative theories with regard to the creation it requires mind subtle and penetrating his own to understand the mystic meanings scattered throughout the poem they elude the ordinary reader by their abstraction and delicacy of distinction but they are far from vague it was his design to write prose metaphysical essays on the nature of man which would have served to explain much of what is obscure in his poetry few scattered fragments of observations and remarks alone remain he considered these philosophical views of mind and nature to be instinct with the intensest spirit of poetry more popular poets clothe the ideal with familiar and sensible imagery shelley loved to idealize the gift the mechanism of the material universe with soul and voice and to bestow such also on the most delicate and abstract emotions and thoughts of the mind sophocles was his great master in this species of imagery i ﬁnd in one of his manuscript books some remarks on line in the oedipus tyrannus which show at once the critical subtlety of shelley mind and explain his apprehension of those and remote distinctions of feeling whether relative to externa l nature or the living beings which surround us which he pronounces in the letter quoted in the note to the revolt of islam to comprehend all that is sublime in man the greek shakespeare sophocles we ﬁnd the image pollas d odous elthonta phrontidos planois line of almost unfathomable depth of poetry yet how simple are the images in which it is arrayed coming to many ways in the wanderings of careful thought if the words odous and planois had not been used the line might have been explained in metaphorical instead of an absolute sense we say ways and means and wanderings error and confusion but they meant literally paths or roads such we tread with our feet and wanderings such man makes when he loses himself in desert or roam s from city to oedipus the speaker of this verse was destined to wander blind and asking charity

complete poetical works of percy bysshe shelley complete by percy bysshe shelley and https with respect to what he ought to searches throughout he would search the external universe some valued thing which was hidden from him upon its surface in reading shelley poetry we often ﬁnd similar verses resembling but not imitating the greek in this species of imagery though he adopted the style he gifted it with that originality of form and colouring which sprung from his own genius in the prometheus unbound shelley fulﬁls the promise quoted from letter in the note on the revolt of islam while correcting the of that poem it struck that the poet had indulged in an exaggerated view of the evils of restored despotism which however injurious and degrading were less open ly sanguinary than the triumph of anarchy such it appeared in france at the close of the last century but at this time book scenes of spanish life translated by lieutenant crawford from the german of huber of rostock fell into my hands the account of the triumph of the priests and the serviles after the french invasion of spain in 1823 bears strong and frightful resemblance to some of the descriptions of the massacre of the patriots in the revolt of islam the tone of the composition is calmer and more majestic the poetry more perfect whole and the imagination displayed at once more pleasingly beautiful and more varied and daring the description of the hours they are seen in the cave of demogor gon is an instance of ﬁlls the mind the most charming long to see an artist at work to bring to our view the drawn

shelley rome may 29 the cenci preface manuscript was communicated to during my travels in italy which was copied from the archives of the cenci palace at rome and contains detailed account of the horrors which ended in the extinction of one of the noblest and richest families of that city during the pontiﬁcate of clement viii in the year the story is that an old man having spent his life in debauchery and wickedness conceived at length an implacable hatred towards his children which showed itself towards one daughter under the form of an incestuous passion aggravated by every circumstance of cruelty and violence this daughter after long and vain attempts to escape from what she considered perpetual contamination both of body and mind at length plotted with her mother and broth er to murder their common tyrant the young maiden who was urged to this tremendous deed by an impulse which overpowered its horror was evidently most gentle and amiable being creature formed to adorn and be admired and thus violently thwarted from her nature by the necessity of circumstance and opinion the deed was quickly discovered and in spite of the most earnest prayers made to the pope by the highest persons in rome the criminals were put to death the old man had during his life repeatedly bought his pardon from the pope capital crimes of the most enormous and unspeakable kind at the price of hundred thousand crowns the death therefore of his victims can scarcely be accounted by the love of justice the pope among other motives severity probably felt that whoever killed the count cenci deprived his treasury of certain and copious source of revenue the papal government formerly took the most extraordinary precautions against the publicity of facts which offer so tragical demonstration of its own wickedness and weakness so that the communication of the manuscript had become until very lately matter of some difﬁculty such story if told so to present to the reader all the feelings of those who once acted it their hopes and fears their conﬁdences and misgivings their various interests passions and opinions acting upon and with each other yet all conspiring to one tremendous end would be light to make apparent some of the most dark and secret caverns of the human heart on my arrival at rome i found that the story of the cenci was subject not to be mentioned in italian society without awakening deep and breathless interest and that the feelings of the company never failed to incline to romantic pity the wrongs and passion ate exculpation of the horrible deed

and among all ranks of people in great city where the imagination is kept ever active and awake ﬁrst suggested to the conception of its ﬁtness dramatic purpose in fact it is tragedy which has already received from its capacity of awakening and sustaining the sympathy of men approbation and success nothing remained i imagined but to clothe it to the apprehensions of my countrymen in such language and action would bring it home to their hearts the deepest and the subli mest tragic compositions king lear and the two plays in which the tale of oedipus is told were stories which already existed in tradition matters of popular belief and interest before shakspeare and sophocles made them familiar to the sympathy of all succeeding generations of mankind this story of the cenci is indeed eminently fearful and monstrous anythin g like dry exhibition of it on the stage would be insupportable the person who would treat such subject must increase the ideal and diminish the actual horror of the events so that the pleasure which arises from the poetry which exists in these tempestuous sufferings and crime s may mitigate the pain of the contemplation of the moral deformity from which they spring there must also be nothing attempted to make the exhibition subservient to what is vulgarly termed moral purpose the highest moral purpose aimed at in the highest species of the drama is the teaching the human heart through its sympathies and antipathies the knowledge of itself in proportion to the possession of which knowledge every human being is wise just sincere tolerant and kind if dogmas can more it is well but drama is ﬁt place the enforcement of them undoubtedly person can be truly dishonoured by the act of another and the ﬁt return to make to the most enormous injuries is kindness and forbearance and resolution to convert the injurer from his dark passions by peace and love reven ge retaliation atonement are pernicious mistakes if beatrice had thought in this manner she would have been wiser and better but she would never have been tragic character the few whom such an exhibition would have interested could never have been sufﬁciently interested dramatic purpose from the want of ﬁnding sympathy in their interest among the mass who surround them it is in the restless and anatomiz ing casuistry with which men seek the justiﬁcation of beatrice yet feel that she has done what needs justiﬁcation it is in the superstitious horror with which they contemplate alike her wrongs and their revenge that the dramatic character of what she did and suf fered consists i

under thin veil converting names and actions of the sixteenth century into cold impersonations of my own mind they are represented catholics and catholics deeply tinged with religion to protestant apprehension there will appear something unnatural in the earnest and perpetual sentiment of the relations between god and men which pervade the tragedy of the cenci it will especially be startled at

himself built chapel in the court of his palace and dedicated it to thomas the apostle and established masses the peace of his soul thus in the ﬁrst scene of the fourth act lucretia design in exposing herself to the consequences of an expostulation with cenci after having administered the opiate was to induce him by feigned tale to confess himsel f before death this being esteemed by catholics essential to salvation and she only relinquishes her purpose when she perceives that her perseverance would expose beatrice to new outrages i have avoided with great care in writi ng this play the introduction of what is commonly called mere poetry and i imagine there will scarcely be found detached simile or single isolated description unless beatrice description of the chasm appointed her father murder should be judged to be of that nature an idea in this speech was suggested by most sublime passage in el purgaterio san patricio of calderon the only plagiarism which i have intentionally committed in the whole piece in dramatic composition the imagery and the passion should interpenetrate one another the former being reserved simply the full development and illustration of the latter imagination is the immortal god which should assume ﬂesh the redemption of mortal passion it is thus that the most remote and the most familiar imagery may alike be ﬁt dramatic purposes when employed in the illustration of strong feeling which raises what is low and levels to the apprehension that which is lofty castin g over all the shadow of its own greatness in other respects i have written more carelessly that is without an and learned choice of words in this respect i entirely agree with those modern critics who assert that in order to move men to true sympathy we must use the familiar language of men and that our great ancestors the ancient english poets are the writers study of whom might incite us to that our own age which they have done theirs but it must be the real language of men in general and not that of any particular class to whose society the writer happens to belong so much what i have attempted i need not be assured that success is very different matter particularly one whose attention has but newly been awakened to the study of dramatic literature i endeavoured whilst at rome to observe such monuments of this story might be accessible to stranger the portrait of beatrice at the colonna palace is admirable work of art it was taken by guido during her conﬁnement in prison but it is most interesting just representation of one of the loveliest specimens of the workmanship of nature there is ﬁxed and pale composure upon the features she seems sad and stricken down in spirit yet the despair thus expressed is lightened by the

inexpre ssibly pathetic beatrice cenci appears to have been one of those rare persons in whom energy and gentleness dwell together without destroying one another her nature was simple and profound the crimes and miseries in which she was an actor and sufferer are the mask and the mantle in which circumstances clothed her her impersonation on the scene of the world the cenci palace is of great extent and though in part modernized there yet remains vast and gloomy pile of feudal architecture in the same state during the dreadfu l scenes which are the subject of this tragedy the palace is situated in an obscure corner of rome near the quarter of the jews and from the upper windows you see the immense ruins of mount palatine half hidden under their profuse overgrowth of trees there is

ﬁrst but lastly into the direct track that enabled him fully to develop them is curious instance of his modesty of feeling and of the methods which the human mind uses at once to deceive itself and yet in its very delusion to make its way out of error into the path which nature has marked out its right one he often incited to attempt the writing tragedy he conceived that i possessed some

succeeding even moderately in species of composition that requires greater scope of experience in and sympathy with human passion than could then have fallen to my lot than any perhaps except shelley ever possessed even at the age of at which he wrote the cenci on the other hand shelley most erroneously conceived himself to be destitute of this talent he believed that one of the ﬁrst requisites was the capacity of forming and story or plot he fancied himself to he defective in this portion of imagination it was that which gave him least pleasure in the writings of others though he laid great store by it the proper framework to support the subli mest efforts of poetry he asserted that he was too metaphysical and abstract too fond of the theoretical and the ideal to succeed tragedian it perhaps is not strange that i shared this opinion with himself he had hitherto shown inclination nor given any specimen of his powers in framing and supporting the interest of story either in prose or verse once or twice when he attempted such he had speedily thrown it aside being even disagreeable to him an occupation the subject he had suggested tragedy was charles i and he had written to remember charles i have been already imagining how you would conduct some scenes the second volume of leon begins with this proud and true sentiment there is nothing which the human mind can conceive which it may not execute shakespeare was only human being these words were written in 1818 while we were in lombardy when he little thought how soon work of his own would prove proud comment on the passage he quoted when in rome in 1819 friend put into our hands the old manuscript account of the story of the cenci we visited the colonna and doria palaces where the portraits of beatrice were to be found and her beauty cast the reﬂection of its own grace over her appalling story shelley imagination became strongly excited and he urged the subject to one ﬁtted tragedy more than ever i felt my incompetence but i entreated him to write it instead and he began and proceeded swiftly urged on by intense sympathy with the sufferings of the human beings whose passions so long cold in the tomb he revived and gifted with poetic language this tragedy is the only one of his works that he communicated to during its progress we talked over the arrangement of the scenes together i speedily saw the great mistake we had made and triumphed in the discovery of the new talent brought to light from that mine of wealth never alas through his untimely death worked to its depths richly gifted mind we suffered severe afﬂiction in rome by the loss of our eldest child who was of such beauty and promise to cause him deservedly to be the idol of our hearts we left the capital of the world anxious time to escape spot associated too intimately with his presence and loss such feelings haunted him when in the cenci he makes beatrice speak to cardinal camillo of fair child who was the lodestar of your

small house villa valsovano about between the town and monte nero where we remained during the summer our villa was situated in the midst of podere the peasants sang they worked beneath our windows during the heats of very hot season and in the evening the water creaked the process of irrigation went on and the ﬁreﬂies ﬂashed from among the myrtle hedges nature was bright sunshiny and cheerful or diversiﬁed by storms of majestic terror such we had never before witnessed at the top of the house there was sort of terrace there is often such in italy generally roofed this one was very small yet not only roofed but glazed this shelley made his study it looked out on wide prospect of fertile country and commanded view of the near sea the storms that sometimes varied our day showed themselves most picturesquely they were driven across the ocean sometimes the dark lurid clouds dipped towards the waves and became water that churned up the waters beneath they were chased onward and scattered by the tempest at other times the dazzling sunlight and heat made it almost intolerable to every other but shelley basked in both and his health and spirits revived under their inﬂuence in this airy cell he wrote the principal part of the cenci he was making study of calderon at the time reading his best tragedies with an accomplished lady living near us to whom his letter from leghorn was addressed during the following year he admired calderon both his poetry and his dramatic genius but it shows his judgement and originality that though greatly struck by his ﬁrst acquaintance with the spanish poet none of his peculiarities crept into the composition of the cenci and there is trace of his new studies except in that passage to which he himself alludes suggested by one in el purgatorio san patricio shelley wished the cenci to be acted he was not playgoer being of such fastidious taste that he was easily disgusted by the bad of the inferior parts while preparing our departure from england however he saw miss several times she was then in the zenith of her glory and shelley was deeply moved by her impersonation of several parts and by the graceful sweetness the intense pathos the sublime vehemence of passion she displayed she was often in his thoughts he wrote and when he had ﬁnished he became anxious that his tragedy should be acted and receive the advantage of having this accomplished actress to ﬁll the part of the heroine with this view he wrote the following letter to friend in london object of the present letter us to ask favour of you i have written tragedy on story well known in italy and in my conception eminently dramatic i have taken some pains to make my play ﬁt representation and those who have already seen it judge favourably it is written without any of the peculiar feelings and opinions which characte rize my other compositions i have attended simply to the impartial development of such characters it is probable the persons represented really were together with the greatest degree of popular effect to be produced by such development i send you translation of the italian manuscript on which my play is founded the chief circumstance of which i have touched very delicately my principal doubt to whether it would succeed an acting play hangs entirely on the question to whether any such thing incest in this shape however treated would be admitted on the stage i think however it will form objection considering ﬁrst that the facts are matter of history and secondly the peculiar delicacy with which i have treated it in speaking of his mode of treating this main incident shelley said that it might be remarked the project gutenberg ebook of the complete poetical works of percy bysshe shelley complete by percy

of cenci curse that if she have child etc i am exceedingly interested in the question of whether this attempt of mine will succeed or not i am strongly inclined to the afﬁrmative at present founding my hopes on composition it is certainly not inferior to any of the modern plays that have been acted with the exception of remorse that the interest of the plot is incredibly greater and more real and that there is nothing beyond what the multitude are contented to believe that they can understand either in imagery opinion or sentiment i wish to preserve complete incognito and can trust to you that whatever else you you will at least favour on this point indeed this is essential deeply essential to its success after it had been acted and successfully could i hope such thing i would own it if i pleased and use the celebrity it might acquire to my own purposes i want you to is to procure its presentation at covent garden the principal character beatrice is precisely ﬁtted miss and it might even seem to have been written her god forbid that i should see her play would tear my nerves to pieces and in all respects it is ﬁtted only covent garden the chief male character i confess i should be very unwilling that any one but kean should play that is impossible and i must be contented with an inferior actor the play was accordingly sent to harris he pronounced the subje ct to be so objectionable that he could not even submit the part to miss perusal but expressed his desire that the author would write tragedy on some other subject which he would gladly accept shelley printed small edition at leghorn to ensure its correctness he was much annoyed by the many mistakes that crept into his text when distance prevented him from correcting the press universal approbation soon stamped the cenci the best tragedy of modern times writing concerning it shelley said i have been cautious to avoid the introducing faults of youthful composition diffuseness profusion of inapplicable imagery vagueness generality and hamlet says words words there is nothing that is not purely dramatic throughout and the character of beatrice proceeding from vehement struggle to horror to deadly resolution and lastly to the elevated dignity of calm suffering joined to passionate tenderness and pathos is touched with hues so vivid and so beautiful that the poet seems to have read intimately the secrets of the noble heart imaged in the lovely countenance of the unfortunate girl the fifth act is masterpiece it is the ﬁnest thing he ever wrote and may claim proud comparison not only with any contem porary but preceding poet the varying feelings of beatrice are expressed with passionate eloquence every character has voice that echoes truth in its tones it is curious to one acquainted with the written story to mark the success with which the poet has inwoven the real incidents of the tragedy into his scenes and yet through the power of poetry has obliterated all that would otherwise have shown too harsh or too hideous in the picture his success was double triumph and often after he was earnestly entreated to write again in style that commanded popular favour while it was not less instinct with truth and genius but the bent of his mind went the other way and the project gutenberg ebook of the complete poetical works of percy bysshe shelley complete by percy bysshe

nature the necessaries of life when fairly earned by labour and intellectual instruction his hatred of any despotism that looked upon the people not to be consulted or protected from want and ignorance was intense he was resid ing near leghorn at villa valsovano writing the cenci when the news of the manchester massacre reached us it roused in him violent emotions of indignation and compassion the great truth that the many if accordant and resolute could control the few was shown some years after made him long to teach his injured countrymen how to resist inspir ed by these feelings he wrote the mask of anarchy which he sent to his friend leigh hunt to be inserted in the examiner of which he was then the editor i did not insert it leigh hunt writes in his valuable and

ﬂaming robe of verse days of outrage have passed away and with them the exasperation that would cause such an appeal to the many to be injurious without being aware of them they at one time acted on his suggestions and gained the day but they rose when human life was respected by the minister in power such was not the case during the administration which excited shelley abhorrence the poem was

and creative the glorious calling of discovering and announcing the beautiful and good to support and propagate ignorant prejudices and pernicious errors imparting to the unenlightened not that ardour truth and spirit of toleration which shelley looked on the sources of the moral improvement and happiness of mankind but false and injurious opinions that evil was good and that ignorance and force were the best allies of purity and virtue his idea was that man gifted even transcendently the author of peter bell with the highest qualities of genius must if he fostered such errors be infected with dulness this poem was written narration of the reality he was unacquainted personally with wordsworth or with coleridge to whom he alludes in the ﬁfth part of the poem and therefore i repeat his

intuitive than founded on reasoning yet i believe mistake was made the winter of 1822 was passed in pisa if we might call that season winter in which autumn merged into spring after the interval of but few days of bleaker weather spring sprang up early and with extreme beauty shelley had conceived the idea of writing tragedy on the subject of charles it was one that he believed adapted drama full of intense interest contrasted character and busy passion he had recommended it long before when he encouraged to attempt play whether the subject proved more difﬁcult than he anticipated or

navy and had afterwards entered the army he had spent several years in india and his love adventure and manly exercises accorded with shelley taste it was their favourite plan to build boat such they could manage themselves and living on the coast to enjoy at every hour and season the pleasure they loved best captain roberts undertook to build the boat at genoa where he was also occupied in building the bolivar lord byron ours was to be an open boat on model taken from one of the royal dockyards i have since heard that there was defect in this model and that it was never seaworthy in the month of february shelley and his friend went to spezia to seek houses us only one was to be found at all suitable howev er triﬂe such not ﬁnding house could not stop shelley the one found was to serve all it was unfurnished we sent our furniture by sea and with good deal of precipitation arising from his impatience made our removal we left pisa on the 26th of april the bay of spezia is of considerable extent and divided by rocky promontory into larger and smaller one the town of lerici is situated on the eastern point and in the depth of the smaller bay which bears the name of this town is the village of san terenzo our house casa magni was close to this village the sea came up to the door steep hill sheltered it behind the proprietor of the estate on which it was situated was insane he had begun to erect large house at the summit of the hill behind but his malady prevented its being ﬁnished and it was falling into ruin he had and this to the italians had seemed glaring symptom of very decided madness rooted up the olives on the hillside and planted forest trees these were mostly young but the plantation was more in english taste than i ever elsewhere saw in italy some ﬁne walnut and ilex trees intermingled their dark massy foliage and formed groups which still haunt my memory then they satiated the eye with sense of loveliness the scene was indeed of unimaginable beauty the blue extent of waters the almost landlocked bay the near castle of lerici shutting it in to the east and distant porto venere to the west the varied forms of the precipitous rocks that bound in the beach over which there was only winding rugged footpath towards lerici and none on the other side the tideless sea leaving sands nor shingle formed picture such one sees in salvator rosa landscapes only sometimes the sunshine vanished when the sirocco the wind was called on that shore the gales and squalls that hailed our ﬁrst arrival surrounded the bay with foam the howling wind swept round our exposed house and the sea roared unremittingly so that we almost fancied ourselves on board ship at other times sunshine and calm invested sea and sky and the rich tints of italian heaven bathed the scene in bright and ever tints the natives were wilder than the place our near neighbours of san terenzo were more like savages than any people i ever before lived among many night they passed on the beach singing or rather howling the women dancing about among the waves that broke at their feet the men leaning against the rocks and joining in their loud wild chorus

indeed excite my surprise and admiration shelley and i walked to lerici and made stretch off the land to try her and i ﬁnd she fetches whatever she looks at in short we have now perfect plaything the summer was thus that mortals welcomed death he having disguised his grim form in pleasing mask the time of the friends was now spent on the sea the weather became ﬁne and our whole party often passed the evenings on the water when the wind promised pleasant sailing shelley and williams made longer excu rsions they sailed several times to massa they had engaged one of the seamen who brought her round boy by name charles vivian and they had not the slightest apprehension of danger when the weather was unfavourable they employed themselves with alterations in the rigging and by building boat of canvas and reeds light possible to have on board the other the convenience of landing in waters too shallow the larger vessel when shelley was on board he had his papers with him and much of the triumph of life was written he sailed or weltered on that sea which was soon to engulf him the heats set in in the middle of june the days became excessively hot but the cooled the air at noon and extreme heat always put shelley in spirits long drought had preceded the heat and prayers rain were being put up in the churches and processions of relics the same effect took place in every town at this time we received letters announcing the arrival of leigh hunt at genoa shelley was very eager to see him i was conﬁned to my room by severe illness and could not move it was agreed that shelley and williams should go to leghorn in the boat strange that fear of danger crossed our minds living on the shore the ocean became plaything child may sport with lighted stick till spark inﬂames forest and spreads destruction over all so did we fearlessly and blindly tamper with danger and make game of the terror s of the ocean our italian neighbours even trusted themselves far massa in the skiff and the running down the line of coast to leghorn gave more notion of peril than inland navigation would have done to those who had never seen the sea once some months before trelawny had raised warning voice to the difference of our calm bay and the open sea beyond but shelley and his friend with their one sailor thought themselves match the storms of the mediterranean in boat which they looked upon equal to all it was put to on the 1st of july they left us if ever shadow of future ill darkened the present hour such was over my mind when they went during the whole of our stay at lerici an intense presentiment of coming evil brooded over my mind and covered this beau tiful place and genial summer with the shadow of coming misery i had vainly struggled with these the project

borrowed cushions from the larger vessel and slept on board their boat they spent week at pisa and leghorn the want of rain was severely felt in the country the weather continued sultry and ﬁne i have heard that shelley all this time was in brilliant spirits not long before talking of presentiment he had said the only one that he ever found infallible was the certain advent of some evil fortune

mother of the world he who asserts the doctrine of necessity means that contemplating the events which compose the moral and material universe he beholds only an immense and uninterrupted chain of causes and effects one of which could occupy any other place than it does occupy or act in any other place than it does act the idea of necessity is obtained by our experience of the connection between objects the uniformity of the operations of nature the constant conjunction of similar events and the consequent inference of one from the other mankind are therefore agreed in the admission of necessity if they admit that these two circumstances take place in voluntary action motive is to voluntary action in the human mind what cause is to effect in the material universe the word liberty applied to mind is analogous to the word chance applied to matter they spring from an ignorance of the certainty of the conjunction of antecedents and consequents every human being is irresistibly impe lled to act precisely he does act in the eternity which preceded his birth chain of causes was generated which operating under the name of motives make it impossible that any thought of his mind or any action of his life should be otherwise than it is were the doctrine of necessity false the human mind would longer be legitimate object of science from like causes it would be in vain that we should expect like effects the strongest motive would longer be paramount over the conduct all knowledge would be vague and undeterminate we could not predict with any certainty that we might not meet

and motives of any man on any occasion being given the moral philosopher could predict his actions with much certainty the natural philosopher could predict the effects of the mixture of any particular chemical substances why is the aged husbandman more experienced than the young beginner because there is uniform undeniable necessity in the operations of the material universe why is the old statesman more skilful than the raw politician because relying on the necessary conjunction of motive and action he proceeds to produce moral effects by the application of those moral causes which experience has shown to be effectual some actions may be found to which we can attach motives but these are the effects of causes with which we are unacquainted hence the relation which motive bears to voluntary action is that of cause to effect nor placed in this point of view is it or ever has it been the subject of popular or philoso phical dispute none but the few fanatics who are engaged in the herculean task of reconciling the justice of their god with the misery of man will longer outrage common sense by the supposition of an event without cause voluntary action without motive history

to admit necessity inﬂuencing matter many have disputed its dominion over mind independently of its militating with the received ideas of the justice of god it is by means obvious to superﬁcial inquiry when the mind observes its own operations it feels connection of motive and action but we know more of causation than the constant conjunction of objects and the consequent inferen ce of one from the other we ﬁnd that these two circumstances are universally allowed to have place in voluntary action we may be easily led to own that they are subjected to the necessity common to all causes the actions of the will have regular conjunction with circumstances and characters motive is to voluntary action what cause is to effect but the only idea we can form of causation is constant conjunction of similar objects and the consequent inference of one from the other wherever this is the case necessity is clearly established the idea of liberty applied metaphorically to the will has sprung from misc onception of the meaning of the word power what is power quod potest that which can produce any given effect to deny power is to say that nothing can or has the power to be or act in the only true sense of the word power it applies with equal force to the lodestone to the human will you think these motives which i shall present are powerful enough to rouse him is question just common you think this lever has the power of raising this weight the advocates of assert that the will has the power of refusing to be determined by the strongest motive but the strongest motive is that which overcoming all others ultimately prevails this assertion therefore amounts to denial of the will being ultimately determined by that motive which does determine it which is absurd but it is equally certain that man can not resist the strongest motive that he can not overcome physical impossibility the doctrine of necessity tends to introduce great change into the established notions of morality and utterly to destroy religion reward and punishment must be considered by the necessarian merely motives which he would employ in order to procure the adoption the project gutenberg ebook

incapable of producing happiness is useless and though the crime of damiens must be condemned yet the frightful torments which revenge under the name of justice inﬂicted on this unhappy man can not be supposed to have augmented even at the long run the stock of pleasu rable sensation in the world at the same time the doctrine of necessity does not in the least diminish our disapprobation of vice

elevated and dreadless composure upon the links of the universal chain they pass before his eyes whilst cowardice curiosity and inconsistency only assail him in proportion to the feebleness and indistinctness with which he has perceived and rejected the delusions of religion is the perception of the relation in which we stand to the principle of the universe but if the principle of the universe be not an organic being the model and prototype of man the relation between it and human beings is absolutely none without some insight into its will respecting our actions religion is nugatory and vain but will is only mode of animal mind moral qualities also are such only human being can possess to attribute them to the principle of the universe is to annex to it properties incompatible with any possible deﬁnition of its nature it is probable that the word god was originally only an expression denoting the unknown cause of the known events which men perceived in the universe by the vulgar mistake of metaphor real being of word thing it became man endowed with human qualities and governing the universe an earthly monarch governs his kingdom their addresses to this imaginary being indee d are much in the same style those of subjects to king they acknowledge his benevolence deprecate his anger and supplicate his favour but the doctrine of necessity teaches us that in case could any event have happened otherwise than it did happen and that if god is the author of good he is also the author of evil that if he is entitled to our gratitude the one he is entitled to our hatred the other that admitting the existence of this hypothetic being he is also subjected to the dominion of an immutable necessity it is plain that the same arguments which prove that god is the author of food light and life prove him also to be the author of poison darkness and death the earthquake the storm the battle and the tyranny are attrib utable to this hypothetic being in the same degree the fairest forms of nature sunshine liberty and peace but we are taught by the doctrine of necessity that there is neither good nor evil in the universe otherwise than the events to which we apply these epithets have relation to our own peculiar mode of being still less than with the hypothesis of god will the doctrine of necessity accord with the belief of future state

understood solely to affect creative deity the hypothesis of pervading spirit with the universe remains unshaken close examination of the validity of the proofs adduced to support any propo sition is the only secure way of attaining truth on the advantages of which it is unnecessary to descant our knowledge of the existence of deity is subject of such importance that it can not be too minutely investigated in consequence of this conviction we proceed brieﬂy and impartially to examine the proofs which have been adduced it is necessary ﬁrst to consider the nature of belief when proposition is offered to the mind it perceives the agreement or disagreement of the ideas of which it is composed perception of their agreement is termed belief many obstacles frequently prevent this perception from being immediate these the mind attempts to remove in order that the perception may be distinct the mind is active in the investigation in order to perfect the state of perception of the relation which the component ideas of the proposition bear to each which is passive the investigation being confused with the perception has induced many falsely to imagine that the mind is active in belief belief is an act of volition consequence of which it may be regulated by the mind pursuing continuing this mistake they have attached degree of criminality to disbelief of which in its nature it is incapable it is equally incapable of merit belief then is passion the strength of which like every other passion is in precise proportion to the degrees of excitement the degrees of excitement are three the senses are the sources of all knowle dge to the mind consequently their evidence claims the strongest the project gutenberg ebook of the complete poetical works of percy bysshe shelley complete by percy bysshe shelley and https decision of the mind founded upon our own experience derived from these sources claims the next degree the experience of others which addresses itself to the former one occupies the lowest degree graduated scale on which should be marked the capabilities of propositions to approach to the test of the senses would be just barometer of the belief which ought to be attached to them consequently testimony can be admitted which is contrary to reason reason is founded on the evidence of our senses every proof may be referred to one of these three divisions it is to be considered what arguments we receive from each of them which should convince us of the existence of deity 1st the evidence of the senses if the deity should appear to us if he should convince our senses of his existence this revelation would necessarily command belief those to whom the deity has thus appeared have the strongest possible conviction of his existenc but the god of theologians is incapable of local visibility 2d reason it is urged that man knows that whatever is must either have had beginning or have existed from all eternity he also knows that whatever is not eternal must have had cause when this reasoning is applied to the universe it is necessary to prove that it was created until that is clearly demonstrated we may reasonably suppose that it has endured from all eternity we must prove design before we can infer designer the only idea which we can form of causation is derivable from the constant conjunction of objects and the consequent inference of one from the other in case where two propositions are diametrically opposite the mind believes that which is least incomprehensible is easier to suppose that the universe has existed from all eternity than to conceive being beyond its limits capable of creating it if the mind sinks beneath the weight of one is it an alleviation to increase the intolerability of the burthen the other argument which is founded on man knowledge of his own existence stands thus man knows not only that he now is but that once he was not consequently there must have been cause but our idea of causation is alone derivable from the constant conjunction of objects and the consequent inference of one from the other and reasoning experimentally we can only infer from effects causes exactly adequate to those effects but there certainly is generative power which is effected by certain instruments we can not prove that it is inherent in these instruments nor is the contrary hypothesis capable of demonstration we admit that the generative power is incomprehensible but to suppose that the same effect is produced by an eternal omniscient omnipotent being leaves the cause in the same obscurity but renders it more incomprehensible 3d testimony it is required that testimony should not be contrary to reason the testimony that the deity convinces the senses of men of his existence can only be admitt ed by us if our mind considers it less probable that these men should have been deceived than that the deity should have appeared to them our reason can never admit the testimony of men who not only declare that they were of miracles but that the deity was irrational the project gutenberg ebook of the complete poetical works of percy bysshe shelley complete by percy bysshe shelley and https that he should be believed he proposed the highest rewards faith eternal punishments disbelief we can only command voluntary actions belief is not an act of volition the mind is even passive or involuntarily active from this it is evident that we have sufﬁcient testimony or rather that testimony is insufﬁcient to prove the being of god it has been before shown that it can not be deduced from reason they alone then who have been convinced by the evidence of the senses can believe it hence it is evident that having proofs from either of the three sources of conviction the mind can not believe the existence of creative god it is also evident that belief is passion of the mind degree of criminality is attachable to disbelief and that they only are reprehensible who neglect to remove the false medium through which their mind views any subject of discussion every reﬂecting mind must acknowledge that there is proof of the existence of deity god is an hypothesis and such stands in need of proof the onus probandi rests on the theist sir isaac newton says hypotheses non ﬁngo quicquid enim ex phaenomenis non deducitur hypothesis vocanda est et hypothesis vel metaphysicae vel physicae vel qualitatum occultarum mechanicae in philosophia locum non habent to all proofs of the existence of creative god apply this valuable rule we see variety of bodies possessing variety of powers we merely know their effects we are in state of ignorance with respect to their essences and causes these newton calls the phenomena of things but the pride of philosophy is unwilling to admit its ignorance of their causes from the phenomena which are the objects of our senses we attempt to infer cause which we call god and gratuitously endow it with all negative and contradictory qualities from this hypothesis we invent this general name to conceal our ignorance of causes and essences the being called god by means answers with the conditions prescribed by newton it bears every mark of veil woven by philosophical conceit to hide the ignorance of philosophers even from themselves they borrow the threads of its texture from the anthropomorphis m of the vulgar words have been used by sophists the same purposes from the occult qualities of the peripatetics to the efﬂuvium of boyle and the crinities or nebulae of herschel god is represented inﬁnite eternal incomprehensible he is contained under every predicate in non that the logic of ignorance could fabricate even his worshippers allow that it is impossible to form any idea of him they exclaim with the french poet pour dire ce est il faut etre lord bacon says that atheism leaves to man reason philosophy natural piety laws reputation and everything that can serve to conduct him to virtue but superstition destroys all

human beings in the midst of the garden he planted tree whose fruit although within their reach they were forbidden to touch that the devil in the shape of snake persuaded them to eat of this fruit in consequence of which god condemned both them and their posterity yet unborn to satisfy his justice by their eternal misery that four thousand years after these events the human race in the meanwhile having gone unredeemed to perdition god engendered with the betrothed wife of carpenter in judea whose virginity was nevertheless uninjured and begat son whose name was jesus christ and who was cruciﬁed and died in order that more men might be devoted to he bearing the burthen of his father displeasure by proxy the book states in addition that the soul of whoever disbelieves this sacriﬁce will be burned with everlasting ﬁre during many ages of misery and darkness this story gained implicit belief but at length men arose who suspected that it was fable and imposture and that jesus christ so far from being god was only man like themselves but numerous set of men who derived and still derive immense emoluments from this opinion in the shape of popular belief told the vulgar that if they did not believe in the bible they would be damned to all eternity and burned imprisoned and poisoned all the unbias sed and unconnected inquirers who occasionally arose they still oppress them

death although his very judge made public acknowledgement of his innocence jesus was sacriﬁced to the honour of that god with whom he was afterwards confounded it is of importance therefore to distingui sh between the pretended character of this being the son of god and the saviour of the world and his real character man who vain attempt to reform the world paid the forfeit of his life to

in the glorious martyrdom of liberty and have braved torture contempt and poverty in the cause of suffering humanity since writing this note i have some reason to suspect that jesus was an ambitious man who aspire d to the throne of judea the vulgar ever in extremes became persuaded that the cruciﬁxion of jesus was supernatural event testimonies of miracles so frequent in unenlightened ages were not wanting to prove that he was something divine this belief rolling through the lapse of ages met with the reveries of plato and the reasonings of aristotle and acquired force and extent until the divinity of jesus became dogma which to dispute was death which to doubt was infamy christianity is now the established religion he who attempts to impugn it must be contented to behold murderers and

doctrines most essential to the ng of man in doubt and dispute the only ones which since their promulgation have been the subject of unceasing cavil the cause of irreconcilable hatred if god has spoken why is the universe not convinced there is this passage in the christian scriptures who obey not god and believe not the gospel of his son shall be punishe d with everlasting destruction this is the pivot upon which all religions turn all assume that it is in our power to believe or not to believe whereas the mind can only believe that which it thinks true human being can only be supposed accountable those actions which are inﬂuenced by his will but belief is utterly distinct from and unconnected with volition it is the apprehension of the agreement or disagreement of the ideas that compos any preposition belief is passion or involuntary operation of the mind and like other passions its intensity is precisely proportionate to the degrees of excitement volition is essential to merit or demerit but the christian religion attaches the highest possible degrees of merit and demerit to that which is worthy of neither and which is totally unconnected with the peculiar faculty of

degree of servility analogous to the loyalty demanded by earthly tyrants obedience indeed is only the pitiful and cowardly egotism of him who thinks that he can something better than reason christianity like all other religions rests upon miracles prophecies and martyrdoms religion ever existed which had not its prophets its attested miracles and above all crowds of devotees who would bear patiently the most horrible tortures to prove its authenticity it should appear that in case can discriminating mind subscribe to the genuineness of miracle miracle is an infraction of nature law by supernatural cause by cause acting beyond that eternal circle within which all things are included god breaks through the law of nature that he may convince mankind of the truth of that revelation which in spite of his precautions has been since its introduction the subject of unceasing schism and cavil miracles resolve themselves into the following question see hume essay volume 2 page 121 it is more probable the laws of nature hitherto so immutably harmonious should have under gone violation or that man should have told lie whether it is more probable that we are ignorant of the natural cause of an event or that we know the supernatural one that in old times when the powe rs of nature were less known than at present certain set of men were themselves deceived or had some hidden motive deceiving others or that god begat son who in his legislation measuring merit by belief evidenced himself to be totally ignorant of the powers of the human what is voluntary and what is the contrary we have many instances of men telling lies of an infraction of nature laws those laws of whose government alone we have any knowledge or experience the records of all nations afford innumerable instances of men deceiving others either from vanity or interest or themselves being deceived by the limitedness of their views and their ignorance of natural causes but where is the accredited case of god having come upon earth to give the lie to his own creations there would be something truly wonderful in the appearance of ghost but the assertion of child that he saw one he passed through the churchyard is universally admitted to be less miraculous but even supposing that man should raise dead body to life before our eyes and on this fact rest his claim to being considered the son of god humane society restores drowned persons and because it makes mystery of the method it employs its members are not mistaken the sons of god all that we have right to infer from our ignorance of the cause of any event is that we not know it had the mexicans attended to this simple rule when they heard the cannon of the spaniards they would not have considered them gods the experiments of modern chemistry would have deﬁed the wisest philosophers of ancient greece and rome to have accounted them on natural principles an author of strong common sense has observed that

could the prophet have foreknown it without inspiration how could he have been inspired without god the greatest stress is laid on the prophecies of moses and hosea on the dispersion of the jews and that of isaiah concerning the coming of the messiah the prophecy of moses is collection of every possible cursing and blessing and it is so far from being marvellous that the one of dispersion should have been fulﬁlled that it would have been more surprising if out of all these none should have taken effect in deuteronomy chapter 28 verse 64 where moses explicitly foretells the dispersion he states that they shall there serve gods of wood and stone the lord shall scatter thee among all people from the one end of the earth even to the other and there thou shal t serve other gods which neither thou nor thy fathers have known even gods of wood and stone the jews are at this day remarkably tenacious of their religion moses also declares that they shall be subjected to these curses disobedience to his ritual it shall come to pass if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of the lord thy god to observe to all the commandments and statutes which i command thee this day that all these curses shall come upon thee and overtake thee is this the real reason the third fourth and ﬁfth chapters of hosea are piece of immodest confession the indelicate type might apply in hundred senses to hundred things the third chapter of isaiah is more explicit yet it does not exceed in clearness the oracles of delphos the historical proof that moses isaiah and hosea did write when they are said to have written is far from being clear and circumstantial but prophecy requires proof in its character miracle we have right to suppose that man foreknew future events from god until it is demonstrated that he neither could know them by his own exertions nor that the writings which contain the prediction could possibly have been fabricated after the event pretended to be foretold it is more probable that writings pretending to divine inspiration should have been fabricated after the fulﬁlment of their pretended prediction than that they should have really been divinely inspired when we consider that the latter supposition makes god at once the creator of the human mind and ignorant of its primary powers particularly we have numberless instances of false religions and forged prophecies of things long past and accredited case of god having conversed with men directly or indirectly it is also possible that the description of an event might have foregone its occurrence but this is far from being legitimate proof of divine revelation many men not pretending to the character of prophet have nevertheless in this sense prophesied lord chesterﬁeld was never yet taken prophet even by bishop yet he uttered this remarkable prediction despotic government of france is screwed up to the highest pitch revolution is fast approaching that revolution i am convinced will be radical and sanguinary this appeared in the letters of the prophet long before the accomplishment of this wonderful prediction now have these particulars come to pass or have they not if they have how could the earl have foreknown them without inspiration if we admit the truth of the christian religion on testimony such this we must admit on the same strength of evidence that god has afﬁxed the highest

ordinary and extraordinary modes of operation the latter is supposed to be that which inspired the prophets and apostles and the former to be the grace of god which summarily makes known the truth of his revelation to those whose mind is ﬁtted its reception by submissive perusal of his word persons convinced in this manner can anything but account their conviction describe the time at which it happened or the manner in which it came upon them it is supposed to enter the mind by other channels than those of the senses and therefore professes to be superior to reason founded on their experience admitting however the usefulness or possibility of divine revelation unless we demolish the foundations of all human knowledge it is requisite that our reason should previously demonstrate its genuineness before we extinguish the steady ray of reason and common sense it is ﬁt that we should discover whether we can not without their assistance whether or there be any other which may

written he had come to the decision that he was too young to be of controversies and he was desirous of acquiring sobriety of spirit which is the characteristic of true heroism but he never doubted the truth or utility of his opinions and in printing and privately distributing queen mab he believed that he should further their dissemination without occasioning the mischief either to others or himself that might arise from publication it is doubtful whether he would himself have admitted it into collection of his works his severe classical taste reﬁned by the constant study of the greek poets might have discovered defects that escape the ordinary reader and the change his opinions underwent in many points would have prevented him from putting forth the speculations of his boyish days but the poem is too beautiful in itself and far too remarkable the production of boy of eighteen to allow of its being passed over besides that having been frequently reprinted the omission would be vain in the former edition certain portions were left out shocking the general reader from the violence of their attack on religion i myself had painful feeling that such erasures might be looked upon mark of disrespect towards the author and am glad to have the opportunity of restoring them the notes also are reprinted because they are mode ls of reasoning or lessons of truth but because shelley

when it was enforced by menaces and punishment to aversion to the society of his such he found them when collected togeth er in societies where one egged on the other to acts of tyranny was joined the deepest sympathy and compassion while the attachment he felt individuals and the admiration with which he regarded their powers and their virtues led him to entertain high opinion of the perfectibility of human nature and he believed that all could reach the highest grade of moral improvement did not the customs and prejudices of society foster evil passions and excuse evil actions the oppression which trembling at every nerve yet resolute to heroism it was his to encounter at school and at college led him to dissent in all things from those whose arguments were blows whose faith appeared to engender blame and hatre my existence he wrote to friend in 1812 i have incessantly speculated thought and read his readings were not always well chosen among them were the works of the french philosophers far metaphysical argument went he temporarily became convert at the same time it was the cardinal article of his faith that if men were but taught and induced to treat their fellows with love charity and equal rights this earth would realize paradise he looked upon religion it is professed and above all practised hostile instead of friendly to the cultivation of those virtues which would make men brothers can this be wondered at at the age of seventeen fragile in health and frame of the purest habits in morals full of devoted generosity and universal kindness glowing with ardour to attain wisdom resolved at every personal sacriﬁce to right burning with desire affection and sympathy was treated reprobate cast forth criminal the cause was that he was sincere that he believed the opinions which he entertained to be true and he loved truth with martyr love he was ready to sacriﬁce station and fortune and his dearest affections at its shrine the sacriﬁce was demanded from and made by youth of seventeen it is singular fact in the history of society in the civilized nations of modern times that false step is so irretrievable one made in early youth older

of his friends and mankind in general and to equal power to produce the advantages he desired the world brightest gauds and its most solid advantages were of worth in his eyes when compared to the cause of what he considered truth and the good of his born in position which to his inexperienced mind afforded the greatest facilities to practise the tenets he espoused he boldly declared the use he would make of fortune and station and enjoyed the belief that he should materially beneﬁt his by his actions while conscious of surpassing powers of reason and imagination it is not strange that he should even while so young have believed that his written thoughts would tend to disseminate opinions whic h he believed conducive to the happiness of the human race if man were creature devoid of passion he might have said and done all this with quietness but he was too enthusiastic and too full of hatred of all the ills he witnessed not to scorn danger various disappointments tortured but could not tame his soul the more enmity he met the more earnestly he became attached to his peculiar views and hostile to those of the men who persecuted him he was animated to greater zeal by compassion his his sympathy was excited by the misery with which the world is burning he witnessed the sufferings of the poor and was aware of the evils of ignorance he desired to induce every rich man to despoil himself of superﬂuity and to create brotherhood of property and service and was ready to be the ﬁrst to lay down the advantages of his birth he was of too uncompromising disposition to join any party he did not in his youth look forward to gradual improvement nay in those days of intolerance now almost forgotten it seemed easy to look forward to the sort of millennium of freedom and brotherhood which he thought the proper state of mankind to the present reign of moderation and improv ement made him believe that his race would soon be run that year or two was all he had of life he desired that these years should be useful and illustrious he saw in fervent call on his to share alike the blessings of the creation to love and serve each other the noblest work that life and time

of writing queen mab great traveller within the limits of england scotland and ireland his time was spent among the loveliest scenes of these countries mountain and lake and fores t were his home the phenomena of nature were his favourite study he loved to inquire into their causes and was addicted to pursuits of natural philosophy and chemistry far they could be carried on an amusement these

of its two recognized literal wooden shoe or block of wood tied round the neck or to the leg of horse or dog again it is of others hearts not of his own that shelley here deplores the icy coldness and weight besides how could he appropriately describe his heart weight or encu mbrance upon the free play of impulse and emotion seeing that shelley above all men the heart was itself the main source and spring of all feeling and action that source he complains has been dried emotions the crushing impact of other hearts heavy hard and cold stone his heart has become withered and barren like lump of

locock examination of the manuscript leads him to conclude that shelley ﬁnal choice was 1 strophe 2 antistrophe 1 antistrophe 2 antistrophe 1 alpha antistrophe 2 alpha this in itself would be perfectly appropriate but it would be inconsistent with the method employed in designating the epodes i have therefore adopted in preference scheme which if it lacks manuscript authority in some
