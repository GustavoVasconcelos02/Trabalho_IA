illumed the spacious saloon was white and clear the midsummer moon twas the pure beam galvanic soft steady and free from all noxious fumes that with health disagree and i heard that the engine that moved our light bark was the same that gave out the bright flashing spark that oil was now used nor explosive compound on earth among all nations was found and light heat and motion at last were attained by one simple and practical instrument gained the sides of that noble apartment were dressed with gems of rare art from the east and the west here statue stood poised just ready to fly there

above the mart of london where science wealth learning and art the treasures of ages in countless store lay reserved till the dawn of happier day then softly descending we stepped on firm ground to view the new objects and people around the grim tower rose before entered the gate unguarded once by stern orders of state the jewels that in the rich diadems shone longer could tempt one to take his own exposed on all sides were rich scepters of kings tiaras pearls gems and thousand bright things once prized the emblems of place and of power but now thought mere childish toys of the hour the vestments of royalty too were displayed silk satin chenille velvet plush and brocade with exquisite work of silver and gold in fine threads that shone on each rich wavy fold and i heard with surprise an attendant confess twas the work of long years to complete court dress what folly i cried to deck the outside with garments to flatter and foster one s pride while the soul the true being of

strange looking junk from distant japan unchanged in its form since the empire began the light buoyant bark of more modern time adapted use in every clime the swift gliding steamer with paddle or screw the frigate longer exposing to view its whence issued the missiles of strife hate and conflict existed more hundred bright flags were floating in air each the name of some country or race to

this i enquired when patriarch near in pure white attired replied is it true that one being on earth knows not that the world was reformed in new birth i have heard when boy my grandsire affirm that the plant in one night was destroyed by worm and never since then half century ago has any one seen it or known it to grow the panic from pole to equator was great any past earthquake was known to

her precincts within remain then and see what treasures untold they who witness messiah s blest advent time presses i said in an hour i must start in an steamer ready to part thanks all i have seen and have heard thee declare and now to the new world glad tidings i bear that the kingdoms of earth all acknowledge the lord redeemed and restored by his life giving we taking some shoes swift and

rapid strides er the waters i sped and distanced the that flew er my head soon the wide river entered rich grassy plain where its fresh waters mingled with those of the main there lay the fair vessel with quivering wings like bird on the that flutters and sings just ready to soar through the measureless sky er mead hill and vale and precipice high the clarion left italy s shore and the old classic

inviting to sleep we glided swift on the ocean s expanse the leaves that in the wild hurricane dance the sea glowed with fire from creatures unknown brighter far than the stars in the zenith they shone and myriad flocks of strange sea birds lay on the face of the deep awaiting the day moon rose that night but re twilight was gone the sky seemed to glow with rich northern dawn and not till our flag in the morning breeze swayed did its soft lambent light from the firmament fade thus three days and nights we skimmed the blue main now watching the air ships again and again now noting far down in the green glassy brine iron vessels with submarine line propelled by galvanic action alone and made to explore ocean s chambers unknown meantime i conversed with some that i knew came from far distant climes new wonders to view of the change wrought on earth since the began when christ reigned supreme acknowledged by man pen could describe nor could language declare the glory his saints were permitted to share when the devil and all his foul works were destroyed and happiness dwelt in each heart unalloyed but how i inquired was the old world renewed in day by omniscient fiat made good or purged in long years from sin and its leaven till god saw on its bosom the image of heaven thief in the night breaks in unaware so flashed on the earth mid its pleasure and care splendor surpassing the sun s noontide ray foretelling the dawn of millenial day attended by thousands of saints came the lord to bless his redeemed and to drive the abhorred erst he once drove the angels that
