after passing the harvard gates craigie house the home of longfe llow and elmwood the home of lowell thoug h their hallowed retirement has been profaned by the encroachments of the growing city yet in their simple dignity these ﬁne old colonial mansions still bespeak the noble associ ations of the past and stand memorials of the ﬁnest products of american culture elmwood was built before the revolut ion by thomas oliver the tory governor who signed his abdication at the invitation of committee of about four thousand people who surrounded his house at camb ridge the property was conﬁscated by the commonwealth and used by the american army during the war in 1818 it was purchased by the rev charles lowell pastor of the west congregational church in boston and after ninety years it is still the family home here was born february 22 1819 james russell lowell with surroundings most propitious the nurturing of within the stately home there was reﬁned family life the father had proﬁted by the unusual privilege of three years study abroad and his library of some four thousand volumes was not limited to theology the mother whose maiden name was spence and who traced her scotch ancestry back to the hero of the ballad of sir patrick spens taught her children the good old ballads and the romantic stories in the fairie queen and it was one of the poet earliest delights to recount the adventures of spenser heroes and heroines to his playmates an equally important inﬂuence upon his early youth was the life at elmwood to the love of nature his soul was early dedicated and american poet has more truthfully and beautifully interpreted the inspired teachings of nature whispered through the solemn or caroled by the happy birds the open ﬁelds surrounding elmwood and the farms miles around were his familiar playground and furnished daily adventures his curious and eager mind the mere delight of this experience with nature he says made my childhood the richest part of my life it seems to if i had never seen nature again since those old days when the balancing of yellow butterﬂy over thistle bloom was spiritual food and lodging whole forenoon in the cathedral is an autobiographic passage describing in series of charming pictures some of those choice hours of childhood one summer hour abides what time i perched dappled with noonday under simmering leaves and pulled the pulpy oxhearts while aloof an oriole clattered and the robins shrilled denouncing an alien and thief quite like other boys lowell was subjected to the processes of the more formal education of books he was ﬁrst sent to dame school and then to the private school of william wells under whose rigid tuition he became thoroughly grounded in the classics among his schoolfellows was story the who continued his g friend thomas wentworth higginson who was one of the younger boys of the school recalls the high talk of story and lowell about the fairie queen at ﬁfteen he entered harvard college then an institution with about two hundred students the course of study in those days was narrow and dull pretty steady diet of greek latin and mathematics with an occasional dessert of paley evidences of christianity or butler analogy lowell was not distinguished scholarship but he read omnivorously and wrote copiously often in smooth ﬂowing verse fashioned after the accepted english models of the period he was an editor of harvar diana the college magazine and was elected class poet in his senior year but his habit of lounging with the poets in the secluded alcoves of the old library in preference to attending recitations ﬁnally became too scandalous ofﬁcial forbearance 7 8 9 the project gutenberg ebook of the vision of sir launfal and other poems by james russell lowell https he was rusticated on account of constant neglect of his college duties the faculty records state he was sent to concord where his exile was not without mitigating proﬁt he became acquainted with emerson and thoreau here he wrote the class poem which he was permitted to circulate in print at his commencement this production which now stands at the head of the list of his published works was curiously unprophetic of his later tendencies it was written in the neatly polished couplets of the pope type and other imitative metres and aimed to satirize the radical movements of the period especially the transcendentalists and abolitionists with both of whom he was soon to be in active sympathy lowell ﬁrst two years out of college were troubled with rather more than the usual doubts and questionings that attend young man choice of profession he studied bachelor degree in law which he obtained in two years but the work was done reluctantly law books he says i am reading with few wry faces i may though he was nominally practicing law two years there is evidence that he ever had client except the ﬁctitious one so pleasantly described in his ﬁrst magazin article entitled my first client from coke and blackstone his mind would inevitably slip away to hold more congenial communion with the poets he became intensely interested in the old english dramatists an interest that resulted in his ﬁrst series of literary articles the old english dramatists published in the boston miscellany the favor with which these articles were received increased he writes the hope of being able one day to support myself by my pen and to leave calling which i hate and which i am not well ﬁtted to say the least during this struggle between law and literature an inﬂuence came into lowell life that settled his purposes directed his aspirations and essentially determined his career in 1839 he writes to friend about very pleasant young lady who knows more poetry than any one i am acquainted with this pleasant young lady was maria white who became his wife in the loves of this young couple constitute one of the most pleasing episodes in the history of our literature idyllic in its simple beauty and inspiring in its spiritual perfectness miss white was woman of unusual loveliness says norton and of gifts of mind and heart still more unusual which enabled her to enter with complete sympathy into her lover intellectual life and to direct his genius to its highest aims she was herself poet and little volume of her poems published privately after her death is an evidence of her reﬁned intellectual gifts and lofty spirit in 1841 lowell published his ﬁrst collection of poems entitled year life the volume was dedicated to una veiled admission of indebtedness its inspiration to miss white two poems particularly irene and my love and the best in the volume are rapturous expressions of his new inspira tion in later years he referred to the collection poor windfalls of unripe experience only nine of the poems were preserved in subsequent collections in 1843 with young friend robert carter lowell launched new magazine the pioneer with the high purpose the prospectus stated of giving the public rational substitute the love tales and sketches monthly poured out to them by many of our popular magazines these young reformers did not know how strongly the great reading public is attached to its literary and so the pioneer proved itself too good to live in just three months the result of the venture to lowell was an interesting lesson in editorial work and debt of eighteen hundred dollars his next venture was second volume of poems issued in 1844 in which the permanent lines of his poetic development appear more clearly than in year life the tone of the ﬁrst volume was uniformly serious but in the second his muse face begins to brighten with the occasional play of wit and humor the volume was heartily praised by the critics and his reputation new poet of convincing distinction was established in the following year appeared conversations on some of the old poets volume of literary criticism interesting now mainly pointing to maturer work in this ﬁeld it is generally stated that the inﬂuence of maria white made lowell an abolitionist but this is only qualiﬁedly true year before he had met her he wrote to friend the abolitionists are the only ones with whom i sympathize of the present extant parties 10 11 the project gutenberg ebook of the vision of sir launfal and other poems by james russell lowell https justice humanitarianism were fundamental to his native idealism maria white enthusiasm and devotion to the cause served to crystallize his sentiments and to stimulate him to practical participation in the movement both wrote the liberty bell an annual published in the interests of the agitation immediately after their marriage they went to philadelphia where lowell time was an editorial writer the pennsylvania freeman an journal once edited by whittier during the next six years he was regular contributor to the standar d published in new york in all of this prose writing lowell exhibited the ardent spirit of the reformer although he never adopted the extreme views of garrison and others of the wing of the party but lowell greatest contribution to the cause was the biglow papers series of satirical poems in the yankee dialect aimed at the politicians who were responsible the mexican war war undertaken he believed in the interests of the southern slaveholders hitherto the abolitionists had been regarded with contempt by the conservative complacent advocates of peace and compromise and to join them was essentially to lose caste in the best society but now laughing prophet had arisen whose tongue was tipped with ﬁre the biglow papers was an unexpected blow to the slave power never before had humor been used directly weapon in political warfare soon the whole country was ringing with the homely phrases of hosea biglow satiric humor and deriding conservatism began to change countenance speech plea appeal says geor ge william curtis was comparable in popular and perman ent effect with this pitiless tempest of ﬁre and hail in the form of wit argument satire knowledge insight learning and patriotism it was humor of the purest strain but humor in deadly earnest an embodiment of the elemental yankee character and speech it is classic of ﬁnal authority says curtis burns did not give to the scotch tongue nobler immortality than lowell gave to the dialect of new england the year 1848 was one of remarkably productive results lowell besides the biglow papers and some forty magazine articles and poems he published third collection of poems the vision of sir launfal and the fable critics the various phases of his composite genius were nearly all represented in these volumes the fable was natured satire upon his fellow authors in which he touched up in rollicking rhymed couplets the merits and weaknesses of each not omitting himself with witty characterization and acute critical judgment and it is still read its delicious humor and sterling criticism example the lines on poe will always be quoted there comes poe with his raven like barnaby rudge of him genius and sheer fudge and so the sketch of hawthorne there is hawthorne with genius so shrinking and rare that you hardly at ﬁrst see the strength that is there frame so robust with nature so sweet so earnest so graceful so lithe and so ﬂeet is worth descent from olympus to meet lowell was now living in happy content at elmwood his father whom he once speaks of primrose in the comparative degree had lost large portion of his property and literary journals in those days sent very small checks to young authors so humble frugality was an attendant upon the high thinking of the poet couple but this did not matter since the richest objects of their ideal world could be had without price but clouds suddenly gathered over their beautiful lives four children were born three of whom died in infancy lowell deep and lasting grief his is tenderly recorded in the poems she came and went and the first the volume of poems published in 1848 was reverently dedicated to the memory of our little blanche and in the introductory poem addressed to he poured forth his sorrow like

died that autumn morning when she its soul was borne to lie all dark on the hillside that looks over woodland and corn before 1854 lowell literary success had been won mainly in verse with the appearance in the magazines of moosehead journal fireside travels and leaves from my italian journal his success prose essayist began henceforth and against his will his prose was stronger literary force than his poetry he now gave course of lectures on the english poets at the lowell institute and during the progress of these lectures he received notice of his appointment to succeed longfellow in the professorsh ip of the french and spanish languages and belle in harvard college year was spent in europe in preparation his new work and during the next twenty years he faithfully performed the duties of the professorsh ip pouring forth the ripening fruits of his varied studies in lectures such it is not often the privilege of college students to hear that pulling in the yoke of this steady occupation was sometimes galling is shown in his private letters to howells he wrote regretfully of the time and energy given to teaching and of his conviction that he would have been better poet if he had not estranged the muse by donning professor gown but good teacher always bears in his left hand the lamp of sacriﬁce in 1857 lowell was married to miss frances dunlap woman of remarkable gifts and grace of person and character says charles eliot norton in the same year the atlantic monthly was launched and lowell became its ﬁrst editor this position he held four years under his painstaking and wise management the magazine quickly became what it has continued to be the ﬁnest representative of true literature among periodicals in 1864 he joined his friend professor norton in the editorship of the north american review to which he gave much of the distinction which this periodical was once so worthily famous in this ﬁrst appeared his masterly essays on the great poets chaucer dante shakespeare spenser milton dryden and the others which were gathered into the three volumes among my books ﬁrst and second series and my study windows variety was given to this critical writing by such charming essays good word winter and the deliciously caustic paper on certain condescension in eigners one of the strongest elements of lowell character was patriotism his love of country and his native soil was not merely principle it was passion american author has done so much to enlar ge and exalt the ideals of democracy an intense interest in the welfare of the nation broadened the scope of his literary work and led him at times into active public life during the civil war he published second series of biglow papers in which says greenslet we feel the vital stirring of the mind of lowell it was moved by the great war and if they never had quite the popular reverberation of the ﬁrst series they made deeper impression and are more priceless possession of our literature when peace was declared in april 1865 he wrote to professor norton the news my dear charles is from heaven i felt strange and tender exaltation i wanted to laugh and i wanted to cry and ended by holding my peace and feeling devoutly thankful there is something magniﬁcent in having country to love on july 21 solemn service was held at harvard college in memory of her sons who had died in the war in which lowell gave the commemoration ode poem which is now regarded not popular 15 16 the project gutenberg ebook of the vision of sir launfal and other poems by james russell lowell https marking the highest reach of his poetic power the famous passage characterizing lincoln is unquestionably the ﬁnest tribute ever paid to lincoln by an american author in the presidential campaign of 1876 lowell was active making speeches serving delegate to the republican convention and later presidential elector there was even much talk of sending him to congress through the friendly ofﬁces of howells who was in intimate personal relations with president hayes he was appointed minister to spain this honor was the more gratifying to him because he had long been devoted to the spanish literature and language and he could now read his beloved calderon with new joys in 1880 he was promoted to the english mission and during the next four years represented his country at the court of james in manner that raised him to the highest point of honor and esteem in both nations his career in england was an extraordinary in most respects an unparalleled success he was our ﬁrst ofﬁcial representative to win completely the heart of the english people and great part of his permanent achievement was to establish more cordial relations between the two countries his literary reputation had prepared the ground his personal popularity he was greeted his excellency the ambassador of american literature to the court of shakespeare his fascinating personali ty won friends in every circle of socie ty queen victoria declared that during her long reign ambassador had created so much interest or won so much regard he had already been honored by degrees from oxford and cambridge and now many similar hono rs were thrust upon him he was acknowledged to be the best speaker in england and one was called upon so often addresses at dedications the unveiling of tablets and other civic occasions it is not strange that he became attached to england with an increasing affection but there was diminution of his intense americanism his celebrated birmingham address on democracy is yet our clearest and noblest expositio n of american political principles and ideals with the inauguration of cleveland in 1885 lowell ofﬁcial residence in england came to an end he returned to america and time lived with his daughter at deerfoot farm lowell had died in england and he could not carry his sorrow back to elmwood alone he now leisurely occupied himself with literary work making an occasional address upon literature or politics which was always distinguished by grace and dignity of style and richness of thought in november 1886 he delivered the oration at the 250th anniversary of the founding of harvard university and rising to the requirements of this notable occasion he captivated his hearers among whom were many distinguished delegates from the great universities of europe well of america by the power of his thought and the felicity of his expression during the period of his diplomatic service he added almost nothing to his permanent literary product in 1869 he had published under the willows collection that contains some of his ﬁnest poems in the same year the cathedral was published stately poem in blank verse profound in thought with many passages of great poetic beauty in 1888 ﬁnal collection of poems was published entitled heartsease and rue which opened with the memorial poem agassiz an elegy that would not be too highly honored by being bound in golden volume with lycidas adonais and thyrsis going back to his earliest literary studies he again 1887 lectured at the lowell institute on the old dramatists occasionally he gave poem to the magazines and collection of these last poems was made in 1895 by professor norton during these years were written many of the charming letters to personal friends which rank with the ﬁnest literary letters ever printed and must always be regarded an important part of his prose works it was gracious boon of providence that lowell was permitted to spend his last years at elmwood with his daughter burnett and his grandchildren there again in the early days he watched the orioles building their nests and listened to the tricksy catbird call to an english friend he writes i watch the moon rise behind the same

mt auburn he rests in life still near his great neighbor longfellow in memorial poem oliver wendell holmes spoke the thousands who mourned peace to thy slumber in the forest shade poet and patriot every gift was thine thy name shall live while summers bloom and fade and grateful memory guard thy leafy shrine lowell rich and varied personality presents type of cultured manhood that is the ﬁnest product of american democracy the largeness of his interests and the versatility of his intellectual powers give him unique eminence among american authors his genius was undoubtedly embarrassed by the diffusive tendency of his interests he might have been greater poet had he been less the reformer and statesman and his creative impulses were often absorbed in the mere enjoyment of exercising his critica l faculty although he achieved only qualiﬁed eminence poet or prose writer yet because of the breadth and variety of his permanent achievement he must be regarded our greatest man of letters his sympathe tic interest always outﬂowing toward concrete humanity was with such lar ge range from the bench can reach the stars and be with both at home with marvelous versatility and equal ease he could talk with the farmer and salty seamen and exchange elegant compliments with old world royalty in the cathedral he says signiﬁcantly i thank benignant nature most this force of sympathy

calls him out beneath the unmastered sky where the buttercups brim with wine beyond all lesbian juice but there are ampler skies he answers in fancy land and the singers though dead so give its best sweetness to all song to nature self her better glory his love of reading is manifest in all his work giving to his style bookishness that is sometimes excessive and often troublesome his expression though generally direct and clear and happily colored by personal frankness is often burdened with learning to be able to read his essays with full appreciation is in itself evidence of liberal education his scholarship was broad and profound but it was not scholarship in the german sense exhaustive and exhausting he studied the joy of knowing never the purpose of being known and he cared more to know the spirit and meaning of things than to know their causes and origins language he learned the sake of its literature rather than its philology brownell observes he shows little interest

merle and mavis all the year but books could never divert his soul from its early endearments with nature the older i grow he says the more i am convinced that there are satisfactions so deep and so permanent our sympathies with outward nature and in the preface to my study windows he speaks of himself one who has always found his most fruitful study in the open air the most charming element of his poetry is the nature element that everywhere cheers and stimulates the reader it is full of sunshine and bird music so genuine spontaneous and sympathetic are his descriptions that we feel the very heart throbs of nature in his verse and in the prose of such records of intimacies with outdoor friends the essay my garden acquaintance how i love the earth he exclaims i feel it thrill under my feet i feel somehow if it were conscious of my love if something passed into my dancing blood from it it is this sensitive nearness to nature that makes him better interpreter of her visible forms than bryant even moreover unlike bryant he always catches the notes of joy in nature voices and feels the uplift of happy inspiration in the presence of the immense popularity of mark twain it may seem parad oxical to call lowell our greatest american humorist yet in the reﬁned and artistic qualities of humorous writing and in the genuineness of the native ﬂavor his work is certainly superior to any other humorous writing that is likely to compete with it permanent interest indeed greenslet thinks that it is the author of the biglow papers that he is likely to be longest remembered the perpetual play of humor gave to his work even to the last the freshness of youth we love him his boyish love of pure fun the two large volumes of his letters are delicious reading because he put into them good wholesome nonsense he says keeping my seriousness to bore myself with but this sparkling and overﬂowing humor never obscures the deep seriousness that is the undercurrent of all his writing high idealism characterizes all his work one of his greatest services to his country was the effort to create saner and sounder political life he himself realized he often moralized his work too much with purposeful idealism in middle life he said i shall never be poet until i get out of the pulpit and new england was all when i was growing up in religion and philosophy he was conservative deprecating the radical and scientiﬁc tendencies of the age with its knife and that make thought physical and thrust far of f the heaven so neighborly with man of old the moral impulse and the poetic impulse were often in conﬂict and much of his early poetry this reason was condemned by his later judgment his maturer poems are ﬁlled with lines phrases of high aspiration and ecstasies though his thought is spiritual and ideal it is always ﬁrmly rooted in the experience of common humanity all can climb the heights with him and catch inspiring glimpses at least of the ideal and the inﬁnite critical apprecia tions the proportion of his poetry that can be so called is small but great deal of it is very ﬁne very noble and at times very beautiful and it discloses the distinctly poetic faculty of which rhythmic and ﬁgurative is native expression it is impressionable rather than 21 22 the project gutenberg ebook of the vision of sir launfal and other poems by james russell lowell https in the large sense it is felicitous in detail rather than in design and of general rather than individual represen tative rather than original inspiration there is ﬁeld of poetry assuredly not the highest but ample and which these qualities more or less unsatisfactory in prose are legitimately and fruitfully exercised all poetry is in the realm of feeling and thus less exclusively dependent on the thought that is the sole reliance of prose being genuine poetry lowell proﬁts by this advantage feeling is ﬁtly genuinely its inspiration its range and limitations correspond to the character of his susceptibility those of his prose to that of his thought the fusion of the two in the crucible of the imagination is infrequent with him because with him it is the fancy rather than the imagination that is luxuriant and highly developed the architectonics of poetry he had not the requisite reach and grasp the comprehensive and constructing vision nothing of his has any large design or effective interdependent proportions in technical way an exception should be noted in his skilful building of the form in which he was extremely successful and which he evidently had native aptitude lowell constitutes on the whole the most admirable american contribution to the nature poetry of english beyond that of bryant whittier or longfellow i think and only occasionally excelled here and there by the magic touch of emerson br ownell in scribner magazine february 1907 lowell is poet who seems to represen t new england more variously than either of his comrades we ﬁnd in his work in theirs her loyalty and moral purpose she has been at cost his training and he in turn has read her heart honoring her mother before the world and seeing beauty in her common garb and speech if lowell be not ﬁrst of all an original genius i know not where to look one judged by his personal bearing who is brighter more persuasive more equal to the occasion than himself open to doudan stricture upon writers who hoard and store up their thoughts the betterment of their printed works lowell treasury can stand the drafts of both speech and composition judged by his works poet in the end must be he is one who might gain by revision and compression but think is his due upon the marks of his abundant tide and see how enviable the record of poet who is our most brilliant and learned critic and who has given us our best native idyll our best and most complete work in dialectic verse and the noblest heroic ode that america has and all ranking with the ﬁrst of their kinds in english literature of the modern time edmund clar ence stedman racy humorist and brilliant wit using verse an instrument of expression he has clear superior probably equal so far at least american readers are concerned among writers who have employed the english language satirist he has superiors but scarcely an inventor of jeux patriotic lyrist he has few equals and very few superiors in what is probably the highest function of such of stimulating to noble height the national instincts of his countrymen the rest of his poetry may fairly be said to gain on that of any of his american contemporaries save poe in more sensuous rhythm in choicer diction in more reﬁned and subtilized imagination and in deeper more brooding intelligence w illiam p trent in originality in virility in lowell is the ﬁrst of american poets he not only possessed at times in nearly equal measure many of the qualities most notable in his rivaling bryant painter of nature and holmes in pathos having touch too of emerson

the first and after the burial in another again the noble harvar d commemoration ode he had plainly most defective ear rhythm and verbal harmony except when he conﬁnes himself to simple metres we rarely ﬁnd ﬁve consecutive lines which not in some way jar on us his blank verse and the irregular metres which he unfortunately so often employs have little or music and are often quite intolerable but after all the deductions which the most exacting criticism can make it still remains that serious poet lowell stands high painter of nature he has when at his best few superiors and in his own country none whatever be their esthetic and technical deﬁciencies he has written many poems of sentiment and pathos which can never fail to come home to all to whom such poetry appeals his hortatory and didactic poetry it expresses itself in the commemoration ode is worthy if not of the music and felicity of milton and wordsworth at least of their tone when that tone is most exalted humorist he is inimitable his humor is rooted in ﬁne sense of the becoming and in profounder insight into the character of his countrymen than that of any other american writer john churton collins he was brilliant wit and delightful humorist discursive essayist of unfailing charm the best american critic of his time scholar of wide learning deep also when his interest was most engaged powerful writer on great public questions patriot passionately pure but ﬁrst last and always he was poet never so happy when he was looking at the world from the poet mount of vision and seeking ﬁt words and musical to tell what he had seen but his emotion was not sufﬁciently in tranquillity had he been more an artist he would have been better poet then he would have challenged the invasions of his literary memory his humor his animal spirits within limits where they had right of way if his humor was his rarest it was his most dangerous gift so often did it tempt him to laugh out in some holy place less charming than longfellow less homely than whittier less artistic than holmes less grave than bryant less vivid than emerson less unique than poe his qualities intellectual moral and esthetic in their assemblage and coördination assign him to place among american men of letters which is only little lower than that which is emerson and his alone john white chadwick the vision of sir launf al early

letter he calls it little narrative poem in december 1848 it was published in thin volume alone and at once justiﬁed the poet expectations of popularity the poem was an improvisation like that of his musing organist it was written we are told almost at single sitting entirely within two days the theme may have been suggested by tennyson sir galahad but his familiarity with the old romances and his love of the mystical and symbolic sense of these good time tales were quite ample source such suggestion moreover lowell in his early years was much given to seeing visions and dreaming dreams during that part of my life he says which i lived most alone i was never single night unvisited by visions and once i thought i had personal revelation from god himself the fairie queen was the ﬁrst poem i ever read he says and the bosky glades of elmwood were often transformed into an enchanted forest where the knight of the red cross and una and others in medieval costume passed up and down before his wondering eyes this medieval romanticism was perfectly natural accompaniment of his intense idealism 26 27 the project gutenberg ebook of the vision of sir launfal and other poems by james russell

clearly perceived i ﬁnd myself very curiously compounde d of two utterly distinct characters one half of is clear mystic and enthusiast and the other humorist and he adds that it would have taken very little to have made saint francis of him it was the saint francis of new england the moral and spiritual enthusiast in lowell nature that produced the poem and gave it power thus we see that notwithstanding its antique style and artiﬁcial structure it was perfectly direct and spontaneous expression of himself the allegory of the vision is easily interpreted in its main signiﬁcance there is nothing original in the lesson the humility of true charity and it is common criticism that the moral purpose of the poem is lost sight of in the beautiful nature pictures but knowledge of the events which were commanding lowell attention at this time and quickening his native feelings into purposeful utterance gives to the poem much deeper signiﬁcance in 1844 when the discussion over the annexation of texas was going on he wrote the present crisis noble appeal to his countrymen to improve and elevate their principles during the next four years he was writing editorially the standar d the ofﬁcial organ of the society at the same time he was bringing out the biglow papers in all these forms of expression he voiced constantly the sentiment of reform which now ﬁlled his heart like holy zeal the national disgrace of slavery rested heavily upon his soul he burned with the desire to make god justice prevail where man justice had failed in 1846 he said in letter it seems if my heart would break in pouring out one glorious song that should be the gospel of reform full of consolation and strength to the oppressed yet falling gently and restoringly dew on the withered of the oppressor that way my madness lies if any this passionate yearning reform is embodied poetically in the vision in broad sense therefore the poem is an expression of ideal democracy in which equality sympathy and sense of the common brotherhood of man are the basis of all ethical actions and standards it is the conception of human society that is always so alluring in the poetry and so discouraging in the prose of life the following explanation appeared in the early editions of the poem an introductory note according to the mythology of the romancers the san greal or holy grail was the cup out of which jesus christ partook of the last supper with his disciples it was brought into england by joseph of arimathea and remained there an object of pilgrimage and adoration many years in the keeping of his lineal descendants it was incumbent upon those who had charge of it to be chaste in thought word and deed but one of the keepers having broken this condition the holy grail disappeared from that time it was favorite enterprise of the knights of arthur court to go in search of it sir galahad was at last successful in ﬁnding it may be read in the seventeenth book of the romance of king arthur tennyson has made sir galahad the subject of one of the most exquisite of his poems the plot if i may give that name to anything so slight of the following poem is my own and to serve its purposes i have enlar ged the circle of competition in search of the miraculous cup in such manner to include not only other persons than the heroes of the round table but also period of time subsequent to the date of king arthur reign in the last sentence there is sly suggestion of lowell playfulness of course every one may compete in the search the grail and the time subsequent to king arthu r reign includes the present time the roman ce of king arthur is the morte darthur of sir thomas malory lowell speciﬁc indebtedness to the medieval romances extended only to the use of the symbol of consecration to some noble purpose in the search the grail and to the name of his hero it is free version of older french romances belonging 28 29 the project gutenberg ebook of the vision of sir launfal and other poems by james russell lowell https the arthurian cycle sir launfal is the title of poem written by sir thomas chestre in the reign of henry vi which may be found in ritson ancient english metrical romances there is nothing suggestive of lowell poem except the quality of generosity in the hero gaf gyftys lar gelyche gold and sylver and clodes ryche to squyer and to knight one of lowell earlier poems the search contains the germ of the vision of sir launfal it represents search christ ﬁrst in nature fair woods and ﬁelds then in the proud world amid power and wealth and the search ﬁnally ends in hovel rude where the king i sought meekly stood naked hungry child clung round his gracious knee and poor hunted slave looked up and smiled to bless the smile that set him free and christ the seeker learns is not to be found by wandering through the world his throne is with the outcast and the weak similar fancy also is embodied in little poem entitled parable christ goes through the world to see how the men my brethren believe in and he ﬁnds in church and palace and disregard the primary principles of his teaching have ye founded your throne and altars then on the bodies and souls of living men and think ye that building shall endure which shelters the noble and crushes the poor these early poems and passages in others written at about the same time taken in connection with the vision show how strongly the theme had seized upon lowell mind the structure of the poem is complicated and sometimes confusing at the outset the student must notice that there is story within story the action of the major story covers only single night and the hero of this story is the real sir launfal who in his sleep dreams the minor story the vision the action of this story covers the lifetime of the hero the imaginary sir launfal from early manhood to old age and includes his wanderings in distant lands the poem is constructed on the principles of contrast and parallelism by holding to this method of structure throughout lowell sacriﬁced the important artistic element of unity especially in breaking the narrative with the prelude to the second part the ﬁrst prelude describing the beauty and inspiring joy of spring typifying the buoyant youth and aspirin g soul of sir launfal corresponds to the second prelude describing the bleakness and desolation of winter typifying the old age and desolated life of the hero but beneath the surface of this wintry age there is new soul of summer beauty the warm love of suffering humanity just beneath the surface of the frozen brook there is an of summer beauty in part first the gloomy castle with its joyless interior stands the only cold and forbidding thing in the landscape like an outpost of winter so in part second the same castle with christmas joys within is the only bright and gladsome object in the landscape in part first the castle gates never might opened be in part second the castle gates stand open now and thus the student may ﬁnd various details contras ted and paralleled the symbolic mean ing must be kept constantly in mind or it will escape unobserved example the cost of earthly things in comparison with the generosity of june corresponds to the churl ish castle opposed to the inviting warmth of summer and each symbolizes the proud selﬁsh misguided heart of sir launfal in youth in comparison with the humility and large 30 31 the project gutenberg ebook of the vision of sir launfal and other poems by james russell lowell https charity in old age the student should search these symbolic hints passages in which more is meant than meets the ear but if he does not ﬁnd all that the poet may or may not have intended in his dream y design there need be detraction from the enjoyment of the poem critical judgment upon the vision of sir launfal is generally severe in respect to its structural faults greenslet declares that through half century nine readers out of ten have mistaken lowell meaning even the numerous commentators have interpreted the poem if the young knight actually adventured the quest and returned from it at the end of years broken and old this however must be regarded rather exaggerated estimate of the lack of unity and consistency in the poem stedman says i think that the vision of sir launfal owed its success quite much to presentation of nature to its misty legend it really is landscape poem of which the lovely passage what is so rare day in june and the wintry prelude to part second are the speciﬁc features and the english critic churton collins thinks that sir launfal except the beautiful nature pictures scarcely rises above the level of an ingoldsby legend the popular judgment of the poem which after all is the important judgment is fairly stated by greenslet there is probably poem in american literature in which visionary faculty like that of lowell is expressed with such ﬁrm command of poetic background and variety of music in sir launfal its structure is far from perfect yet all that it has stood the searching test of time it is beloved now by thousands of young american readers whom it has been ﬁrst initiation to the beauty of poetic idealism while studying the vision of sir launfal the student should be made familiar with tennyson sir galahad and the holy grail and the libretto of wagner parsifal also henry abbey magniﬁcent series of mural paintings in the boston public library representing the quest of the holy grail may be utilized in the copley prints if possible the story

had been killed in the war eight of these fallen young heroes were of lowell own kindred personal grief thus added intensity to the deep passion of his utterance upon this great occasion he was invited to give poem and the ode which he presented proved to be the supreme event of the noble service the scene is thus described by francis underwood who was in the audience the services took place in the open air in the presence of great assembly prominent among the speakers were major meade the hero of gettysbur g and major general devens the wounds of the war were still fresh and bleeding and the interest of the occasion was deep and thrilling the summer afternoon was drawing to its close when the poet began the recital of the ode living audience could the ﬁrst time follow with intelligent appreciation the delivery of such poem to be sure it had its obvious strong points and its sonorous charms but like all the later poems of the author it is full of condensed thought and requires study the reader ﬁnds many passages whose force and beauty escaped him during the recital but the effect of the poem at the time was overpowering the face of the poet always singularly expressive was on this occasion almost if with an inward light it was impossible to look away from it our age has furnished many great historic scenes but this 32 33 the project gutenberg ebook of the vision of sir launfal and other poems by james russell lowell https combined the elements of grandeur and pathos and produced an impression lasting life of the delivery and immediate effect of the poem greenslet says some in the audience were thrilled and shaken by it lowell himself was shaken in its delivery yet he seems to have felt with some reason that it was not complete and immediate success nor is this cause wonder the passion of the poem was too ideal its woven harmonies too subtle to be readily communicated to so large an audience mastered and mellowed though it was by single deep mood nor was lowell elocution quite that of the mouthed odist capable of interpreting such organ tones of verse but sooner was the poem published with the matchless lincoln strophe inserted than its greatness and nobility were manifest the circumstances connected with the writing of the ode have been described by lowell in his private letters it appears that he was reluctant to undertake the task and several weeks his mind utterly refused to respond to the high duty put upon it at last the sublime thought came to him upon the swift wings of inspiration the ode itself he says was an improvisation two days before the commemoration i had told my friend child that it was i was dull but the next day something gave jog and the whole thing came out of with rush i sat up all night writing it out clear and took it on the morning of the day to child in another letter he says the poem was written with vehement speed which i thought i had lost in the skirts of my professor gown till within two days of the celebration i was hopelessly dumb and then it all came with rush literally making lean mi fece magro and so nervous that i was weeks in getting over it in note in scudder biography of lowell vol 65 it is stated upon the authority of lowell that the poem was begun at ten the night before the commemoration day and ﬁnished at four in the morning she opened her eyes to see him standing haggard actually wasted by the stress of labor and the excitement which had carried him through poem full of passion and ﬁre of ﬁve hundred and lines in the space of six hours critical estimates are essentially in accord to the deep signiﬁcance and permanent poetic worth of this poem greenslet the latest biographer of lowell says that the ode if not his most perfect is surely his noblest and most splendid work and adds until the dream of human brotherhood is forgotten the echo of its large music will not wholly die away professor beers declares it to be although uneven one of the ﬁnest occasional poems in the language and the most important contribution which our civil war has made to song of its exalted patriotism geor ge william curtis says the patriotic heart of america throbs forever in lincoln gettysbur g address but nowhere in literature is there more magniﬁcent and majestic personiﬁcation of count ry whose name is sacred to its children nowhere profounder passion of patriotic loyalty than in the closing lines of the commemoration ode the american whose heart swayed by that lofty music does not thrill and palpitate with solemn joy and high resolve does not yet know what it is to be an american with the praise of discriminating criticism stedman discusses the ode in his poets of america another poet would have composed less unequal ode american could have gloriﬁed it with braver passages with whiter heat with language and imagery so beﬁtting impassioned thought tried by the rule that true poet is at his best with the greatest theme lowell strength is indisputable the ode is verse from pentelicus but mass of rugged quartz beautiful with prismatic crystals and deep veined here and there with virgin gold the early strophes though opening with ﬁne abrupt line is song are scarcely ﬁrm and incisive lowell had to work up to his theme in the third division loved truth and lavished life best oil he struck upon new and musical intonation of the tenderest thoughts the quaver of this melodious interlude carries the ode along until the great strophe is reached such was he our martyr 34 35 36 the project gutenberg ebook of the vision of sir launfal and other poems by james

passages and at the close the poet rises with the invocation down dear land thou hast found release strain which shows that when lowell determinedly sets his mouth to the trumpet the blast is that of roncesvalles brownell the latest critic of lowell poetry says of this poem the ode is too long its evolution is defective it contains verbiage it preaches but passages of most famous having characteristically been interpolated after its equal to anything of the kind the temptation to quote from it is hard to withstand it is the sheaf of lowell achievement in this ode he reaches if he does not throughout maintain his own height and his verse has the elevation of ecstasy and the splendor of the sublime the versiﬁcation of this poem should be studied with some particularity of the forms of lyric expression the ode is the most elaborate and digniﬁed it is adapted only to lofty themes and stately occasions great liberty is allowed in the choice and arrangement of its meter rhymes and stanzaic forms that its varied form and movement may follow the changing phases of the sentiment and passion called forth by the theme lowell has given us an account of his own consideration of this matter my problem he says was to contrive measure which should not be tedious by uniformity which should vary with varying moods in which the transitions including those of the voice should be managed without jar i at ﬁrst thought of mixed rhymed and blank verses of unequal measures like those in the choruses of samson agonistes which are in the main masterly of course milton deliberately departed from that stricter form of greek chorus to which it was bound quite much i suspect by the law of its musical accompaniment by any sense of symmetry i wrote some stanzas of the commemoration ode on this theory at ﬁrst leaving some verses without rhyme to match but my ear was better pleased when the rhyme coming at longer interval echo rather than instant reverberation produced the same effect almost and yet was gratiﬁed by unexpectedly recalling an association and faint reminiscence of consonance bibliography horace scudder james russell lowell biography 2 vols the standard

delivered but was written immediately after the occasion and included in the published poem it is so completely imbedded in the structure of the ode says scudder that it is difﬁcult to think of it an afterthought it is easy to perceive that while the glow of composition and of recitation was still upon him lowell suddenly conceived this splendid illustration and indeed climax of the utterance of
