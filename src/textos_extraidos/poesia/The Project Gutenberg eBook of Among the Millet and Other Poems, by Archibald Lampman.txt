your sward ﬁeld without reaper they called the shining sun your lord the shepherd wind your keeper your sweetest poets i will deem the men of old moulding in simple beauty such dream and i could lie beholding where daisies in the meadow toss the wind from morn till even forever shepherd you across the shining ﬁeld of heaven april pale season watcher in unvexed suspense still priestess of the

sun at even scatters down mist across the murmuring town by the slow streams the frogs all day and night dream without thought of pain or heed of ill watching the long warm silent hours take ﬂight and ever with soft throats that pulse and thrill from the shallows trill and trill tremulous sweet voices answering one to another glorying in the spring all day across the ever soil strong horses labour

april day lulled with cool murmurs and the drowsy beat of partridge wings in secret thickets grey the marriage hymns of all the birds at play the faces of sweet ﬂowers and easeful dreams beside slow reaches of streams wandered with happy feet and quite forgot the shallow toil the strife against the grain near souls that hear us call but answer not the loneliness perplexity and pain and high thoughts cankered with an earthly stain and then the long draught emptied to the lees i turn homeward in slow pacing ease cleaving the cedar shadows and the thin mist of grey gnats that cloud the river shore sweet even choruses that dance and spin soft tangles in the sunset and once more the city smites with its dissonant roar to its hot heart i pass untroubled yet fed with calm hope without desire or fret so to the year ﬁrst altar step i bring gifts of meek song and make my spirit free with the blind working of unanxious spring careless with her whether the days that ﬂee pale drouth or

and solemn slowly with hushed ﬂight ye saw the echoing hours go by drawn nor ever stirred watching with fathomless eyes and with your countless clear antiphonies filling the earth and heaven even till dawn found you with its ﬁrst pale gleam still with soft throats unaltered in your dream and slowly we heard you day by day the stillness of enchanted reveries bound brain and spirit and eyes in some divine sweet wonder astray to us sorrow or upreared dismay nor any discord came but evermore the voices of mankind the outer roar grew strange and murmurous faint and far away morning and noon and midnight exquisitely wrapt with your voices this alone we knew cities might change and fall and men might die secure were we content to dream with you that change and pain are shadows faint and ﬂeet
