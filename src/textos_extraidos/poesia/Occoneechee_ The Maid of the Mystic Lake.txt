maid of the mystic lake https the maritime navigator full of visions and dreams dared to sail those hitherto undiscovered shores now known america there lived within the realm wandering happy yet untutored race of men whom we afterwards called indians who dwelt in great numbers along the whole distance from penobscot bay south to the ever glades of florida tuckaseigee falls above dillsboro all along the racing river gorgeous forest trees are among the more noted tribes were the abnaki mohawk mohican huron iroquois munsi erie seneca susquehanna mamrahoac powhatan monacan nollaway tuscarora pamlico catawba santee uchee yamasee creek choctaw seminole showano and cherokee but of all of these it is left us to speak alone of the valiant cherokee the most noble of all red men who inhabited that picturesque country in the appalachian chain of mountains in east tennessee western north carolina northern geor gia south carolina and alabama and part of virginia kentucky and west virginia these are the people of whom little has been said and less written than most of the children of men yet of all of the native americans the cherokee tribe was the most noble humane and intelligent 10 occoneechee the maid of the mystic lake https in the annals of the aborigines of america the cherokee separated from the great northern tribe the iroquois and by preference inhabited the hills of the appalachian range and here we find them early in the dawn of american history occupying country which af fords ample environment the artist the poet and the painter had homer seen and michelangelo traveled among the towering hills of the happiest land of earth the song and the chisel instead of being draped with the vail of blood would have inspired the world to look forward to the time when there will be death serenely sitting upon the throne of war at one time the cherokee tribe was the lar gest and most learned in art and literature of any tribe in the united states having perhaps many thousand people and attained under sequoya whose photograph is herein reproduced that degree of learning that many of the tribe became quite familiar with letters and literature printed from the alphabet invented by this noted man inventor and devout preacher of the christian gospel sequoya was himself an untutored yet to him are we indebted an alphabet of 76 characters which stands third among the alphabets which have been invented among men and by which cherokee child learns to read fluently in six months of study does the average english child in three years of study under our system the name cherokee so far research reveals has meaning or the meaning has been lost or perhaps anglicized but we have authority its use the past 375 years when soto s expedition was made through the appalachian mountains in 1540 he encountered this great and friendly nation living peacefully in their paradise among the hills and mountains who received him they were wont to receive friendly tribe so did they ever receive and treat the white neighbor until treaty after treaty had been broken and their homes had been destroyed and every compact violated hostilities were in most cases caused by encroaching whites and broken promises and intrigues of the foreigners who were gradually drawing the cordon around the diminishing tribe the battle of horseshoe bend which took place in the tallapoosa river in alabama on the 27th day of march 1814 was one of the notable events in cherokee history where junaluska in conjunction with general jackson slaughtered or massacred nearly one thousand creeks which ended the creek war and brought much honor to junaluska and his valiant cherokee army of more than 500 men the terrors which followed the battle of horseshoe bend we have only to refer to history to be able to ascertain the facts concerning the bloody atrocities which were perpetrated upon an oppressed people then came the end which occurred in the year 1838 which culminated in the removal of the band to the indian territory which is now called oklahoma choctaw word meaning red people okla people homa red this removal was the most luckless and recreant of all the abuses that had been heaped upon the brave but helpless band of cherokee junaluska who witnessed the removal but was permitted to remain with the residue remarked that had he known that general jackson who became president would have removed the cherokee in such brutal manner he would have killed him at the battle of horseshoe bend the history of the removal of the cherokee told by james mooney of the department of american ethnology gleaned by him from eye witnesses and 11 12 occoneechee the maid of the mystic lake https in the tragedy may well exceed in weight of grief and pathos any other act in american history even the much sung song of the exile of the arcadians falls far behind it in the sum of death and misery under general winfield scott an army of volunteers and regular troops were concentrated in the cherokee country and by instruction from washington he was directed and gave orders to soldiers to gather all indians to the various stockades which had been previously prepared their reception from these posts squads of soldiers were sent to search out with rifle and bayonet every small cabin which could be found within the ramifications and deep recesses of the great appalachian range of mountains and bring to the forts every man woman and child to be found within the gates of the granite hills families while sitting peacefully at the meal others while performing the matutinal ablution were suddenly startled by the gleam of bayonets and with blows curses and oaths from the men called soldiers the indians were driven like cattle from their humble homes down the rugged mountain paths and their houses in many cases were burned and their small possessions destroyed the brave but defenceless cherokee people looked on with that wonderful stoicism which other race of men ever possessed men were seized in the fields women torn from the wheel and the distaf f and children frightened from the pleasures of play the vandals who followed in the wake of the soldiery looting and pillaging burning and destroying yet calling themselves civilized christians were such band of outlaws is seldom seen even among the most savage and barbaric races even indian graves were robbed of the silver pendants and other valuables which had been deposited with the dead women who were not able to go were actually forced at the point of bayonet to march with the same speed men upon one occasion the soldiers surrounded the house of an old christian patriot who when informed to what was to take place called his wife children and grandchildren around him kneeling down among them of fered last prayer in the sanctuary of his home in his native tongue while the soldiers stood astonished looking on in silence when his devotions were finished he arose bade the household follow him and he led them into exile with that becoming christian fortitude which is seldom witnessed among men one woman on finding the house surrounded went to the door and called up the chickens fed them the last time bade them farewell then taking her baby upon her back she extended her hands to her other two small children then followed her husband into exile from whence she never returned geor gia volunteer who afterwards became colonel in the confederate service said i have fought through the civil war and have seen men shot to pieces and slaughtered by the thousands but the cherokee removal was the most cruel work i ever all were not thus so submissive one old man named tsali charlie was seized with his wife his brother his three sons and their families exasperated at the brutality accorded his wife who being unable to travel fast was prodded with the bayonets to hasten her steps he ur ged the other men to join him in dash liberty and he spoke in cherokee the soldiers although they heard understood nothing until each warrior suddenly sprang upon the soldier nearest and endeavored to wrench his gun from him the attack was so sudden and unexpected that one soldier was killed and the rest fled while the indians escaped to the mountains hundreds of others some of them from the various stockades managed also to escape to the hills and mountains from time to time where those 13 14 occoneechee the maid of the mystic lake https did not die from starvation subsisted on roots and wild berries until the hunt was over finding that it was impossible to secure these fugitives general scott finally tendered them proposition through colonel thomas known in cherokee their trusted friend and chief that if they would bring charlie and his party punishment the rest would be allowed to remain until their case could be adjusted by the government on hearing of the proposition charlie voluntarily came in with his sons of fering himself sacrifice his people by command of general scott charlie his brother and the two elder sons were shot near the mouth of tuckaseigee river detachment of cherokee prisoners being compelled to the shooting in order to impress upon the indians the fact of their utter helplessness from those fugitives thus permitted to remain originated the present eastern band of cherokee when nearly cherokee had been gathered into the stockades the removal began early in june several parties aggregating about five thousand persons were brought down by the troops to the old agency on hiwassee river at the present calhoun and to ross landing now chattanooga and to gunter s landing now guntersville lower down on the tennessee where they were put upon steamers and transported down the tennessee and ohio to the farther side of the mississippi whence their journey was continued by land to indian territory now oklahoma the removal in the the hottest part of the year was attended with so great sickness and mortality that by resolution of the cherokee national council john ross and the other chiefs submitted to general scott proposition that the cherokee be allowed to remove themselves in the fall after the sickly season ended this was granted on condition that all should have started by the 20th of october except the sick and aged who might not be able to move so rapidly accordingly officers were appointed by the cherokee council to take char ge of the emigration the indians being or ganized into detachments averaging one thousand each with two leaders in char ge of each department and suf ficient number of wagons and horses the purpose in this way the remainder enrolled at about including few negro slaves started on the long march overland late in the fall those who thus emigrated under the management of their own of ficers assembled at rattlesnake springs near the present charleston where final council was held in which it was decided to continue their old constitution and laws in their new home then in october 1838 the long procession of exiles was set in motion few went by the river route but nearly all went overland crossing to the north side of the hiwassee river at ferry above gunter s creek they proceeded down along the river the sick aged and children together with their belongings being hauled in wagons the rest on foot or on horses it was like an army 645 wagons regiment after regiment the wagons in the center the of ficers along the line and the horsemen on the flank and at the rear tennessee river was crossed at tucker s ferry short distance above jolly s island at the mouth of hiwassee thence the route lay south of pikeville through mcminnville and on to nashville where the cumberland was crossed they then went on to hopkinsville where the noted chief white path in char ge of detachment sickened and died his people buried him by the roadside with 15 16 occoneechee the maid of the mystic lake https over the grave and poles with streamers around it that the others coming on behind might note the spot and remember him somewhere along that march of the exiles died by tens and twenties every day of the devoted wife of the noted chief john ross sank down and died leaving him to go on with bitter pain of bereavement added to the heartbreak at the ruin and desolation of his nation the ohio was crossed at ferry near the mouth of the cumberland and the army passed on through southern illinois until the great mississippi was reached opposite cape girardean missouri it was now the middle of winter with the river running full of ice so that several detachments were obliged to wait some time on the eastern bank the channel to become clear information furnished by old men at tahlequah after the lapse of fifty years showed that time had not suf ficed to wipe out the memory of the miseries of that halt beside the frozen river with hundreds of sick and dying penned up in wagons or stretched upon the ground with only blanket overhead to keep out the january blast the crossing was at last made in two divisions at cape girardean and green s ferry short distance below whence the march was continued on through missouri to indian territory the later detachment making northerly circuit by springfield because those who had gone before had killed of f all the game along the direct route they had started in october 1838 and it was now march 1839 the journey having occupied nearly six months of the hardest part of the year it is dif ficult to state positively to the mortality and loss by reason of the removal of this once happy nation but near can be ascertained more than four thousand persons perished along the great highway of death on the arrival in indian territory the exiles at once set about building houses and planting crops the government having agreed under treaty to furnish them rations one year after arrival they were welcomed by their kindred the old settlers who held the country under previous treaties of 1828 and these however being already regularly or ganized under government and chiefs of their own were by means disposed to be swallowed by the governmental authority of the newcomers jealousies developed in which the minority or treaty party of the emigrants headed by major ridge took sides with the old settlers against john ross of the national party which outnumbered the others nearly three to one while these dif ferences were at their height the nation was thrown into fever of excitement by the news that major ridge his son john ridge and elias leaders of the treaty been killed by adherents of the national party immediately after the adjournment of general council which had adjourned after nearly two weeks of debate without having been able to bring about harmonious action major ridge was waylaid and shot near the arkansas line his son was taken from bed and cut to pieces with hatchets while boudinot was treacherously killed at his home at park hill indian territory all three being killed upon the same day june 22 1839 which date marks the decline and fall of once great and happy people fifty years which followed this luckless day in june indian territory became veritable theater of crime and disorder from the south meridian of the sunflower state to the cypress banks of the red river and from fort smith to the shifting sands of the great plains half century sheltered coterie of actors that would have made robin hood or kit carson blush with envy the soil of the five tribes has been moistened with human blood when there was none to answer the cry vengeance when 17

the desperado is thing of the past the brave men who enlisted in the hazardous governmental service to give them battle have disappeared and the sound of the firing winchester used in deadly conflict has been replaced by the reaper and the mower and toilers in the field of commerce and industry the indian tribe has been supplanted by the american government and the school and church have taken the place of the chase and the feud where the wild flowers nodded far out on the lonely plain vast fields of wheat and corn whisper the great name of oklahoma at this writing the eastern band of cherokee

proper form and ceremony in the old times the and priests were accustomed to meet together at night in the asi or log sleeping house to recite the traditions and discuss their secret knowledge at times those who desired instruction from an adept in the sacred lore of the tribe would meet the priest by appointment in the asi where they sat up all night talking with only the light of small fire burning in the middle of the floor at daybreak the whole party went down to the running stream where the pupils or hearers of the myths stripped themselves and were scratched upon the naked skin with bone tooth comb in the hands of the priest after which they waded out facing the rising sun and dipped seven times under the water while the priest recited prayers upon the bank the purificatory rite which was observed more than century ago by adair is also part of the ceremonial of the ball play the dance and in fact every important ritual performance before beginning one of the stories of the

made the earth is great island floating in sea of water and suspended at each of the four cardinal points by cord hanging down from the sky vault which is of solid rock when the world grows old and worn out the people will die and the cords will break and let the earth sink down into the ocean and all will be water again the indians are afraid of this when all was water the animals were above the galunlati beyond the arch but it was very much crowded and they were wanting more room they wondered what was below the water and at last dayunisi beaver s grandchild the little beetle of fered to go and see if it could learn it darted in every direction over the surface of the water but could find firm place to rest then it dived to the bottom and came up with some soft mud which began to grow and spread in every direction until it became an island which we call the earth it was afterwards fastened to the sky but one remembers who did it at first the earth was flat and very soft and wet the animals were anxious to get down and sent out dif ferent birds to see if it was yet dry but they found place to alight and came back again to galunlati at last it seemed to be time and they sent out the buzzard and told him to go and make ready them this was the great buzzard the father of all the buzzards we see now he flew all over the earth low down near the ground and it was still soft when he reached the cherokee country he was very tired and his wings began to flap and strike the ground and wherever they struck the earth there was valley and where they turned up again there was mountain when the animals above saw this they were afraid the whole earth would be mountains so they called him back but the cherokee country remains full of mountains to this day when the earth was dry and the animals came down it was still dark so they got the sun and set it in track to go every day across the island from east to west just overhead it was too hot this way and tsiskagili the red crawfish had his shell scorched red so that his meat was spoiled and the cherokee not eat it the conjurers put the sun another higher in the air but it was still too hot they raised it another time and another until it was seven high and just under the sky arch then it was right and they left it so this is why the conjurers call the highest place gulkwagine digalunlatiyun the seven height because it is seven above the earth every day the sun goes along under this arch and returns at night on the upper side to the starting place there is another world under this and it is like ours in plants and that the seasons are dif ferent the streams that come down from the mountains are the trails by which the people reach the underworld and the springs at their heads are the doorways by which they enter it but to this one must fast and go to water and have one of the under ground people guide we know that the seasons in the under ground are dif ferent from ours because the water in the springs is warmer in the winter and cooler in the summer than the outer air when the animals and the plants were first not know by they were told to watch and keep awake seven nights just young men now contents 132 133 occoneechee the maid of the mystic lake https and keep awake when they pray to their medicine they tried to this and nearly all were awake through the first night but the next night several dropped off to sleep and the third night others were asleep and then others until on the seventh night of all the animals only the owl the panther and one or two more were still awake to these were given the power to see and to go about in the dark and to make prey of the birds and animals which must sleep at night of the trees only the cedar the pine the spruce the holly and the laurel were awake to the end and to them it was given to be always green and to be greatest medicine but to the others it was said because you have not endured to the end you shall lose your hair every winter men came after the animals and plants at first there were only brother and sister until he struck her with fish and told her to multiply and so it was in seven days child was born to her and thereafter every seven days another and they increased very fast until there was danger that the world could not keep them then it was made that woman should have only one child in year and it has been so ever since myth two the first fire in the beginning there was fire and the world was cold until the thunders who lived up in galunlati sent their lightning and put fire into the bottom of hollow sycamore tree which grew on an island the animals knew it was there because they could see the smoke coming out at the top but they could not get to it on account of the water so they held council to decide what to this was long time ago every animal that could fly or swim was anxious to go after the fire the raven offered and because he was so lar ge and strong they thought he could surely the work so he was sent first he flew high and far across the water and alighted on the sycamore tree but while he was wondering what to next the heat had scorched all his feathers black and he was frightened and came back without the fire the little w ahuhu volunteered to go and reached the place safely but while he was looking down in the hollow tree blast of hot air came up and nearly burned out his eyes he managed to fly home best he could but it was long time before he could see well and his eyes are red to this day then the hooting owl uguku and the horned owl t skili went but by the time they got to the hollow tree the fire was burning so fiercely that the smoke nearly blinded them and the ashes carried up by the wind made white rings about their eyes they had to come home again without the fire but with all of their rubbing they were never able to get rid of the white rings now more of the birds would venture and so the little uksuhi snake the black racer said he would go through the water and bring back some fire he swam across to the island and crawled through the grass to the tree and went in by small hole at the bottom the heat and smoke were too much him too and after dodging about blindly over the hot ashes until he was almost on fire himself he managed by good luck to get out again at the same hole but his body had scorched black and he has ever since had the habit of darting and doubling on his track if trying to escape from close quarters contents 134 135 occoneechee the maid of the mystic lake https came back and the great blacksnake gulegi the climber offered to go the fire he swam over to the island and climbed up the tree on the outside the blacksnake always does but when he put his head down into the hole the smoke choked him so that he fell into the burning stump and before he could climb out again he was black the uksuhi now they held another council still there was fire and the world was cold but the birds snakes and four animals all had some excuse not going because they were all afraid to venture near the burning sycamore until at last kananeski amaiyehi the water spider said she would go this is not the water spider that looks like mosquito but the other one with black downy hair and red stripes on her body she can run on the water or dive to the bottom so there would be trouble to get over to the island but the question was how could she bring back the fire i ll manage that said the spider so she spun thread from her body and wove it into tusti bowl which she fastened on her back then she crossed over to the island and through the grass to where the fire was still burning she put one little coal of fire into her bowl and came back with it and ever since we have had fire and the spider still keeps her tusti bowl myth three origin of the pleiades and the pine long ago when the world was new there were seven boys who used to spend all their time down by the playing the gatayusti game rolling stone

the spot until the earth was damp with her tears at last little green shoot sprouted up and grew day by day until it became the tall tree that we now call the pine and the pine is still of the same

leaving the other free now it gave him terrible squeeze that almost broke his ribs and then began to drag him along toward the water with his free hand the hunter began to clutch at the bushes they passed but the snake turned his head and blew its sickening breath into his face until he had to let go his hold again and again this happened and all the time they were getting nearer and nearer to

across and getting grip with its front feet and then swing its body over wherever its footprints were found there was danger it used to bleat like young fawn and when the hunter heard fawn bleat in the woods he never looked it but hurried away in the other direction up the mountain or down nothing could escape the ustutli s pursuit but along the side of the ridge it could not go because the great weight of its swinging head broke its hold on the ground when it moved sideways it came to pass after awhile that not hunter about cohutta would venture near the mountain dread of the ustutli at last man from one of the northern settlements came down to visit some relatives in that neighborhood when he arrived they made feast him but only had corn and beans and excused themselves having meat because the hunters were afraid to go into the mountains he asked the reason and when they told him he said he would go himself tomorrow and either bring in deer or find the ustutli they tried to

grass and leaves soon the fire ran all around the mountain and began to climb upward when the great serpent smelled the smoke and saw the flames coming it got all about the hunter and turned to make all speed high clif f near the summit it reached the rock and got upon it but the fire followed and caught the dead pines about the base of the clif f until the heat made the ustutli s scales crack

had hardly time to climb up again to the top of the rock before they reached the nest when they found the nest empty they were furious and circled round and round in the air until they saw the snake put its head from the water then they darted straight downward and while one seized the snake in his talons and flew far up in the sky with it his mate struck at it and bit of f piece after piece until nothing was left they were so high up that when the pieces fell they made holes in the rocks which are still to be seen there at the place which we call where the tlanuwa cut it up opposite the

feeding the two young hawks the hunter stayed in the cave many days until the young birds were nearly grown and every day the old mother bird would fly away from the nest and return in the evening with deer or bear of which she always gave the first piece to the hunter he grew very anxious to see his home again but the tlanuwa kept telling him not to be uneasy but to wait little while longer at last he made up his mind to escape from the cave and finally studied out the plan the next morning after the great hawk had gone he dragged one of the young birds to the mouth of the cave and tied himself to one of its legs with strap from his hunting pack then with the flat side of the tomahawk he struck it several times on the head until it was dazed and helpless then pushed the bird and himself together of f the shelf of rock into the air they fell far far down toward the earth but the air from below held up the bird s wings so that it was almost if they were flying the tlanuwa revived it tried to fly upward toward the nest but the hunter struck it again with his hatchet until it was dazed and dropped again at last they came down in the top of poplar tree when the hunter cut the strap from the leg of the bird and let it fly away first pulling out feather from its wing he climbed down from the tree and went home to the settlement but when he looked in his pack the feather

ogress woman monster whose food was human livers she could take on any shape that she pleased or that suited her purpose but in her right form she looked very much like an old woman excepting that her whole body was covered with skin hard rock that weapon could wound or penetrate and that on her right hand she had long stony finger of bone like an awl or spear with which she stabbed everyone to whom she could get near enough on account of this fact she was called utlunta spear finger and on account of her stony skin she was sometimes called nunyunuwi there was another monster that killed people but that is dif ferent story spear had such power over stone that she could easily lift and carry immense rocks and could cement them together by merely striking one against another to get over the rough country more easily she undertook to build great bridge through the air from nunyutlugunyi the t ree rock on hiwassee over to sanigilagi whiteside mountain in jackson county north carolina

there 173 contents 174 occoneechee the maid of the mystic lake https used to range all over the mountains about the heads of the streams and in the dark passes of nantahala always hungry and looking victims her favorite haunt on the tennessee side of the great smoky mountains was about the gap on the trail where chilhowee mountains come down to the river sometimes the old woman would approach along the trail where the children were picking strawberries or playing near the village and would say to them coaxingly come my grand children come to your granny and let granny dress your hair when some little girl ran up and laid her head in the old woman s lap to be petted and combed the old witch would gently run her fingers thru the child s hair until it went to sleep when she would stab the little one thru the heart or back of the neck with the long awl finger which she had kept hidden under her robe then she would take out the liver and eat it she would enter the house by taking the appearance of one of the family who happened to have gone out short time and would watch her chance to stab some one with her long finger and take out his liver she could stab him without being noticed and often the victim did not even know it himself at the it left wound and caused pain went on about his own af fairs until all at once he felt weak and began to pine away and was always sure to die because spear had taken his liver when the cherokee went out in the fall according to their custom to burn leaves off from the mountains in order to get the chestnuts on the ground they were never safe the old witch was always on the lookout and soon she saw the smoke rise she knew there were indians there and she would sneak up and try to surprise one alone so well they could they would try to keep together and were very cautious of allowing any stranger to approach the camp but if one went to the spring drink they never knew but it might be the liver that came back and sat with them at last great council was held to devise some means to get rid of the old witch before she should destroy everybody the people came from all around to nikwasi mound now near franklin and after much talking it was decided that the best way to secure her demise would be to trap her in pitfall where all the warriors could attack her at once so they dug deep pitfall across the path and covered it over with earth and grass if the ground had never been disturbed then they kindled lar ge fire of brush near the trail and hid themselves in the laurels because they knew that she would come soon she saw the smoke sure enough they soon saw an old woman coming along the trail she looked very much like an old woman that they knew in the village and although several of the wiser men wanted to shoot at her the others interfered because they did not want to hurt one of their own people the old woman came slowly along the trail with one hand under her blanket until she stepped upon the pitfall and tumbled through the brush top into the deep hole below then at once she showed her true nature and instead of the old feeble woman there was the terrible utlunta with her stony skin and her sharp awl finger reaching out in every direction some one to stab the hunters rushed out from the thicket and surrounded the pit but shoot true and often they could the arrows struck the stony mail of the witch only to be broken and fall useless at her feet while she taunted them and tried to climb out of the pit to get at them they kept out of her way but were only wasting their arrows when small bird utsugi the titmous perched on tree overhead and began to sing un un they thought it was saying unqhu heart meaning that they should aim at the heart of the stone witch they directed their arrows where the heart should be but the arrows only glanced of f with the flint heads broken then they caught the utsugi and cut of f its tongue so that ever since its tongue is short and everybody knows that it is liar 175 176 occoneechee the maid of the mystic lake https the hunters let it go it flew straight up into the sky until it was out of sight and it never came back any more and the titmouse that we know now is only an image of the other they kept up the fight without result until another bird little tsikilili the chickadee flew down from tree and alighted upon the witch s right hand the warriors took this sign that they must aim there and they were right her heart was on the inside of her hand which she kept doubled up into fist this same with which she had stabbed so many people now she was frightened in earnest and began to rush furiously at them with her long awl finger and to jump about in the pit to dodge the arrows until at last an arrow struck her just where the awl finger joined her wrist and she fell down dead ever since then the tsikilili is known and when man is away on journey if this bird comes and perches near the house and chirps its song his friends know that he will soon reach his home in safety and his friends will greet him upon his arrival myth twenty nunyunuwi the stone man this is what the old men used to tell us when we were boys once when all the people of the settlement were out in the mountains on great hunt one man who had gone ahead climbed to the top of high ridge and found lar ge river on the other side while he was looking across he saw an old man walking about on the opposite ridge with cane that seemed to be made of some bright shining rock the hunter watched and saw that every little while the old man would point his cane in certain direction then draw it back and smell the end of it at last he pointed it in the direction of the hunter s camp on the other side of the mountain and this time when he drew back the staf f he snif fed it several times if it smelled very good and then started along the ridge straight the camp he moved very slowly with the help of the cane until he reached the end of the ridge when he threw the cane out into the air and it became bridge of shining rock stretching across the river after he had crossed over upon the bridge it became cane again and the old man picked it up and started over the mountain toward the camp the hunter was frightened and felt sure that it meant mischief so he hurried on down the mountain and took the shortest trail back to the camp to get there before the old man when he got there and told his story the said the old man was wicked cannibal monster called nunyunuwi dressed in stone who lived in the nantahala mountains and was always going about thru the forest looking some hunter that he might kill and eat him it was very hard to escape from him because his cane guided him dog and it was nearly hard to kill him his body was entirely covered with skin of solid rock if he came he would kill and eat them all and there was only one way to save their lives he could not bear to look upon woman and if they could bring to the path seven married women that the sight of them would kill him and they would rid themselves of him so they ran swiftly and brought quickly many women they could find and placed them along the trail and when the old man came he saw one woman standing near the trail and the very sight of her made him sick and he cried out y u my grandchild i hate the sight of woman he hurried past her and in moment he saw the second woman standing he had seen the other 177 contents 178 179 occoneechee the maid of the mystic lake https he cried out again y u my child i hate the tribe of women and he hurried past her and he continued

ground and when night came they piled great logs over him and set fire to them and all the people gathered around to see nunyunuwi was great adawehi and knew many secrets and now the fire came close to him he began to talk and told them the medicine all kinds of sickness at midnight he began to sing and sang the hunting songs calling up the bear and deer and all the animals of the woods and mountains the blaze grew hotter his voice sank lower and lower until at last when the daylight came the logs were heap of white ashes and the voice was still then the told them to rake of f the ashes and where the body had lain they found only lar ge lump of wadi paint and magic ulunsuti stone he kept the stone himself and calling the people around him he painted them on the face and breast with

once canoe filled with warriors was crossing over from the town on the other side of the river when the dakwa suddenly rose up under the boat and threw them all into the air they came down it swallowed one with single snap of its jaws and dived with him to the bottom of the river soon the hunter came to his senses he found that he had not been hurt but it was so hot and close inside the dakwa that he was nearly smothered he groped around in the dark his hand struck lot of mussel shells which the fish had swallowed and taking one of these knife he began to cut his way out until soon the fish grew uneasy at the scraping inside his stomach and came up to the top of the water air he kept on cutting until the fish was in such pain that it swam this way and that across the stream and thrashed the water into foam with its tail finally the hole was so lar ge that he could look out and found that the fish was resting in shallow water near the shore the dakwa soon became so sick from the wound that it vomited the hunter out of its mouth and he with the others made their escape to tellico but the juices in the stomach of the fish made the hair fall from the head of the hunter so
