nests which is it should be how could the bird rear its young without its little home and soft little bed any more than children could be comfortably brought up without either bed to lie upon or home in which to be happy though you may ﬁnd them in every bush are wonderful things let us talk about them they are all alike in the purpose which they are intended but two families of birds build exactly alike all the wrens instance have their kind of nest the thrushes have theirs so has the swallow tribe so has the sparrow or the rook they not imitate one another but each adheres to its own plan god the great builder and artist well creator taught them from the very beginning the ﬁrst nightingale that sang its hymn of joyful thanksgiving in the garden of paradise built its nest just the same the bird you listened to last year in the coppice the materials were there and the bird knew how to make use of them and that is perhaps the most wonderful part of it she has implements to work with needle and thread scissors hammer and nails nothing but her own little feet and bill and her round little breast upon which to mould it it is generally the mother which is the chief builder sooner is the nest wanted the eggs which she is about to lay than the hitherto slumbering faculty of constructiveness is awakened and she selects the angle of the branch or the hollow in the bank or in the wall or the tangle of reeds or the platform of twigs on the exactly the right place her the selection being always the same according to her tribe and true to the instinct which was implanted in her at the ﬁrst so the building begins dry grass or leaves little twigs and hair or down whether of feather or winged seed spangled outside with silvery lichen or embroidered with green mosses less beauty it is so the birds safety because it so exactly imitates the bank or the in which it is built or it may be that her tenement is like that of the swallow or lath and plaster so to speak like an old country house is the fashion of the magpie or platform of rude sticks like the ﬁrst rudiment of basket up in the that of the pigeon she may be carpenter like the woodpecker tunneller like the or she may knead and glue together the materials of her nest till they resemble thick felt but in all this she is exactly what the great creator made her at ﬁrst equally perfect in skill and equally undeviating year after year this is very wonderful so that we may be quite sure that the sparrow s nest which david remarked in the house of god was exactly the same the sparrow built in the days of the blessed saviour when he pointing to that bird made it proof to man that god s providence ever watches over him nevertheless with this unaltered and unalterable working after one pattern in every species of bird there is choice or an adaptation of material allowed thus the bird will within certain limits select that which is ﬁttest its purpose producing however in the end precisely the same effect i will tell you what jules michelet french writer who loves birds we writes on this subject the bird in building its nest he says makes it of that beautiful or cradle form by pressing it down kneading it and shaping it upon her own he says i have just told you that the mother builds and that the is her purveyor he fetches in the materials grasses mosses roots or twigs singing many song between whiles and she arranges all with loving reference ﬁrst to the delicate egg which must be bedded in soft material then to the little one which coming from the egg naked must not only be cradled in soft comfort but kept alive by her warmth so the supposing it to be linnet brings her some hair it is stiff and hard nevertheless it is proper the purpose and serves lower stratum of the sort of elastic mattress he brings her hemp it is cold but it serves the same purpose then comes the covering and the lining and this nothing but 2 3 4 birds and their nests by mary project gutenberg ebook https various birds build the titmouse s soft silky ﬁbre of certain plants wool or cotton or better still the down from her own breast will satisfy her it is intere sting he says to watch the s skilful and furtive search materials he is afraid if he see you watching that you may discover the track to his nest and in order to mislead you he takes different road back to it you may see him following the sheep to get little lock of wool or alighting in the poultry yard on the search dropped feathers if the farmer s wife chance to leave her wheel whilst spinning in the porch he steals in morsel of ﬂax from the distaf he knows what is the right kind of thing and let him be in whatever country he may he selects that which answers the purpose and the nest which is built is that of the linnet all the world over again he tells us that there are other birds which instead of building bring up their young under ground in little earth cradles which they have prepared them of he thinks the queerest must be the ﬂamingo which lays her eggs on pile of mud which she has raised above the ﬂooded earth and standing erect all the time hatches them under her long legs it does seem queer uncomfortable way but if it answer its end we need not object to it of carpenter he thinks the thrush is the most remarkable other writers say the woodpecker the plait their nests not very skilfully it is true but sufﬁciently well their purpose they are clothed by nature with such an oily impermeable coat of plumage that they have little need to care about climate they have enough to to look after their ﬁshing and to feed themselves and their young all these families have immense appetites herons and storks build in sort of fashion so the jays and the mocking birds only in much better way but they have all large families they are obliged to so they lay down in the ﬁrst place sort of rude platform upon which they erect nest of more or less elegant design web of roots and dry twigs strongly woven together the little wren hangs her nest to bough and in the nursery song when the wind blows the cradle an australian bird kind of called there the razor from its note resembling the sound of razor at work builds her nest on the sligh test twig hanging over the water in order to protect it from snakes which climb after them she chooses her purpose twig so slender that it would not bear the weight of the snake and thus she is perfectly safe from her enemy the same probably is the cause why in tropical countries where snakes and monkeys and such abound nests are so frequently suspended by threads or little cords from slender boughs the canary the goldﬁnch and chafﬁnch are skilful or felt makers the latter restless and suspicious speckles the outside of her nest with quantity of white lichen so that it exactly imitates the tree branch on which it is placed and can hardly be detected by the most accustomed eye glueing and felting play an important part in the work of the the instance consolidates her little house with the gum of trees the american starling sews the leaves together with her bill other birds use not only their bills but their feet having woven cord they ﬁx it web with their feet and insert the weft the weaver would throw his shuttle with their bill these are genuine weavers in ﬁne their skill never fails them the truth is that the great creator never gives any creature work to without giving him at the same time an inclination to in the animal is tools sufﬁcient the work though they may be only the delicate feet and bill of the bird and now in conclusion let describe to you the nest of the little english titmouse i saw it many years ago and which i give from sketches of natural history there where those boughs of blackthorn cross behold that oval ball of moss observe it

so beautifully depicted by harrison weir with her tiny body her pretty lively and conceited ways her short little tail and delicate plumage is worthy of our tender regard and love the colouring of the wren is soft and colour the breast of light and all the hinder parts both above and below marked with wavy lines of with two bands of white dots across the wings its habits are remarkably lively and attractive i know pleasanter object says the agreeable author of british birds than the wren it is always so smart and cheerful in gloomy weather other birds often seem melancholy and in rain the sparrows and ﬁnches stand silent on the twigs with drooping wings and disarranged plumage but to the merry little wren all weathers are alike the big drops of the thunder more wet it than the drizzle of scotch mist and it peeps from beneath the bramble or glances from hole in the wall it seems snug kitten frisking on the parlour wrens and nest page 8 8 birds and their nests by mary project

attracted to some bush by hearing issue from it the frequent repetition of sound resembling the syllable chit on going up you perceive an old wren ﬂitting about the twigs and presently young one ﬂies off uttering stiﬂed chirr to conceal itself among the bushes several follow whilst the parents continue to ﬂutter about in great alarm uttering their chit chit with various degrees of the nest of the wren is wonderful structure of which i shall have good deal to say it begins building in april and is not by any means particular in situation sometimes it builds in the hole of wall or tree sometimes in this lovely little picture of ours in the mossy hollow of bank and because it was formerly supposed to live only in holes or little caves it received the name of troglodytes or but it builds equally willingly in the thatch of in or either when growing apart or nailed against wall amongst ivy or other climbing plants in fact it seems to be of such happy disposition to adapt itself to great variety of situations it is singular fact that it will often build several nests in one that it needs so many separate dwellings or that it ﬁnishes them when built but it builds if the very pleasure of the work our naturalist says speaking of this odd propensity that whilst the hen is sitting the d if from desire to be doing something will construct many nests near the ﬁrst none of which however are lined with feathers and that whilst the true nest on which the mother is sitting will be carefully concealed these sham nests are open to view some say that the wrens during the cold weather sleep in some snug warm hole they frequently occupy these extra nests winter four or ﬁve or even more huddling togethe r to keep one another weir friend of the author i have just quoted says this was the case in his own garden and that during the winter when the ground was covered with snow two of the extra nests were occupied at night by little family of seven which had hatched in the garden he was very observant of their ways and says it was amusing to see one of the old wrens coming little before sunset and standing few inches from the nest utter his little cry till the whole number of them had arrived nor were they long about it they very soon answered the call ﬂying from all seven young ones and the other then at once nestled into their snug little dormitory it was also remarkable that when the wind blew from the east they occupied nest which had its opening to the west and when it blew from the west then one that opened to the east so that it was evident they knew how to make themselves comfortable and now regards the building of these little homes i will far i am able give you the details of the whole business from the diary of the same gentleman which is accurate if the little wren had kept it himself and which will just well refer to the little nest in the primrose bank to the nest in the spanish juniper where in fact it was built on the 30th of may therefore you must imagine little pair of wrens having after great deal of consultation made up their minds to build themselves home in the branches of spanish juniper the female at about seven clock in the morning laid the foundation with the decayed leaf of some men were at work cutting drain not far off but she took notice of them and worked away industriously carrying to her work bundles of dead leaves big herself her mate seeming the while to be delighted with her industry seated not far off in portugal laurel where he watched her singing to her and so doing making her labour doubt light and pleasant from eight clock to nine she worked like little slave carrying in leaves and then selec ting from them such suited her purpose and putting aside the rest this was the foundation of the nest which she rendered compact by pressing it down with her breast and turning herself round in it then she began to rear the sides and now the delicate and difﬁcult part of the work began and she was often away eight or ten minutes together from the inside 9 10 11 birds and their nests by mary project gutenberg ebook https patient industry of this built the underpart of the aperture with the stalks of leaves which she ﬁtted together very ingeniously with moss the upper part of it was constructed solely with the mentioned material to round it and give it the requisite solidity she pressed it with her breast and wings turning the body round in various directions most wonderful to tell about seven clock in the evening the whole outside workmanship of this snug little erection was almost complete being very anxious to examine the interior of it i went out that purpose at two the next morning i introduced my ﬁnger the birds not being there and found its structure so close that though it had rained in the night yet that it was quite dry the birds at this early hour were singing if in ecstasy and at about three clock the little came and surveyed his domicile with evident satisfaction then ﬂying to the top of tree began singing most merrily in s time the made her appearance and going into the nest remained there about ﬁve minutes rounding the entrance by pressing it with her breast and the shoulders of her wings the next hour she went out and came back ﬁve times with ﬁne moss in her bill with which she adjusted small depression in the of it then after twenty minutes absence returned with bundle of leaves to ﬁll up vacancy which she had discovered in the back of the structure although it was cold morning with wind and rain the male bird sang delightfully but between seven and eight clock either having received reproof from his wife his indolence or being himself seized with an impulse to work he began to help her and the next ten minutes brought in moss and worked at the inside of the nest at eleven clock both of them ﬂew off either little recreation or their dinners and were away till little after one from this time till four clock both worked industriously bringing in ﬁne moss then during another hour the brought in feather three times so that day came to an end the next morning june 1st they did not begin their work early was evident to weir because having placed slender at the entrance there it remained till eight clock when the two began to work the day before with ﬁne moss the leaving off however every now and then to express his satisfaction on near again this day they went off either dinner or amusement then came back and worked another hour bringing in ﬁne moss and feathers the next morning the little seemed in regular ecstasy and sang incessantly till nine when they both brought in moss and feathers working on about two hours and again they went off remaining away an hour later than usual their work was now nearly over and they seemed to be taking their leisure when all at once the bird who was sitting in her nest and looking out at her door espied man by an arbor vitæ it was other than her good friend but that she did not know all men were terrible enemies to her race and at once she set up her cry of alarm the on hearing this appeared in great state of agitation and though the frightfu l monster immediately ran of f the little creatures pursued him scolding vehemently the next day they worked again with feathers and ﬁne moss and again went off after having brought in few more feathers so they did the next ﬁve days working leisurely and latterly only with feathers on the tenth day the nest was ﬁnished and the little mother laid her ﬁrst egg in where is the boy let him be ruthless he may who could have the heart to take wren s nest only to tear it to pieces after reading the history of this patient labour of love the wren like various other small birds can not bear that their nests or eggs should be touched they are always disturbed and distressed by it and sometimes even will desert their nest and eggs in consequence on one occasion therefore this good friend of every bird that builds carefully put his ﬁnger into wren s nest during the mother s absence to ascertain whether the young were hatched on her return perceiving that the entrance had been touched she set up doleful lamentation carefully rounded it again with her breast and wings so to bring everything into proper order after which 12 13 14 birds and their nests by mary project gutenberg ebook https and her mate attended to their young these particular young ones only six in number were fed by their parents 278 times in the course of day this was small and if there had been twelve or even sixteen is often the case what an amount of labour and care the birds must have had but they would have been equal to it and merry all the time all these little creatures which so lightly we regard they love to their duty and they never think it hard birds and their nests by mary project gutenberg ebook https ii the goldfinch the goldﬁnch which is cousin to the linnet is wonderfully clever and docile i shall show you presently in the ﬁrst place however let say word or two about bird cleverness in general which i copy from jules michelet s interesting work the speaking of the great cruel and rapacious family of the raptor es or birds of prey he expresses satisfaction in the idea that this race of destroyers is decreasing and that there may come time when they longer exist on the earth he has admiration them though they may be the swiftest of the swift and the strongest of the strong because they put forth none of the higher qualities of courage address or patient endurance in taking their prey which are all weak and powerless in comparison with themselves their poor unoffending victims all these cruel tyrants of the air he says like the serpe nts have ﬂattened skulls which show the want of intellect and intelligence these birds of prey with their small brains offer striking contrast to the amiable and intelligent species which we ﬁnd amongst the smaller birds the head of the former is only beak that of the latter is afterwards to prove this more strongly he gives table to show the proportion of brain to the size of the body in these different species of birds thus the chafﬁnch the sparrow and the goldﬁnch have more than six times much brain the eagle in proportion to the size of the body we may look therefore less than six times his intelligence and docile ability whilst in the case of the little tomtit it is thirteen times much but now the goldﬁnch of which our is both faithful and shows us pair evidently contemplating with much satisfaction the nest which they have just ﬁnished on one of the topmost boughs of blossomy this nest is wonderful little fabric built of moss dry grass and slender roots lined with hair wool and but the true wonder of the nest is the exact manner in which the outside is made to imitate the bough upon which it is placed all its little ruggednesses and lichen growths are represented whilst the colouring is so exactly that of the old that it is almost impossible to know it from the branch itself wonderful ingenuity of instinct which human skill would ﬁnd it almost impossible to imitate the bird lays mostly ﬁve eggs which are of spotted with or brown and sometimes with dark streak or two the goldﬁnch is one of the most beautiful of our english birds with its scarlet forehead and quaint little black cap brought down over its white cheeks its back is cinnamon brown and its breast white its wings are beautifully varied in black and white are also its tail feathers in the midland counties it is known the proud tailor probably because its attire looks so bright and fresh and it has lively air if conscious of being well dressed 15 16 birds and their nests by mary project gutenberg ebook https life of this bird goldfinches and nest page

the plenty that surrounds them in the ripened down and all such winged seeds are then ﬂoating in the air how often have i said it is worth while to go out into the woods and ﬁelds and bringing yourself into state of quietness watch the little birds in their life s employment building their nests feeding their young or pursuing their innocent diversions so now on this pleasant still autumn afternoon if you will go into the old pasture ﬁelds where the thistles have not been stubbed up generations or on the margin of the old lane where ragwort and groundsel and burdock ﬂourish abundantly let us the author of british birds says stand still to observe ﬂock of goldﬁnches they ﬂutter over the plants cling to the stalks bend in various attitudes disperse the down already dry and winged like themselves ﬂight pick them out one by one and swallow them then comes stray cow followed by herd boy at once the birds cease their labour pause moment and ﬂy off in succession you observe how lightly and buoyantly they cleave the air each ﬂuttering its little wings descending in curved line mounting again and speeding along anon they alight in little thicket of dried weeds and in settlin g display to the delighted eye the beautiful tints of their plumage with ﬂuttering wings and 17 birds and their nests by mary project gutenberg ebook https goldﬁnch introduced into tail they hover moment to select landing place amid the prickly points of the stout thistles whose heads are now bursting with the song of the goldﬁnch which begins about the end of march is very sweet unassuming and to that of the linnet but singularly varied and pleasant now however we must give few instances of this bird s teachable sagacity which indeed are so numerous that it is difﬁcult to make selection syme in his british song birds says the goldﬁnch is easily tamed and taught and its capacity learning the notes of other birds is well known few years ago the sieur roman exhibited number of trained birds they were goldﬁnches linnets and canaries one appeared dead and was held up by the tail or claw without exhib iting any signs of life second stood on its head with its claws in the air third imitated dutch milkmaid going to market with pails on its shoulders fourth mimicked venetian girl looking out at window ﬁfth appeared soldier and mounted guard sentinel whilst sixth acted cannonier with cap on its head ﬁrelock on its shoulder and match in its claw and dischar ged small cannon the same bird also acted if it had been wounded it was wheeled in barro w if to convey it to the hospital after which it ﬂew away before the whole company the seventh turned kind of windmill and the last bird stood in the midst of some ﬁreworks which were dischar ged all round it and this without showing the least sign of fear others i have said may be taught to draw up their food and water from well in little buckets all this is very wonderful and shows great docility in the bird but i can not greatly admire it from the secret fear that cruelty or harshness may have been used to teach them these arts so contrary to their nature at all events it proves what teachable and clever little creatures they are how readily they may be made to understand the will of their master and how obediently and faithfully they act according to it man however should always stand human providence to the animal world in him the creatures should ever ﬁnd their friend and protector and were it so we should then see many an astonishing faculty displa yed and birds would then instead of being the most timid of animals gladden and beautify our daily life by their sweet songs their affectionate regard and their amusing and imitative little arts the early italian and german painters introduce goldﬁnch into their beautiful sacred y on the at the feet of some martyred saint or angel perhaps from an old legend of the bird s sympathy with the suffering saviour or from an intuitive sense that the divine spirit of christianity extends to bird and beast well to man 18 19 birds and their nests by mary project gutenberg ebook https iii the song thrush we have here charming picture of one of the ﬁnest and noblest of our thrush throstle or mavis the trees are yet leaﬂess but the bird is in the act of building whilst her mate on the pours forth his exquisite melody the almost completed nest like richly ornamented bowl is before us this bird belongs to grandly musical family being own cousin to the and the blackbird each one having kindred song but all at the same time distinctly characteristic the colouring of the thrush is soft and very pleasing the upper parts of brown the chin white the under part of the body grayish white the throat breast and sides of the neck yellowish thickly spotted with dark brown song thrush and nest page the thrush remains with us the whole year and may occasionally be heard singing even in the winter though april may and june are the months when he is in fullest song they pair in march and by the end of that month or early in april begin to build they 20 birds and their nests by mary project gutenberg ebook https day was several broods in the year the nest which we see is commodious is placed at great height from the ground in thick bush or hedge and sometimes also in rough bank amongst bushes and under growth they are particularly fond of plantations building on one of the low spreading branches close to the stem though the structure is so solid and substantial yet it is built very rapidly indeed the thrush seems to be wide awake in all its movements he is loiterer and does his work well proof of his expedition i will mention that pair of these birds began to build second perhaps indeed it might be third nest on thursday june 15 on friday afternoon the nest was ﬁnished and on saturday morning the ﬁrst egg was laid though the interior plastering was not then dry on the 21st the hen began to sit and on the 17th of july the young birds were hatched the so to speak of the nest is composed of twigs roots grasses and moss the two latter being brought to the outsid inside it is lined with thin plastering of mud and rotten wood which is laid on quite smoothly almost like the glaze on earthenware nor is there an internal covering between this and the eggs the circular form of the nest is perfect bowl shaped upon lathe and often contracts inwards at the top the eggs which are generally ﬁve in number are of bright spotted over with these spots being more numerous at the lar ger end the food of the thrush is mostly of an animal character worms slugs and snails and by seasides small molluscs whelks and periwinkles on all such are enclosed in shells he exercises his ingenuity in remarkable way we ourselves lived at one time in an old house standing in an old garden where were many ancient trees and in the old ivied roots and walls of which congregated great quantities of one portion of this garden which enclosed an old disused dairy was great resort of thrushes where they had so to speak their stones of sacriﬁce around which lay heaps of the broken shells of snails their victims i have repeatedly watched them at work hither they brought their snails and taking their stand by the stone with the snail in their beak struck it repeatedly against the stone till the shell being smashed they picked it out easily the oyster is taken from its opened shell this may seem easy work with the slender snail but the labour is considerably greater with hard on this subject the intelligent author of british birds says that many years ago when in the isle of harris he frequently heard sharp sound of one small stone being struck upon another the cause of which he considerable time sought in vain at length one day being in search of birds when the tide was out he heard the click and saw bird standing between two ﬂat stones moving its head and body alternate ly up and down each downward motion being accompanied by the sound which had hitherto been so mysterious running up to the spot he found thrush which ﬂying off left whelk lying amongst fragments of shells lying around the stone thrushes are remarkably clean and neat with regard to their nests suffering litter or impurity to lie about and in this way are great example to many untidy people their domestic character too is excellent the now and then taking the place of the hen on the eggs and when not doing so feeding her she sits when the young are hatched the parents may be seen by those who will watch them silently and patiently frequently stretching out the wings of the young if to exercise them and pruning and trimm ing their feathers to put their love of cleanliness to the proof gentleman great friend of all birds had some sticky mud rubbed upon the backs of two of the young ones whilst the parents were absent on their return either by their own keen sense of propriety or perhaps the complaint of the young ones they saw what had happened and were not only greatly disconcerted but very angry and instantly set to work to clean the little unfortunates which strange to say they managed to by making use of dry earth which they brought to the nest that purpose human intellect could not have suggested better mode this same gentleman determined to spend whole day in discovering how the thrushes spent it hiding himself therefore in little hut of ﬁr boughs he began his observations in the early morning of the 8th of june at two clock the birds 21 22 23 birds and their nests by mary project gutenberg ebook https s verses on the to feed their brood and in two hours had fed them times it was now ﬁve the little birds were all wide awake and one of them whilst pruning its feathers lost its balance and fell out of the nest to the ground on this the old ones set up the most doleful lamentations and the gentleman coming out of his retreat put the little one back into the nest this kind action however wholly disconcerted the parents nor did they again venture to feed their young till an artiﬁce of the gentleman led them to suppose that he was gone from their neighbourhood other event happened to them through the day and by nine clock at night when all went to rest the young ones had been fed two hundred and six times thrushes however become occasionall y so extremely tame that the female will remain upon her eggs and feed her young without any symptom of alarm in the close neighbourhood of man of this i will give an instance from bishop stanley s history of birds short time ago in scotland some carpenters working in shed adjacent to the house observed thrush ﬂying in and out which induced them to direct their attention to the cause when to their surprise they found nest commenced amongst the teeth of harrow which with other farming tools and implements was placed upon the joists of the shed just over their heads the carpenters had arrived soon after six cloc k and at seven when they found the nest it was in great state of forwardness and had evidently been the morning s work of pair of these indefatigable birds their activity throughout the day was incessant and when the workmen came the next morning they found the female seated in her mansion and when she ﬂew off short time it was found that she had laid an egg when all was ﬁnished the took his share of the labour and in thirteen days the young birds were out of their shells the refuse of which the old ones carried away from the spot all this seems to have been carefully observed by the workmen and it is much to their credit that they were so quiet and friendly to win the conﬁdence of the the song of the thrush is remarkable its rich mellow intonation and the great variety of its notes unfortunately the thrush its exquisite power songster makes it by means an unusual prisoner you are often startled by hearing from the doleful upper window of some dreary court or alley of london or some other large town an outpouring of joyous melody from an imprisoned thrush which perfect it is saddens you being so wholly out of place yet who can say how the song of that bird may speak to the soul of many risoned passer wordsworth thus touchingly describes an incident of this kind at the corner of wood street when daylight appears hangs thrush that sings loud it has sung three years poor susan has passed by the spot and has heard in the silence of morning the song of the bird green pastures she views in the midst of the dale down which she so often has tripped with her pail and single small

distinguishing colour till his second year the female is of colour sometimes the singular variety of white blackbird occurs which seems to astonish even its fellow birds the same phenomenon also occurs amongst sparrows fatal distinction to the poor birds who are in consequence very soon shot this bird is one of our ﬁnest singers his notes are solemn and ﬂowing unlike those of the thrush which are short quick and extremely varied the one bird is more lyrical the other sings in grand epic strain friend of ours deeply versed in maintains that the blackbird is oratorical and sings if delivering an eloquent rhythmical oration this bird begins to sing early in the year and continues his song during the whole time that the hen is sitting like his relatives the thrush and the he takes his post on the highest branch of tree near his nest so that his song is heard far and wide and in fact through the whole pleasant spring you hear the voices of these three feathered kings of english song constantly ﬁllin g the woods and ﬁelds with their melody the blackbird sings deliciously in rain even during thunderstorm with the lightning ﬂashing round him indeed both he and the thrush seem to take great delight in summer showers the blackbird has peculiar call to give notice to his brood of the approach of danger probably however it belongs both to male and female again there is third note very peculiar also heard only in the dusk of evening and which seems pleasingly in harmony with the approaching shadows of night by this note they call each other to roost in the same way partridges call each other to assemble at night however far they may be asunder the nest of the blackbird is situated variously most frequently in the thicker parts of hedges sometimes in the hollow of stump or amongst the curled and twisted roots of old trees which projecting from the banks of woods or woodland lanes wreathed with their trails of ivy afford the most picture sque little hollows the purpose again it may be found under the roof of or laid on the and very frequently in copses in the stumps of pollard trees partly concealed by their branches and is often begun before the leaves are on the trees the nest is composed of dry bents and lined with ﬁne dry grass the hen generally lays ﬁve eggs which are of dusky thickly covered with black spots altogether very much resembling those of crows rooks magpies and that class of birds universal favourite the blackbird deservedly is yet in common with the thrush all gardeners are their enemies from the great liking they have his fruit especially currants raspberries and cherries there is however something very amusing though at the same time annoying in the sly way by which they approach these fruits quite aware that they are on mischievous errand they steal along ﬂying low and silentl y and if observed will hide themselves in the nearest growth of garden plants scarlet runners or jerusalem artichokes where they remain still mice till they think the human enemy has moved off if however instead of letting them skulk quietly in their he drives them away they ﬂy off with curious note very like little chuckling laugh of deﬁance if they would say ha ha we shall soon be back again which they very soon are but we must not begrudge them their share though they neither have dug the ground nor sowed the seed very dull and joyless indeed would be the garden and the gardener s toil and the whole country in short if there were blackbirds and to gladden our hearts and make the gardens well the woods and ﬁelds joyous with

though naturally unsocial and keeping much to itself is very bold in defence of its young should they be in danger or attacked by any of the numerous enemies which abound everywhere especially to those which are in immediate association with man the rev wood tells us instance that on one occasion prowling cat was forced to make an ignominious retreat before the united onset of pair of blackbirds on whose young she was about to make an attack let now in conclusion give day with family of blackbirds which i somewhat curtail from macgillivray on saturday morning june 10th i went into little hut made of green branches at two in the morning to see how the blackbirds spend the day at home they lived close by in hole in an old wall which one or other of them had occupied number of years at quarter three they began to feed their young which were four in number she was the most industrious in doing so and when he was not feeding he was singing most deliciously towards seven clock the father induced one of the young ones to ﬂy out after him but this was little mistake and the bird falling i was obliged to help it into its nest again which made little family commotion they were exceedingly tidy about their nest and when little rubbish fell out they instantly carried it away at ten clock the feeding began again vigor ously and continued till two both supplying their young almost equally the hut in which i sat was very closely covered but little wren having alighted on the ground in pursuit of ﬂy and seeing one of my legs moving set up cry of alarm on which in the course of few seconds all the birds in the neighbourhood collected to know what was the matter the blackbird hopped round the hut again and again making every effort to peep in even alighting on the top within few inches of my head but not being able to make any discovery the tumult subsided it was probably considered false alarm and the blackbirds went on feeding their young till almost four clock and now came the great event of the day at about three the mother brought large worm four inches in length probably which she gave to one of the young ones and ﬂew away shortly afterwards returning she had the horror of perceiving that the worm instead of being swallowed was sticking in its throat on this she uttered perfect moan of distress which immediately brought the who also saw at glance what terrible catastrophe was to be feared both parents made several efforts to push the worm down the throat but to purpose when strange to say the father discovered the cause of the accident the outer end of the worm had got entangled in the feathers of the breast and being held fast could not be swallowed he carefully disengaged it and holding it up with his beak the poor little thing with great effort managed to get it down but was by this time so exhausted that it lay with its eyes shut and without moving the next three hours the male bird in the meantime took his stand upon tree few yards from the nest and poured forth some of his most enchanting song of rejoicing doubt the narrow escape from death of one of his family from four till seven clock both birds again fed their young after which the male bird left these family duties to his mate and gave himself up to incessant singing at twenty minutes to nine their labours ceased they having then fed their young one hundred and thirteen times during the day i observed that before feeding their young they always alighted upon tree and looked round them few seconds sometimes they brought in quantity of worms and fed their brood alternately at other times they brought one which they gave to only one of them the young birds often trimmed their feathers and stretched out their wings they also appeared to sleep

this nest is extremely soft and elastic sometimes of large size the reason which one can not understand it is generally near to the water and being kept damp by its situation is always so fresh

song in the stillness of summer s night am ready to say with good old izaak walton the nightingale another of my airy creatures breathes such sweet music out of her little instrumental throat that it might make mankind to think that miracles had not ceased he that at midnight when the weary labourer sleeps securely should hear i have very often heard the clear airs the sweet descants the natural

unpretending nest not built up aloft on the tree branch but humbly at the tree s root or even on the very ground itself may teach us that the world s external show or costliness is not true greatness the world s best might have been big an eagle attired in colours of blue and scarlet and orange like the grandest macaw but the great creator willed that it should not be strength and his furiousnes s and his cruel capacity were sufﬁcient the eagle and his shining vestments the macaw whilst the bird to which was given the divinest gift of song must be humble and unobtrusive small of size with surpassing beauty of plumage and loving best to hide itself in the thick seclusion of the copse in which broods the little mother the very counterpart of himself upon her coloured eggs harrison weir

traversed night after night by rich and poor learne d and unlearned to listen to the bird in our own neighbourhood we have with its thickety copses on either hand its young oaks and spanish chestnuts

the same song the following spring the want is again in his heart he can not believe but that she will still come the cruel therefore try all their arts to take him in this early stage of his visit to us should he be taken later when he is mated and we see him in our picture with all the wealth of his little life around him he can not sing long how should narrow cage and dingy street of london or some other great with his eyes put his cruel captor fancies he sings best if blind he may sing perhaps while thinking that he can wake himself out of this dreadful dream of captivity darkness and solitude but it is dream the terrible reality at length comes upon him and before the summer is over he dies of broken heart it is curious fact that the nightingale conﬁnes itself without apparent reason to certain countries and to certain parts of england instance though it visits sweden and even the temperate parts of russia it is not met with in scotland north wales nor ireland neither is it found in any of our northern counties excepting yorkshire and there only in the neighbourhood of doncaster neither is it known in the counties cornwall and devonshire it is suppos ed to migrate during the winter into egypt and syria it has been seen amongst the willo ws of jordan and the olive trees of judea but we have not to our knowledge any direct mention of it in the scriptures though solomon

of the neck spotted with brown the breast and under part of the body white its feet are peculiar being furnished with an extraordinarily long hind claw the purpose of which has puzzled many naturalists but whatever nature intended it the bird has been known to make use of it purpose which can not fail to interest us and call forth our admiration this shall be presently explained the nest is built on the ground either between two clods of earth in the deep of cattle or some other small hollow suitable the purpose and is composed of dry grass hair and leaves the hair is mostly used the lining here the mother lays four or ﬁve eggs of pale sepia colour with spots and markings of darker hue she has generally two broods in the year and commences sitting in may the begins to sing early in the spring bewick says he rises from the neighbourhood of the nest almost perpendicularly in the air by successive springs and hovers at vast height his descent on the contrary is in an oblique direction unless he is threatened by birds of prey or attracted by his mate and on these occasions he drops like 44 birds and their nests by mary project gutenberg ebook https solicitude its young skylarks and nest page with regard to his ascent i must however add that it is in spiral direction and that what bewick represents springs are his sudden spiral ﬂights after pausing to sing another peculiarity must be mentioned all his bones are hollow and he can inﬂate them with air from his lungs so that he becomes it were little balloon which accounts the buoyancy with which he ascends and the length of time he can support himself in the air often an hour at time still more extraordinary is the wonderful power and reach of his voice while probably the seven hundred or thousand voices of the grand chorus of an oratorio would fail to ﬁll the vast spaces of the atmosphere it can be done by this glorious little songster which mounting upwards makes itself heard without effort when it can be seen longer the attachment of the parents to their young is very great and has been seen to exhibit itself in remarkable manner the nest being placed on the pasture or in ﬁeld of mowing is very liable to be disturbed many therefore are the instances of the bird s tender solicitude either the young or its eggs one of which i will give from jesse in case of alarm he says either by cattle grazing near the nest or by the approach of the mower the remove their eggs by means of their long claws to place of greater security and this i have observed to be affected in very short space of he says that when one of his mowers ﬁrst told him of this fact he 45 birds and their nests by mary project gutenberg ebook https scarcely believe it but that he afterwards saw it himself and that he regarded it only another proof of the affection which these birds show their offspring instances are also on record of larks removing their young by carrying them on their backs in one case the young were thus removed from place of danger into ﬁeld of standing corn but however successful the poor birds may be in removing their eggs they are not always so with regard to their young yarrell relates an instance came under his notice in which the little ﬂedgeling proved too heavy the parent to carry and being dropped from an height of about thirty feet was killed in the fall of all captive birds none grieves more than the skylark its impulse is to soar which is impossible in the narrow spaces of cage and in this unhappy condition when seized by the impulse of song he ﬂings himself upwards and is dashed down again by its cruel barriers this reason the top of the lark s cage is always bedded with green baize to prevent his injuring himself in the freedom of nature he is the joyous minstrel of liberty and love carrying upwards and sending down from above his buoyant song which seems to fall down through the golden sunshine like ﬂood of sparkling melody i am not aware of the height to which the lark soars but it must be very great he becomes diminished to mere speck almost invisible in the blaze of light yet high he may soar he never loses the consciousness of the little mate and the nestlings below but their ﬁrst cry of danger or anxiety though the cry may be scarce audible to the human ear thrills up aloft to the singer and he comes down with direct ﬂight whilst otherwise his descent is more leisurely and said by some to be in the direct spiral line of his ascent larks unfortunately themselves are considered very ﬁne eating immense numbers of them are killed the table not only on the continent but in england people cry shame on the roman epicure lucullus dining on stew of nightingales tongue nearly two thousand years ago and more can i reconcile to myself the daily feasting on these lovely little songsters which may be delicate eating but are less god s gifts to gladden and beautify the earth 46 birds and their nests by mary project gutenberg ebook https viii

attracted by their chirping ﬂuttered round the children till they reached home when the nest was carried up stairs and placed in the the old birds soon approached the nest and fed the young this being observed the nest was afterwards placed on table in the middle of the room the window being left open when the parents came in and fed their young before still farther to try their attachment the nest was then placed in cage but still the old birds returned with food and towards evening actually perched on the cage regardless of the noise made by several children so it went on several days when unfortunately the cage having been set outside the window was exposed to violent shower of rain and the little brood was drowned in the nest the poor birds continued hovering round the house and

naturalist family of gallator es or waders all of which are furnished with strong legs and feet walking whilst all which inhabit watery places or feed their young amongst the waves have legs

now ascending to great height on untiring wing then down again running along the ground and leaping about from spot to spot if very amusement it is however with all its agility very untidy in fact it

much like the ground itself so like little bits of moorland earth or old stone that it is difﬁcult to distinguish them but in proportion the bird makes so insufﬁcient and unguarded nest so all the greater is the anxiety both of herself and her mate about the eggs hence whilst she is sitting he exercises all kinds of little arts to entice away every intruder from the nest wheeling round and

he says two of these birds were given to carlisle and placed in his garden where one soon died the other continued to pick up such food the place afforded till winter deprived it of its usual supply

the evening and night with his two associates sitting close to them and partaking of the comforts of warm ﬁreside soon spring appeared he betook himself to the garden but again at the approach of winter had recourse to his old shelter and his old friends who received him very cordially but his being favoured by them did not prevent his taking great liberties with them he would frequently amuse

men and women boys and girls had only their persevering spirit and their courage under adversity there would not be so much unsuccess either at school or in life is now too often the case some people are very fond of having martins about their houses under their eaves and even in the corners of their windows the earl of traquair was one of these he was indeed great lover of all kinds of birds and all were protect ed on his premises in the autumn of 1839 there were less than one hundred and three martins nests on traquair is very ﬁne old several which had been deserted injured or taken possession of by sparrows which is very unwarrantable liberty taken by these birds from six to twenty days are required to build martin s nest if all goes on well it may be ﬁnished in the shorter time let us now see how the birds set about building here are several nests in our picture and turning to the pages of macgillivray s british birds i shall ﬁnd exactly the information we need i will therefore extract freely from this interesting writer that my young readers may be grateful to him i am myself again turning to our picture we ﬁnd four nests party of eight martins arrived here on the 1st of may this was quite new location they spent the whole day in examining the eaves of the house the corners of the windows and the by the following morning the question was settled and they had you see ﬁxed upon high wall with slate coping and an eastern aspect and at once commenced making general foundation their nests suitable materials are procured from the banks of an adjoining pond or puddle in the lane let us go down and see them here they come sailing placidly over the now they descend so almost to sweep the surface of the pond some of them alight at once others skim round if borne away by brisk wind those that have alighted walk about with short steps looking round materials some seem not to ﬁnd the mud suitable but seize on piece of straw or grass which tempering in the mud they then ﬂy off with returning now to the building we see one using its tail planted against the wall or against the nest if sufﬁciently advanced support deposit the material it has brought by giving its head wriggling motion so that the mud slides gently into the crevices of yesterday s work then he retouches the whole see one has now arrived with his supply before the other has ﬁnished he is impatient to disburden himself and wants to drive off the worker who rather snappishly retorts and he poor fellow goes off while with the mud sticking to his bill now she has ﬁnished there is room him and he goes back again and works hard in his turn they never alight on the nest without twittering at noon if the weather be hot they betake themselves to the ﬁelds or after dip in the pond sun themselves on the or so then they will hawk about food and after awhile one of them may perhaps return and give another touch or two to the work or seat herself in the nest to consolidate the materials but if cold wet or windy they keep away what they with themselves i know not but soon it clears up they are at work again at the beginning of their building they seem to have objection to leave it whole day but it advances they become more interested or anxious and one or both will sit in it all night even though the weather be so much the building of these four nests of our picture

of thunder rain almost the entire nest was wash ed to the ground together with the young birds which it contained short time before the catastrophe the old birds were observed hovering about and expressing great uneasiness almost immediately after it happened they left the place but returned the following day and spent it in ﬂying about and examining the angle of the wall next morning they commenced repairing the nest in three days they had made great progress but again rain fell and their work was stayed on the 30th they advanced rapidly and both remained sitting on the nest all night the next day it was ﬁnished and now they began to rejoice they twittered all the evening till it was dark now and then pruning each other s heads seated side by side they prepared to spend the dark hours in the nest eggs were soon laid again but sad to say on the morning of the 18th of july again during great storm of wind and rain the upper wall fell carrying with it one of the eggs the old birds again ﬂuttered about uttering the most plaintive cries and early the next morning began to repair the damage though it rained heavily all day part of the lining hanging over the side was incorporated with the new layers of mud the urgency of the case was such that they were obliged to work during the bad weather throughout the day one bird sat on the nest whilst the other laboured assiduously kindly was he welcomed by his mate who sometimes during his absence nibbled and retou ched the materials which he had just deposited in few days it was ﬁnished the weather became settled the young were hatched and all went well with them sometimes when the nests are destroyed the birds instead of attempting to repair the damage forsake the neighbourhood if wholly disheartened nothing can be more distressing to them than to lose their young in the storm of which i have just spoken another martin s nest was washed down with unﬂedged young in it these were placed on some cotton wool in basket covered with sheet of brown paper in an open window facing the wall during that day and the following the parents took notice of them and their kind human protector fed them with that evening he tried an experiment he gently placed the young ones in nest of that same window where were other young it was then about eight clock in the evening the rain was fallin g heavily and sound was heard save the cheep cheep of the young birds and the dashing of the storm against the minute elapsed when forth rushed the parents shrieking their alarm notes and again and again wheeled up to the nest until at last they drifted away in the storm he watched them till they disappeared about during all this time they only twice summoned courage to look into the nest next morning i was rejoiced to see them attending assiduously to the young and now turning again to our group of four nests on the walls supposing it be the month of july every one of them with its ﬂedgeling brood sitting with gaping mouths ever ready food you may perhaps like to know how many meals are carried up to them in the course of the day if then the parents began to feed them at about ﬁve in the morning and left little before eight at night they would feed them at the lowest calculation about thousand times with all this feeding and the young ones the summer goes on are ﬂedged and have grown so plump and large that the nest is quite too small them therefore they must turn out into the world and begin life themselves it is now ﬁne brisk august morning and at about eight clock you can see if you look up at the nests how the old birds come dashing up to them quite in an excited way making short curves in the air and repeating note which says plain bird can speak this is the day you must

great event in you may well believe let us therefore now direct our attention to one nest in particular in which are only two young very small family but what happens here is occurring all round us one of these little ones balances itself at the entrance looking timidly into the void and having considered the risk awhile allows its fellow to take its place during all this time the parents keep driving about within few feet of the entrance and endeavour by many winning gestures to induce their charge to follow them the second bird also after sitting some time if distrustful of its powers retires and the ﬁrst again appears opening and shutting his wings and often half inclined again to retire he at length summons up all his resolution springs from the nest and with his pinions cleaves the air he and his parents who are in ecstasies return to the nest and the second young one presently musters courage and joins them and now begins day of real enjoyment they sport chieﬂy about the till seven in the evening when all the nest in several instances i have seen the neighbours add their inducements to those of the parents when the young were too timid to leave their home if the happy day prove ﬁne they seldom return to the nest till sunset if otherwise they will come back two or three times on one occasion when the young were ready to ﬂy but unwilling to take the ﬁrst leap the parents had recourse to little stratagem both ingenious and natural the bird held out ﬂy at about four inches from the entrance to the nest in attempting to take hold of it they again and again nearly lost their balance on another occasion the mother bird trying this plan to purpose seemed to lose patience and seizing one of them by the lower mandible with the claw of her right foot whilst it was gaping food tried to pull it out of the nest to which however it clung like squirrel but the young every one of them ﬂy in time and right joyous holiday they all have together so the summer comes to an end and towards the middle of september the great family cares being over and the young having attained to an age capable of undertaking the fatigues of migration that mysterious impulse strong life itself and probably affecting them like some necessity to exchange one country and climate upon them under this inﬂuence they congregate together in immense numbers every neighbourhood seeming to have its place of roofs of lofty buildings or the leaﬂess boughs of old trees here they meet not only to discuss the great undertaking but to have right merry time time of luxurious idleness lively chatterings singing in chorus their everlasting and musical cheep cheep eating and drinking and making ready the journey before them at length the moment of departure is come and at given signal the whole party rises twittering and singing and bidding long farewell to the scenes of their summer life they ﬂy off in body perhaps if coming from scotland or the north of england to rest yet few weeks

day of so many successive months almost wholly on the wing the swallow frequently suffers great fatigue and exhaustion in its long migration sometimes probably driven out of its course by adverse winds it is known to alight by hundreds on the rigging of vessels when worn out by hunger and fatigue it is too often shot or cruelly treated nevertheless the swallow protected by him who cares the sparrow generally braves the hardships of migration and the following spring guided by the same mysterious instinct ﬁnds his way across continents and seas to his old home where identiﬁed by some

says also that little f which had been caught and tamed was accustomed to dash to the ceiling of the room in which it was kept and to snatch thence the ﬂies which settled on the white surface my husband writing of this bird says gilbert white gave i believe the name of f to this little bird from its note in the midland counties it is called the from the same cause and indeed this name is to my ear more accordant with its continuous ditty its cheery little voice is one of the pleasantest recognitions of returning spring it is sure to be heard just in former years in the copse the dell the belt of trees bordering wayside we catch its simple note with pleasure it brings with it many memory of happy scenes and days gone by we see the little creature hopping along the boughs of the yet only budding oak and know that it is usefully employed man agreeably itself it tells us in effect that sunny days ﬂowers and sweet airs and the music of thousand other birds are coming we revert to the time when tracing the or the bosky dingle in boyhood we caught sight of its rounded nest amongst the screening twigs of the low bush and the bleached bents of last year s grapes we remember the pleasure with which we examined its little circular entrance and discovered in its downy interior its store of delicate eggs or the living mass of feathery inmates with their heads ranged side by side and one behind another with their twinkling eyes and mouths many time we have heard the ever blithe note of it stuck to its unambitious part of the obscure woodland glade we have wished that we could

the quill feathers of the wing are dusky edged with pale green are also the tail feathers thus attired by nature that is by the great creator who cares all his creatures this little bird creeping and ﬂuttering about the branches and bole of the leafy summer tree can scarcely be distinguished from the tree itself hence it is that the bird is so unfamiliar to most people the however has little distinguishing glory of his crest of feathers bordered on each side with black like sort of to his bright hazel eyes this crest which gives him his distinguished name can be erected at pleasure when he is full of life and enjoyment or when he chooses to lord it over birds ten times big himself it is worth anybody s while who has love the innocent denizens of nature and desire to them harm to go into wood on summer s day on purpose to watch the doings of this lively little bird amongst the es are the best this purpose this bird has an especial liking these trees and ten to one if you will only be patient and quite still you may soon see him at work busily looking after his dinner running along the branches up one and down another then like little arrow off to the next tree scudding along its branches then back again up and down round and round the bole going like little ﬁre so rapid are his movements now running up aloft now hanging head downward now off again in another direction what wonderful activity there is in that little body he must devour hundreds of insects well their eggs which he thus seeks under the scaly roughnesses of the bark and ﬁnding devours pretty he is his nest of which harrison weir has given most accurate drawing is quite worthy of him it is always the same swung like little hammock from branch and always hidden it may be by leaves or bunch of the cordage by which it is suspended is of his own weaving and is made of the same materials the nest which are moss and slender roots in form it is oval you see with hole entrance at the side and is lined with the softest down and ﬁbrous roots it is lovely little structure like soft ball of moss within which the mother lays from six to dozen tiny eggs scarcely bigger than peas the delicate shell of which will hardly bear handling the colour of the egg is white sprinkled over with the smallest of coloured spots jesse describes one of these lovely nests which was taken from the slender branches of where it had been suspended usual by means of delicate cordage secured to the branch by being twisted round and round and then fastened to the edge or rim of the nest so that one may be sure that the making and securing of these tiny ropes must be the ﬁrst work of the clever little artizan the nest thus suspended sways lightly to and fro with the movement of the bird we can not see in our cut the slender ropes that suspend it they are concealed under the thick foliage but we can easily see what dainty little structure it is delicate and lovely is this bird and pleasing and harmless is his life he yet possesses some curious traits of character i said instance though so small with body only an inch long he has apparently wonderful conceit of himself and loves to be lord and master of creatures that will not dispute with him not worth their while or perhaps because there really is some inherent mastership in him by which he contrives under certain circumstances to rule over them in proof of this i will tell you what the rev wood relates from the experience of lady friend of his one severe winter when she had housed and fed numb er of birds amongst which were jackdaw magpie two skylarks goldﬁnch and robin in warm aviary feeding them regularly and abundantly other birds came of course to partake of the plentiful feast and amongst them two wrens these little things made themselves not only quite at home but lorded it over the other birds in the most extraordinary way possible instance if the jackdaw had possessed himself of nice morsel which he was holding down with his foot to eat comfortably and the wren had also set his mind 71 72 73 birds and their nests by mary project gutenberg ebook https it he hopped on the jackdaw s head and pecked in his eye on the side where his foot held the delicacy on this the poor jackdaw instantly lifted his foot to his head where he thought something was amiss and the mischievous little fellow snatched up the treasure and was off at ﬁrst the jackdaw would pursue him in great wrath but he soon learned that it was use the creature would only jump upon his back where he could not reach him and so was safe from punishment before the winter was over continues the lady the little were masters of all the birds and even roosted at night on their backs ﬁnding doubt that in this way they could keep their little feet much warmer than on conceited and dominant however these little birds may be they are yet either extremely timid or their nervous system is so delicately constituted that sudden fright kills them thus if when they are all alert and busy on the seeking insects and fearing evil the branch be suddenly struck with stick the poor bird falls dead to the ground the shock has killed it it has received apparent feather is its joyous innoc ent life is gone ever this fact is asserted by gilbert white and was proved by my husband who brought home the bird which had thus died 74 birds and

spotted all over with grey and brown proof of the conﬁding nature of this bird i must mention that occasionally it builds in most unimaginable places directly under the human instance pair of them last summer says jesse built their nest in hollow under sleeper of the brighton railway near the terminus at that place trains at all times of the day were passing close to the nest but in this situation the young were hatched and macgilliv ray also mentions that pair of these birds built their nest in an old wall near quarry within few yards of four men who worked most part of the day in getting the stone which they occasionally blasted the laid four eggs and reared her brood she and her mate becoming so familiar with the men to ﬂy in and out without showing the least sign of fear but if stranger approached they would immediately ﬂy off nor return till they saw him clear off from the place another nest was built beneath wooden platform at where the noisy business of unloading the hutches brought up from the pit was continually going forward but soon the wagtails were quite at home becoming familiar with the colliers and other people connected with the work and ﬂew in and out of their nest without showing the slightest sign of fear again another pair built close to the wheel of lathe in workshop at brass manufactory at taunton amid the incessant din of the braziers yet here the young were hatched and the mother became perfectly familiar with the faces of the workmen but if strange r entered or any one belonging to the factory though not to what might be called her shop she quitted her nest instantly nor would return till they were gone the male however had much less conﬁdence and would not come into the room but brought the usual supplies of food to certain

four weeks after they can ﬂy they defend them with great courage when in danger or endeavour to draw aside the enemy by various little arts they are very attentive also to the cleanliness of their nests and so orderly to have been known to remov light substances such paper or straw which have been placed to mark the regards this proof of their love of order however i would rather suggest that it may be proof of their sagacity and sense of danger they suspected that some human visitor of whose friendly character they were not convinced was intending to look in upon them and they thought it best therefore to decline the honour of his visit the ordinary note of this bird uttered rapidly if alarmed is sort of cheep cheep in the summer morning however it may be heard singing pleasant mellow

it is in the nature of some sticks not to be got into hole by any means he drops it down and fetches another probably to have better result and this may happen several times but jackdaws have perseverance and so with trying and trying again he meets with sticks that are not so and that can be put into holes either by being short enough or held the right way and so the foundation is laid and the easier part of the work goes on merrily the jackdaw is at loss sheets and blankets his children s bed though we can not see them in our picture the clamorous children lying at the very edge of their bed but if we could examine it we should most likely be amused by what we should ﬁnd the jackdaw takes this purpose anything soft that comes can not say to hand to bill in this respect he resembles the sparrow and being like him fond of human society gleans up out of his neighbourhood all that he needs the comfort of his nestlings thus we hear of nest built in the ruins of holyrood chapel in which on its being looked into piece of lace which was supposed to be there it was found also to be lined with part of worsted stocking silk handkerchief child s cap muslin frill and several other things which the busy jackdaw had picked up in various ways it must be borne in mind that he is own cousin to the magpie whose thievish propensities are well known the call of the jackdaw is much quicker and more lively than the rook somewhat resembling the syllable yak variously modulated and repeated somewhat leisurely but at the same time cheerfully its food is similar to that of the rook and going forth at early dawn it may be seen in pastures or ploughed ﬁelds busily searching larvæ worms and insects they walk gracefully with none of the solemn gravity either of the rook or raven and may occasionally be seen running along and sometimes quarrelling amongst themselves like the rook the jackdaw stows away food in its mouth or to feed its young its plumage is black with shining silvery grey behind the head occasionally they are found with streaks or patches of white are also rooks but these are mere sports of nature waterton was of opinion that jackdaws lived in pairs all the year round he had seen them sitting in november on the leaﬂess branches of sycamore side by side pruning each other s heads and apparently full of mutual affection and they mostly left the trees in pairs and so returned he was inclined to think that it was their custom always to remain paired i will now give you his carte visite from macgillivray s british he is remarkably active pert and talkative little fellow ever cheerful always on the alert and ready either business or frolic if not so respectable the grave and sagacious raven he is at least the most agreeable of the

to thrusting himself into gang of rooks i am however of opinion that the rooks make him heartily welcome how we know what amusement they with their stolid gravity and solemn dignity ﬁnd in him with all his fun and loquacity that rooks are really fond of the society of jackdaws is proved by an observation of mudie he says that in the latter part of the season when the rooks from one of the most extensive rookeries in britain made daily excursions of about six miles to the warm groun ds by the and in their ﬂight passed over deep ravine in the sunny side of which were many jackdaws he observed that when the cawing of the rooks in their morning ﬂight 82 83 84 birds and their nests by mary project gutenberg ebook https rev wood s heard at the ravine the jackdaws who had previously been still and quiet instantly raised their shriller notes and ﬂew up to join the rooks both parties clamouring loudly if welcoming each other and that on the return the daws accompanied the rooks little past the ravine if good fellowship then both cawed their farewell the daws returned to their home and the rooks proceeded on their way jackdaws like rooks are said to be excellent weather if they ﬂy back to their roost in the forenoon or early in the afternoon storm may be expected that evening or early in the morning the anecdotes of tame jackdaws are numerous the rev wood speaks of one which had learnt the art of kindling lucifer matches and thus became very dangerous inmate busying himself in this way when the family was in bed though fortunately he seems to have done nothing worse than light the kitchen ﬁre which had been laid ready kindling over night clever he was however he could not learn to distinguish the proper ignitable end of the match and so rubbed on till he happened to get it right he frightened himself terribly at ﬁrst by the explosion and the sulphur fumes and burned himself into the bargain but i not ﬁnd that like the burnt child he afterwards feared the ﬁre and

their memories that they will pipe it to the end of their days and let us hope i believe is the fact that they ﬁnd in it never delight just in human schools and colleges it is only the few out of the great number who take the highest honours or degrees or become senior wranglers so it is not above ﬁve birds in every hundred who can attain to the highest perfection in their art but all such are valued at very high it is allowable to hope that the poor which has thus industriously applied himself to learn and has thus become artiﬁcially gifted with the power of pleasing takes great satisfaction in his accomplishment perhaps also the association with his human teacher calls forth his affection well his power of song it is fact that the piping is of all birds given to attach itself to some one individual of the family where it is kept expressing at their approach the most vehement delight greeting them with its piping melody hopping towards them and practising all its little winning ways to show its love and to court return of caresses an interesting story says the bishop was told by sir william parsons who was himself great musician and who when young man possessed piping which he had taught to sing god save the on his once going abroad he gave his favourite in charge to his sister with strict injunction to take the greatest care of it on his return one of his ﬁrst visits was to her when she told him that the poor little bird had been long in declining health and was at that moment very sir william full of sorrow went into the room where the cage

113 birds and their nests by mary project gutenberg ebook https poor little birds are extremely attached to their home and their young so much so that if these be taken by the pitiless they will continue some days about the place uttering the most melancholy plaint which though still to the same old tune the song of their spring rejoicing has now the expression of the deepest woe the author of british birds thus sums up their various characteristic actions when perched on tree especially in windy weather they crouch close to the twigs draw in their necks and keep their tails declined

and contemplating it with rather sentimental air perhaps rather with tender admiration and to his dwelling it is we must confess wonderful ediﬁce so to speak and with its and all complete the magpie is one of our most beautiful well most amusing and characteri stic birds he is cousin to the jackdaw and has like him odd ways of his own in all countries where he is found he is just the same an old greek poet who lived two thousand years ago speaks of him great mimic and such an inordinate talker that in his own satirical humour he pretends to believe that magpies were originally family of young ladies in macedonia who were noted the volubility of their tongues handsome he is well talkative and very droll and mischievous being such we need not wonder that his nest is very original he likes to place it in secure angle of branches on some lofty tree we see it here ﬁfty feet or so from the ground and prefers to have it on tree bare of branches to considerable height knowing that it is then more inaccessible he is wise in all this its bulk being so large it is discernible to great distance magpies however are found almost everywhere and in some parts of the country the north of scotland instance where there are trees the poor magpie is then obliged to build in bush and the best he can in such case in norway he was known to barricade his nest with thorny branches brought thither by himself that purpose till it was next to impossible the domicile to be invaded cat could not get to it and man only with on his hands and by help of like the rook the magpie inhabits the same nest several years perhaps the whole of his life putting it into repair every year before he again needs it family wealthy country family taking possession of their ancestral mansion in the spring and now turning to our picture we ﬁnd our magpie in excellent circumstances every thing has gone well with him here he is and i will have the pleasure of giving you bit of magpie life sketched by that true artist the author of british our scene opens few minutes before the time indicated in our picture 115 116 birds and their nests by mary project gutenberg ebook https search food magpie and nest page 1 16 there on the old you may see pair one perched on the topmost twig the other hopping on the branches below keeping up an incessant chatter how gracefully she on the topmost twig swings in the breeze off she starts and directs her ﬂight to the opposite chattering all the way seemingly to call her mate after her but he prefers remaining behind he is in brown study or something of that kind we can plainly see now having spied something below he hops downwards from twig to branch and descends to the ground his you must understand grows close to and in part overshadows farmyard so now he is on ground which is customary in such places is not over clean therefore lifting up his tail to prevent it being soiled or wet the farmer s wife might hold up her sunday gown and raising his body high possible he walks few paces and spying an half out of his hole drags it forth by sudden jerk breaks it in pieces and swallows it now under the hedge he has found snail which he will presently pick out of its shell an old woman would periwinkle but now something among the bushes has startled him and he springs lightly upwards chattering the while to regain his favourite tree it is cat which not less frightened than himself both are intent on mischief runs off towards the barn the magpie again descends steps slowly over the grassy margin of the yard looking from side to side stops listens advances rapidly by succession of leaps and encounters whole brood of chickens with their mother at their heels if she had not been there he would have had delicious 117 birds and their nests by mary project gutenberg ebook https beautiful of one of those chickens but he dare not think of such thing now with fury in her eye bristled plumage and loud clamour the hen rushes forward at him overturning two of her younglings and the enemy suddenly wheeling round to avoid the encounter ﬂies of f to his mate there again you perceive them in the meadow they walk about with their elevated tails looking something eatable by the hedge afar off are two boys with gun endeavouring to creep up to ﬂock of plovers on the other side but the magpies see them there are not many things which escape their sharp eyes and presently rising they ﬂy directly over the ﬁeld chattering vehemently and the ﬂock of plovers on this take wing and the disappointed young sportsmen sheer of f in another magpies always make great chattering when they are disturbed or when they apprehend that danger is near waterton says that they are vociferous at the approach of night and that they are in truth valuable watchmen on that account whoever enters the wood he says is sure to attract their notice and then their challenge is incessant when i hear them during the night or even during the day i know that mischief is on the stir three years ago at eleven clock in the day i was at the capture of one of the most expert and desperate poachers to whose we were directed by the chatter of the the poor magpie has many enemies and knowing this is always on the watch and easily alarmed its mode of walking is like that of the rook but not having any dignity to maintain it every now and then leaps in sidelong direction when alarmed itself or wishing to announce danger to other birds it utters sort of chuckling cry or chatter if fox or cat or any other unfriendly animal approaches it hovers about it and alarms the whole neighbourhood by its cries till the enemy is out of sight like the jackdaw it generally keeps in pairs the whole year round and indeed when birds continue to inhabit the same nest season after season it is quite natural that they should so it is curious fact however that if by any accident the is killed whilst sitting on her eggs her mate sets off at once and brings home another wife who takes to the nest and eggs just if she had laid them and if by another mischance she too should come to an untimely end the widower again goes off and without any loss of time brings back third wife and she takes to her duties quite naturally and lovingly the other did but where all these surplus mothers come from is question which naturalist has yet answered and the magpie with all his chattering is not clever enough to explain the wonder the beauty of this bird s plumage is familiar to all and although it is simply black and white yet the gloss of green blue and purple with their varying and intermingling tints produce such charming effect that one can not sufﬁciently admire them with the external structure of the magpie s nest we are acquainted the lower part inside is neatly plastered with mud and is furnished says bewick with sort of mattress formed of wool or ﬁbrous roots on which from three to six eggs are the eggs frequently vary both in size and colour sometimes they are of pale green freckled over with amber and light purple sometimes pale blue with smaller spots of the same dark colours the nest is so to speak sort of little domed chamber of good size its purpose but then comes the does the magpie with her long tail she sits on her eggs it would certainly poke hole through the wall if left to its full extent she must therefore lift it up she does when walking amongst the wet grass and sit with it laid ﬂat against the wall which probably is not inconvenient to her 118 119 birds and their nests by mary project gutenberg ebook https xxii the nutha tch this bird is almost an entire stranger to most people it belongs to the rather large family of creepers birds which like the woodpecker and the little wren run up the holes and branches of trees in search of food the nuthatch however has an advantage over all its other creeping relatives by being gifted with the power of coming down the tree head foremost which none of them have it can also sleep with its head downwards neither in its rapid ascent has it occasion to press its tail against the tree help so that it is the most accomplished little acrobat of the whole race of creepers nutha tch and nest page the nuthatch can not be called rare bird and yet it is not often seen being of shy and retiring disposition though naturally lively and active the plumage is very pleasing in colour the upper parts of the body are black line passes from the corners of the mouth to the back of the neck the breast and under parts light and the sides 120 birds and their nests by mary project gutenberg ebook https favourite food her defence of her delights in woods and trees nor need it be looked elsewhere it derives its food entirely amongst them either of insects and larvæ hidden in the bark or of fruits and nuts kernels of beech and other nuts the shells of which it breaks in very ingenious manner i shall presently describe now and then it alights on the ground and then advances by short leaps it has song but in winter when living in small companies perhaps the whole summer associating together it has little piping note which however is supposed to be simply the call to each other it is said to be sensitive to the cold and always feeds on the side of the wood or of the tree which is defended from the wind in spring however when all nature is renovated with quicker pulse of tennyson says in the spring fuller crimson comes upon the robin s breast in the spring the wanton lapwing gets himself another crest in the spring livelier iris changes on the burnished then also the silent nuthatch sends forth through the awakening solitude of the woods his two little notes one short and twittering the other low mellow whistle which is so clear that it may be heard to considerable distance the graphic author of the british birds says it is at all times busy and cheerful bird particularly at its favourite food is nuts of any kind it builds and roosts in hollow trees and is seldom seen in the open ﬁelds unless when in quest of the stones of the or sloe it may therefore be properly called forester its dexterity in opening nuts and the stones of fruit is curious it ﬁxes the nut in crack on the top of post or in the bark of tree and placing itself above it head downwards striking with great force and rapidity with its strong bill on the edge of the shell splits it open when their food is plentiful they have favourite crack unshellin g the kernels sometimes peck of broken shells may be seen under this the rev bree tells us that the tapping of the bird on the hard shell may be heard at considerable distance and that during the operation it sometimes happens that the nut swerves from its ﬁxture and falls towards the ground it has not descended however the space of more than few yards when the nuthatch with admirable adroitness recovers it in the fall and replacing it in its former position commences the attack afresh the fall of the nut in the air and the recovery by the bird on the wing i have seen repeated several times in the space of few this is little act of skill in the bird which it would be charming to observe and here again i would remark i have so often done before that this is but single instance of what many of us living in the country might witness in some woodland nook near at hand if we would only be lovingly still and patient and interest ourselves in the ways and means of the innocent around us the nest of the bird also deserves our notice and let here call your attention to the beautiful and living little portrait of the bird at home given us by harrison weir than which we have nothing more truthful from his pencil the home of the nuthatch is nothing more to begin with than the hole in an old tree which probably has been deserted by the woodpecker however the woodpecker either requires more enlar ged entrance to her nursery or considers it more seemly the nuthatch who merely likes snug little hole to creep in at and nothing more walls up the opening with plastering of clay or mud leaving only just room enough herself to enter perhaps she may be afraid of the old tenants returning and again taking possession so builds up little defence in front but of that i can not say certain it is she makes herself comfortably at home in rather an untidy nest compo sed mostly of dead and here she lays six or seven white eggs with ruddy spots on them if the plaster wall be by any chance removed the poor bird loses not moment in replacing it and though she has apparently great dread of any woodpecker snake man or whatever else he may be disturbing so faithfully devoted is she to her duties that scarcely anything will induce her to leave the eggs or young she ﬁghts vigorously in defence of her home and its treasures striking out with her bill and wings 121 122 123 birds and their nests by mary project gutenberg ebook https making hissing angry noise nay timid and shy she naturally is she will suffer herself to be carried of f captive rather than desert her char ge let conclude with one of bechstein s anecdotes of the nuthatch lady amused herself in the winter by throwing seeds on the terrace below the window to feed the birds in the neighb ourhood she put some and cracked nuts even on the and on board her particular favourites the two nuthatches came one day to have their share of this repast and were so well pleased that they became quite familiar and did not even go away in the following spring to get their natural food and to build their nest in the wood they settled themselves in the hollow of an old tree near the house soon the two young ones which were reared here were ready to ﬂy they brought them to the hospitable window where they were to be nourished and soon after disappeared entirely it was amusing to see these two new visitors hang or climb on the walls or blinds whilst their benefactress put their food on the board these pretty creatures well the tits knew her so well that when she drove away the sparrows which came to steal what was not intended them they did not ﬂy away also but seemed to know what was done was only to protect and defend them they remained near the house the whole summer rarely wandering till one fatal day at the beginning of the sporting season in autumn on hearing the report of gun they disappeared and were never seen watson
