from tapestry screen standing between her and the ferns rising from basket framework in the bow of the window consulting it at intervals the afternoon wore on she found that it made very light of the quiet propositions that were being elaborated within hearing of her inattent ive ears looking beyond it she could catch glimpses between the crowded fernery when tram was not jingling by of palisade just across the roadway and beyond the palisade of green level ending at row of spanish poplars the trams seemed very near and noisy when they passed by the window the speakers had to raise their voices otherwise the little was very quiet with strange fashioned quietness it was full of old things like the gobelin screen and old thoughts like the thoughts of the ladies who were sitting and talking there she and her mother had seemed quite modern fussy worldly people when they had ﬁrst come into the room from the moment the three ladies had come in and begun talking to her mother the things in the room and the view of the distant row of poplars had grown more and more peaceful and now at the end of an hour she felt that she and to some extent henderson too belonged to the room with its quiet green outlook shut in by the poplars only the trams were disturbing they came busily by with their strange jingle and made her inattentive why were there so many people coming by in trams where were they going why were all the trams painted that hard dingy blue the sisters talked quietly outlining their needs in smooth gentle voices in small broken phrases frequently interrupting and correcting each other miriam heard dreamily that they wanted help with the lower school the children from six to eight years of age in the mornings and afternoons and in the evenings general superintendence of the four boarders they kept on saying that the work was very easy and simple there were naughty hardly single naughty the school there should be difﬁcult superintendence exercise of authority would be required by the time they had reached the statem ent of these modiﬁcations miriam felt that she knew them quite well the shortest who did most of the talking and who had twinkling eyes and crooked and soft reddish cheeks and little nose and whose small coil of sheeny grey hair was pinned askew on the top of her loops standing out at curious miss jenny the middle one the very tall one sitting opposite her with delicate wrinkled creamy face and eyes and peak of ringletted smooth hair was the eldest miss deborah the other sister much younger with neat smooth hair and long sad greyish face and faded eyes was miss haddie they were all three dressed in thin ﬁne black material and had tiny hands and little softly moving feet what did they think of the trams you think you could manage it chickie said henderson suddenly i think i doubt my dear oh doubt said miss jenny with little sound of laughter she tapped her knee with the she had plucked from their2 3 the project

from all three taught her that miss deborah took the bible classes of the whole school how old is miriam just eighteen she has put up her hair oh poor child she need not have done she is born teacher she used to hold little classes amongst her schoolfellows when she was only eight years miriam turned sharply to her mother she was sitting with her tired bright eyes and moist ﬂushed face how had she heard about the little classes had there been little classes she could not remember them she speaks french like that was that silly remark made by the woman in the train coming home from hanover was in germany she yes but i learned more the sisters smiled provisionally she shared room with the she might speak french with the oh i couldn t speak there was tender little laugh i don t know french well the sisters brought the discussion to an end by offering twenty pounds year in return miriam s services and naming the date of the beginning of the autumn term 2 on the way to the front door they all looked into the principal schoolroom miriam saw long wide table covered with brown american cloth shelves neatly crowded with books lined one wall from ﬂoor to ceiling opposite them at the far end of the room was heavy grey marble mantelpiece on which stood heavy green marble clock frame at its centre clock ticked softly opposite the windows were two shallow alcoves in one stood shrouded blackboard on an easel the other held piano with high slender back the prancing outward sweep of its lid gave miriam the impression of an afternoon dress miss deborah drew up one of the venetian blinds they all crowded to the window and looked out on small garden backed by trees and lying in deep shadow beyond were more gardens and the brownish backs of small old brick houses low walls

the trams the5 the project gutenberg ebook of backwater pilgrimage volume 2 by dorothy richardson https of the hoofs of the and the noise of screaming train thundering over the bridge miriam made her voice heard gazing through the spotted veil at her mother s quivering features they might have made all sorts of things i can t henderson s voice breathless with walking made little sound of protest narrowed sound that told miriam her amusement was half annoyance the dark noisy bridge the clatter and rattle and the mud through which she must plunge to an omnibus exasperated her to the limit of her endurance i d got the post she said angrily you could see it was all settled and then you went saying those glancing at the thin shrouded features she saw the faint lift of her mother s eyebrows and the ﬁrmly speechless mouth on let s go outside now it s ﬁne said miriam crossly reaching the top of the omnibus she hurried to the front seat on the left hand side that s very windy it isn t it s quite hot the sun s come out now it s rained weeks it won t rain any more it ll be hot you won t feel the wind will you have the corner mother chick you sit miriam screwed herself into the corner seat crossing her knees and grazing the tips of her shoes this is the only place on the top of henderson sat down at her side i always make harriett come up here when we go up to the west of course it s the only place she insisted in response to her mother s amused laugh one smoking or talking in front you can see out in front and you can see the shops if there are any and you re not falling off all the time the bus goes on the left side of the road and tilts to the the seats were ﬁlling up and the driver appeared clambering into his place didn t you ever think of that didn t you ever think of the bus tilting that way persisted miriam to her moth er s inattentive face fancy never thinking of it it s beastly on the other the omnibus jerked forward you ought to be man mimmy i liked that little short one said miriam contentedly they came from under the roar of the bridge they were awfully nice weren t they they seemed to have made up their mind to take before we went so i think they like us i wonder why they like us didn t you think they liked us don t you think they are awfully nice i they are very charming yes but wasn t it awfully rum their liking us in that funny way i m sure i don t see why they should oh mother you know what i mean i like them i m perfectly sure i shall like them d you remember the little one saying all girls ought to marry why did she say that they are dear funny little s said henderson merrily she was sitting with her knees crossed the stuff of her brown canvas dress was dragged across them into an ugly fold by the weight of the velvet panel at the side of the skirt she looked very small and resourceless and there were the pernes with their house and their school they were old maids of course what then i never dreamed of getting such big salary

she had missed the ﬁrst swing forward of the vehicle and the ﬁrst movements of the compact street they were going ahead now at steady even trot her face was bathed in the ﬂow of the breeze little rivulets played about her temples feeling their way through her hair she drew off her gloves without turning from the ﬂowing roadway they went on and on down the long road miriam forgot her companion in the tranquil sense of being carried securely forward through the air away from people and problems ahead of her at the end of the long drive lay three sunlit weeks bright now in the certainty of the shadow that lay beyond them the junior school four 5 they lumbered at last round corner and out into wide thoroughfare drawing up outside house above it rose row upon row of upper windows sunk in masses of ornamental plaster branch roads laid with tram lines led off in every direction miriam s eyes followed dull blue tram with grubby seatless roof jingling busily off up roadway where short trees stood all the way along in the small dim gardens of little grey houses on the near corner of the road stood wide white building bulging into heavy domes against the sky across its side large gilt letters standing far apart spelled out banbury it must be theatre she told herself in astonishment that s what they call suburban theatre people think it is really the little shock sent her mind feeling out along the road they had just left she considered its unbroken length its shops its treelessness the wide thoroughfare up which they now bega n to rumble repeated it on larger scale the pavements were wide causeways reached from the roadway by stone steps three deep the people passing along them were unlike any she knew there were ladies gentlemen girls or young men such she knew they were all alike they were she could ﬁnd word the strange impression they made it colou red the whole of the district through which they had come it was part of the new world to which she was pledged to go on september 18th it was her world already and she had words it she would not be able to convey it to others she felt sure her mother had not noticed it she must deal with it alone to try to speak about it even with eve would sap her courage it was her secret strange secret all her life hanover had been but hanover was beautiful with distant country through the saal windows with its colours misty in the sunlight the beautiful happy town and the woodland villages so near this new secret was shabby ugly and shabby the something persisted unchanged when the causeways and shops disappeared and long rows of houses streamed by their close ranks broken only by an occasional cross road they were large high houses with ﬂights of grey stone steps leading to their porchless doors they had tiny front gardens crowded with shrubs here and there long narrow strips of garden pushed row of houses back from the roadway in these longer plots stood signboards and 12 the project

shops reappeared and densely crowded pavements and then more high straight houses 6 she roused herself at last from her puzzled contemplation and turned to glance at her mother henderson was looking out ahead the exhausted face was ready miriam saw with its faintly questioning eyebrows and lips emotional response she turned away uneasily to the spellbound streets useless to try to talk about anything mother would be somehow violent she would be overpowering the strange new impressions would be but she must something show some sign of companionship she began humming softly the air was so full of clamour that she could not hear her voice the houses and shops had disappeared drab brick walls were passing slowly by on either side goods yard she deepened her humming accentuating her phrases so that the sound might reach her companion through the reverberations of the clangour of shunting trains 7 the high brick walls were drawing away the end of the long roadway was in sight its widening mouth offered sign of escape from the disquieting strangeness the open stretch of thoroughfare into which they emer ged was fed by innumerable lanes of trafﬁc from the islands dotted over its surface towered huge lamp standards branching out thin arms they rattled noisily over the stone setts they jolted across several lines of tramway and wove their way through currents of trafﬁc crossing each other in all directions i wonder where we re wonder if this is piccadilly bus miriam thought of saying impossible to shout through the din 8 the driver gathered up his horses and they clattered deafeningly over the last open stretch and turned into smooth wide prospect oh bliss murmured miriam mass of sharply steepled stone building appeared on the right her eyes rested on its soft shadows

richmond until our avenue 11 miriam fumbled with the fastening of the low wide gate her mother passed on up the drive she waited until the footsteps were mufﬂed by the fullness of the may trees linking their middle branches over the bend in the drive then she looked steadily down the sunﬂecked asphalted avenue along which they had just come the level sunlight streamed along the empty roadway and the shadows of the lime trees lay across the path and up the oak palings her eyes travelled up and down the boles of the trees stopping at each little stunted tuft of greenery she could longer hear her mother s footsteps there was scented coolness in the shady watered garden leaning gently with her breast against the upper bars of the gate she broke away from the sense of her made 20 the

lime trees long she watched her eyes roaming from the owing leaves where the green was densest to the edges of the trees where the light shone through gold and green she whispered green and gold held up by ﬁrm brown stems bathed in when she reached the open garden beyond the bend she ran once round the large centre bed where berberus and laurestinus bushes stood in clump ringed by violas and blue

geraniums in her arms 12 hullo said miriam putting down her pot harriett ﬁxed brown eyes upon her and began jumping lightly up and down where she stood the small tips of her fawn glacé kid shoes shone

of candles on the girandoles hanging on either side of the high overmantel gave out an unﬂickering radiance and in the centre of the large room the chandelier pulled low held out in all directions bulbs of softly tinted light in an intensity of brilliance pouring from tall standard lamp across the sheepskin hearthrug stood guest with ﬁddle under her arm ﬂuttering pages on music stand the family sat grouped towards her in circle on her low sofa outside the more brilliant light miriam was retreating loop in the circle of seated forms all visible she lay with her eyes on the ceiling but eyes could meet and pilfer her own the darkness brimmed in from the window on her right she could touch the on the sill and listen to the dewy stillness of the garden what shall i play said the guest what have you there gluck klassische stücke ah gluck said henderson smoothing his long knees with outspread ﬁngers have you got that beethoven thing asked sarah not here sally i saw the chords said sarah excitedly chords encouraged miriam yes i think so muttered sarah taking up her crochet i daresay i m wrong she giggled throwing out foot and hastily withdrawing it i can ﬁnd it dear chanted the guest miriam raised ﬂourishing hand the crimsoned oval of eve s face appeared inverted above her own she poked ﬁnger into one of the dark eyes and looking at the lid whispered voicelessly make her play the romance ﬁrst and then the cavatina without talking in between eve s large soft mouth pursed little and miriam watched steadily until dimples appeared go on eve she said removing her hand shall i play the beethoven ﬁrst enquired the guest then the cavatina murmured miriam if half asleep turning wholly towards the garden eve went to collect the piano scores 2 she seemed to grow larger and stronger and easier the thoughtful chords came musing out into the night and hove red amongst the dark trees she found herself drawing easy breaths and relaxi ng completely against the support of the hard friendly sofa how quietly everyone was listening 29 30 the project gutenberg ebook of backwater pilgrimage volume 2 by dorothy richardson https while everything was dissolved past and future and present and she was nothing but an ear intent on the meditative harmony which stole out into the garden 3 when the last gently strung notes had ceased she turned from her window and found harriett s near eye ﬁxed upon her the eyebrow travelling slowly up the forehead wow mouthed miriam harriett screwed her mouth to one side and strained her eyebrow higher the piano introduction to the cavatina drowned the comments on the guest s playing and the family relaxed once more into listening pink anemones eh suggested miriam softly harriett drew in her chin and nodded approvingly pink anemones sighed miriam and turned to watch margaret wedderburn standing in her white dress on the hearthrug in radiance of red and golden light her heavily waving fair hair fell back towards its tightly braided basket of plaits from face serene death from between furry eyelashes her eyes looked steadfastly out robbed of their everyday sentimental expression she gazed at the broad white forehead the ﬁne gold down covering the cheeks and upper lip and traced the outline of the heavy chin and ﬁrm large mouth and the steady arm that swept out in rich notes the devout theme of the lyric miriam drifted to an extremity of happiness 4 the room would be lit and decked and clear amongst the crowd of guests he would come across the room walking in his way she smiled to herself he would come sloping in in his way like shadow not looking at anyone his strange friend woul d be with him there would be introductions and greetings then he would dance with her silently and not looking at her if they were strangers and then be dancing with someone else with smiling mocking tender brown eyes and talking and answering and all the time looking about the room and then again with her cool and silent and not looking and presently she would tell him about going away to banbury park 5 perhaps he would look wretched and miserable again he had done when they were alone by the piano the sunday before she went to germany play abide with miriam play abide with there would be another moment like that he would say her name suddenly he had done last week at the babingtons dance very low towards her she would be ready this time and say his name and move instead of being turned to stone conﬁdently the music assured her of that 33 the project gutenberg ebook of backwater pilgrimage volume 2 by dorothy richardson https she lay looking quietly into his imagined face till the room had gone then the face grew dim and far off and at last receded altogether into darkness that darkness was dreadful it was his own life she would never know it however well they got to know each other they would always be strangers probably he never thought about her when he was alone only of shakespeare and politics what would he think if he knew she thought of him but he thought of her when he saw her that was utterly certain the one thing certain in the world that day coming along putney hill with mother tired and dull and trying to keep her temper passing his house seeing him standing at his window alone and pale and serious the sudden lightening of his face surprised her again violently she recalled it it had lit up the whole world from end to end he did not know that he had looked like that she had turned swiftly from the sudden knowledge coming like blow on her heart that one day he would kiss her not years and years but one day he would bend his head she wrenched herself from the thought but it was too late she thanked heaven she had looked she wished she had not the kiss had come she would forget it it had not touched her it was like the breath of the summer everything had wavered her feet had not felt the pavement she remembered walking on exulting with hanging head cringing close to the ivy which hung from the top of the garden wall sorry and pitiful towards her mother and everyone who would never stand ﬁrst with ted 7 there were girls who let themselves be kissed fun playing kiss in the ring being kissed by someone they did not mean to always be with all their life how sad and dreadful why did it not break their hearts 8 meg wedderburn was smiling on her hearthrug being thanked and praised her brown violin hung amongst the folds of her skirt people like us mused miriam listening to the peculiar sympathy of the family voice meg was there away from her own home happy with them the front door shut their garden and house all round her and her strange luggage upstairs in one of the spare rooms nice meg 9 after breakfast the next morning miriam sat in low carpet chair at window in the long bedroom she shared with harriett it was morning of blazing sunlight and bright blue she had just come up through the cool house from tour of the garden with harriett little bunch of pink anemones she had picked herself were set in tumbler on the stand she had left the door open to hear coming faintly up from the the of hammering that told her sarah and eve were35 the project gutenberg ebook of backwater pilgrimage volume 2 by dorothy richardson https the drugget on her knee lay her father s machine and parcel of papers and tobacco an empty cigarette tin stood upon the she began packing tobacco into the groove of the machine distributing and pressing it lightly with the tips of her ﬁngers watching she worked the heavy pink cups of the anemones and the shining of their green stalks through the water they were she reﬂected little too much out in the sun they would have come out still more they would close up at night unless the rooms grew very hot slipping the paper evenly into the slot she shut the machine and turned the roller the sound of the loosely working cogs came up to her she revolted from her task she was too happy to make cigarettes it would use up her happiness too stupidly she was surprised by sudden suggestion that she should smoke the single cigarette herself why not why had she never yet smoked one she glanced at the slowly swinging door one would come she was alone on the top ﬂoor everyone was downstairs and busy the ﬁnished cigarette lay on her knee taking it between her ﬁngers she pressed little hanging thread of tobacco into place the cigarette felt pleasantly plump and ﬁrm it was well made she rose to get matches the mowing machine sounded suddenly from the front lawn she started and looked out of the window concealing the cigarette in her hand it was the gardene r with bent shoulders pushing with all his might with some difﬁculty she unhitched the phosphorescent from its place under the and got back into her low chair invisible from the lawn the cool air ﬂowed in she held the cigarette between two ﬁngers the match hissed and ﬂared she held it carefully below the sill and the ﬂame ﬂowed towards her while she set the paper alight raising the cigarette to her lips she blew gently outwards down through the tobacco the ﬂame twisted and went out leaving the paper charred she struck another match angrily urging herself to draw and drew little panting breaths with the cigarette well in the ﬂame it smoked blowing out the match she looked at the end of the cigarette it was glowing all over and delicate little spiral of smoke rose into her face quickly she applied her lips again and drew little breaths opening her mouth wide between each breath and holding the cigarette sideways away from her the end glowed afresh with each breath the paper charred evenly away and little ﬂecks of ash fell about her 10 third of the whole length was consumed her nostrils breathed in smoke and she tasted the burnt ﬂavour the sweetness of the unpolluted air all around her was new thing the acrid tang in her nostrils intoxicated her she drew more boldly there was smoke in her mouth she opened it quickly sharply exhaling yellow cloud oddly different from the grey spirals wreathing their way from the end of the cigarette she went on drawing in mouthful after mouthful of smoke expelling each quickly with lips turning to look at the room through the yellow haze and again at the sky which drew nearer she puffed at it the sight of the tops scrolled with her little clouds brought her sense of power she had chosen to smoke and she was smoking and the morning world gleamed back at her 1137 38 39 the project gutenberg ebook of backwater pilgrimage volume 2 by dorothy richardson https morning gleamed she would choose her fate it should be amongst green trees and sunshine that daunted lump who had accepted the post at banbury park had nothing to with her morning gladness ﬂooded her and her gladness of the thought of the evening to come quickened it had done last night into certainty she burned the last inch of the cigarette in the grate wrapped with combings from the in screw of paper when all was consumed she carefully replaced the summer bundle of ornamental mohair behind the bars useless to tell anyone one would believe she had not felt she found it difﬁcult to understand why anyone should feel sick from smoking dizzy perhaps little drunk pater s tobacco was very strong some people could not smoke it she had smoked whole cigarette of strong tobacco and liked it raising her arms above her head she worked them upwards stretching every muscle of her body she was anything but leaving the window wide she went on to the landing the smell of tobacco was everywhere she ﬂung

anxiously is mary driving them into the properly before she had reached the end of her second page everyone had disappeared she paused moment and looked down the brightly lit empty sight of the cold sheeny drugget ﬁlled her with despair the hilarious voice resounded in the hall there couldn t be many there yet were they all looking after them properly moment she was tempted to leave her piano and go and make some desperate attempt at geniality then the sound of the pervading voice back again in the room and brisk footsteps coming towards the conservatory drove her back to her music the little man stepped quickly over the low moulding into the conservatory ah mariamne he blared gently oh bennett you angel how did you get here so early responded miriam playing with zealous emphasis got old barrowgate to ﬁnish off the he said with choke of amusement i say mirry don t you play let take it on you go and ply the light he laid his hands upon her shoulders and burred the tune she was playing

the forms circling past the gap in the curtains and slowed little the room seemed fairly full that s mim signalled harriett s partner swinging her by she held to the fresh rhythm and passing into tender old waltz tune that she knew by heart gave herself to her playing she need not watch the feet any longer she could go on ever she knew she was not playing altogether the dancers she was playing to two hearers but she could not play that tune if they came they would be late but they must be here now where were they were they having coffee dancing she ﬂung terriﬁed glance at the room and met the cold eye of bevan seymour she would not look again the right feeling the dreamy old tune came and went uncontrollably why did they not come presently she would be cold and sick and done the evening she played on harking back to the memory of the kindly challenge in the eyes of her brother to be dancing gravely with grave harriett her writing in her album she was his life the ocean to the river of his which terminated cold calm little harriett her waltz had swung soft and low and the dancers were hushed only tommy babington s voice still threaded the little throng someone held back the near curtain voice said quietly here she 16 ted s low voice ﬁlled the conservatory he was standing very near her looking down at her with his back to the gay room yesterday s dream had come more than true at once at the beginning of the evening he had come straight to her with his friend not dancing not looking partner they were in the little green enclosure with her the separating curtains had fallen back into place behind the friend who stood leaning against the far end of the piano the massed fernery gleamed now with the glow of concealed fairy lamps she had not noticed it before the fragrance of fronds and moist warm clumps of maidenhair and scented geraniums inundated her she glanced across at the light falling on hard sculptured waves of hair above white handsome face her music held them all protecting the wordless meeting her last night s extremity of content was reality being lived by all three of them it centred in herself ted stood within it happy in it the friend watched witnessing ted s confession ted had said nothing to him about her about any of them in his usual way but he was disguising nothing now that he had come at the end of her playing she stood up faintly dizzy and held out towards max sonnenheim s familiar strangeness hands heavy with happiness and quickened with the sense of ted s touch upon her arm the swift crushing of the strange hands upon her own steadied her the curtains swung wide and group of dancers crowded in 17 don t tell we ve scrubbed the cofﬁn ll sit there all the 52 53 the project gutenberg ebook of backwater pilgrimage

he responded thoughtfully he was standing at her side at the top of the garden steps staring out into the garden and apparently not noticing the noisy if they stood there much longer ted who had not been dancing would join them she did not want that she would put off her dance with ted until later the next dance she would play herself and then perhaps dance again with max once more from the strange security of his strongly swinging arms she would meet ted s eyes watching and waiting she must dance once more with max she had never really danced before she would go to ted at last and pass on the spirit of her dancing to him but not yet i will show you the front garden she said running down the steps he joined her and they walked silently round the side of the house through the kitchen yard and out into the deserte d carriage drive she thought she saw people on the front lawn and walked quickly humming little tune on down the drive max crunched silently along little apart from her singing to himself 18 both sides of the front gate were bolted back and their footsteps carried them straight out on to the asphalted avenue extending right and left dim tunnel of greenery scarcely lit by the lamps out in the roadway with sudden sense of daring miriam determined to assume the deserted avenue part of the garden the gate left behind they made their way slowly along the high leafy tunnel they would walk to the end of the long avenue and back again in moment she would cease humming and make remark she tasted new sense of ease walking slowly along with this strange man without making he was taking her silence granted all her experience so far had been of companions whose uneasi ness pressed unendurably speech and her talking had been done with an irritated sense of the injustice of aspersions on women s tongues while man could endure woman s silence even ted except when dancing woman could except minna in germany max must be foreign of course course she could if she liked talk of the stars to him he would neither make jokes nor talk science and want her to admire him until all the magic was gone her mood expanded he had come just at the right moment she would keep him with her until she had to face ted he was like big ship towing the little barque of her life to its harbour his vague humming rose to little song it was german it was the lorelei moment she forgot everything but pride in her ability to take her share in both music and words you understand german he cried they had reached the end of the avenue and the starlit roadway opened ahead lined with meadows ach wie schön breathed max wie miriam was startled by the gay sound of her own voice it sounded if she were alone speaking to herself she looked up at the spangled sky the freshening air streamed towards them from the meadows we must go back she said easily turning in again under the 56 the project gutenberg ebook of backwater pilgrimage volume 2 by dorothy richardson https limes

was true the german phrase ted was dear dear but so far away coming and going far away is it she said with vague sweet intonation to hear more wie süss wie süss he repeated ﬁrmly ﬂinging his arm across her shoulders the wildly shimmering leafage rustled and seemed to sing she walked on horriﬁed cradled her elbow resting in her companion s hand in cup she laughed and her laughter mingled with the subdued lilting of the voice close at her side ted was waiting somewhere in the night her ted ted not this stranger but why was he not bold like this primly and gently she disengaged herself she and ted would walk along through the darkness and it would shout to them colours seemed to be shining through the night she turned abruptly to her companion aren t the lime trees jolly she said conversationally you will dance again with yes if you i must go so early must you morning early i go 19 hullo where were you all that last dance nan babington s voice startled her they came into the bright hall through the open front door she smiled towards nan sitting drearil y with brilliant smile on her face watching the dancers from long chair drawn up near the door and passed on into the room with her hand on her partner s arm they had missed dance and an interval it must have been lancers and now there was another waltz several couples were whirling gravely about amongst them she noted bevan seymour upright and slender dancing with harriett with an air of condescending vivacity his bright teeth showing all the time her eyes were ready ted she was going to meet his the ﬁrst one look and then she would ﬂy her life anywher to anybody and he would ﬁnd her and make her look at him again ted he was not there people were glancing at her curiously she veiled her waiting eyes and felt their radiance stream through her ﬂooding her with strength from head to foot how battered and ordinary everyone had looked frail and sick stamped with pallor of sickness how she pitied them all let us take short turn said max and his arms came around her they circled slowly down the length of the room she stared at his black shoulder few inches from her eyes his stranger s face was just above her in the bright light his strange glove holding her mittened hand his arms steadied her they neared the conservatory 59 the project gutenberg ebook of backwater pilgrimage volume 2 by dorothy richardson https let us go out she heard him say and her footsteps were guided across the moulding her arm retained in his meg wedderburn was playing and met her with her sentimental smile in the gloom at her side just beyond the shaded candle stood ted ready to turn the music his disengaged hand holding the bole of tall palm he dropped his hands and turned they passed him almost colliding with miriam next dance with he whispered neatly will you show your cofﬁn asked max they reached the garden steps it s quite down at the end beyond the kitchen 20 there are raspberry canes all along

trail isn t it funny how dark they are and yet the colour s there all the time isn t it they are lovely in the day lovely leaves and great big fruit and in between are little squatty gooseberry bushes

men are like green gooseberries why are they tell perhaps you would not like it we are passing the apple trees now quarendens and tell i shall like what you say well it s because women can make fools

will sit down it will not be damp your future brother has not scrubbed also the ivy on the wall he pursued they sat down on the broad low seat it will spoil your miriam leaned uncomfortably against the intervening arm isn t it perfectly lovely night she said i feel that you would not make of man fool why not 61 62 the project gutenberg ebook of backwater pilgrimage volume 2 by dorothy richardson

listen someone was standing on the grass near max s side of the cofﬁn match spat and ﬂared and miriam s heart was shaken by ted s new eager frightened voice aren t you ever going to dance with again she had seen the whiteness of his face and his cold delicate upright ﬁgure in spirit she had leapt to her feet and faltered his name all the world she knew had fallen into newness this was certainty ted would never leave her but it was max who was standing up and saying richly in the blackness left by the match all in good time burton miss miriam is engaged to this her faint of course ted was drowned in the words which her partner sang after the footsteps retreating rapidly along the gravel path we re just coming i suppose they ve begun the next dance she said rising decisively and brushing at her velvet skirt with trembling hands our dance let us go and dance our they walked little apart steadily along up through the kitchen garden their unmatched footsteps sounding loudly upon the gravel between remarks made by max miriam heard them and heard the voice of max but she neither listened nor responded she began to talk and laugh at random they neared the lawn lit by the glaring uncurtained windows consulting his scrutinising face they danced easily in the yet empty room he humming the waltz which swung with their movement she found narrow glinting eyes looking into her own strange eyes that knew all about big business and were going to paris and new york his stranger s face was going away to be washed and shaved innumerable times keeping its assurance in strange places she knew nothing about here just these few hours laughing at ted phrase ﬂashed through her brain he s brought ted to his she ﬂushed and laughed vaguely and danced with feeling of tireless strength and gaiety she knew the phrase was not her own it was one nan babington could have used it excited her it meant that real things were going to happen she could bear herself proudly in the room she rippled complacently at max the room was full of whirling forms swelling and shrinking they crossed and recrossed the line between the clear vision rimmed by her glasses and the surrounding bright confusion swift rhythmic movement unbroken and unjostled told her how well they were dancing she was secure landed in life dancing carelessly out and out to life of her own i go i see you again in year said max

tidying her hair it must be nearly time phrase caught her eye the old château where the ﬁrst years of adèle s life were spent was situated in the midst of garden along one side of the château ran

ground pierced the avenue of poplars and disappeared through the further greenery in curve that was the beginning of its encirclement of the park lake coming slowly along the pathway was little ﬁgure dressed bunchily in black it looked pathetically small and dingy in the bright scene the afternoon blazed round it it was something left over what was the explanation of it it came near it seemed to change it grew real it was hurrying eagerly along quite indifferent to the afternoon glory with little rolling steps that were like the uneven toddling of child and carrying large newspaper whose great sheets although there was wind balled out scarcely controlled by the small hands its feathered hat had rakish air on such still afternoon it was thinking and coming along thinking and thinking

the table it had begun with miriam who sat on miss jenny s right hand and had nancie neighbour she had helped herself sparingly unable quite to resist the enhancement of the solid fare but fearing that there would be possibility of getting anything from72 73 the project gutenberg ebook of backwater pilgrimage volume 2 by dorothy richardson https to make return in kind things were so bad the

voicelessly miriam glanced at the too familiar sight of nancie s small eyes vanishing to malicious points she was sitting usual very solid and upright in her chair with her long cheeks pink ﬂushed and her ﬁne nose white and cool and twitching her yellow hair standing strongly back from her large white brow she stabbed keenly in her direction miriam glanced and miriam turned and applied herself to her bread and jam if she did not eat she would not get more than two slices from the piled dishes before the others had consumed four and ﬁve apiece and brought tea to an end eh what why are ye laughing nancie i m not laughing miss jenny nanci s ﬁrm lips curved away from her large faultless teeth i m only smiling and telling you about our visit to jones miss jenny s newspaper was lowered and

nonsensical to say when you mean yes d ye understand what i mean nancie it s bad hitching on her miss jenny returned to her paper miriam gave herself up to the luxury of reading adèle to the accompaniment of bread and jam she would not hurry over her bread and jam well not have it she would sacriﬁce her chance of third slice she reﬂected that it would be good thing if she could decide never to have more than two slices and have them in peace then she could thoroughly enjoy her reading but she was always so hungry at home she could not have eaten thick bread and butter but here every slice seemed better than the last when she began at the hard thick edge there always seemed to be tender places on her gums her three hollow teeth were uneasy and she had to get through worrying

round her soft brown neck her neck and her delicate pale face were shaded by lively silky brown curls she held her small head sideways from her book with questioning air one of her wicked swift brown eyes was covered serenely with its thin lid she uttered second gentle sigh and once more cleared her throat accompanying the sound with rapid ﬂuttering of the lowered lid miriam condemned her ﬂouting the single eye which tried to search her hating the sudden sharp dimpling which came high up almost under trixie s cheek bones in answer to her own 76 the project gutenberg ebook of backwater

whose neat china doll s face was half hidden between her cup and the protruding edge of her thatch of tight gold curls miriam disgustedly watched beadie prolong the irritating comedy by choking over her tea it was some minutes before the whole incident was made clear to miss jenny reading was suspended everyone watched while charlotte stubbs going carefully backwards came to the end at last of

stole glance at the breadth of her broad ﬂushed face at its broadest she hung over her book her broad ﬂat nose shone with her and her shock of coarse hair ﬂatly brushed on the top stuck out bushily on

holidays at margate you d look neat on the seat of bicyka made two brought miriam the utmost sense of imprisonm ent within the strange inﬂuence that had threatened her when she ﬁrst came to banbury

happen to her but she turned from the effort at full realisation threatened complete despair trixie too with home just78 79 80 the project gutenberg ebook of backwater pilgrimage volume 2 by dorothy

evidently knew it herself and said very little about it but her large red hands so strange handling were comforting and her holland apron with its bib under the fresh colouring of her you like butter buttercup under your chin to miriam picture of the farm white amidst bright greenery with dairy and morning and creamy white sheep on hillside it was all there with her she sat at table reading the lamplighter the sound of her broad husky voice explaining to miss jenny had been full of it but it was all past she too had come to banbury park she did not seem to mind banbury park she was to study hard and be governess she evidently thought she was having great was ﬁfteen and quite how could she be turned into governess sort of nursery governess farms perhaps but farms did not want books and worry miriam wanted to put her back into her farm and sometimes her thoughts wearily brushed the idea of going with her perhaps though she had come away because her father could not keep her the little problem hung about her she sat sweetly there common and good and strong the golden light that seemed to belong specially to her came from london garden an unreal north london garden resounding in its little spaces were the blatterings and shouts of the deaf and dumb next door 4 miss jenny left the standard with miriam after tea stopping suddenly she made her uncertain way from the to the door and saying absently eh you d better read this my dear there s leader on the education commission would ye like to yes i think you d better miriam accepted the large sheets with hesitating expressions of thanks wondering rather fearfully what leader might be and where she should ﬁnd it she knew the word her mother read the leaders in the excellent leader she sometimes said and her father would put down his volume of proceedings of the british association or herbert spencer s first principles and condescendingly agree but any discussion generally ended in his warning her not to believe thing because she saw it in print and reminder that before she married she had thought that everything she saw in print was true and quite often he would go on to general remarks about the gullibility of women bringing in the story of the two large pearly transparent room vases with stems and soft masses of roses and leaves painted on their sides that she had given too much at the door to man who said they were italian brummagem brummagem he would end mouthing the word and turning back to his book with the neighi ng laugh that made miriam turn to the imagined picture of her mother in the ﬁrst year of her married life standing in the sunlight at the back door of the babington house with the varnished door on her right and the cucumber frames in front of her sloping up towards the that began the kitchen garden with her little scallopped bodice her hooped skirt her hair bunched in curls up on her high pad and falling round her neck looking at the jugs with grave dark eyes

suffering under the ﬁerce gaslight feeling every night of her life winter and summer if the ceiling were coming down on her head and read leaders cautiously and knew when they were written in ﬁne chaste digniﬁed but that was the the standard was penny rag and probably not worth considering at all in any case she would not read it at evening study she had never had newspaper in her hand before far she could remember the girls would see that she did not know how to read it and it would be snubby towards them to sit there if she were miss perne scrumpling great paper while they sat with their books so she read her page of saxon kings with summary of each reign list of six english counties with their capitals and the rivers the capitals stood on and the principal industries of each town devising ways of remembering the lists and went on to bell s standard she had found the book amongst the school books on the schoolroom shelves it was standard book and must therefore be about something she ought to know something about if she were to hold her own in this north london world there had been standard books at school and the word offended her it suggested ﬁxed agreement about the things people ought to know and that she felt sure must be wrong and not only wrong but common standard readers standard pianoforte tutors she had learned to read in reading without tears and gone on to classical poems and prose the young her arithmetic book instead of being thin cold paper thing called standard i had been pleasant green volume called barnard smith that began at the beginning and went on to compound fractions and stocks there was morris s grammar at banbu ry park wetherell or english accidence bits from piers plowman and pages of scraps of words with the way they changed in different languages and quotations just sentences that had made her long more the mist she opened bell s standard elocutionist apprehensively her mind working on possible meanings elocutionist she thought of ventriloquist and wondered dismally whether it was book of conju ring tricks it was poems poems and prose all mixed up together anyhow the room was very still the girls all sitting reading with their backs to the table so that nobody she could not go on vaguely ﬂuttering pages so she read poem that was not divided up into verses robert of sicily brother of pope urbane and valmond emperor of allemaine apparelled in magniﬁcent attire with retinue of many knight and squire on john s eve at vespe rs proudly sat and heard the priests chant the should she go on it was like the pieces in scott s novels the best bits before the characters began to talk and bay the moon than such roman and bay the moon than such roman muttered nancie rapidly swinging her feet it would not be fair to read thing that would take her right away and not teach her anything whilst the girls were learning their things monday she hesitated and turned page the poem she saw soon began to break up into sentences with quotation signs somebody making turning several pages at once she caught sight of the word hanover hamelin town s in brunswick by famous hanover that was irresistible but she must read it one day away from the gassy room and the pressure of the girls the lines were magic but the rush that took her to the german town the sight and smell and sound of it the pointed houses wood ﬁres the bürgers had made her cheeks ﬂare and thrown her out of the proper teacher s frame of mind she wanted to stand up and pull up the blinds hiding the garden and shout the poem aloud to the girls they would stare and giggle and think she had gone mad the mountain has gone mad nancie would mutter there is mountain in banbury park covered over with yellow bark nancie s description of herself

the various girls whose afternoon practi ce it was her business to superintend their intent faces the pages of bad unclassical music things with horrible names by english composers the uselessness of the hours and terms and years of practice 5 presently the bread and butter and milk came up the girls and then there was three servants lined up in front of the bookshelves cook wheezing heavily tall and thin and bent with sloping mob cap and thin old brown face with forehead that was like buttress of shiny bone and startling dark eyes that protruded so that they could be seen even when she sat looking down into her lap and flora the parlo urmaid short and plump and brown with an expression of perfectly serene despair this was part of miriam s daily bread and annie the housemaid raw pink and gold and grinning slyly at the perne sitting at the head of the table with the shabby family bible and the book of family prayers miss jenny and miss haddie one on each side of the ﬁreplace miss jenny

chin rested on her thin chest her eyes darting from the servants to the girls who sat in their places round the table during the time it took miss perne to read short psalm miriam tried to cast down her eyes and close her ears all that went on during that short interval left her equally excluded from either party she could not sit gazing at flora and miss perne s polite unvarying tone brought her comfort she sometimes thought longingly of prayers in germany the big quiet saal with its high windows its great dark doors its annexe of wooden summer fräulein s clear brooding undertone the pensive calm of the german girls the strange mass of fresh melodious sound they all sang together here there seemed to be everything to encourage and nothing whatever to check the sudden murmur the lightning swift gesture of nancie or trixie the moment miss perne had ﬁnished her psalm they all swung round on to their knees miriam pressed her elbows against the cane seat of her chair and wondered what she should say to miss jenny at supper about the newspaper while miss perne decorously prayed that they might all be fed with the sincere milk of the word and grow thereby after the lord s prayer unison of breathy mutterings against closed ﬁngers they all rose then the servants ﬁled out of the room followed by the misses perne miss perne stopped in the doorway to shake hands with the girls on their way to bed before joining her sisters in the little across the hall one of the servants reappeared almost at once with tray distributed its contents at the end of the long table and rang the little bell in the hall on her way back to the kitchen the misses perne ﬁled back across the hall 6 eh deborah are ye sure said miss jenny getting into her chair at miss perne s right 90 the project gutenberg ebook of backwater pilgrimage volume 2 by dorothy richardson https the newspaper would not be mentioned after all if it were she would simply say she had been preparing monday and was going to read it after supper anyhow there was never any threat with the pernes of anything she would not be able to deal with she glanced to see what there was to eat and then feeling miss haddie s eye from across the table assumed an air of interested abstraction to cover her disappointment cold white blancmange in round dish garnished with prunes bread and butter square of cream cheese on dessert

sweet fruit could people eat cheese well my dear i tell you only what i saw with my own allen and eunice dupont running about in the park without their ech syphoned miss haddie drawing her delicate eyebrows sharply towards the deep line in the middle of her forehead she did not look up but sat frowning sourly into her bowl of bread and milk ladling and pouring the milk from the spoon miriam kept nervous eye on her acid preoccupation one had seen the behaviour of her own face how one corner of her mouth had shot up so sharply to bring the feeling of deeply denting dimple in her cheek she sat regulating her breathing and carefully extracting the stone from prune did ye speak to them asked miss jenny ﬁxing her tall sister over her miss perne sat smilingly upright her black eyes blinking rapidly at the off bookshelves i did not speak to eh deborah why not scolded miss jenny miss perne drew breath i did not speak to them went on miss deborah beaming delightedly at the bookcase the very good reason that i was not sufﬁciently near to them i was walking upon the asphalt pathway surrounding the lake and had just become engaged in conversation with brinkwell who had stopped the purpose of giving further details with regard to constance s prolonged absence from school when i saw polly and eunice apparently chasing one another across the recreation ground in the condition i have described to miriam who had felt miss haddie s eyes playing watchfully over her sat pressing the sharp edge of her high heel into her ankle eh my dear what pity you couldn t speak to them they ve business at all in the recreation ground where the rough boys well i have described to you the circumstances my dear and the impossibility of my undertaking any kind of eh well deborah my dear i think i should have done something don t you think you ought eh called someone managed to get at the gels in some dear what is to be done you see it is hardly of any use to speak to them afterwards you want to catch them and make them feel ashamed of i am fully prepared to admit my dear jenny the justice of all that you say but i can only repeat that in the circumstances in which i found myself i was entirely unable to exercise any control whatever upon the doings of the gels they were running and long before i was free from brinkwell they were out of miss perne spoke in clear high narrative tone that seemed each moment on the point of delighted laughter her delicate head held high her ﬁnely wrinkled face puckering with restrained pleasure miriam saw vividly the picture in the park the dreadful mean grubby lake the sad asphalt pathway all round it the shabby london greenery the october wind rushing through it miss perne s high stylish arrowy ﬁgure ﬂuttered by the wind swaying in

rushing across it and held herself sternly back from vision of miss perne chasing the delinquents down the wind why did miss perne speak so triumphantly much to say there my dear jenny there s problem you can t answer she enjoyed telling the tale and was not really upset about the girls she spoke exactly if she were reading aloud from robinson miss haddie was watching again ﬂashing her eyes about she gently spooned up her bread and milk miriam wished she knew whether miss haddie knew how difﬁcult it was to listen gravely she was evidently angry and disgusted but still she could watch did ye go that way at all way the girls went i did not beamed miss perne turning to miss jenny if waiting judgment well eh i m sure really it s most difﬁkilt what is one to with these gels now miriam here s something you to exercise your wits upon what would ye eh miriam hesitated memories kept her dumb of course she had never rushed about in common park where rough boys came at the same the girls wanted to rush about and scream and wear hats nobody had any right to interfere with them they ought to be suppressed though north london girls capable of anything in the way of horridness the pernes did not seem to see how horrid the girls were in themselves common and knowing and horrid dear funny little s they were something much more than that they were wrong about the hats but it was good heavenly to be here like this with them she turned to miss jenny her mind in warm confusion and smiled into the little red face peering delicately from out its disorderly gor gon loops well my dear jenny said miss haddie s soft hollow voice how should the child judge miriam s heart leapt she smiled inane ly and eagerly accepted second helping of blancmange suddenly proffered by miss perne who was drawing little panting breaths and blinking sharply at her nonsense haddie come along my dear it s chance you come tomboys said miss haddie indignantly miriam drew breath it was wrong they were not knew they had not run like had scuttled she was girls that was what they were nothing the pernes could understand the pernes ought not to be bothered with them well she said feeling sudden security are we responsible them out of school hours miss haddie s eyebrows moved nervously and miss perne s smile turned to dubious mouthing eh there you are d ye see deborah that s it that s the crucial point are we responsible i m sure i can t say that places the whole difﬁculty in nutshell here are these gels not even day boarders how far can we control their general behaviour eh i m sure i don t know my dear jenny said miss haddie quickly her hollow voice reverberating if she were using gargle it s quite obvious that we can t have gels known to belong to the school running about in the park with nothing i agree my dear haddie but jenny says how are we to prevent such conduct don t let us lose sight of miriam s point are we responsible their times i suppose we re not you know deborah really after all not directly perhaps but sheerly we are indir ectly responsible sheerly we ought to be able to make it impossible them to carry on in this unseemly 95 96 97 the project gutenberg ebook of backwater pilgrimage volume 2 by dorothy richardson https yes yes said miss deborah eagerly sheerly is it education suggested miriam that s it my dear it is education that s what s wanted that s what these gels want i don t know though all this talk of education it ought to be the thing and yet look at these two gels both of them from miss cass there s her school now famous all over london three hundred gels we ve had several here and they ve all had that objectionable noisy tone eh deborah i don t know how is it to be accounted eh i ve never heard of miss cass s said miriam my dear child it s not possible d ye mean to say ye don t know miss cass s high school oh if it s high school of course all three ladies waited with their eyes on her making chorus of inarticulate sounds oh well high schools are simply miriam glowed in tide of gentle cackling laughter well you know i think there s something in it giggled miss jenny softly it s the number perhaps that s what i always say deborah treating the gels like soldiers like regiment d ye see individual study of the gels well however that may be i am sure of one thing i am sure that on monday polly and eunice must be reprimanded severely yes i suppose they must they re nice gels at heart you know both of them that s the worst of it well i hardly mean that only so often the naughty gels are so likable at bottom ye know eh i m sure i don t know 7 miriam sat on in the schoolroom after supper with the newspaper spread out on the brown american cloth table cover under the gas she found long column headed the royal commission on the queen then was interesting herself in education but in england the sovereign had power was only ﬁgurehead perhaps the queen had been advised to interest herself in education by the privy council and the conservatives people of leisure and cultivation commission was sort of must be important something the privy council had decided and sent out in the queen s name she read her column sitting comfortle ssly between the window and the open door she read the room grew still the memory of the talking and clinking supper faded and presently even the ticking of the clock was longer there she raised her head at last wonder people read newspapers you could read about what was going on in the country actually what the government was doing at that very moment of course men seemed to know such lot because they read the news papers and talked about what was in them but anybody could know much the men sitting in the armchairs if they chose read all about everything written down everybody to see that was the freedom of the that the history books said so much about and was one of those new important things more important than facts and dates like the independence of ireland yet very few people really talked like newspapers only angry men with loud voices here was the free press that milton had gone to prison certainly it made great difference the room was quite changed there was hardly any pain in the silent seated chairs there were really people making the world better now at last perhaps it was rather happy fate to be teacher in the banbury park school and read newspapers there were plenty of people who could neither read nor99 100 the project gutenberg ebook of backwater pilgrimage volume 2 by dorothy richardson https someone had servant like that who did

if only she were at home how she could rush up and down the house and shout about it and shake mary by the shoul ders she shrank into herself and sat stifﬂy up suddenly discovering she was lounging over the table she moved she reﬂected that probably gladstone s being so very dark made him determined that things should not go on they were in that case gladstonians would be not musical someone had said musical people were queer soft lot laissez faire lazy fair but perhaps it was possible to be fair and musical and to be gladstonian too you can t have your cake and eat it it was good thing one s best self knew it was good thing that someone had found out why people were so awful like dentist ﬁnding out bad tooth however much it hurt only if education was going to be the principal thing and all teachers were to be qualiﬁed it was use going on miss jenny had said private schools were doomed 8 long time she sat blankly contemplating the new world that was coming everyone would be trained and efﬁci ent but herself she was not strong enough to earn living and qualify teacher at the same time the day s work tired her to death she must hide somewhere she would not be wanted if you were

hall table and went slowly upstairs watching the faint reﬂection of the hall gas upon the polished balustrade the staircase was cold and airy cold rooms and landings stretched up away above her into the darkness she became aware of curious buoyancy rising within her it was so strange that she stood still moment on the stair second life seemed to cease in her and the staircase to be swept from under her feet i m it was if something had struck her struck right through her impalpable body sweeping it away leaving her there shouting silently without it i m alive i m alive then with thump her heart went on again and her feet carried her body warm and happy and elastic easily on up the solid stairs she tried once or twice deliberately to bring back the breathless moment standing still on stair each time something of it returned it s this is being alive she murmured with feeling under her like the sudden drop of lift but her thoughts distracted her they were eagerly talking to her declaring that she had had this feeling before she opened her bedroom door very quietly the air of the room told her that nancie and beadie were asleep going lightly across to the chest of drawers by the window if she were treading on air she stood holding its edge in the darkness two forgotten incidents ﬂowed past her in quick succession one of waking up on her seventh birthday in the seaside villa alone in small dark room and suddenly saying to herself that one day her father and mother would die and she would still be there and after curious moment when the darkness seemed to move

been doing since friday gertie miriam said presently we went walk said gertie in neat liquid little voice dimpling and faintly raising her eyebrows the eight little girls who made up the upper class of the junior school stood in close row near possible to miriam s chair at the head of the table they were silent and fresh and eagerly crowded waiting her to begin she106 107 108 the project

with the youngest class drawn up in their scripture lesson was an approving presence keeping her own little class at level of quiet question and answer that made background rather than disturbance the adventure of the elder girls not too close together said miriam at last gathering herself with deep breath throw back your shoulders and stand straight don t lump down on your heels let your weight come on the ball of your feet are you all all right don t poke your heads the girls eagerly manœuvred themselves wilfully carrying out her instructions even to turning their heads to face the opposite

answers bore relationship to the questions and gertie could only pipe replies if the questions were so put to contain part of the answer the girl was beginning to gnaw her ﬁngers by the time the questioning was at an end well now what is the difﬁculty said miriam of getting hold of the events of this queer little reign everybody laughed and was silent again at once because miriam s voice went on trying to interest both herself and the successful girls in inventing ways of remembering all the things that had to be hooked on to the word in less than ten minutes even the stout snoring girl could repeat the reign successfully and the remainder of their time they talked aimlessly the children standing at ease saying whatever occurred to them even the snoring girl secured from ridicule by miriam s consideration of whatever was offered their adventure took them away from their subject into what miriam knew clever people would call side nothing is side issue she told herself passionately

of her eyes in the shimmering cloud of her hair the strangest hair in the school negroid in its intensity of fuzziness but saved by its ﬁne mesh don t you adore kiddies miss henderson i think they re

girls who attended only few subjects she was dark girl with thick shoulders receding mouth and boldly drawn nose and chin gave her look of shrewd elderliness the heavy mass of hair above the broad sweep of her forehead her heavy frame and 114 the project gutenberg ebook of backwater pilgrimage volume 2 by dorothy richardson https added to this appearance she wore black serge pinafore dress with black crape vest and sleeves you mind speaking to you she said in hot voice her fringed brown eyes were ﬁxed on the garden railings where people passed by and miriam never looked said miriam shyly you

glancing fearfully at the heavy scroll of proﬁle and ﬁnding it expressive and confused we ve got house about quarter big where we used to miriam found it impossible to respond to this confession and still tried desperately to sweep away the sense of the ﬁgure so solidly planted at her side i ve asked our aunt if we can ask you to come to tea with thank you very much said miriam in one word when could you come oh i m afraid i couldn t come it would be oh you must come i shall ask aunt lucy to write to miss i really couldn t come i shouldn t be able to ask you that doesn t matter panted the relentless voice i ve wanted to speak to you ever since you 3 when next miriam saw the brooms and their aunt ﬁle past the transept where were the wordsworth house sittings she felt that to visit them might perhaps not be the ordeal she had not dared to picture it would be strange those three heavy women their small new house she imagined them sitting at tea in little room why was grace so determined that she should sit there too grace had life and home and was real she did not know that things were awful nor did florrie broom nor the aunt but yet they did not look like social people they were little different not worldly not pious either nor intellect ual what could they want with her she had soon forgotten them and the congregation assumed its normal look the service went on the thoughts came that came every sunday an old woman with girl at her side were the only people whose faces were within miriam s line of vision from her place at the wall end of the wordsworth house pew the people in front of them were not even in proﬁle and those behind were hidden from her by the angle of the transept wall to her right she could just see rising above the heads in the rows of pews in front of her the far end of the chancel screen the faces grouped in the transept on the opposite side of the church were blur the two ﬁgures sat or knelt or stood in heavy silence they neither sang nor prayed their faces remained unaltered during the whole service to miriam they were its most intimate part during the sermon she rarely raised her eyes from the circle they ﬁlled her they sat thrown into relief by the great white pillar their faces were turned towards the chancel they could see its high dim roof and distant altar the light on the116 117 the project gutenberg ebook of

face with its heavy seemed to have been dead years under its black bonnet her large body was covered by mantle of thickly ribbed black material trimmed with braid and bugles that bright yellow colour meant liver whatever she had she was dying of it people were always dying when they looked like that but it was bad way to die the real way was the way of that lady trailing about over the heath near roehampton dying by inches of an internal complaint with her face looking the little alabaster chapelle in the nursery with candle alight inside she was going to die walking about alone on the heath in the afternoons her family going on usual at home the greengro cer calling she knew that everybody was alone and that all the fuss and noise people made all day was pretence what to to be walking about with quiet face meeting death nothing could be so alone that the pain and struggle and darkness that was what the old woman feared she did not think about death she was afraid and sullen all the time stunned sitting there with her cold common daughter she had been common herself girl but more noisy and she had married and never thought about dying and now she was dying and hating her cold daughter the daughter sitting there with her stiff coat and skirt her indistinct hat tied with thin harsh veil to her small ﬂat home with her in it all the time she would never laugh her cheeks were yellowish her fringe dry without gloss she would move her mouth when she spoke sideways with snarling curl of of the upper lip and have that resentful way of speaking that all north londoners have and the maddening north london accent the old woman s voice would be deep and hollow the girl moving heavily about the house wearing boots and stiff dresses and stiff stays showing their outline through her clothes they would be bitter to their servant and would not trust her what was the good of their being alive house and water system and drains and cooking and they would take all these things granted and grumble and snarl the gas meter man would call there did men like that resent calling at houses like that they d just say the ole party she sez to how good they were these men good and kind and cheerful someone ought to prevent the extravagance of keeping whole houses and ﬁres going women like that they ought to be in an institution but they never thought about that they were satisﬁed with themselves they were because they did not know what they were like why should you have house and tradesmen calling jehoiakin the rush of indistinct expostulating sound coming from the pulpit was accompanied moment by reverberations of the one clearly bawled word the sense of the large cold church the great stone pillars the long narrow windows faintly stained with yellowish green the harsh north london congregation stirred and seemed to settle down more securely she saw the form of the vicar in the light grey stone pulpit standing up short and neat against the cold grey stone wall enveloped in ﬁne soft folds his small puckered hands beautifully cuffed his plump crumpled little face his small bald head fringed with little curls his pink pouched busy mouth what was it all about pompous pottering going on and on and the old testament the whole church was in the old testament honour thy father and thy mother how horribly the words would echo through the great cold church why honour thy father and thy mother wha t had they done that was so honourable everybody was dying in cold secret fear christ the son of god was part of it all the same family vindictive christmas and easter hard white cold ﬂowers real explanation i came not to destroy but to the stagnant blood ﬂushed in her face and tingled in her ears the words occurred to her why didn t everybody die at once and stop it all 119 120 121 the project gutenberg ebook of backwater pilgrimage volume 2 by dorothy richardson https miss haddie paused at the door of her room and wheeled suddenly round to face miriam who had just reached the landing you ve not seen my little corner she tweedled breathlessly throwing open her door miriam went in oh how nice she said fearfully breathing in the freshness of little square room taking refuge at the window she found narrow view of the park greener than the one she knew the wide yellow pathway going up through the cricket ground had shifted away to the right it s really from your oh said miriam vivaciously there s door door i daresay you ve oh that s the door in our cupboard the dim door behind the hanging garments led to nothing but to miss haddie s room she began unbuttoning her gloves miss haddie was hesitating near cupboard making little sounds i suppose we must all make ourselves tidy now said miriam i thought you didn t look very happy in church this morning cluttered miss haddie rapidly miriam felt heavy with anger oh she said clumsily i had the most frightful poor child i thought ye didn t look the window was shut but the room was mysteriously fresh far away from the school ﬂy was hovering about the muslin window blind with little reedy loops of song the oboe in the quintet thought miriam suddenly i don t know she said listening the ﬂies sang like this at home she had heard them without knowing it she moved in her place by the window the ﬂy swept up to the ceiling wavering on deep note like tiny gong hot sunny reﬁned lawns roses in bowls on summerhouse reﬁned voices far away from the caledonian road flies don t buzz she said passionately they don t buzz why people say they buzz the pain pressing behind her temples slackened in moment it would be only glow miss haddie stood with bent head her face turning from side to side with its sour hesitating smile her large eyes darting their strange glances about the room won t you sit down minute they haven t sounded the ﬁrst bell miriam sat down on the one little chair near the said miss haddie beginning to unfasten her veil she doesn t approve of general conversation thought miriam she s female oh well she ll have to see i m what gave you yer headache oh well i don t know i suppose i was wondering what it was all i don t think i quite understand well

phrases would not miss haddie i couldn t agree with anything he 123 124 the project gutenberg ebook of backwater pilgrimage volume 2 by dorothy richardson https haddie sat down on the edge of the little white bed burying her face in her hands and smoothing them up and down with wiping movement one can always criticise sermon she said reproachfully well why not i mean to say ye can said miss haddie from behind her ﬁngers but but ye shouldn you can t help oh yes ye can if ye listen in the right spirit gargled miss haddie hurriedly oh it isn t only the sermon it s the whole thing said miriam crimsoning ye mustn t think about the speaker went on miss haddie in faint hurried rebuke that s wrong that sets people running from church to church you must attend your own parish church in the right spirit let the preacher be who he may oh but i think that s positively danger ous said miriam gravely it simply means leaving your mind open whatever they choose to say like eh ﬂared miss

he likes with that s what it is that s what they i ve seen it again and again i ve heard people talking about sermons ﬁnished miriam with vivacious intentness miss haddie sat very still with her hands once more pressed tightly against her face oh my dear this is dreadful state of affairs i m afraid you re all wrong that s not it at all if you listen only the good the good will come to but these men don t know how should they they don t agree amongst oh my dear that is very wrong attitude how long have ye felt like this oh all my life responded miriam proudly i m very sorry my dear ever since i

with yer vicar not i knew his mind too well had heard him preach years he would have run round my questions he wasn t capable of answering them instance supposing i had asked him what i ve always

was not supernatural then there s nothing in the whole my dear child i m dreadfully sorry ye feel like that i d idea ye felt like that poor child i knew ye weren t quite happy always i mean i ve thought ye weren t quite happy in yer mind sometimes but i d eh have ye ever consulted able to give ye advice there you are that s exactly the whole thing who can one consult there isn t anybody the people who are qualiﬁed are the people who have the thing called faith which means that they beg the whole question from the 126 127 the project gutenberg ebook of backwater pilgrimage volume 2 by

god well you see i see things like this on one side prime cause with certain object unknown to bringing humanity into being on the other side humanity all more or less miserable never having been consulted to whether they wanted to come to life if that is belief south sea islander could have it but good people people with faith want to believe that one day god sent saviour to rescue the world from sin and that the world can never be grateful enough and must become christ well if god made people he is responsible and ought to save what yer parents think about yer ideas they don t know ye ve never mentioned yer trouble to them i did ask pater once when we were coming home from the stabat mater that question i ve told you what did he say he couldn t answer we were just by the gate he said he thought it was remarkably reasonable dilemma he and ye ve never had any discussion of these things with him ye re an independent young woman said miss haddie miriam looked up miss haddie was sitting on the edge of her bed faint pink ﬂush on her cheeks made her eyes look almost blue she was longer frowning i m something kind of different world she is wondering i must stick to my guns mused miriam i ll not ask ye said miss haddie quietly and cheerfully to expect any help from yer fellow creatures since ye ve such poor opinion of them but ye re not happy why not go straight to the source miriam waited moment the sheen on miss haddie s silk sleeves had distracted her by becoming gentle and unchallenging the light on her mother s dresses when there were other people in the room she had feared the leaping out of some emotional appeal but miss haddie had plan strange secret knowledge i should like to ask ye yes well i ll put it in this way while ye ve watched the doings of yer fellow creatures ye ve gotten that the truth ye re seeking is miriam pondered that s where ye ought to begin and how fancy ye ve been neglecting means of grace i think ye miss haddie rose and crossed the room to little bookshelf at the head of her bed talking happily on upright dart commented miriam mentally waiting the fulﬁlment of the promise of miss haddie s cheerfulness against the straight lines of the miss haddie showed swaying slightly backwards from the waist she moved the ﬁrst bell rang and miriam got up to go miss haddie came forward with small volume in her hands and held it out standing close by her and keeping her own hold on the volume ye ll ﬁnd argument in it not but i think few sound arguments would ye good give it try don t be necked just read it and the smooth soft leather slipped altogether into miriam s hands and she felt the passing contact of cool small hand and noted faint ﬁne scent coming to her from miss haddie s person in her own room she found that the soft binding of the book had rounded corners and nothing on the cover but small plain gold cross in the corner she feasted her eyes on it she took off her things when the second bell rang she glanced inside the cover preparation holy 129 130 the project gutenberg ebook of backwater pilgrimage volume 2 by dorothy richardson https hiding it in her long drawer under pile of linen she ran to the door running back again she took it out and put it together with her prayer book and hymn book in the small top drawer 5 the opportunity to use miss haddie s book came with nancie s departure visit beadie was in the deeps of her ﬁrst sleep and the room seemed empty the book lay open on her bed she noted she placed it there when she began preparing bed that it was written by bishop man she knew by name being still alive it struck her extraordinary that book should be printed and read while the author was alive and she turned away with feeling of shame from the idea of the bishop still going about in his lawn sleeves and talking while people read book that he had written in his study but it was very interesting to have the book to look at because he probably knew about modern people with doubts and would not think about them inﬁdels an honest agnostic has my sympathy he might say and it was possible he did not believe in eternal punishment if he did he would not have had his book printed with rounded edges and that beautiful little cross line upon line and the pilgrim s progress were not meant modern minds archbishop whateley had chaste and eloquent wit and was great gardener witty archbishop fond of gardening was simply aggravating and silly restraining her desire to hurry miriam completed her toilet and at last knelt down in her its pinked fell heavily against her face she leant over the bed tucking it into her neck she clasped her outstretched hands leaving the book within the circle of her arms the attitude seemed little lacking in respect the beautifully printed pages flattening her entwined hands between herself and the edge of the bed she read very slowly that just worldly communion men cleanse and deck their bodies so attendance at the holy feast must there be cleansing and decking of the spirit she knelt upright feeling herself grow very grave the cold air of the bedroom ﬂowed round her carrying conviction then that dreadful feeling at early service kneeling like lump in the pew too late to begin to be good the exhausted moments by the altar challenging light on the shining brass rod on the priest s ring and the golden lining of the cup the curious bite of the wine in the sullen disappointed all the strange failure was due to lack of preparation she knelt some moments without thoughts breathing in the cleansing air sighing heavily at intervals what she ought to was clear certain time preparation could be taken every night kneeling up in bed with the gas out if nancie were awake and specially long time on saturday night the decision took her back to her book she read that man can cleanse himself but it is his part to examine his conscience and confess his sins with prayer cleansing grace the list of questions to sins past and present in thought word and deed brought back the sense of her body with its load of memories could they be got rid of she could cast them off feel them sliding away like christian s burden but was that all was it being reconciled with your brother to throw off without letting him know and telling him you were sorry unkind deeds and words those you met would ﬁnd out the change but all the you had offended from your youth your family write to them sense of checking of the tide that had seemed to ﬂow through her ﬁnger came with this suggestion and miriam knelt heavily on the hard ﬂoor feeling the weight of her known body the attracted her attention and the honeycomb132 133 134 the project gutenberg ebook of backwater pilgrimage volume 2 by dorothy richardson https of the thick fringed white counterpane she shut the little book and rose from her knees moving quickly about the room she turned at random to her washhand basin and vigorously rewashed her hands in its soapy water

comfortably come and sit with us when ye ve done we ll have supper in the m smiling and laughing she turned eagerly away of course miss perne said miriam in loud wavering voice arresting her i enjoyed my holidays but i want to tell you how glad i am to be back yes yes said miss perne hilariously we re all there was little break in her voice and miriam saw that she would have once more taken her in her arms i like being here she said hoarsely looking down and supported herself by putting two trembling ﬁngers on the hall table she was holding back from the gnawing of the despair that had made her sick with pain when she heard once more the of the north london trams this strong feeling of pride in miss perne was beating it down i m very glad my dear responded miss perne in quivering gleeful falsetto if you can t have what you like you must like what you have said miriam over and over to herself she went with heavy feet up the four ﬂights of stairs 2 candle was already burning in the empty bedroom i m back i m back it s all over she gasped she shut the door and jolly good thing too this is my place i can keep myself here and cost nothing and not interfere with anybody it s just if i d never been away it ll always be like that now short holidays gone in minute and then the long term getting out of touch with everything things happening knowing nothing about them going home like visitor and people talking to you about things that are only theirs now and not wanting to hear about yours not about the little real everyday things that give you an idea of anything but only the startling things that are not important you have to think of them though to make people awful awful awful really only putting people further away afterwards when you ve told the thing and their interest dies down and you can t think of anything else to say miss perne s hair is perfectly black coal and she s the eldest just fancy then everybody looks up my room s downstairs the room where i teach is in the basement directly breakfast is basement what pity basement rooms are awfully bad and by the time you have stopped them exclaiming and are just going to begin you see that they are ﬁdgetting and thinking about something eve had listened little because she wanted to tell everything about her own place and136 137 the project gutenberg ebook of backwater pilgrimage volume 2 by

be in house with worry about money and plenty of jolly food green is so strong and clever she can anything she s good she keeps would you like to be like her of course they re all so even when they re old her sister s forty and she s still pretty not given up hope eve eve had listened but not agreed about the teaching about making the girls see how easy it was to get hold of the things and then letting them talk about other things i see how you it and i see why the girls obey you of funny eve thought it was hard and inhuman that s what she really thought two newly purchased lengths of spotted net veiling were lying at the top of her lightly packed trunk partly folded in uncrumpled tissue paper she took the crisp net very gently into her hands getting sitting alone on the ﬂoor by her trunk the full satisfaction that had failed her in the shop with harriett s surprise at her sudden desire ﬂowing over the counter and infecting the charm of baskets full of cheap stockings and common handkerchiefs some of which had borders so narrow and faint really hardly to show when they were scrumpled up veiling moddom yes moddom the assistant had retorted when she had asked veil wot on earth fower without answering harriett she had bought two there was need to have bought two one could go back in the trunk store they would be the beginning of gradually getting suitable outﬁt things

she was in it alone sometimes and knew one verse will be opening her bible at random she read and not only so but we glory in tribulations also knowing that tribulation worketh eagerly closing the

probably miss perne went up occasionally to look at them and see that they were all right clean and tidy they had to go up every night carrying little jugs of water and making noise on the stairs and come down every morning they were the there would never be any dancing nobody thought about them they could not get away from each other and cook to be general servant would be very hard work perhaps

afternoons and evenings dragging you along further and further and changing you months and months and years until it was too late to get back and there was nothing ahead the thing to remember to keep

money spent on ﬂowers and gloves and blouses keeping stiff and sensible all the time the family of the two little quaker girls had home library with lists an inventory lending each other their books

same plain clothes you had to be certain sort of person to that it would spoil the holidays to be like that at home every penny must be spent if only on things other people not spending would bring nice strong secret feeling and horrid expression into one s eyes the only way was to give up your family and stay at your work like flora and have box of in your drawer spend and always be afraid of rainy days save and never enjoy life at all but going out now and again in the holidays feeling stiff and governessy and just beginning to learn to be oneself again when it was time to go back was not

to give everything up why you make suf fer so 149 the project gutenberg ebook of backwater pilgrimage volume 2 by dorothy richardson https vi 1 iecemeal statements in her letter home brought miriam now and again momentary sense of developing activities but she did not recognise the completeness of the change in her position at the school until through her second term she found herself talking to the new pupil teacher she had heard apathetically of her existence during supper conversations with the misses perne at the beginning of the term she was an irish girl of sixteen one of large family living on the outskirts of dublin and would be boarder attending the ﬁrst class english and earning pocket money by helping with the lower school the weeks went on and miriam grew accustomed to hearing her began to associate it with an idea of charm that brought her sinking of heart she knew her position in the esteem of the pernes was secure but this new young teacher would work strange miracles with the girls she would it quite easily and unconsciously the girls would be easy with her and would laugh and one would have to hear them however when at last her arrival was near and the three ladies discussed the difﬁculty of having her met miriam plied them until they reluctantly gave her permission to go taking workman s train that would bring her to euston station at seven clock in the morning at the end of an hour spent pacing the platform exhausted with cold and excitement and the monotonously reiterated effort to imagine the arrival of one of hungerford s heroines from train journey miriam whose costume had been described in letter to the girl s mother was startled wandering amidst the vociferous passengers at the luggage end of the newly arrived train by liquid colourless intimate voice at her elbow i think i ll be right to say how d you she turned and saw slender girl in toque and an fashioned coat and skirt what were they to say to each other two dowdy struggling women both in the same box she must get her to banbury park quickly possible it was dreadful that they should be seen together there on the platform in their ragbag clothes at any rate they must not talk oh i m very pleased to see you i m glad you v come i suppose the train must have been late she said eagerly ah we ll be late i dare venture haven t an idea of the hour oh yes said miriam emphatically i m sure the train s where ll we ﬁnd core what we ll need core the oh yes cab we must get cab we d better ﬁnd porter ah i ve man here seeking out my inside the cab julia s face shone chalky white and miriam found that her eyes looked like weymouth sea in general on days when clouds keep sweeping across the sun when she laughed she had dimples and the thick white rims of her eyelids looked like piping cord round her eyes but she was not pretty there were lines in her cheeks well dimples and there was something apologetic in her little gusty laugh she laughed good deal they started off saying things little quiet remarks that miriam could not151 152 153 the project gutenberg ebook of backwater pilgrimage volume 2 by dorothy richardson https and that did not seem to be answers to her efforts to make conversation perhaps she was not going the right way to make her talk perhaps she had not said any of the things she thought she had said she cleared her throat and looked out of the window thinking over possible opening i ve never been so glad over anything in my life hearing you re one of the teachers said julia presently the pernes call by my name so i suppose you will too you re teacher said miriam headlong that s awfully sweet of you replied julia laughing and blushing clear deep rose it makes anyone feel at home i ll be looking out till i hear it miriam laughed isn t it funny that people don t like saying their own i wish you d tell about your teaching i m sure you re awf ly clever miriam gave her list of the subjects she taught in the lower school you know all there is to know oh well and then i take the top girls now german and the second class french reading and two arithmetic classes in the upper school and shell of two very stupid girls to help with their college of you re frightening 2 miriam looked out of the cab window hardly hearing julia s next remark the drab brick walls of king s cross station were coming towards them when they had got themselves and julia s luggage out of the cab and into the train banbury park she was still pondering uneasily over her own dislike of appearing successful teacher this stranger saw her only teacher that was what she had become if she was really teacher now just that in life it meant that she must decide at once whether she really meant to teach always everyone now would think of her teacher someone who was never going to anything else when really she had not even begun to think about doing any of the things that professional teachers had to she was not qualifying herself examinations in her spare time her predecessor had done supposing she did this girl julia would certainly expect her to be doing so what then if she were to work very hard and also develop her

by dorothy richardson https having come in at ten clock to turn out the gas and found miriam sitting unoccupied the room was cold and close with the gas and miriam had turned upon her with scornful half laugh when she had playfully exclaimed at ﬁnding her there so late miss haddie was obviously still little excited she had presided at schoolroom tea and julia had ﬁlled the room with bay the streets the jarveys and their outside cars her journey the channel boat her surprise at england eh what s the matter miriam my dear some time miriam had parried her questions ﬁercely demanding that her mood should be understood without clue presently they had slid into an irritated discussion of the respective values of sleep before and sleep after midnight in the midst of which miriam had said savagely i wish to goodness i knew what to about miss haddie s kindly desire gave her relief what did she mean but the hopelessness of imagining that anybody could anything about anything nobody could ever understand what anyone else really wanted only some people were fortunate miss haddie was one of the fortunate ones she had her share in the school and many wealthy relatives and the very best kind of good clothes and good deal of strange jewelry and whatever happened there was money and her sisters and relatives to look after her without feeling it burden because of the expense and there she sat at the table looking at what she thought she could see in another person s life if only one knew in the least what one ought to said miriam crossly miss haddie began speaking in halting murmur and miriam rushed on with ﬂaming face i suppose i shall have to go on teaching all my life and i can t think how on earth i m going to it i don t see how i can work in the evenings my eyes get so tired if you don t get certiﬁcates there s prospect and even if i did my throat is simply agonies at the end of each eh my dear child i m sorry to hear that why have ye taken to that is it something

voice oh yes murmured miss haddie cheerfully there s one who oh yes said miriam tugging thread out of the fraying edge of the table cover but it s practically impossible to discover what on earth they mean you to my dear she said in an angry guttural ye re always miriam tugged at the thread and bit her lips why ye suppose ye ll go on teaching all yer life perhaps ye ll marry oh ye can t oh i never any case now have ye quarrelled with him oh well him said miriam roundly digging pencil point between the grainings of the it s they i think goodness knows i don t know it s so perfectly extraordinary

like that things happen sometimes just when ye least expect not to oh things will happen to fear now my dear child trot along with ye of f to miriam braced herself against miss haddie s gentle shaking of her shoulders and the quiet kiss on her forehead that followed it 4 the strengthening of her intimacy with miss haddie was the ﬁrst of the many changes brought to miriam by julia doyle at the beginning of the spring term her two room mates were transferred to julia s care the two back rooms became little hive of girls over which julia seemed to preside she handled them all easily there was rollicking and laughter in the back bedrooms but never any sign that the girls were going too far and their escapades were not allowed to reach across the landing her large front room was miriam realised the term went on being secretly and ﬁercely guarded by julia the fabric of the days too had changed all the midday constitutional when she often found julia at her side walking in her curious springy lounging way and took the walk in comforting silence resting her weary throat during the evenings of study and the unemployed intervals of the long seemed to come between her and the girls she mastered them all with her speech and laughter miriam felt that when they were all together she was always in some hidden way on the alert she never jested with miriam but when they were alone and rarely then usually she addressed her in low tone and if half beside herself with some overpowering emotion it was owing too to julia s presence in the school that an unexpected freedom came to miriam every day during the hour between afternoon school and 162 the project gutenberg ebook of backwater pilgrimage volume 2 by dorothy richardson https by the rapid increase towards the end of the winter term of the exhaustion visiting her at the end of each day she had conﬁded in her mother who had wept at this suggestion of an attack on her health and called in the family doctor more air he said testily air and miriam repeated this to miss perne who at once arranged that she should be free if she chose to go out every afternoon between school and at ﬁrst she went into the park every day it was almost empty during the week at that hour the cricket green was sparsely decked with children and their maids few strollers were left along the poplar avenue and round the lake but away on the further slopes usually avoided in the midday walks because the girls found them oppressive miriam discovered the solitary spring air day by day she went if by appointment to meet it it was the same wandering eloquent air she had known from the beginning of things whilst she walked along the little gravel pathways winding about over the clear green slopes in the ﬂood of afternoon light it stayed with her the day she had just passed through was touched by it it added warm promise to the hours that lay the evening s reading the possible visit of miss haddie the quiet of her solitary room the coming of sleep one day she left the pathways and strayed amongst pools of shadow lying under the great trees she approached the giant trunks and the detail of their shape and colour grew clearer her breathing quickened she felt her prim bearing about her like cloak the reality she had found was leaving her again looking up uneasily into the forest of leaves above her head she found them strange she walked quickly back into the sunlight gazing reproachfully at the trees there they were she had always known them but between them and herself was her governess veil close drawn holding them sternly away from her the warm comforting communicative air was round her but she could not recover its secret she looked fearfully about her to get away somewhere by herself every day would not be enough if that was all she could have there would come time when there would be nothing anywhere day or two she came out and walked feverishly about in other parts of the park resentfully questioning the empty vistas one afternoon far away but coming towards her if in answe r to her question was the ﬁgure of man walking quickly moment her heart cried out to him if he would come straight on and understanding would walk into her life and she could face things knowing that he was there the light would come back and would stay until the there would be other lives on and on she stood transﬁxed trembling he grew more and more distinct and she saw handbag and the outline of bowler hat north london clerk hurrying home to tea with bent head she turned away and dragged her shamed heavy limbs rapidly towards home 5 early in may came day of steady rain enveloped in and sheltered under her lowered umbrella she ventured down the hill towards the shops near the railway arch the overshadowed street began to be crowded with jostling ﬁgures people were pouri ng from the city trams at the terminus and coming out of the station entrance in steady stream hard intent faces clashing umbrellas the harsh snarling monotone of the north london voice gave her the feeling of being an intruder everything seemed to wonder what she was doing down there instead of being at home in the schoolroom sudden angry eye above coarse loudly talking mouth all but made her turn to go with instead of against the tide but she pushed blindly on and through and presently found herself in quiet side street just off the station road looking164 165 166 the project gutenberg ebook of backwater pilgrimage volume 2 by dorothy richardson https shop window 1 lb super boudoir envelopes her eyes moved about the window from packet to packet set askew and shining with freshness if she had not brought so much from home she could have bought some perhaps she could buy packet christmas present eve and have it in

that she felt were of similar type that tea was already on the schoolroom table when she reached wordsworth house with an unknown volume by hungerford under her arm hiding it upstairs she came down to tea and sat recovering her composure over her paper cinq mars relic of the senior oxfo rd examination now grown suddenly rich and amazing it could not hold her the madcap was upstairs and beyond it an unlimited supply of twopenny volumes and ouida bound volumes of ouida on the bottom shelf had sent her eyes quickly back to the safety of the upper rows through the whole of she was quietly aware of discussion going on at the back of her mind to who it was who had told her that ouida s books were bad evil books she remembered her father s voice saying that ouida was an extremely able woman quite politician then of course her books were all right people it must have been someone at dance who had made her curious about them someone she had forgotten in any case whatever they were there was one

was different she must not be led by eve in any case she must leave off being led by anybody the ﬁgures sitting round the table bent over their books quietly disinclined conversation or mischief under the shrewd eye of miss haddie suddenly looked exciting and mysterious but perhaps the man in the shop would be shocked it would be impossible to ask them unless she could pretend she did not know anything about them 6 the last six weeks of the summer term she sat up night after night propped against her upright pillow and bolster under the gas jet reading her twopenny books in her silent room almost every night she read until two clock she felt at once that she was doing wrong that the secret was thing she could not confess even to miss haddie she was spending hours of the time that was meant sleep restful preparation the next day s work in vicious circle of it was sin she had read somewhere that sin promises satisfaction that it is unable to fulﬁl but she found when the house was still and the trams had ceased jingling up and down outside that she grew steady and cool and that she rediscovered the self she had known at home where the refuge of silence and books was always open perhaps that self leaving others to the practical things erecting little wall168 169 the project gutenberg ebook of backwater pilgrimage volume 2 by dorothy richardson https unapproachability between herself and her family that she might be free to dream alone in corners had always been wrong but it was herself the nearest most intimate self she had known and the discovery that it was not dead that her six months in the german school and the nine long months during which banbury park life had drawn veil even over the little slices of holiday freedom had not even touched it brought her warm moments of reassurance it was not perhaps good self but it was herself her own familiar secretly happy and rejoicing dead her hands lying on the coverlet knew it they were again at these moments her own old hands holding very ﬁrmly to things that one might touch or even approach too nearly things everything the great thing that woul d some day communicate itself to someone through these secret hands with the strangely thrilling ﬁnger holding them up in the gaslight she dreamed over their wisdom they knew everything and held their secret even from her she eyed them communed with them passionately trusted them they were not artistic or clever hands the ﬁngers did not taper nor did the outstretched thumb curl back on itself like nan babington s they were long the tips squarish and ﬁrmly padded the palm square and bony and supple and the large thumb joint stood away from the rest of the hand like the thumb joint of man the right hand was larger than the left kindlier friendlier wiser the expression of the left hand was less reassuring it was narrower lighter hand more ﬂexible less sensitive and more even in its smooth and manageable in playing scales it seemed to belong to her much less than the right but when the two were ﬁrmly interlocked they made pleasant curious whole the right clasping more ﬁrmly its thumb always uppermost its ﬁngers separated ﬁrmly over the back of the left palm the left hand clinging its ﬁngers close together against the hard knuckles of the right it was only when she was alone and in the intervals of quiet reading that she came into possession of her hands with others they oppressed her by their size and their lack of feminine expressiveness one could fall in love with such hands loving her someone might come to tolerate them they were utterly unlike eve s plump white inﬂexible little palms but they were her strength they came between her and the world of women they would be her companions until the end they would wither

barring her way 8 then came series of the volumes she had not already read she read them eagerly inspirited the gabled country houses the sunlit twilit endless gardens the deep orchards the falling of dew the mists of the summer mornings masses of ﬂowers in large rooms with carved oaken furniture wide staircases with huge painted windows throwing down strange patches of light on shallow thickly carpetted stairs these were the things she wanted gay people with beautiful wavering complexions and masses of shimmering hair catching the light fragrant ﬁlmy diaphanous dresses these were the people to whom she year or two of life like that dancing and singing in and out the houses and gardens and then marriage living alone sadly estranged in the house of husband who loved her and with whom she was in love both of them thinking that the other had married because they had lost their way in thunderstorm or spent the night sitting up on or because of clause in will and then one day both ﬁnding

it of hungerford s heroines were they had clouds of hair and were pathetically slender and appealing in their deep mourning she read volume after volume forgetting the single word hungerford on cover inﬂamed her her days became an irrelevance and her evenings dreamy sunlit indulgence now and again she wondered what julia doyle would think if she knew what she was reading and how it affected she would still watch her in the way she did she went about her work pale and tired whether she would go on guarding her so ﬁercely 9 at last exasperated tired of the mocking park the mocking happy books she went one day to the lower shelf and saying very calmly i think i ll take ouida drew out under two flags with trembling hand the man seemed to take an interminable time noting the number of the book and when at last she got into the air her limbs were heavy with sadness that night she read until three clock and ﬁnished the volume the next night at the same hour sitting upright when the last word was read refreshed from that moment the volumes became the centre of her life she read moths and in maremma slowly word by word with an increasing steadiness and certainty the mere sitting with the text held before her eyes gave her the feeling of being strongly confronted the strange currents which came whenever she was alone and at ease ﬂowing to the tips of her 175 the project gutenberg

solid trusty volume from her drawer and ﬂing it on her bed to have it under her eyes while she undressed she ceased to read her bible and to pray ouida ouida she would muse with the book at last in her hands i want bad strong bad things it doesn t matter italy the sky bright hot landscapes things happening i don t care what people think or say i am older than anyone here in this house i am

adam 12 one day just before the end of the summer term miss perne asked miriam to preside over the large schoolroom the morning the ﬁrst and girls were settled there at their written examination in english history rounding the schoolroom door she stood moment in the doorway the sunlight poured in through the wide bay window and the roomful of quiet girls seemed like ﬁeld jessie wheeler s voice broke the silence it s the hen she shouted gently it s the blessed hen oh come on you going to sit with us yes be quiet said miriam oh thank goodness groaned jessie supported by groans and murmurs from all over the room be quiet girls and get on with your papers said miriam in tone of acid detachment from the top of her tide she sat feeling that her arms were round the entire roomful that each girl struggling alone with the list of questions was resting against her breast i m going away from them i must be going away from them ran her thoughts regretfully they can t keep this is the utmost i ve won there ll never be anything more than this it177 178 the project gutenberg ebook of backwater pilgrimage volume 2 by dorothy richardson https always be the different girls certainty even the sunlight paid sort of homage to the fathomless certainty she felt the sunlight in this little schoolroom was telling her of other sunlights vast and unbroken her own sunlights when she should have wrenched herself away it was there she glanced up again and again to watch it breaking and splashing all over the room it would come again but how differently quite soon she might have spared herself all her agonising the girls did not know where she belonged they were holding her but she would go away to some huge open space leave it was unkind but she had left them already in spirit if they could all get up together now and sing let their voices peal together up and up throw all the books out of the window they might go on together forward into the sunshine but they would not want to that hardly any of them would want to that they woul d look at her with knowing eyes and look at the door and stay where they were the room was very close polly allen and eunice dupont sitting together at little in the darkest corner of the room were whispering with beating heart miriam got up and went and stood before them you two are talking she said with her eyes on the thickness of polly s shoulders she sat in proﬁle to the room eunice opposite her against the wall ﬂashed up at her her beautiful fugitive grin from the darkness of wood history thought miriam what has eunice to with history laws henry ii the english constitution you don t talk she said coldly feeling she watched her that eunice s pretty clothes were stripped away and she were stabbing at her soft rounded body at examinations can t you see that eunice s pale face grew livid first because it isn t fair and also because it disturbs other you can tell all the people who cheat by their smile she reﬂected on her way back eunice chuckled serenely two or three times what have these north london girls to with studies there was not single girl like eunice at barnes even the very pretty girls were reﬁned 13 that afternoon miriam spent her hour of leisure in calling on the brooms to enquire grace who had been ill the whole of the term she found the house after some difﬁculty in one of maze of little rows and crescents just off the main road she s almos t perfection said philps the aunt lucy miriam had heard of and seen in church they had been together in the little talking about grace from the moment when miriam was shown in to philps sitting darning duster in low chair by the closed conservato ry door the glazed closed door with the little strips of window on either side giving on to crowded conservatory made the little room seem dark to miriam it seemed horribly remote her journey to it had been through immense distances threading the little roadways between houses whose unbroken frontage was so near and so bare to forbid scrutiny she felt she had reached the centre the home and secret of north london life off every main road there must be neighbourhood like this where lived the people who ﬁlled the pavements and shops and walked in the parks to enter one of the little houses and speak there to its inmates would be to be ﬁnally claimed and infected by the life these people lived the thing that made them what they were at wordsworth house she was held up by the presence of the pernes and julia doyle here she was helpless and alone when she had discovered the number she sought and crossing the little tiled pathway separated from the pathway next door by180 181 182 the project gutenberg ebook of backwater pilgrimage volume 2 by dorothy richardson https single iron rail had knocked with the lacquered knocker against the glazed and leaded door her dreams the future faded they would never be realised they were just part of the radiance that shone now from the spacious houses she had lived in in the past the things she had felt this morning in the examination room were that too they had nothing to with the future all the space was behind things would grow less and less 14 admitted to the dark narrowly echoing tiled passage she stated her errand and was conducted past closed door and the opening of narrow staircase which shot steeply carpeted with narrow strip of surprisingly green velvet carpeting up towards an unlit landing and admitted to philps wait minute vashti said philps holding miriam s hand she murmured her errand you ll stay tea well if you re sure you can t i ll not press you bring the biscuits and the sherry and two white vashti get them now and bring them in at once sit down miss henderson she s little better than they re all the whilst she described her niece s illness miriam wondered over the immense bundle of little even black rolls of hair which stuck out larger than her head and smoothed to sphere by tightly drawn net at the back of her skull she was short and stout and had bright red cheeks that shone in the gloom and rather prominent large blue eyes that roamed she talked allowing miriam to snatch occasional glimpses of and beaded ottomans presently vashti returned clumsily with the wine making great bumping and rattling round about the door you stupid thing you ve brought claret don t you know sherry when you see it it s at the the harvest burgundy i shall have to go soon said miriam relieved at the sight of the red wine and longing to escape the sherry vashti put down the tray and stood with open mouth even with her very high heels she looked almost dwarf the room seemed less oppressive with the strange decanter and the silver biscuit box standing on table in the curious greenish light philps accepted the claret and returned busily to her story whilst miriam sipped and glanced at large print in heavy black frame leaning forward low over the small white marble mantelpie ce it represented young knight in armour kneeling at an altar with joined and pointed hands held to his lips an angel standing in was touching his shoulder with sword why doesn t she kiss the top of his head thought miriam she sipped her wine the distant aisles and pillars of the church made the room seem larger than it was i suppose they all look into that church when they want to get away from each other she mused philps went on with her long sentences beginning and newman and there was little mirror above bulging chiffonier which was also an escape from the conﬁned space looking into it she met philps s glowing face with the blue eyes widely staring and ﬁxed upon her own and heard her declare with her bunched coloured lips that grace was almost is she she responded eagerly and philps elaborated her theme grace then with her heavy body and strange hot voice lying somewhere upstairs in white bed was the most important thing in this dark little house she was very near to death then philps was saying tearfully very near and when she came round from her delirium one of the ﬁrst things she said to soon she was strong enough to whisper was that she was perfectly certain about there being another philps s voice faded and she sat with trembling lips and eyes downcast did she miriam almost shouted ng from her seat and turning from contemplating philps in the mirror to look her full in184

room rock slightly touch would sweep it all away and heaven would be there all round them did she whispered miriam in faint voice that shook her chest aunt she said went on philps steadily the room grew ﬁrm round miriam and the breath she drew seemed like an early morning breath i want to say something quickly she said in case i die it s that i positive fact there is another what perfectly stupendous thing said miriam it s so i was much impressed of course i knew she was nearly perfect but we ve not been in the habit of talking about religion i asked her if she would like to see the vicar oh she said there s need he i doubt if he knows much she does but i didn t make point of oh but it s simply wonderful it s much more important than anything vicar could say it s their business to say those i don t know about that but she was so weak that i didn t press but it s so important what wonderful thing to have in your family did she say anything more she hasn t returned to the subject again she s very wild clutching thoughts shook at miriam if only grace could suddenly appear in her to be questioned or if she herself could stay on there creeping humbly about in this little house watering the conservatory and darning dusters being relative of the brooms devoting herself to grace waiting on her hearing all she had to say what did it matter that the brooms wore heavy mourning and gloated over funerals if grace upstairs in her room had really seen the white light away in the distance far away beyond the noise of the world 187 the project gutenberg ebook of

crepitations and ﬂittings ahead of them the river blazed gold and blue hedged by high spacious trees come come tea said bird suddenly from the island thicket d you know what bird that is gerald asked miriam not from adam breathed gerald swaying on his seat with little laugh it s bird that s all i know we d better unmoor silly muttered harriett briskly gathering up the tiller ropes right la look here let something this time pull or you sit still my dear but i should simply love you shall pull if you like later on when the bally sun s down my advice to you now is to go and lounge in the bow oh yes mim you try it lie right down it s simply heavenly the boat glided deliciously away miriam relinquishing her vision of harriett sitting very upright in the stern in her white drill dress and gerald s back and long lean arms grasping the sculls lay back on the bow cushions with her feet comfortably outstretched under the unoccupied seat in front of her six hours ago shaking hands with roomful of noisy now nothing to but ﬂoat dreamily out through the gateway of her six weeks holiday the dust of the school was still upon her the skin of her face felt strained and tired her hands were tired and hot her blouse dim with week of school wear and her black skirt oppressed her with its invisible burden of grime but she was staring up at clean blue sky fringed with she stretched herself out more luxuriously upon her cushions the river smoothly moving and lapping underneath the boat was like cradle the soft ﬁngers of the air caressed her temples and moved along the outlines of her face and neck forty days like this she would wake up new person sing and shout with harriett she closed her eyes the gently lifting water seemed to come nearer the invading air closed in on her she gave herself ecstatically to its touch the muscles of her tired face relaxed and she believed that she could sleep cry or sleep 2 it was gerald who had worked this miraculous ﬁrst day her boating

jokes of the men even ted always joked all the time the misery of large noisy picnic teas on the grass and in the end great weariness and disappointment the beauty of the river and the trees only

arranged their expedition at trained to richmond bought fruit and cakes and got the boat s water ﬁlled by one of redknap s men gerald knew how to things properly he had always been accustomed to things like this boat he would not care to have anything just anyhow let s the thing decently la he would keep on saying that at intervals until harriett had learned too how he had changed her since easter when their engagement had been openly allowed the clothes he had bought her especially this plain drill dress with its neat little coat the long black tie fastened with the plain heavy cable broach pinned in lengthwise down the ends of the tie which reached almost to her black belt that was gerald her shoes the number of pairs of light expensive beautifully made shoes her bearing the

chelsea giving dinner parties and going to the opera until nearly all the capital had gone both dying just in time to leave enough to bring gerald in small income when he left haileybury and the wonderful thing was that gerald liked mouching about and giggli ng he liked looking hours in shop windows and strolling on the heath eating peppermints 3 everything had disappeared into soft blackness

invisible from the stroke seat the boat went swiftly and easily miriam felt she could go on pulling hours at the top of her strength through the night leaning forward breasting the featureless darkness sweeping the sculls back at the full reach of her arms leaning back and pressing her whole weight upwards from the footboard against the pull of the water her body became an outstre tched elastic system of muscles rhythmically working against the smooth dragging resistance of the dark water her sleeves were rolled up her unfastened her cool drowsy lids drooped over her cool eyes each time she leaned backwards against her stroke pressing the footboard the weight of her body dragged at line of soreness where the sculls pressed her hands and with the ﬁnal ﬂing of the water from the

right what about it there aren t any here you re not one anyhow 4 the next day after tea eve arrived home from gloucestershire miriam had spent the day with harriett after breakfast bounding silently up and downstairs they visited each room in turn chased each other about the echoing rooms and passages of the basement and all over the garden miriam listened speechlessly to the sound of harriett s heels soft on the stair carpet ringing on the stone ﬂoors of the basem ent and the swish of her skirts she ﬂew over the lawn following surrounding responding to miriam s wild tour of the garden miriam listened and watche d her eyes and ears eagerly gathering and hoarding visions it could not go on presently some claim would be made on harriett and she would be alone but when they had had their ﬁll of silently rushing about harriett piloted her into the and hastily began opening the piano pile of duets lay on the lid she had evidently gathered them there in readiness wandering about the room shifting the familiar ornaments ﬂinging herself into chair after chair miriam watched her and saw that her strange quiet little snub face was lit and shapely harriett serene and and going to be married in the spring was transported by this new coming together when they had played the last of the duets that they knew well harriett fumbled at the pages of bound volume of operas in obvious uncertainty at any moment miriam might get up and go off and bring their sitting together on the long duet stool to an end come on roared miriam gently let s try this and they attacked the difﬁcult pages miriam counted the metre whispered it intoned and sang it carrying harriett along with shouts go on go on when they had lost each other they smashed their way along by turns playing only single note here and there into the framework of miriam s desperate counting or banging out cheerful masses of discordant tones anything to go on driving their way together through the pages while the sunlight streamed half seen into the conservatory and the ﬂower garden crowded up against the windows anything to come out triumphantly together at the end and to stop satisﬁed the sounds of the house so long secretly known to them both low now around them heard by them together punctuating their joy the gong sounded lunch eve miriam remembered suddenly eve s coming this the thought set gladness thundering through her she rose from the piano let s go walk after lunch she muttered harriett blushed awri she responded tenderly 197 the project gutenberg ebook of backwater pilgrimage volume 2 by

the great lane under the towering trees miriam wondered if she found it dull and was taking it so boldly because they were walking along it together obviously she did not want to talk she walked along swiftly and erect looking eagerly ahead if when they reached the top and the heath and the windmill they would ﬁnd something they were both looking miriam felt she could glance about unnoticed and looked freely she had done so many hundreds of times before at the light on the distant meadows and lying along the patches of under growth between the trunks of the trees they challenged and questioned her silently they had always done and she them in sort of passionate sulkiness they gave answer but the scents in the cool air went on all the time offering steady assurance and presently walking became an unconscious rhythm and the question of talk or talk had deﬁnitely decided itself the challenge of the light was silenced and the shaded roadway led on to parad ise was there anyone anywhere who saw it she did anyone who looking along the alley of white road would want to sit down in the roadway or kneel amongst the under growth and shout and shout in the north of london there were all those harsh street voices infesting the trees and the parks they did not exist there was north london let them die they did not know the meaning of meadows deer the great silent heath the

sure of each other i say harriett she said at the top of her voice bringing harriett curvetting in the road just in front of her i say harriett ran up the remaining strips of road and out on to the heath it was ablaze with the river and the trees had been whole day of light and eve on her way home almost home harriett must not know how she was rushing to eve with what tingling ﬁngers oh what i was going to ask you was whether you can see the moonlight like it is when you are alone when gerald is it isn t the same when you are alone said harriett quietly arranging the cuf f of her glove

extraordinary about all those white dresses said miriam emphatically pushing her way after eve into sarah s bedroom can i come in i m coming in sarah says it s because men like them and she gets simply sick of girls in white and cream dresses all over the place in the summer and it s perfect relief to see anyone in colour in the sun they have red sunshades sometimes but sarah says that s not

ﬁlthy world god what ﬁlthy world she muttered everyone hemmed and hemmed and hemmed into harriett came in and stepped up on to the high canopied bed ullo she said in general sitting herself up tailor

paper garments to be gathered up by sarah moving solidly about between the wardrobe and the chest of drawers in her rather heavy boots there would not be any talk but silently the room ﬁlled and overﬂowed turning at last from her window miriam glanced at her sisters and let her thoughts drop into the ﬂowing tide harry sitting there sharp and upright in the fading light coming in to them with her future life streaming out behind her spreading and shining and ripplin g herself the radiant point of that wonderful life actually there neatly enthroned amongst them one of them drawing them all with her out towards its easy security eve happy with her wardrobe of dainty things going fearle ssly forward to some unseen fate not troubling about it sarah s strange clean clear channel of wisdom where would it lead it would always drive straight through everything all these things meant that the mere simple awfulness of things at home had changed these three girls she had known so long and who still bore at moments in their eyes their movements the marks of the terrors and uncertainties amongst which they had all grown up were going on out into life scored and scarred but alive and changeable able to become quite new memories of strange crises and the ageing deadening shifts they had invented to tide them over humiliating situations were here crowded in the room together with them all but these memories were longer they had so often been the principal thing in the room whenever they were all gathered silently together if eve and harriett had got away from the past and now had happy eyes and mouths sarah s solid quiet cheerfulness now grown so large and free that it seemed even when she was stillest to knock your mind about like something in harlequinade why had they not all known in the past that they would chan ge why had they been so oppressed whenever they stopped to think those american girls in little women and good wives made fun out of everything but they

daylight would be streaming in through the madras muslin curtains everything in the room very silent and distinct nothing to be heard but the little ﬂutterings of birds under the eaves you could listen to it ever if you kept perfectly still when you drew back the curtains the huge day would be standing outside clear with gold and blue and dense with trees and ﬂowers sarah s face was uneasy she seemed to avoid meeting anyone s eyes presently she faced them sitting on low rocking chair with her tightly clasped hands stretched out beyond her knees she glanced fearfully from one to the other and bit her lips what now thought miriam the anticipated holidays disappeared of course she might have known they would moment she felt sick naked and weak then she braced herself to meet the shock i must sit tight i must sit tight and not show anything eve s probably praying oh make haste sally and get it over what s the matter sally said eve in low voice oh eve and mim i m awfully sorry you d better tell us at once said eve crimsoning haven t you noticed anything miriam looked at sarah s homely prosperous shape it couldn t be anything it was nightmare she waited pinching her wrist what is it sally breathed eve tapping her knee clothes and furniture and pictures houses full of things and people talking in the houses and having meals and pretending talking and smiling and pretending it s mother what on earth you mean sarah said miriam angrily she s bennett took her to specialist there s got to s got to have an miriam drew up the blind with noisy rattle smiling at eve frowning impatiently at the noise driving the heavy sash up far it would go she leaned her head against the open frame the garden did not seem to be there the tepid night air was like wall black wall moment splintered red light like the light that comes from violent blow on the forehead ﬂashed along it sarah and eve were talking in strange voices interrupting each other it would be relief to something faint or something selﬁsh but she must hear what they were saying listen to both the voices cutting through the air of the hot room propped against the window air she forced herself to hear pressing her cold hands closely together the gas light that had seemed so bright hardly seemed to light the room at all everything looked small even grannie s old chippendale bedstead and the wardrobe the girls were little monkey ghosts babbling together beside eve s open trunk did they see that it was exactly like grave 9 the sun shone through the apple trees making the small apples look though they were coated with enamel it was quite clear that if they did go away together the four of them she eve gerald and harriett to brighton or somewhere they would be able to forget you could tell that

they would go to the aquarium with its strange under ground smell of stagnant sea air and stare into the depths of those strange green tanks and watch the ﬁsh ﬂashing about like shadows or skimming by near the front of the tank with the light full on their softly tinted scales harriett sat steadily at her side on the overturned and responsible quietly discussing the details of the plan with gerald at their feet on the grass plot they had not said anything about the reasons going but of course gerald must know all that he knew everything now all about the money troubles all the awful things and it seemed to make difference to him he made light of it it was humiliating to think that he had come just things had reached their worst the house going to be sold pater and mother and sarah going into lodgings in september and the maddening helpless worry about mother and all the money that and yet it was good thing he had known them all in the old house and seen them there even pretending to be prosperous and yet the house and garden was nothing to him just house and garden harriett s house and garden and he was going to take harriett away the house and garden did not matter she glanced at the sunlit fruit trees the thickets of the familiar kitchen garden the rising grass bank at the near end of the distant lawn the eloquent back of the large red house he could not see all the things there were there all the long years or know what it was to have that cut away and nothing ahead but brighton aquarium with harriett and eve and then the school again and disgraceful lodgings in some strange place friends and everybody looking down on them she met his eyes and they both smiled keep her perfectly quiet the next few weeks that s the idea and when it s all over she ll be better than she s ever been in her d you think so i don t think i know she will people always are i ve known scores of people have operations it s nothing nowadays ask does he think she ll be better of did he say

man walking at her side along the cliff his frame his blue serge the trimness of collar and tie his faintly blunted regular features clean ruddy skin and clear expressionless german blue eyes altogether he was rather like german with his red and white and gold and blue colouring and his small military moustache she could imagine him snapping abruptly in booming chest voice mit frauen spreche ich überhaupt but he spoke slowly and languidly he was an englishman and somehow looked like man who was accustomed to reﬁned society it was true he never spoke at the house meals excepting an occasional word with his friend and he had been obliged to join their sunday walk because his friend was so determined to come still he was not awkward or clumsy either at table or now only absolutely quiet and then saying such startling rather rude thing quite suddenly one could stare at him to discover the reason of his funny speech because evidently he was quite common not bounder but quite common young man speaking of women young then how on earth did he manage to look distinguished oppressed and ill at ease she turned away to the green levels and listened to the sea tumbling heavily far below against the cliffs away ahead eve and her little companion walking jauntily along his tight curls exposed to the full sunlight his cane swinging round he talked and laughed seemed to be turning inland towards the downs they had seen ovingdean in the distance stupid ovingdean that everybody had talked about at breakfast and were ﬁnding the way how utterly silly they did not see how utterly silly it was to make up your mind to go to ovingdean and then go to ovingdean how utterly silly everybody and everything was eve looked very straight and slim and was walking happily bending her head little she always did when she was listening their backs looked happy and here she was forced to walk with this strange solid heavyish man and his cold insulting remark almost the only thing he had said since they had been alone together it had been rather nice walking along the top of the cliff side by side saying nothing they walked exactly in step and his blunted features looked quite at ease and she had gone easily along disposing of him with gentle feeling of proprietorship and had watched the gentle swing and movement of the landscape they swung along it seemed secure and painless and was gradually growing beautiful and then suddenly she felt that he must have his thoughts men were always thinking and would be expecting her to be animated and entertaining lumpishly she had begun about the dullness of the beach and promenade on sundays and the need to ﬁnd something to between dinner and all conversation was lie and somehow she had led him to his funny german remark how you mean she said at last anxiously it was very rude intruding upon him like that he had spoken quite simply she ought to have laughed and changed the conversation but it was laughing matter he did not know what he was saying or how horribly it hurt worldly girl would chaff and make fun of him it was detestable to make fun of men just way of 215 216 the project gutenberg ebook of backwater pilgrimage volume 2 by dorothy richardson https sarah said that being rude to men or talking seriously to them was ﬂirting just much not true not true and yet it was true she did want to feel happy walking along with this man have some sort of good understanding with him him man with her woman was that ﬂirting if so she was just more solemn underhand ﬂirt than the others that was all she felt very sad anyhow she had asked her question now she looked at his proﬁle perhaps he would put her off in some way then she would walk slower and slower until harriett and gerald caught them up and come home walking four in row taking harriett s arm his face had remained quite expressionless well he said at length in his slow tone i always take care to get out of the way when there are any young ladies when you mean i didn t ask you to come i don t want to talk to you you beast she thought but it would be impossible to ﬁnish the holiday and go back to the school with this strange statement uninvestigated well when my sisters have young ladies in in the evening i always get out of the way ah thought miriam you are one of those men who ﬂirt with servants and perhaps those awful wome n either she must catch eve up or wait harriett not be alone any longer with this man i see you simply run away from them she said scornfully go out walk or small brixton full of brixton gerald said that brixton was something too chronic words just like clapham and there was that joke about the man who said he would not go to heaven even if he had the chance because of the strong clapham contingent that would be all i go and sit in my oh said miriam brokenly in the winter without ﬁre parrow laughed i don t mind about that i wrap myself up and get what sort of book i ve got few books of my own and there s generally something worth reading in t how did he manage to look so reﬁned and cultured those girls were quite good enough him probably too good but he would go on despising them and one of them would marry him and give him puddings and here he was walking by the sea in the sunlight confessing his suspicions and fears and going back to brixton you ll have to marry one of those young ladies one day she said abruptly that s out of the question even if i was marrying nonsense said miriam they turned down the little pathway leading towards the village poor man how cruel to encourage him to take up with one of those giggling dressy girls d you mean to say you ve been never specially interested in anybody yes i never 2 ovingdean had to be faced they were going to look at ovingdean and then walk back to the to tea now that she knew all about his she would not be able to meet his eyes across the table two tired elm trees stood one on either side of the road at the entrance to the village here they all gathered and then went forward in strolling party when they turned at last to walk home and fell again into couples before miriam searched her empty mind something to say about the dim cool218 219 the project gutenberg ebook of backwater pilgrimage volume 2 by dorothy richardson https church the strange silent deeps of it there amongst the great green downs the waiting chairs the cold empty pulpit and the little cold font and the sunlit front of the old grange where king charles had taken refuge parrow would know she was speaking insincerely if she said anything about these things there was long long walk ahead some time they walked in silence d you know anything about architecture she said at last angrily cruel silly question of course he didn but men she walked with ought to know about architecture and be able to tell her things that s subject i don t know anything d you like churches i don t know that i ve ever thought about then you probably don oh well i don t know about that i don t see any objection to then you re probably an i don t know i m you go to church i can t say i in the usual way unless i m on holiday perhaps you go walks instead well i generally stay in bed and have that dreadful room with the dreadful man hiding in it and reading bits and staying in bed in it on bright sunday mornings how heavily they were treading on the orange and yellow faces of the tom thumbs scattered over the short green grass how much you think people could marry on said parrow suddenly in thin voice oh well that depends on who they i suppose it does and where they are going to d you think anyone could marry on hundred and ﬁfty of course said miriam emphatically mentally shivering over the vision of tiresome determined cheerful woman with thin pinched reddish nose an everlasting grey hat and faded ulster going on year after year two or three common children she would never be able to educate with horribly developed characters it was rather less than the rent of their house of course everything would depend on the woman she said wisely after all hundred and ﬁfty with doubt and anxiety about it was very wonderful thing to have probably everybody was wasteful buying the wrong things and silly things ornaments and brooches and serviette rings and not thinking things out and not putting things down in books and not really enjoying managing the hundred and ﬁfty and always wanting more it ought to be quite jolly being thoroughly common and living in small way and having common neighbours doing the same but you think if man could ﬁnd young lady who could agree about prices it would be of course it the houses on the eastern ridges of brighton came into sight in the distance and stood blazing in the sunlight there was high half piece of fencing at the edge of the cliff to their left little ahead of them splintered and sunlit how much week is hundred and ﬁfty year three they gravitated towards the fence and stood vaguely near it looking out across the unrufﬂed glare of the open sea why had she always thought that the bright blue and gold ripples seen from the beach and the promenade on jolly weekdays was the best of the sea it was much more lovely up there the great expanse in its quiet sunday loneliness you could see and think about things instead of just dreaming on the drowsy hot sands seeing nothing but the rippling stripes of bright blue and bright gold she put her elbows on221 222 the project gutenberg ebook of backwater pilgrimage volume 2 by dorothy richardson https upper bar parrow did the same and they stood gazing out across the open parrow was probably wondering how long they were going to stand silently there and thinking about his tea of course let him until eve s voice sounded near them in dimpling laugh they walked home in row eve and green in the centre asking riddles one against the other every time miriam spoke parrow laughed or made some little responsive sound 3 when green and parrow went back to london at the end of the week eve and miriam saw them off at the station the four went off boldly together down the ﬂight of white stone steps and made their way up into the town called miss meldrum affectionately from the doorway i shall send both of you copy of the it s most generous of miss meldrum to go to all that expense to give us pleasant memento said green in his small ringing voice they all swung out into the clean bare roadway miriam felt if they were bit of the photograph walking up the hill and went freely and conﬁdently along with sense of being steered and guided by miss meldrum why had she had the group odd and bold of her having the photographer waiting in the garden them before they had ﬁnished breakfast and then laughing and talking and pushing them all about if they were her dearest friends it was whilst they were all out in the garden together hanging about and being arranged with the photographer s voice like the voice of ventriloquist knocking them coldly about that gerald and green had arranged about the evening at the crystal palace on the last day of miriam s holiday miriam had held back from the group feeling nervous about her hair there had been time to go to their rooms and had forced eve to the same harriett with cheerful shiny face was sitting on the grass with gerald in line with the traveller from robinson and cleaver s and his mocking ﬁancée they all looked very small and bald the ﬁancée kept clearing her throat and rearranging her smart feet and rattling her bangles the traveller s heavy waxed moustache was crooked and his slippery blue eyes looked like the eyes of an old man next to him were two newly arrived restively sneering young men one on either side of the ﬂorist s assistant from wigmore street who sat in an easy pose with her skirt draping gracefully over her feet and her long white chin propped on her hands she looked reproachfully about amongst the laughing and talking and seemed to feel that they were all in church miss meldrum and miss stringer the two bald scotch chemists who went out every evening to look comet the pale frowning girl from plaistow with her cousin whose grey curls bunched in velvet band seemed to say h to miriam more dreadfully out here amongst the greenery than when she suddenly caught sight of them at table sat disconnectedly in chairs

white hill with the evening at the crystal palace ahead of them in away london it was quite right they were being like other people met and made friends and arranged to meet again and then things happened it was quite right and ordinary and safe and warm of course eve and green must meet again he was evidently quite determined that they should that was what was carrying them all so conﬁdently up the hill perhaps he would in the end turn into another gerald when they turned off into the224 225 the project gutenberg ebook of backwater pilgrimage volume 2 by dorothy richardson https brighton

all the shabbiness of green s london suit he looked even smaller than he did in his holiday tweed miriam wanted to call to them and stop them stop eve s bright ﬁgure and her mop of thickly twisted brown hair and ask her what she was dreaming of leave the two men there and go back go out away alone with eve down to the edge of the sea she hesitated in her walking not daring even to glance at her companion who was trudging along with bent head carrying his large brown leather bag the street was crowded and she manœuvred so that everyone they met should pass between them perhaps they would be able to reach the station without being obliged to speak to each other parrow it was either quite nice name or pitiful like child trying to say sparrow did he know that to other people it was strange important sort of name rounded like the padding in the shoulders of his coat and his blunted features nobody knew him at all well not single person in the world if he were run over and killed on the

words with thrilling blatter of laughter the elephant was close upon them alone in the road space cleared by its swinging walk if only everyone would be quiet they could hear the soft padding of its feet slowly gently modestly it went by followed by crowd of smaller things monkeys on horseback in gold coatlets sullen caged beasts on trolleys drawn by beribboned unblinkered horses tall white horses pacing singly by bearing bobbing princesses and men in masks and cloaks 5 here and there in the long sunlit hours of the holiday by the brighton sea miriam found the seaside holidays of her childhood going out one afternoon with eve and miss stringer walking at eve s side listening to the conversation of the two girls she had felt when they reached the deserted end of the esplanade and proposed turning round and walking home an uncontrollable desire to be alone and had left them impatiently without word of excuse and gone on down the grey stone steps and out among the deserted chalk

that possessed her now had spread like ﬁlmy veil but now it would hardly ever come there were always people talking the strangers one worked or the hard new people like miss stringer people who had number of things they were always saying she tried to remember when the strange independent joy had begun and thought she could trace it back to morning in the garden at babington the ﬁrst thing she could remember when she had found herself toddling alone along the garden path between beds of ﬂowers almost on level with her head and blazing in the sunlight bees with large bodies were sailing heavily across the path from bed to bed passing close by her head and making loud humming in the air she could see the ﬂowers distinctly she walked quickly back through the afternoon throng on the esplanade they were sweet williams and everlasting ﬂowers the sweet williams smelling very strongly sweet in her nostrils and one sheeny brown everlasting ﬂower that she had touched with her nose smelling like hot paper 6230 231 232 the project gutenberg ebook of backwater pilgrimage volume 2 by dorothy richardson https wanted to speak to someone of these things until she could speak to someone about them she must always be alone always quite alone she thought looking out she walked across the busy stretch of sea between the two piers dotted with pleasure boats it would be impossible to speak to anyone about them unless one felt perfectly sure that the other person felt about them in the same way and knew that they were more real than anything else in the world knew that everything else was fuss about nothing but everybody else seemed to be really interested in the fuss that was the extraordinary thing miss meldrum presiding at the table with her white padded hair and her white face and bright steady brown eyes listening to everybody and making jokes with everybody and keeping things going sometimes looked if she knew it was all pretence but if you spoke to her she would think you were talking about religion and would kiss you she had already kissed miriam playing accompaniments to the hymns on sunday evening and made her feel if there were some sly secret between them if she played the hymns again she would play them stonily mother would look she always did if you suddenly began to talk anything about things in general if you were going to make some confession she had been waiting all her life now with the operation and all the uncertainty ahead she would probably cry she would want to explain in some way she had done one day long ago how dreadful it had been mother i never feel tired not really tired and however i behave i always feel frightfully happy inside my blessed chick it s your splendid the inﬂuence of the holy spirit but i hate everybody what foolish nonsense you mustn t think such things you will make yourself unpopular she must keep her secret to herself this brighton life crushed it back more than anything there had been in germany or at banbury park in germany she had found it again and again and at banbury park though it could never come out and surround her it was never far off it lurked just beyond the poplars in the park at the end of the little empty garden at twilight amongst the books in the tightly packed bookcase it was here too in and out the sunlit days one opened the door of the large sparely furnished it shone moment in the light pouring over the table full of seated forms it haunted the glittering scattered sand round about the little blank platform where the black and white minstrels stood singing in front of their harmonium and poured out across the blaze of blue and gold sea ripples when the town band played anitra s dance or the moon song from the mikado it lay all along the deserted promenade and roadway you went home to lunch and at night it spoke in the ﬂump ﬂump of the invisible sea against the lower woodwork of the pier pavilion 7 but every day at breakfast over the eggs bacon and voices began their day s talking the weary round of words and ugly laughter went steadily on narrow horrible sounds that made you feel conscious of the insides of people s throats and the backs of their if they were not properly formed the talk was like silly sort of battle innuendo miriam would say to herself feeling that the word was too beautiful what she wanted to express double entendr was also unsatisfactory these people were all enemies pretending to be friends why did they pretend why not keep quiet or all sing between their eating different songs it would not matter she and eve and harriett and gerald did sometimes hum the refrains of the nigger minstrels songs or one of them would hum scrap of solo and all three sing the chorus then people were quiet listening and smiling their234 235 the project gutenberg ebook of backwater pilgrimage volume 2 by dorothy richardson https smiles and miss meldrum was delighted it seemed improper and hearted one else joined in but after the ﬁrst few days the four of them always sang between the courses at dinner gerald did not seem to mind the chaffy talk and the vulgar jokes and would generally join in and he said strange disturbing things about the boarders if he knew all about them and he and harriett talked to the niggers too and found out about them it spoilt them when one knew that they belonged to small london musical halls and had wives and families and illnesses and trouble gerald and harriett did not seem to mind this they did not seem to mind anything out of doors they were free and hard and contemptuous of everyone except the niggers and few very people who sailed along and took notice of anybody gerald said extraordinary disturbing things about the girls on the esplanade miriam and eve were interested in some of the young men they saw they talked about them and looked out them sometimes they exchanged glances with them were she and eve also on show waiting to be given half an inch would she or eve be perfectly awful in the dark did the young men they specially favoured with their notice say things about them when these thoughts buzzed about in miriam s brain she wanted to take broom and sweep everybody into the sea she discovered that single steady unexpected glance meeting her own from man who had the right kind of right about the set of the disperse all the vague

told that the endlessness was there and telling that the endlessness was there had gone the eyes were eyes solid and mocking and be avoided in future and when they had gone the sunset or the curious quivering line along the horizon were longer gateways but hard barriers until by some chance one was tranquilly alone the horizon would beckon and lift and the pathway of gold across the sea at sunset call to your feet until they tingled and ached life was ugly and cruel the secret of the sea and of the evenings and mornings must be given up it would fade more and more what was life either playing part all the time in order to be amongst people in the warm or standing alone with the strange true real with sort of edge of reality on everything even on quite ugly common houses face towels and blistered window frames 8 since green and parrow had left they had given up going to pier entertainments and had spent most of their time sitting in close row and talking together in the intervals of the black and white minstrel concerts and the performances of the town band they had drifted into this way of spending their time there was never any discussion or alteration of the day s programme it worked like charm and there was sign of the breaking of the charm miriam was sometimes half afraid just they settled themselves down that someone probably gerald or eve might say funny isn t it how well we four get on and that strange power that held them together and kept everything away would be broken befor the holiday came to an end but one did and they went on sitting togethe r in the

everything there might be in the latest letter from hearing the niggers from ten to eleven bathing from eleven to twelve sitting afterwards fresh and tingling and drowsy in canopied chairs near the band until dinner prowling and paddling in the afternoon and ranging themselves again in chairs the evening they said nothing until almost the end of their time about the passage of the days but they looked at each other each time they settled down with conspiring smiles and then sat side by side less visible to each other than the great sunlit sea or the great clean salt darkness stranded in row

fascinating little pictures of life in the big country house or miriam s stories and legends of said very little about banbury park fearing the amazement and disgust of the trio if anything of the reality of north london should reach them through her talk and guessing the impossibility of their realising the gerald s rich memories of the opulence of his early home life an atmosphere of spending and operas and banquets and receptions and distinguished people during the evening in silent interval just the band was tuning up to begin its last tune gerald had said with quiet emphasis well anyhow girls you mark my words the old man won t make any more money not another penny you may well make up your minds to then the band had broken into their favourite hungarian dance three of them sat blissfully back in their deck chairs but miriam remained uncomfortably propped forward eagerly thinking the music rushed on she saw dancers shining before her in wild groups in the darkness leaping and shouting their feet scarcely touching the earth and wild light darted about them they shouted and leapt set mirry up in some sort of business quoted her mind from one of gerald s recent soliloquies she knew that she did not want that but the dancing forms told her of the absurdity of going back without protest to the long aching days of teaching in the little school amongst those dreadful voices which were going whatever she did them to be dreadful all their lives nothing she could would make any difference to them they did not want her they were quite happy her feelings and thoughts her way of looking at things her desire space and beautiful things and music and quietude would never be their desire reverence she reverence she felt she must have because she knew they had

all come to go out into the summer evening and see the ﬁreworks all but she had come meaning to get quite near to the set pieces and to look at them she had not said anything about meaning to get far away from the ﬁreworks possible she had been trusting to parrow that now that she was with him she felt that perhaps it was not quite fair he had come meaning to see the ﬁreworks he would be disappointed she would be obliged to tell him presently when they got out into the night they were all tramping quickly up along the echoing corridor one seemed to be talking just feet tramp tramp on the planking rather quickly it was like the sound of workmen s feet on the inside scaffolding of house the corridor was like something in the hospital incurables that strange old woman sitting in the hall with bent head laughing over her crochet and miss garrett whom they had come to see sitting up in bed curtained bed in ward with pleated mob cap all over the top of her head and down her forehead sitting back against large square pillows with her hands clasped on the neat and sweet patient look on her face coughing gently and spitting spitting herself to death rushing away out of the ward to wait mother downstairs in the hall with the curious smells and the dreadful old woman what was it chick sick mother i felt sick i couldn t stay it was rage rage with that dreadful old woman people probably told her she was patient and sweet and she had got that trick of putting her head on one side she was not sweet she was one of the worst of those dreadful people who would always make people believe in particular way all the time she had great big frame if she had done anything but sit she sat in that particular way one could have stayed they were all standing looking at some wonderful sort of clock calendar triumph of ingenuity said green s bright reedy voice the building had opened out and rushed up people were passing to and fro we don t want to stay inside let s go out said gerald the group broke into couples again and passed on miriam found herself with parrow once more of course she would be with him all the evening she must tell him at once about the ﬁreworks she ought not to have come if she did not mean to see the ﬁreworks it was mean and feeble to cheat him out of his evening why had she come to wander about with him not seeing the ﬁreworks what an idiotic and abominable thing now that she was here at his side it was quite clear that she must endure the ﬁreworks anything else would be like asking him to wander about with her alone she did not want to wander about with him alone she took an opportunity of joining eve moment they had just walked through winter garden and were standing at the door of concert244 245 246 the project gutenberg ebook of

said suddenly in loud cheerful voice stretching an arm out across the rope and pointing to one of the reliefs it s auntie and grandma miriam stared at him they passed he was so short shorter than any of the ladies he was with it s the only way to see these things he said in the same loud harsh cheerful voice miriam laughed aloud what clever man you like statues said mr parrow in low gentle tone i don t know anything about them said miriam i can t bear ﬁreworks she said hurriedly they were in the open at last in the deepening twilight many people were going to and fro in the distance soft dark masses of trees stood out against the sky in every direction not far away the ghostly frames of the set pieces reared against the sky made the open evening seem the enclosure they had just left round about the scaffolding of these pieces dense little crowds were collecting don t you want to see the ﬁreworks i want to get away from all right we ll get lost at it isn t she explained little breathlessly in relief suddenly respecting him allowing him to thread way her through the increasing crowd towards the open evening that i don t want to see the ﬁreworks but i simply can t stand the i

have to be desperately determined but after all they could not anything with her sitting there in the perne boat still taking an oar and determined to ﬂing herself into the sea she ought not to have told them she was leaving them just desperately without anything else in prospect because they were so good not like employers they would all feel her it was just like speaking roughly at home well it was done she glanced about miss haddie across the table behind her habitual bowl of bread and milk had face of child surprised by injustice i was was right miriam gasped to herself the light ﬂowed in

was escaping she appealed to miss deborah and met ﬂash of her beautiful soft piercing eyes her delicate features quivered and wrinkled almost to smile but miss deborah was afraid of miss jenny who was already thinking and embarking on little sounds miriam got away moment in tumult with miss deborah oh she shouted to her in the depths of her heart you are heavenly young you know life s like robinson

more miriam murmured miss jenny we don t want to lose ye ye ve pulled the lower school together in remarkable way miss deborah was drawing little breaths of protest at this descent into gross detail the children are interested we hear that from the parents we shall be able to give ye excellent oh i don t care about that responded miriam desperately great all my sore ve never heard about that it s all coming out now she thought began miss jenny hesitatingly feeling herself slipping miriam clung harshly to her determination and drew herself up to offer the set of the pretty blouse gerald and harriett had bought her in brighton seal on her irrevocable decision to break with banbury park it was delicate sheeny green silk with soft tuckers what steps have ye taken asked miss jenny in quizzical tone it s very kind of you said miriam formally and went on to hint vaguely and convincingly at the existence of some place in family in the country that would be sure to fall to her lot through the many friends to whom eve had written on her behalf turning away from the feast towards the freedom of the untenanted part of the room the sitting had to be brought to an end in moment she would be utterly routed her lame statements were the end of the struggle she knew she was demonstrating in her feeble broken tones sort of blind strength they knew nothing of and that they would leave it at that whatever they thought if only there were more talk 2 when they had left the room and flora came in the supper things instead of sitting usual at the far end of the table pretending to read she stood planted on the hearthrug watching her flora s hands were small and pale and serenely despairing like her face she cleared the table quietly she had nothing to hope she did not know she had nothing to hope whatever happened she would go quietly on doing things in the twilight on sort of edge people would die perhaps people had already died in her family but she would always be the same one day she would die perhaps of something hard and slow and painful with that small yellowish constitution she would not be able to go on looking serene and despairing with people round her bed helping her when she died she would wait quietly with nothing to blind and wondering death would take her into great her herself she would not believe it and would put up her hands to259 260 the

refusing to be held it made even the dreadful past seem wonderful all the days here the awful days each one awful and hateful and painful flora had gathered up her tray and disappeared quietly closing the door but flora had known and somehow shared her triumph felt her position in the school she stood planted and happy in the middle of the pernes hearthrug 3 an island is piece of land entirely surrounded by water miriam kept automatically repeating these words to herself the newly returned children clung about her the next morning in the schoolroom it was morning of heavy wind and rain and the schoolroom was dark and chilly with its summer ﬁreplace the children seemed to her the ﬁrst time small and pathetic she was deserting them after ﬁfteen months of strange intimacy she was going away ever during the usual routine days the little girls always seemed large and formidable she was quite sure they were not so to the other teachers and she hesitated when she thought over this difference between the explanation which accounted their size and redoubtableness by her own feebleness and the one to which she inclined when she felt her success teacher she had discovered that the best plan was to stand side by side with the children in face of the things they had to learn treating them equals and giving explanations when these were necessary if they were obvious and might have been discovered by the children themselves never if they were possessions of her own to be imparted never claiming knowledge superior to their own the business of the teacher is to make the children independent to get them to think themselves and that s much more important than whether they get to know facts she would say irrelevantly to the pernes whenever the question of teaching came up she bitterly resented their vision of children malleable subordinates and there were many moments when she seemed to be silently exchanging this determination of hers with her pupils good or bad she knew it was the secret of her inﬂuence with them and so long she was faithful to it both she and they enjoyed their hours together very often she was tired feeble with fatigue and scamping all opportunities this too they understood and never took advantage of her one or two of them would even when she failed try to keep things going on her own method all this was sheer happiness to her the bread and wine of her days but now and again perhaps during the recess this impersonal relationship gave way and the children clung fawning all round her passionately competing nearness touching and clinging and snatching kisses there was thought or uprightness or laughter then their hands were quick and eloquent and their eyes wide and deeply smiling with those strange women s smiles sometimes she could respond in kind answering to their smiles and caresses making gentle foolish sounds and feeling their passion rise to frenzy of adoration the little deprecating consoling sounds that they made they clung told her that if she chose steadily to remain always gentle and deprecating and consoling and reproachful she could dominate them persons and extort in the long run complete personal obedience to herself so that they would their work her sake and live by and through 263 the project gutenberg ebook of backwater pilgrimage volume 2 by dorothy richardson https hating her even they fawned she knew they were ﬁghting between their aching desire perfection of tenderness in her and their fear lest she should fulﬁl the desire she was always tempted an instant to yield and ﬂing herself irrevocably into the abyss letting the children go on one by one into the upper school carrying her gift only passionate memory such she herself had one of her nursemaids leaving her downstairs with an endless successi on of new loves different but always the same she would become like kind of nun making bare subsistence but so beloved always so quivering and tender and responsive that human love would never fail her and when strength failed there would be hands held out to shelter her decline but the vision never held her more than moment there was something in the thought of such pure personal sentiment that gave her feeling of treachery towards the children mentally she ﬂung them out and off made them stand upright and estranged she could not give them personal love she did not want to nor to be entangled with them they were going to grow up into north london women most of them loudly scorning everything that was not materi ally proﬁtable these would remember her with few would escape these would remember her at strange moments that were coming them moments when they would recognise the beauty of things like the psalm of life that she had induced them to memorise without understanding it this morning sense of their softness and helplessness went to her heart she had taught them so little but she had forced them to be impersonal almost savagely she had done that she had never taken them by trick 4 and now they were going to be julia s children julia would teach there in the room with them ﬁlling the room her own way there would be more talk about general ideas she would have to keep on the object lessons because the pernes had been so pleased with the idea and the children had liked them there would still be those moments with balls the solar system and candle the sun and the blinds down but there would not be anything like that instant when all the eyes round the table did nothing but watch the movement of shadow on ball the relief afterwar ds the happiness and the moment of intense love in the to be forgotten all of them knowing each other all their differences gone away even the clever watchful eyes of the cheating little jewess real and unconscious moment julia would be watching the children much the shadow and the children would never quite forget julia she would get to know great deal about the children but there would be reverence big cold outside things she would teach them to be kind little she thought all children were darlings and talked to them all in her wheedling coaxing adoring way if one or two were not it was the fault of the way they were treated something in the english way of dealing with them nearly all the elder girls she disapproved of they were longer were english she was full of contempt and indignant laughter them and of pity the wee things who were growing up yet she got on with them all and had the secret of managing them without letting them see her feelings there was something specially bad in the english way of bringing up children not the education exactly but something else something in the way they were treated something in the way they were brought up made english women so their smiles julia did not smile or smirk she265 266 the project gutenberg ebook of backwater pilgrimage volume 2 by dorothy richardson https great deal often to tears and she would often suddenly beam it was like light coming from under her thick white skin was julia the answer to the awfulness of englishwomen if julia said the children were all right and only the girls and awful it

head held and not looking at the girls grave voice full of scripture history but broken all the time quivering with laughter and shoutings which she never uttered hilarious she taught system of things she had been brought up in but all the same she rushed along sweeping the girls with her and the girls believed her if i taught her system i should have false lips and the girls would not believe if ever anyone had the courage to tell her of any dreadful thing she would weep it all away and the person would begin all over again certainly much possible in the fairchild way again and again until they died supposing murderer came and sat down in the hall supposing miss deborah had been brought up people from behind miss jenny exasperatedly trying to wake all the girls up to the importance of
