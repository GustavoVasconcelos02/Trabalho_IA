traveling with bassoon or clarionet packed in your trunk and romance will pass you by but far otherwise will events shape themselves if you set forth with fiddle the moment i turned my back upon the humdrum flute and embraced the that instrument of romance things began happening thick and fast in hitherto uneventful life i found that to sally forth with your couchant under your arm like lance of the days of chivalry was to invite adventure you tempted providence to make things interesting you up to the moment when you returned home and stood your fat melodious friend in the corner on his one the stork that other purveyor of joyful surprises one reason why the is particularly liable to meet with musical adventures is because the nature of his talent is so plainly visible the parce l under his arm labels him fiddler in larger than hearst ever invented headlines it is seen of all men there is concealm ent possible it would indeed be less practicable to hide your under bushel than to hide bushel under your the obesity of this instrument is apt to bring you adventure s of all sorts wrathful sometimes when urchins recognize it target snowballs or when adults audibly quote dean swift asinine remark was fiddler and therefore rogue absurd sometimes when the in the subway bars your path under the misapprehension that you are carrying and when the small boys at the exit offer you satur day evening post in return tune on that there banjo but more often the episodes are pleasant when your bulky trademark enables some kindred spirit to recognize you his predestined companion on impromptu adventures in music i was at first almost painfully aware of my conspicuousness because i had abandoned it an instrument so retiring by nature that you might carry it till death in your side pocket yet never have it contribute an unusual episode to your career but from the moment when i discovered the exaggerated old fiddle in the attic slumbering in its black coffin and wondered what it was all about and brought it resurrection and life began i have never known exactly what was the magic inherent in the dull guttural discouraged protests of the strings which i experimentally plucked that day but their seemed to pregnant with promises of beauty and romance far beyond the ken of the forthright flute so then and there i decided to embark upon the delicate and dangerous enterprise of learning another instrument it was indeed delicate and dangerous because it had to be prosecuted secretly sketching hostile fortifications father must not suspect i feared that if he heard the demonic groans of g string in pain or the ghoulish whimperings of manhandled he would mount to the attic throw back his head look down upon through those lower crescents of his spectacles which always made him look trifle unsympathetic and pronounce that baleful formula son come into my study i knew he labored under the delusion that i already in too much time on the flute away from the companionship of all gaul enteuthen exelaunei and any additional instru ment i feared that he would reduce it to pulp at sight and too my first secret step was to secure long strip of paper to be pasted on the finge under the strings it was all pockmarked with black dots and letters so that if the music told you to play the note g all you had to was to contort your neck properly and remove your left hand from the path of vision then gaze and upside down at the finger until you discovered the particular dot labeled the next move was to clap your fingertip upon that dot and straighten out your neck and eyes and apply the bow then out would come triumphant g is provided your fingers had not already rubbed g characteristically undershot lip so much to erase away the letter individuality in that case to be sure all your striving g might result only in c after all it was fascinating work though and every afternoon the hour of four and father approached i would set like sprin ter on my mark in the upper hall the moment the front door closed definitely behind my parent i would dash the attic and commence my cervical and ocular contortions it was dangerous too it was so hard to stop betimes that one evening father made my blood run cold by inquiring were you moaning about upstairs before dinner i fear that i attributed these sounds to travail in latin scholarship and an alleged sympathy the struggles of the dying the project gutenberg ebook of atlantic classics https paper finger was so efficacio us that in week i felt ready to taste the first fruits of toil so i insinuated pair of musical friends into the house one afternoon to try an easy trio they were brother and sister who played violin and piano things went so brilliantly that we resolved on public performance within few days at the south high school alas if i had only taken the supposed rapidity of my progress with grain of attic salt but my only solicitude was over the problem how to smuggle the too conspicuous instrument to school on the morning of the concert without the knowledge of vigilant father we decided at last that any such attempt would be suicidal rashness so i borrowed another boy father and in default of the printed strip i penciled under the strings notes of the whereabouts of g c and so forth making g shoot out the lip with extra decision our public performance was succès fou is it was succès up to certain point and fou beyond it when one disaster followed another my fingers played so hard to rub out g lower lip they quite obliterated turned into f and b into fair imitation of these involuntary revisions led to introduce the very boldest modern harmonies into one of the most naïvely traditional strains of cornelius gurlitt now in the practice of the art of music one never with impunity pours new harmonic wine into old bottles the thing is simply not done perhaps though we might have muddl ed through somehow had not my violinist friend during rest poked cruelly in the ribs with his bow and remarked in coarse stage whisper who there i looked and gave gasp it might have passed an excellent rehearsal of my last gasp in the very front row he appeared sardonic and businesslike the fatal formula seemed already to be trembling upon his lips the remnants of b c d and so forth suddenly blurred before my crossed eyes with the most dismal report our old bottle of chamber music blew up and i fled from the scene son come into my study in an ague i had waited half the evening those hated words and with laggard step and miserable forebodings i followed across the hall but the day was destined to end in still another surprise when father finally faced in that awful sanctum he was actually smiling in the jolliest manner and i divined that the rod was going to be spared all this he inquired you surprise your old dad eh come tell about it so i told him about it and he was so sympathetic that i found courage the great request i stammered i think i hold the bow just right it scratches so please might i take just four lessons from regular teacher so i could learn all about how to play the father choked little but he looked jollier than ever he replied my son on condition that you promise to lay the flute entirely aside until you have learned all about how to play the i promised i have faithfully kept that promise i i fiddlers errant are apt to rush in and occupy the centre of the stage where angels in good and regular practice fear even to tune up one of the errant pet vagaries is to volunteer his services in orchestras too good him not long after discovering that i would need more than four lessons to learn quite all there was to know about the fact just nine months after discovering the coffin in the attic in hearing that the messiah was to be given at christmas i approached the conductor and magniloquently informed him that i was and that seeing he was he i would contribute my services without money and without price to the coming performance with rather dubious air my terms were accepted that same evening at rehearsal i found that the entire bass section of the orchestra consisted of three these were presided over by an inaudible and therefore negligible little girl hoary sage who always arrived very late and left very early and myself i shall never forget my sensations when the sage at crucial point suddenly packed up and left an undeveloped musical atlas to bear the entire weight of the orchestra on one pair of puny shoulders under these conditions it was memorable ordeal to read at sight trumpet shall sound the trumpet sounded indeed that was more than the did in certain passages the dead being raised however that happened according to programme after this episode i pulled myself together only to fall into cruel and unusual pit which the treacherous händel dug by writing one single passage in that unfamiliar alto clef the project gutenberg ebook of atlantic classics https so much like the usual tenor clef that before the least suspicion of impend ing disaster dawns you are down in the pit hopelessly floundering i emer ged from this rehearsal barely alive but i had really enjoyed myself so much more than i had suffered or made others suffer that my initial impulse to rush at sight into strange orchestras now became stereotyped into habit since then what delightful evenings i have spent in the old café martin and in the old café boulevarde where my friends in the orchestras were ever ready to resign their instruments into my hands course or two and the leader always let pick out the music but one afternoon in upper broadway i met with the sort of adventure that figures in the fondest dreams of fiddlers errant i had strolled into the nearest hotel to use the telephone i passed through the restaurant my attention was caught by vaguely familiar strain from the musicians gallery surely this was unusual spiritual provender to offer crowd of typical new york diners more and more absorbed in trying to recognize the music i sank into an armchair in the lobby the telephone quite forgotten the instruments were working themselves up to some magnificent climax and working up at the same time it began to sound more and more like the greatest of all music musician very holiest of holies surely i must be dreaming my fingers crooked themselves pinch but just then the unseen instruments swung back into the opening theme of the brahms piano quartette in major merciful heavens brahms quartette in broadway pan in wall street silence with three jumps i was up in the little gallery wringing the hands of those performers and calling down blessings upon their quixotism musical missionaries echoed the leader in amusement we could never hope to convert those down there he waved scornful hand at the consumers of lobster below and then we play brahms just in order that we may save our own souls the rose saluted and extended his bow in my direction like some proud commander surrendering his sword it please you he inquired play the next movement it pleased i i i fiddlers errant find that traveling with is almost almost traveling with child it helps you example in cultivating friendly relations with fellow passengers suppose there is broken wheel or the engineer is waiting number 26 to pass or you are stalled three days in blizzard more jolly than to undress your and play each of those present the tune he would most like to hear and lead the congrega tional singing of to only and sweet home fiddle may even make tenable one of those railway junctions which stevenson cursed the nadir of intrinsic uninterestingness and which mr clayton hamilton praised with such brio but this is only the bright side in some ways traveling with is uncomfortable traveling not only with baby but with donkey unless indeed you have an instrument with convenient hinged door in the back so that you may pack it full of pyjamas collars brushes mss and so forth thus dispensing with bag or unless you can calk up its f holes and use the instrument canoe on occasion is about inconvenient traveling companion the corpse in tale which would insist on getting into the wrong box some idea of the awkwardness of taking the along in sleeping car may be gathered from its nicknames it is called the it is called the but unlike either bulls or kennels it can not safely be forwarded by freight or express the formula pullman travel with is follows first ascertain whether the conductor will let you aboard with the instrument if not try the next train when successful fee the porter heavily at sight thus softening his heart so that he will assign the only spare upper birth to your baby and warn him in impressive tones that the instrument is priceless and on account to touch it you need not fear thieves sooner than steal the would button his coat over baby white elephant and let it tusk his vitals i have cause to remember my first and only holiday trip with the princeton glee mandolin and banjo clubs my function being to play solos and to assist the mandolin club i demanded the an upper berth in the special car but i was overwhelmed with howls of derision and assurances that i was very fresh soph indeed the first night my instrument reposed in some mysterious recess under leaky cooler where all too much water flowed under its bridge before the dawn the second night it was compressed into strait and narrow closet with brushes and brooms whence it emer ged with hollow chest stoop consumptive quality of voice and the malady known compr essio pontis thereafter it occupied the same upper with twice i overlaid it with fatal the project gutenberg ebook of atlantic classics https travel with is not much more agreeable in trolleys you have to hold it more delicately than any babe and be ready to give to any one who lurches in your direction and to raise it from the floor every time you jolt over or run over pedestrians fear of jarring the delicate adjustment of the holiday crush down town the best way to negotiate it with is to fix the sharp in place and then holding the instrument at charge like bayonet impale those who seem most likely to break its ribs after my full share of such experiences i learned that if you are fiddler errant it is better to leave your instrument at home and live on the country it were trusting to the fact that you can beg borrow or rent some kind of fiddle and of chamber music almost anywhere if you know how to go about it i v only try it in sicily several months i had buried the fiddler in the errant pure and simple when one sunset across gorge in monte venere my first strain of sicilian music floated to reawaken in all the primeval instincts of the musical adventurer the melody came from the reed pipe of he drove his flock down into taormina such pipe was perhaps to theocritus what the fiddles of stradivarius are to us it was pleasant to imagine that this music might possibly be the same that used to inspire the tenderest of sicilian poets hundred years ago piercingly sweet indescribably pathetic the melody recalled the largo in dvořák new world symphony yet there on the mountain with ætna rosy on the right and the purple mediterranean shimmering far below the voice of the reed sounded more divine than any english horn or boehm flute i had ever heard singing in the depths of modern orchestra and i began to doubt whether music was so completely product of the last three centuries it purported to be but that evening when the ensnared by american gold turned himself into modern chamber musician in our hotel room i regained poise removed from its properly romantic setting like seaweed from the sea the pastoral stop of theocritus became unmistakably penny whistle with an intonation of the whistle conventional purity our captured comatas seemed to realize that the environment was against him and that things were going he refused to venture on any of the soft lydian airs of monte venere and confined himself strictly to tarantellas native dances which he played with magnificent feeling rhythm if not while with pencil i on the fly one was to this ef fect the project gutenberg ebook of atlantic classics https this was going on chance hotel acquaintance dropped into the room and revealed himself professor by explaining that the tarantel la was named its birthplace the old greek city of taranto over yonder in the heel of the italian boot that dancing it was once considered the only cure the maddening bite of the spider known the lycosa tarantula and that some of the melodies our was playing might possibly be ancient greek tunes handed down traditionally in taranto and later dispersed over calabria and sicily this all sounded rather academic but his next words sent the little professor soaring in our estimation he disclosed himself fiddler errant by wistfully remarking that all this made him long two things his violin and chance to play trios right heartily did we introduce ourselves pianist and errant at his service and he and i decided to visit catania next day to scout fiddles and music we thought we would look the music first next day accordingly we invaded the largest music store in catania did they have trios violin violoncello and piano we were shown derangement of la somnambula violin and piano and another and piano if we omitted one of the piano parts we were assured very beautiful trio would result surely one from four makes three finding us hard to please the storekeeper referred us to the conductor of the opera who offered to rent us all the standard works of chamber music the he offered us turned out to be elementary pieces labeled piano and violin or but nothing we could say was able to persuade our conductor that did not mean to this day i feel sure that he is ready to defend his interpretation of this word against all the project gutenberg ebook of atlantic classics https turned three more music stores upside down and had already abandoned the hunt in despair when we discovered fourth in narrow side street there were only five minutes in which to catch the train but in thirty seconds we had unearthed genuine piece of chamber music hallelujah it was the finale of the first beethoven trio suddenly the oil of joy curdled to mourning the thing was an arrangement piano solo we left hurriedly when the proprietor began assuring us that the original effect would be secured if the piano was doubled in the treble by the violin and in the bass by the this piano solo was the nearest approach to chamber music that thorough search and research revealed in the island of trinacria but afterwards recollecting the misadventure in tranquility we concluded that it was absurd to look chamber music in sicily to look wacht am rhein among the idylls of theocritus v scene city composed of one department store and three houses on the forbidding shores of newfoundland time one of those times when fellow needs friend he in stern strange land on pleasure has to have check cashed i know why it is that one always runs out of ready money in newfoundland perhaps because salmon flies are such fleeting creatures of day that you must send many postal orders to johns more perhaps because the customs officials at port au basques make you deposit so much duty on your fishing tackle at any rate there i was penniless with the burly storekeeper scowling in savage manner at my check and not knowing at all whether to take chance on it finally he thought he would but conceded that i might spend night under his roof there was really nowhere else to go at this pass something made think of music perhaps it was the parlor piano which when new back in the stone age had probably been in tune i inquired whether there were any other instruments the wreckage of violin was produced with two pieces of string and table fork i set up the prostrate post i glued together the bridge and put it in position the technique of the angler proved helpful in splicing together some strings the was eked out with piece of salmon leader while an old mandolin yielded wire when all was at last ready fresh difficulty occurred to the violin was an instrument which i had never learned to play but necessity is the mother of pretension i thought of that check and placing the small fiddle carefully between my knees i pretended that it was so the daughter of the house seated herself at the relic of the stone age and we had concert newfoundland appeared not to be in the matter of pitch and and how it did enjoy music the audience was of descent we rendered equal parts of through the rye save the king and mavourneen then the proprietor requested the sextette from lucia while it was forthcoming he toyed furtively with his bandana when it ceased he encored it with all his might then he slipped out storewards and presently returned with the fattest blackest most cigar i ever saw which he gravely prof fered like he remarked in his quaint idiom hear music at scattered times he was trying to affect indifference but his gruf f voice shook and i knew then that music hath charms to cash the savage check v i this essay has rambled on an unconscionable while the shades of editorial night are already descending and still i have not yet described one of those unexpected and perfect orgies of chamber music of those little earthly paradises full of too few which true fiddlers errant hope to find in each new place they visit but which usually keep well in advance of them like the foot of the rainbow one such adventure came to not long ago in california city while i was gathering material book of travel on my first evening there i was taken to dine with writer in his beautiful home which he had built with his own two hands in the spanish mission style during fourteen years of joyous labor this gentleman had idea that i was to be thrust upon him but his hospitality went so far the project gutenberg ebook of atlantic classics https insist before the evening was over that i must stay week he would not take an answer and my part i had desire to say becaus he was delightful person his home with its patio was most alluring and i had discovered promising possibilities fiddlers errant in the splendid and the collection of phonograph records of indian music which mine host had himself made in arizona and new mexico then too there were rumors of skillful musical vagabonds in the vicinity such an environment fairly cried aloud impromptu fiddling so armed with note to the best violinist in that part of california i set forth next morning on the trail of the ideal orgy at the address given i was told that my man had moved and his address was not known that was setback indeed but determined fiddlers errant usually land on their feet on the way back i chanced to hear some masterly strains of issuing from brown bungalow and ringing at venture i was confronted by the very man i sought blocking the doorway he read the note looking bored professionals usually when asked to play with amateurs but just he began to tell how busy he was and how impossible and so forth he happened to glance again at the envelope and very slight gleam came into his eye not by any chance the fellow who wrote that thing about fiddlers in the atlantic are you he inquired at my nod he very flatteringly unblocked the doorway and dragged inside pumping my hand up and down in painful manner shout ing his wife and making various kind representations all at the same time and his talk gradually simmered down into an argument that of course the only thing to was to fiddle together that very night i asked who had the best in town he told the man name but looked dubious trouble is he loves that big amati if it were twins i doubt if he could bring himself to lend it to any one anyway let try he scribbled card to his friend and promised if i were successful to bring along good pianist and play trios in the evening so i set forth on the trail of the amati its owner had just finished his noonday stint in hotel orchestra and looked somewhat tired and cross he glanced at the card and then assumed most conservative expression and tried to fob off on cheap belonging to one of his pupils which sounded very much cigar tastes at this point i gave him the secret grip and whispered into his ear one of those magic pass words of the craft which in trice convinced him that i was in position to dandle with tender solicitude any man alive on my promising moreover to taxicab it both ways with the sacred burden he passed the amati over and the orgy of fiddlers errant was assured and that night how those beautiful spanish walls did resound to beethoven and dvořák and brahms most originally interspersed with the voice of the mexican servant guitar with strange lovely songs of the aboriginal west and south with the bottled sunshine of californian while el alcalde maiore the lone gnarled that filled the patio looked in through the open windows and contributed by way of accompaniment leafy arpeggios sotto voce and sometimes during rests i remembered to be thankful that i had once snapped my fingers at the howling wolf and at fat while i scribbled the atlantic that little essay on fiddlers which had gained this priceless evening turtle eggs agassiz by dallas lore sharp it is one of the wonders of the world that so few books are written with every human being possible book and with many human being capable of becoming more books than the world could contain is the project gutenberg ebook of atlantic classics https amazing that the books of men are so few and so stupid i took down recently from the shelves of great public library the four volumes of agassiz contributions to the natural history of the united states i doubt if anybody but the charwoman with her duster had touched those volumes years they are an excessively learned monumental an work the fruit of vast and heroic labors with colored plates on stone showing the turtles of the united states and their embryology the work was published more than half century ago by subscription but it looked old beyond its heavy weathered if dug from the rocks it was difficult to feel that agassiz could have written have built it grown it the laminated pile had required its growth the patience and painstaking care of process of nature if it were kind of printed coral reef agassiz this the big human magnetic man at work upon these pages of capital letters roman figures brackets and parentheses in explanation of the pages of diagrams and plates i turned away with sigh from the weary learning to read the preface when great man writes great book he usually flings preface after it and thereby saves it sometimes from oblivion whether so or not the best things in most books are their prefac es it was not however the quality of the preface to these great volumes that interested but rather the wicked waste of durable that went to its making reading down through the catalogue of human names and of thanks help received i came to sentence beginning new england i have myself collected largely but i have also received valuable contributions from the late rev zadoc thompson of burlington from henry thoreau of concord and from jenks of middleboro and then it hastens on with the thanks in order to get to the turtles if turtles were the one and only thing of real importance in all the world turtles doubt are important extremely important embryologically part of our genealogical tree but they are away down among the roots of the tree compared with the late rev zadoc thompson of burlington i happen to know nothing about the rev zadoc but to he looks very interesting indeed any reverend gentleman of his name and day who would catch turtles agassiz must have been interesting and henry thoreau we know he was interesting the rarest in the united states was not so rare specimen this gentleman of walden woods and concord we are glad even this line in the preface about him glad to know that he tried in this untranscendental way to serve his day and generation if agassiz had only put chapter in his turtle book about it but this is the material he wasted this and more of the same human sort the jenks of middleboro at the end of the quotation was years later an old college professor of mine who told some of the particulars of his turtle contributions particulars which agassiz should have found place in his big book the preface says merely that this gentleman sent turtles to cambridge by the and scanty recognition that is not the only thing this gentleman did on one occasion he sent not turtles but turtle eggs to brought them i should say and all there is to show it so far i could discover is sectional drawing of bit of the mesoblastic layer of one of the eggs of course agassiz wanted to make that mesoblastic drawing or some other equally important drawing and had to have the fresh turtle egg to draw it from he had to have it and he got it great man when he wants certain turtle egg at certain time always gets it he gets someone else to get it i am glad he got it but what makes sad and impatient is that he did not think it worth while to tell about the getting of it and so made merely learned turtle book of what might have been an exceedingly interesting human book it would seem naturally that there could be nothing unusual or interesting about the getting of turtle eggs when you want them nothing at all if you should chance to want the eggs you chance to find them so with anything else copper stock instance if you should chance to want it and should chance to be along when they chance to be giving it away but if you want copper stock say of c h quality when you want it and are bound to have it then you must command more than college professor salary and likewise precisely when it is turtle eggs that you are bound to have agassiz wanted those turtle eggs when he wanted minute over three hours from the minute they were laid yet even that does not seem exacting hardly more difficult than the getting of hen eggs only three hours old just so provided the professor could have had his private in harvard yard and provided he could have made his turtles lay but turtles will not respond like hens to and the warm mash the professor problem was not to get from mud turtle nest in the back yard to the table in the laboratory but to get from the laboratory in cambridge to some pond when the turtles were laying and back to the laboratory within the limited time and this in the days of darius green might have called nice and discriminating it the project gutenberg ebook of atlantic classics https had been engaged long time upon his contributions he had brought the great work nearly to finish it was indeed finished but one small yet very important bit of observation he had carried the turtle egg through every stage of its development with the single exception of very that stage of first cleavages when the cell begins to segment immediately upon its being laid that beginning stage had brought the contributions to halt to get eggs that were fresh enough to show the incubation at this period had been impossible there were several ways that agassiz might have proceeded he might have got leave of absence the spring term taken his laboratory to some pond inhabited by turtles and there camped until he should catch the reptile digging out her nest but there were difficulties in all of those who are college professors and naturalists know this was quite out of the question he did the easiest jenks of middleboro to get him the eggs jenks got them agassiz knew all about his getting of them and i say the strange and irritating thing is that agassiz did not think it worth while to tell us about it at least in the preface to his monumental work it was many years later that jenks then college professor told how he got those eggs to agassiz i was principal of an academy during my younger years he began was busy one day with my classes when large man suddenly filled the of the room smiled to the four corners of the room and called out with big quick voice that he was professor agassiz course he was i knew it even before he had had time to shout it to across the room i get him some turtle eggs he called yes i would and would i get them to cambridge within three hours from the time they were laid yes i would and i did and it was worth the doing but i did it only once i promised agassiz those eggs i knew where i was going to get them i had got turtle eggs there particular patch of sandy shore along pond few miles distant from the academy hours was the limit from the railroad station to boston was miles from the pond to the station was perhaps three or four miles from boston to cambridge we called about three miles forty miles in round numbers we figured it all out before he returned and got the trip down to two hours time from the pond to the station from the station by express train to boston from boston by cab to cambridge this left an easy hour accidents and delays and car and carriage we reckoned into our but what we did figure on was the turtle and he paused abruptly man he went on his shaggy brows and spectacles hardly hiding the twinkle in the eyes that were bent severely upon man when you go after turtle eggs take into account the turtle that bad advice youth never reckons on the youth seldom ought to only old age does that and old age would never have got those turtle eggs to agassiz was in the early spring that agassiz came to the academy long before there was any likelihood of the turtles laying but i was eager the quest and so fearful of failure that i started out to watch at the pond fully two weeks ahead of the time that the turtles might be expected to lay i remember the date clearly it was may 14 little before near three would drive over to the pond hitch my horse near by settle myself quietly among some thick cedars close to the sandy shore and there i would wait my kettle of sand ready my eye covering the whole sleeping pond here among the cedars i would eat my breakfast and then get back in good season to open the academy the morning session so the watch began i soon came to know individually the dozen or more turtles that kept to my side of the pond shortly after the cold mist would lift and melt away they would stick up their heads through the quiet water and the sun slanted down over the ragged rim of the slow things would float into the warm lighted spots or crawl out and doze comfortably on the hummocks and snags fragrant mornings those were how fresh and new and unbreathed the pond odors the woods odors the odors of the ploughed water and wild grape and the soil i can taste them yet and hear them still large sounds of the waking pickerel breaking the quiet with his swirl the kingfisher dropping anchor the stir of feet and wings among the trees and then the thought of the great book being held up those were rare mornings there began to be good many of them the turtles showed desire to lay they sprawled in the sun and never one came out upon the sand if she intended to help on the great professor book the project gutenberg ebook of atlantic classics https of her eggs was of small concern to her her contribution to the natural history of the united states could wait it did wait i began my watch on the 14th of may june first found still among the cedars still waiting i had waited every morning sundays and rainy days alike june first was perfect morning but every turtle slid out upon her log if might be matter strictly of next year i began to grow uneasy impatient yet naturalist learns his lesson of patience early and all his years but i began to fear lest by some subtile sense my presence might somehow be known to the creatures that they might have gone to some other place to lay while i was away at the i watched on to the end of the first week on to the end of the second week in june seeing the mists rise and vanish every morning and along with them vanish more and more the poetry of my early morning vigil poetry and rheumatism can not long dwell together in the same clump of cedars and i had begun to feel the rheumatism month of morning mists wrapping around had at last soaked through to my bones but agassiz was waiting and the world was waiting those turtle eggs and i would wait it was all i could there is use bringi ng china to turtle she is not open to any such delicate suggestion came sunday morning with dawn breaking little after three warm dawn with the level mist lifted from the level surface of the pond full hour higher than i had seen it any morning before was the day i knew it i have heard persons say that they can hear the grass grow that they know by some extra sense when danger is nigh that we have these extra senses i fully believe and i believe they can be sharpened by cultivation month i had been watching brooding over this pond and now i knew i felt stirring of the pulse of things that the turtles could more escape than could the clods and i my horse unhitched if he too understood i slipped eagerly into my covert look at the pond i did so large pickerel ploughed furrow out through the spatter and in his wake rose the head of an enormous turtle swinging slowly around the creature headed straight the shore and without pause scrambled out on the sand was about the size of big but that was not what excited so much her manner and the gait at which she moved there was method in it and fixed purpose on she came shuffling over the sand toward the higher open fields with hurried determined that was taking her somewhere in particular and that was bound to get her there on time i held my breath had she been dinosaurian making mesozoic footprints i could not have been more fearful footprints in the mesozoic mud or in the sands of time were nothing to when compared with fresh turtle eggs in the sands of this pond over the strip of sand without stop she paddled and up narrow into the high grass along fence then up the narrow on all fours just like another turtle i paddled and into the high wet grass along the fence i kept well within sound of her she moved recklessly leaving trail of flattened grass foot and half wide i wanted to stand up i believe i could have turned her back with rail i was afraid if she saw that she might return indefinitely to the pond so on i went flat to the ground squeezing through the lower rails of the fence if the field beyond were it was nothing of the kind only wild uncomfortable pasture full of dewberry vines and very discouraging they were excessively wet vines and briery i pulled my far over my fists i could get them and with the tin pail of sand swinging from betwe en my teeth to avoid noise i stumped fiercely but silently on after the turtle was laying her course i thought straight down the length of this dreadful pasture when not far from the fence she suddenly hove to warped herself short about and came back barely clearing at clip that was thrilling i warped about too and in her wake bore down across the corner of the pasture across the powdery public road and on to fence along field of young corn i was somewhat wet by this time but not so wet i had been before wallowing through the deep dry dust of the road hurrying up behind large tree by the fence i peered down the and saw the turtle stop and begin to paw about in the loose soft soil she was going to lay i held on to the tree and watched she tried this place and that place and the other eternally feminine the place evidently was hard to find what could female turtle with the project gutenberg ebook of atlantic classics https of possible nests to choose from then at last she found it and whirling about she backed quickly at it and tail first began to bury herself before my staring eyes were not the supreme moments of my life perhaps those moments came later that day but those certainly were among the slowest most dreadfully mixed of moments that i ever experienced they were hours long there she was her shell just showing like some old hulk in the sand alongshore and how long would she stay there and how should i know if she had laid an egg i could still wait and so i waited when over the freshly awakened fields floated four mellow strokes from the distant town clock why there was train until seven train three hours the eggs would spoil then with rush it came over that this was sunday morning and there was regular seven train none till after nine i think i should have fainted had not the turtle just then begun crawling off i was weak and dizzy but there there in the sand were the eggs and agassiz and the great book and i cleared the fence and the forty miles that lay between and cambridge at single jump he should have them trains or those eggs should go to agassiz by seven ck if i had to gallop every mile of the way forty miles any horse could cover it in three hours if he had to and upsetting the astonished turtle i scooped out her round white eggs bed of sand in the bottom of the pail i laid them with what care my trembling fingers allowed filled in between them with more sand so with another layer to the rim and covering all smoothly with more sand i ran back my horse horse knew well i that the turtles had laid and that he was to get those eggs to agassiz he turned out of that field into the road on two wheels thing he had not done twenty years doubling up before the dashboard the pail of eggs miraculously lodged between my knees i let him out if only he could keep this pace all the way to cambridge or even half way there and i would have time to finish the trip on foot i shouted him on holding to the dasher with one hand the pail of eggs with the other not daring to get off my knees though the bang on them we pounded down the wood road was terrific but nothing must happen to the eggs they must not be jarred or even turned over in the sand before they came to agassiz order to get out on the pike it was necessary to drive back away from boston toward the town we had nearly covered the distance and were rounding turn from the woods into the open fields when ahead of at the station it seemed i heard the quick sharp whistle of locomotive did it mean then followed the puff puff puff of starting train but what train which way going and jumping to my feet longer view i pulled into side road that paralleled the track and headed hard the station reeled along the station was still out of sight but from behind the bushe s that shut it from view rose the smoke of moving engine it was perhaps mile away but we were approaching head on and topping little hill i swept down upon freight train the black smoke pouring from the stack the mighty creature pulled itself together its swift run down the rails horse was on the gallop going with the track and straight toward the coming train the sight of it almost maddened bare thought of it on the road to boston on i went on it came quarter of mile between us when suddenly my road shot out along an unfen ced field with only level stretch of sod between and the engine pull that lifted the horse from his feet i swung him into the field and sent him straight an arrow the track that train should carry and my eggs to boston engineer pulled the rope he saw standing up in the rig saw my hat blow off saw wave my arms saw the tin pail swing in my teeth and he jerked out succession of sharp halts but it was he who should halt not i and on we went the horse with flounder landing the carriage on top of the track train was already grinding to stop but before it was near standstill i had backed off the track jumped out and running down the rails with the astonished engineers gaping at had swung aboard the cab offered resistance they had had time nor did they have the disposition i looked strange not to say dangerous hatless ed smeared with yellow mud and holding if it were baby or bomb little tin pail of sand the fireman muttered looking to the engineer his cue i had been crazy perhaps but i was not crazy now the project gutenberg ebook of atlantic classics https throw her wide open i commanded wide open these are fresh turtle eggs professor agassiz of cambridge he must have them before breakfast they knew i was crazy and evide ntly thinking it best to humor threw the throttle wide open and away we went i kissed my hand to the horse grazing unconcernedly in the open field and gave smile to my crew that was all i could give them and hold myself and the eggs together but the smile was enough and they smiled through their smut at though one of them held fast to his shovel while the other kept his hand upon big ugly wrench neither of them spoke to but above the roar of the swaying engine i caught enough of their broken talk to understand that they were driving under full head of steam with the intention of handing over to the boston police perhaps the easiest way of disposing of i was only afraid that they would try it at the next station but that station whizzed past without bit of slack and the next and the next when it came over that this was the through freight which should have passed in the night and was making up lost time the fear of the shovel and the wrench kept from shaking hands with both men at this discovery but i beamed at them and they at i was enjoying it the unwonted jar beneath my feet was wrinkling my diaphragm with spasms of delight and the fireman beamed at the engineer with look that said see the lunatic grin he likes it did like it how the iron wheels sang to they took the rails how the rushing wind in my ears sang to from my stand on the fireman side of the cab i could catch glimpse of the track just ahead of the engine where the ties seemed to leap into the throat of the g monster the joy of it of seeing space swallowed by the mile i shifted the eggs from hand to hand and thought of my horse of agassiz of the great book of my great luck the multitudinous tongues of the thundering train were all chiming luck luck luck they knew they understood this beast of fire and tireless wheels was doing its very best to get the eggs to agassiz swung out past the blue hills and yonder flashed the morning sun from the towering dome of the state house i might have leaped from the cab and run the rest of the way on foot had i not caught the eye of the engineer watching narrowly i was not in boston yet nor in cambridge either i was an escaped lunatic who had held up train and forced it to carry to boston i had overdone the lunacy business suppose these two men should take it into their heads to turn over to the police whether i would or i could never explain the case in time to get the eggs to agassiz i looked at my watch there were still few minutes left in which i might explain to these men who all at once had become my captors but it was too late nothing could avail against my actions my appearance and my little pail of sand i had not thought of my appearance before here i was face and clothes caked with yellow mud my hair wild and matted my hat gone and in my hands tiny tin pail of sand if i had been digging all night with tiny tin shovel on the shore and thus to appear in the decent streets of boston of sunday morning i began to feel like hunted criminal the situation was serious or might be and rather desperately funny at its best i must in some way have shown my new fears both men watched more sharply we were nearing the outer freightyard the train slowed down and came to stop i was ready to jump but i had chance they had nothing to apparently but to guard i looked at my watch again what time we had made it was only six with whole hour to get to cambridge i did like this delay five by i began but was cut short by an express train coming past we were moving again into siding to the main track and on with bump and crash and succession of crashes running the length of the train on at turtle pace but on the fireman quickly jumping the left the way to the step free chance had come i never touched the step but landed in the soft sand at the side of the track and made line the yard fence was hue or cry i glanced over my shoulder to see if they were after evidently their hands were full and they did know i had gone i had gone and was ready to drop over the high when it occurred to that i might drop into policeman arms hanging my pail in splint on top of post i peered cautiously the project gutenberg ebook of atlantic classics https thing to before you jump high there crossing the open square toward the station was big burly fellow with i flattened moment when some one in the yard yelled at i preferred the policeman and grabbing my pail i slid over to the street the policeman moved on past the corner of the station out of sight the square was free and yonder stood cab was flying now here was the last lap the cabman saw coming and squared away i waved paper dollar at him but he only stared the more dollar can cover good deal but i was too much one dollar i pulled out another thrust them both at him and dodged into the cab calling cambridge would have taken straight to the police station had i not said harvard college professor agassiz house i got eggs agassiz and pushed another dollar up at him through the hole was nearly six let him go i ordered here another dollar if you make agassiz house in twenty minutes let him out never mind the police evidently knew the police or there were none around at that time on sunday morning we went down the sleeping streets i had gone down the wood roads from the pond two hours before but with the rattle and crash now of fire brigade whirling corner into cambridge street we took the bridge at gallop the driver shouting out something in hibernian to pair of waving arms and belt and brass buttons the bridge with rattle and jolt that put the eggs in jeopardy and on over the we went half standing to lessen the jar i held the pail in one hand and held myself in the other not daring to let go even to look at my watch i was afraid to look at the watch i was afraid to see how near to seven ck it might be the sweat was dropping from my nose so close was i running to the limit of my time there was lurch and i dove forward ramming my head into the front of the cab coming up with rebound that landed across the small of my back on the seat and sent half of my pail of eggs helter over the floor had stopped here was agassiz house and without taking time to pick up the scattered eggs i tumbled out and pounded at the door one was astir in the house but i would stir them and i did right in the midst of the racket the door opened it was the maid agassiz i gasped i want professor agassiz quick and i pushed by her into the hall go sir i call the police professor agassiz is in bed go sir call or i call him myself i did just then door overhead was flung open great figure appeared on the dim landing above and quick loud voice called excitedly let him in let him in i know him he has my turtle eggs the apparition slipperless and clad in anything but an academic gown came sailing down the stairs maid fled the great man his arms extended laid hold of with both hands and dragging and my precious pail into his study with swift clean stroke laid open one of the eggs the watch in my trembling hands ticked its way to if nothing unusual were happening to the history of the world were in time then i said the tick there stands my copy of the great book i am proud of the humble part i had in it the project gutenberg ebook of atlantic classics https father to his fr eshman son by edward sanford martin doubt my son you have got out of already what there was to help or mar you you are eighteen years old and have been getting it more or less and off and on at least seventeen of those years i regret the imperfections of the source doubt you have recognized them to have father who is attentive to the world indulgent to the flesh and with sort of kindness the son it is good deal of handicap be sure i make allowances you because of it ex eo masculine i remember fons and mons and pons and one other should the pronoun be illo you know i never was an accurate scholar and i suppose you ex eo fonte the stream is bound to run not quite clear my advice to you is quite likely to be bad partly from the imperfection of its source partly because i am not you and partly because of my imper fect acquaintance with the conditions you are about to meet when i came to college my father gave advice he gave his love and some necessary money which did not come i fear easy the love his venerable uncle who lived with great his blessing and told i remember that so far went i could learn much without going to college still he did not discourage my going he was quite right i could have got more out of college than i did get in college and i suppose that you too might get out more than you will get in of course that not the whole story neither is it true of all people college abounded in distractions and i suppose it will you and i was incorrigibly sociable and ready to spend time to get acquainted and more to stay acquainte d and if you have that propensity you need think it was left on the doorstep you come by it lawfully getting acquainted is most of us one of the important branches but it only one of them and to devote one whole time to it is mistake and one that the dean will help you avoid if necessary which probably if i know you at all it wo be it is important to know people but it is more important to be worth knowing college offers you at least two valuable details of opportunity large variety of people to know and large variety of means to make yourself better worth knowing i hope my son that you will avail yourself of both these details this is mechanical age and the most obtrusive of the current mechanisms is the automobile it has valves and cylinders and those things that give it power and speed and rubber tires that it runs on and wheel and and handles and treadles by which it is directed your body especially your stomach is the rubber tires your brains are the cylinders and valves and your will and the spiritual part of you are the chauf feur and his wheel i beg you to be kind to your stomach heretofore it needs alcohol at your time of the less you find occasion to feed into it the more prosperous both your physica l and mental conditions are likely to be i am aware that life and college life in particular has its convivial intervals but you might well understand and i have been remiss or have wasted time if you not understand it already that alcohol is one of the chief abounding in mischiefs if you play with it too hard be wary always wary with it my son and especially with hard liquor your mind like your body is thing whereof the powers are developed by effort that is principal use i see it of hard work in studies unle ss you train your body you ca be an athlete and unless you train your mind you ca be much of scholar the four miles an oarsman covers at top speed is in itself nothing to the good but the physical capacity to hold out over the course is thought to be of some worth so good part of what you learn by hard study may not be permanently retained and may not seem to be of much final value but your mind is better and more powerful instrument because you have learned it is power but still more the faculty of acquiring and using knowledge is power if you have trained and powerful mind you are bound to have stored it with something but its value is more in what it can what it can grasp and use than in what it contains and if it were possible it is not to come out of college with trained and disciplined mind and nothing useful in it you would still be ahead and still in manner educated think of your mind muscle to be developed think of it searchlight that is to reveal the truth to you and cheat it or neglect it to competitive scholarship to my mind it is like competitive athletics those who have the powers and like the game tests are useful they stimulate one ambition and so competitions but success in competitive scholarship like success in competitive athletics may of course be too dearly bought not by you though i surmise my son if you were more urgent either scholar or an athlete i might think it needful to warn you not to wear your tires out scorching too early in life things are the project gutenberg ebook of atlantic classics https to you i often say to myself dawdle scramble when you work work when you play play when you rest rest and think all the time when you get hold of an instructor who is worth attention give him attention that is one way of getting the best that college has to offer great deal you may get from books but some of the most valuable things are passed from mind to mind and can only be had from some one who has them or else from the great source of all truth i suspect that the subtle development we call is one of those things and the great spiritual valuables are apt to come that way you know you are still growing both in mind and body and will continue so to be years to come hope always one of the valuable things about college is that it gives you time to grow you wo have to earn any money and will have time to think and get acquainted with yourself and others well with some of the wisdom that is spread upon the records you would be so engaged more or less in these years wherever you might be but in college where you are so much your own man and are freed from the demands and solicitudes of your parents the conditions it are exceptionally favorable i suppose that is one thing that continues the colleges in business since i read so often that at present they are entirely misdirected and teach the wrong things in the wrong way but nobody denies that they give the young breathing spell breathe my son breathe freely remember that the aim of all these prospective processes is to bring out the man there is in you and arm him more or less the jousts ahead it is not to make you over into somebody else that ca be done in three or four years anyhow but only to bring out and train much possible of you there plenty in most of us if we can only get it out more very much more than we ever get out so will you please think of college nursery in which you are to grow while mind you grow then presently to be transplanted it is not if college was the chief arena of human effort nevertheless your effort while you are there it is the chief arena and i am far from giving you the counsel to put off trying until you leave i hear good deal about clubs and societies how many there are how importan t they are how it is that if youth shall gain the whole of scholarship and all athletics and not proper club he shall still fall something short of success in college parents i meet who are more concerned about clubs than about either scholarship or deportment they are concerned and at the same time bothered so many strategies and chances the clubs involve so bad it may be to be in this one so bad to be out of that so much choice there is between them and so much choice exercised within them by which any mother hopeful may be excluded there is democratic ideal of great college without any clubs where the lion and the lamb shall escort one another about with tails entwined and every student shall be like every other student and have similar habits and associates this ideal is good deal discussed and good deal applauded in the public press whether it will ever come true i ca tell but there has been some form or other of clubs in our older colleges i suppose one or two centuries and they are there now and will at least last out your time so it may be you will have to take thought about them in due time not much however until they take thought of you you see clubs seem to be sort of natural provision just tails were maybe before humanity outgrew them i guess there is propensity of nature toward groups and the natural basis of grouping seems to be likeness in feathers and habits the propensity works to include the like and incidentally but necessarily to exclude the unlike whether it is the knights of the round table or the knigh ts of the garter or the phi beta kappa you see these principles working the measure of success in club is its ability to make people want to join it and that seems to be best demonstrated and preserved by keeping most of them out now the advantages of the clubs are considerable to have place always open where you can hang up your hat and where hospitable welcome always awaits you and where there is enough of crowd and not too much and where you can in your later years inspect at all times family of selected under graduates that is valuable and good and pleasant besides and this continuity of interest that the clubs foster among their members helps to keep up in those members lively and helpful interest in their college the drawback to the clubs is their essential selfishness and their disposition to take you out of large family and limit you to small one and one that is not yours by birth or entirely by choice but is selected you lar gely by other persons in any club you yield certain amount of freedom and individuality the amount being determined by the degree in which the club absorbs you yield too much take the mould of any club college is always bigger than its clubs and the biggest thing in college is always man the object of being in college is to develop man if clubs help in that development i think they help some men the project gutenberg ebook of atlantic classics https are gain but of course if they dwarf you down to the dimensions of they are loss some men take their club shape such it is and find sufficient satisfaction in it others react on their clubs take what they have to give add to it what is to be had elsewhere and turn out rather more valuable people than if they had had club experience at all events take this matter of the clubs too hard those youths comparatively few who by luck and circumstances find themselves eligible to them they are an interesting form of discipline or indulgence and i will not say that they are unimportant neither would i have you keep out of them because of their drawbacks if you begin by keeping out of all things that have drawbacks your progress in this world will involve constant hesitations alcohol has numerous drawbacks but i advise you to be teetotaller tobacco has drawbacks but i believe you smoke it money has drawbacks and so has advertisement but bless you we have to take things they come and deal with them we can the trick is to get the kernel and eliminate the shuck large proportion of people the opposite if you can manage that way with the clubs you ever get chance will be amused to observe in due time how large proportion of your brethren value these organizations chiefly their shuck and grasp most eagerly at that the shuck i see it is exclusiveness which is not valuable except to persons justly doubtful of their own merits whereas the kernel is the fellowship of like minds which has always been treasured by the wise the clubs my son some more than others are recruited considerably from what is known the leisure class to be sure i see any very definite or important leisure class about in our land everybody who amounts to anything works and always did and must you ca amount to anything otherwise but the people who have money laid up ahead them are apt to work somewhat less strenuously than the rest of us and not so much money get it into your head that you want to tie up to the leisure class or that the condition of not having to work is desirable have it in mind that you are to work just about hard the quality of your tires and cylinders will warrant plan to get into the game if you have to go on your hands and knees plan to earn your living somehow aim to go through life aim to get soft seat if you you wo have your fair share of fun there is real fun in ease except you need it because you have worked hard i say plan to earn your living wheth er you actually earn the money you live on makes great difference though in your case i guess you have to if you are going to live at all well but if you get money without earning it it leaves you in debt to society somebody has to earn the money you spend in mine factory railroad or office somebody works the money that supports you matter where the money comes from that is true somebody has to earn it if you get it without due labor of your own you owe it recognize that debt and qualify yourself to dischar ge it study to put back into the world somewhat more than you take out of it study to be somewhat more than merely worth your keep study to shoulder the biggest load your strength can carry that is life that is the great sport that brings the great compensations to the soul getting regular meals and nice clothes and acceptable shelter and transportation and agreeable acquaintan ces is only means to an end and if you accept the means and shirk the end the means will pall on you i said acquaintances very large proportion of the acquaintance s you can make will be agreeable if you can bring enough knowledge and sufficiently hospitable spirit to your relations with them i counsel you to cultivate the arts of popularity they are apt not to wash that is to conflict with inside qualities that are vastly more valuable than they are but keep in so far you can an open heart there is one to whom you are not related if only you can find the relation there is one but you owe him benefit if you can see one you can him be too nice it is such an impediment to usefulness stuttering is to speech sort of spiritual indigestion hesitation in your carbureter by all means be gentleman in manners and spirit in so far you know how but be one from the inside out if you had come far you have in life without acquiring manners you might well blush your parents and teachers i think you have but i beg you hold on to all the good manners you have and get more good manners seem to good deal to seek among youth but i suppose they have always been fairly scarce and the more appreciated their scarcity tobacco manners are uncommonly free and bad in this generation more so i think than they were in mine since cigarettes came in especially youths seem to feel licensed to smoke them in all places and company and the boys are prone to too much ease of attitude and lounge and loll appallingly in company and i see them in parlors with their legs crossed in such fashion that their feet might almost well be in the ladies laps have care these matters of deportment be strict with yourself and your postures keep your legs and feet where they belong they were not meant parlor ornaments show respect people lord the project gutenberg ebook of atlantic classics https the things i see done by males with claim to be gentlemen puffed in women faces men who ought to know better smoking they drive out with ladies men who put their feet on the table and expect you to talk over them show respect people all kinds of people including yourself is at the bottom of all good manners they are the expression of discipline of of respect other people rights and comfort and feelings i suppose good manners are unselfish but the most selfish people might well cultivate them they are so remunerative in the details of life in the public vehicles in crowds and in all situations where the demand presses hard on supply what you get by hogging is incomparably less than what you get by courtesy the things you must scramble and elbow are not worth having not one of them they are the swill of life my son leave them to swine you will have to think more or less about yourself because that belongs to your time of life provided you are the sort that thinks at all but overdo it you wo because you will find it all healthy

your entertainment than truly to guide you you live by maxims any more than you speak by rules of grammar you will speak by ear improving i hope in your college environment and you will live by whatever light there is in you getting more i hope you go along grow in grace my son if your spirit is right the details of life will take care of their own adjustment go to church if not invariably

and consoling current through all of life intensive living by cornelia comer s aid honoria casually i was in town yesterday i went to see adelaide in her new house the others looked up alertly martha from her darning grace from her irish crochet really and how did you like the house honoria hesitated looking to the wide view clarification the three sat on cottage veranda in the foothills of southern california one february day in front of them the landscape ran laughing to the sea spread beneath them like map were thirty miles of town and country orange orchards brave with fruit eucalyptus groves appealing to the sky friendly roofs inclosed in trees great open spaces where the wind moved free hills green near at hand the rains had come and gone thus early changing to dusky blue out yonder where the bright pacific flashed at the end of the long delightful view love of this prospect martha had lately left steep sturdy hills brown brooks shaded streets and old friends girding at herself she did so honoria had lived here many years while grace was but winter guest in honori home whose hospitable brown gables low and were visible beyond the cypress hedge encircling martha the project gutenberg ebook of atlantic classics https is mansion she had capable architect the building is tudor graceful well proportioned two people it is very large house indeed but it is good house and i see perfectly how adelaide means it to express the idea of dignified comfortable living the decorator was not bad of his kind either this sounds like praise said grace i feel that you are keeping something back what is the matter with adelaide house again honoria hesitated seems ungracious to find fault with such perfectly worthy performance yet i came away chilled and uncomfortable almost unhappy indeed thinking about the matter on the way home it became clear to at last that the house is too large adelaide personality you know how perfectly she pervaded that old house of hers in some respects inconvenient with far less perfect fittings it still was thoroughly delightful where the rugs failed or the draperies faltered adela ide personality somehow stepped in and eked out all insuf ficiencies corrected all errors it was hers entirely in this blameless achievement of architect and decorator there are insuf ficiencies to be eked out and so adelaide personality seems to slip and slide helplessly upon kind of glacial surface which it can not penetrate and make its own i may be expressing myself very poorly but i know i have hold of something real adelaide new house it is is not interesting is what i mean even the dear woman herself seems less interesting and less herself now that she is enfolded in it you know interposed martha the first winter in new house the heati ng actually requires more coal than is ever needed again i did know i can well believe it why should it take more coal to warm it when it evidently takes more vitality to cheer it it serious business this breaking in of large house to one self late in life so many americans the draughts upon their vital forces are more taxing than the coal bills all ought to live in inherited homesteads suggested grace the humanizing of the bricks and mortar has been done us by our own people martha demanded ignoring this unpractical suggestion the truth if you were in adelaide place and had carte blanche to incarnate your idea of house yourself and your family would you and too i should enjoy doing it the furniture in my bungalow is altogether too sketchy at present and i am tired of eking it out with personality you would feel differently if you had brought your old mahogany when you came west honoria set few stitches and looked at her friends with eyes in which conviction flamed i and i though i have abundant opportunity she said it may be that i would and or at least that i would have done so until yesterday i think i would it that i know what ails adelaide house your bungalow martha it is comfortable and it is alive there is picture on the wall nor an ornament on the mantel that has reason being exactly where it is that is triumph and you know it i believe you would really exchange your house adelaide and see i would like just once to ignore beauty and suitability and go in size and sheer luxurious comfort would go distracted in two weeks in place that was sheer luxurious comfort and nothing else returned honoria decidedly would hate it you hate everything smug and fat and complacent i have known you too long martha not to know the ways of you with house to satisfy you domicile has to be livable if you consider all the houses little and big of your friends you will see that there are fixed limits to the amount of space in them that is truly and pleasantly habitable you ca get the lovable in look in rooms where you not actually live and you ca live all over house that is bigger than your needs why life is long enough especially if you seldom stay at home think how dreary are most of the great houses we know consider king new marble palace with its commanding site and its ninety rooms there is single spot in it except her own and that would give your spirit congestive chill if you sat there an hour i know woman in colorado who so loathed her big new house it left the hands of new york decorator that she would have moved back into the old one if she had been afraid of her friends laughter and grace even inherited homesteads are sometimes difficult uncongenial kin old houses have ways and wills of their own are curious things said grace take morsel of illimitable space and wall it in and roof it over suddenly it ceases to be part of god and becomes an entity with an atmosphere of its own we warm it with our fires we animate it with our affections we furnish it with such things the project gutenberg ebook of atlantic classics https in our eyes we this to get shelter our bodies but we acquire well an instrument our spirits that reacts on us in its turn other words returned honoria warming to her subject we live our way into house adapting it to our need the bricks and mortar the paint and plaster cease to be inert matter and become alive superficial sociologists have taunted woman with being more anabolic or plant than man but i count it her second glory the plant is an organism that slowly turns lifeless into living matter and this is the thing that woman has done from the beginning with her shelter in our houses we achieve almost an organic extension of our very selves that is part of what i was trying to say but obviously there should exist some reasonable ratio between the self and its extensions i take it the modern multitude of overgrown mansions like the kings or the clays or even adelaide smaller dwelling these places whose owners never find out why they are not at home in them symptoms of our modern disease of materialism the essence of that disease is the desire to grasp more matter than the spirit can fully animate that the infection can lay hold on adelaide shows how it is gripping the just well the unjust when i saw her tired and dissatisfied when i felt the lack of charm and quality in the house and remembered how full of both her old house and garden had been i tried to think it out it all works around to just this you ca have quality you ca have charm in your material enviro nment unless you put them into it yourself it is plain question of your ability to choose arrange and vitalize things and the latter requisite is by far the most important of the three i have really seen with these eyes poor mean rooms where absolutely nothing was beautiful or noteworthy so charged with gracious and comforting personality that you forgot their shabbiness and said what place please note that that is the adjective we always use of places that draw us by their if person ality and nothing else were the essence of home adelaide old house had personality it was completely vitalized it was all under her hand and high her heart but adelaide big new house is yet barren and chilly it is not vitalized at all of course i know that after she has lived in it longer it is bound to improve because it is her nature to humanize and modify all her surroundings but the crucial question big house can she humanize something bigger than cottage certainly something much smaller than hotel the longer i looked at this question the more it seemed to that unconsciou sly i had put my finger on the vital query that in the ideal state should underlie all property all education all privilege i have been talking about houses are the most intimate the most organic of woman possessions the argument applies to all we own it is the mark of our to want more of everything than we can use yet when we get the we demand we are crushed by it tarpeia was crushed by the shields i have often thought said grace the sheer brute mass of people to know of books to read of plays to hear of pictures to see of things to buy learn reach of the person in the modern world far outruns the capacity of any human being to take it in and make of it the sane whole that life should be we go crazily on trying to expand to illimitable possibilities thinking we shall be happier so soon we have discarded all our present belongings and opportunities bigger newer richer ones how many people you know who have not met substantial increase of income with corresponding enlar gement of their whole scale of living senseless expansion sometimes their increased ability to provide it there is future but chaos society with such ambitions they are centrifugal and can only lead to disintegration truth is we have notion of the value and necessity of doctrine of limitations just an once in all the mass of matter printed in the last twenty years about the the aeroplane or other inventions capable of enormous swiftness have i seen the faintest intimation that human beings could not intelligently direct speed of two hundred miles an the railroads are now tardily discovering that the capacity of engineers is seriously taxed by sixty miles mistake my meaning i am not preaching the moral value of poverty i am convert to asceticism that method of ridding one self of the overweight of the material life is too extreme to the correct solution i am simply calling attention with all my might to the æsthetic and vital value of i am not afraid of enough i am greatly afraid of and the reason i am afraid is this the capacity of the human stomach is limited to certain quantity of food so also is limited the capacity of the human spirit appropriating and assimilating property in its different forms beyond certain somewhat variable point material possessions the holder more good the common saying all you get in this world is your board and clothes is the popular acknowledgment of this the project gutenberg ebook of atlantic classics https the affirmation of bounds to our capacity holds good regards the property of the education cultivation æsthetic it does of material goods there is definite limit to what we can ef fectively make our own beyond that limit possession is detriment direct result of helping ourselves to too much of anything is to coarsen and degrade we can see this clearly regards the primal necessity of food nature promptly writes it in large letters all over the man or woman of gross appetites is plainly printed if in smaller type on the faces of those who want too much of other things houses notoriety money power you will the porcine brand is there however disguised personally i fear the mark of the pig i fear nothing else on earth shale r says that certain lines of evolution terminate in such grotesque effects that one almost believes the guiding thought behind the process was humorous i never see stye with its squealing shouldering inhabitants without thinking how tremendously satiric it master of human greed not and i say brother pig heaven grant that i keep my voracities better concealed than thou her companions regarded honoria in type thin nervous ardent with keen and vivid face the comparison was certainly not the heart knoweth its own gluttonies are doing fairly well at it thus far said martha dryly the next step in your argument honoria our capacity is limited and since to glut ourselves beyond it burdens and degrades clearly the thing each individual with intelligen ce to is to find out where him lies the golden point beyond which riches turns to the poverty of burden when even the wise and earnest adelaides get their houses too big and know what is the matter it is time to formulate the principles of first aid to the prosperous i believe the point from which the women of the comfortable classes should attack the problem of saner living is this doctrine of limitation and selection and that we should attack it first of all in our homes we human beings really something to our immediate material surroundings which i can best describe charging them with our personality with the revolution of the days personality accumulates in the things we handle and love and live with much electricity gathers upon the accumulator of static machine with the revolution of the plates this idea has always been popular with the poets and artists but people who advance it in everyday life always so apologetically with the air of saying i know this is slightly fantastic but does it seem true yet most housekeepers know its utter truth i never doubted from the time i consciously began to care old furniture old rugs old china the beautiful fs of vanished vast part of their charm was atmosphere something imparted to them by the affection of those forgotten ones and now inhering the perceptive vision in their very substance the craftsman of those elder days is not the only creator of the beauty that has come down to us whoever has loved another work has thereby added something to it is it not so and i in my turn ought to be beautifying my belongings those who come after grace and martha nodded readily enough this doctrine needs long expounding to any woman who has lived her way into her material possessions and distilled atmosphere from them the comfort of her household she knows what she has done and knows though she says little about it that this business of turning lifeless into living things is one of her important natural functions i studied physics honoria went on i learned that science had been compelled to posit ether an absolutely elastic earing substance to explain the commonest facts of our physical experience later yet i learned that the passage of through ether had found defenders among men of the exact sciences naturally i said to myself ah the scientists are growing next they will be demonstrating some of the things women have always known they will show how we send out vibrations that get caught and entangled in our intimate belongings never to be wholly freed again the thing will be worked out and demonstrated like problem in geometry doubtless they will be measuring everybody and teachin g children in the eighth grade easy ways of charging their belongings with their personality so unmistakably that stealing will have to become lost art well they have done it yet in fact they seem so near doing it they once did the mechanism of the process by which i take chair fresh from grand rapids and in the course of years make it my chair and other woman is secret still but i have to argue with anybody who ever had favorite chair that the thing is i have stated it neither i have to argue that i could not so appropriate and make my own the output of an entire factory it must be equally obvious that the dignified proper environment and my family contains what we can thus make our own and not much more course there are people said martha reflectively routine of whose living demands large and formal apartments impossible to anything with from your point of view the project gutenberg ebook of atlantic classics https there are such people honoria admitted there are people whose entertaining must be in the line of banquets rather than little dinners i am not predicating world full of model cottages even though i think it might prove the happiest world still outside of official circles the need of state rooms is certainly not general and it is of the very gist of my argument is all developed yet martha think it the sake of developing finer and more individual quality in our possessions we should cut off some superfluous ones please listen patiently while i carry the idea to its logical limit even though that limit lies beyond the bounds of practicability profess that in an ideal distribution of goods each man would have much he could consume without waste but this takes account of the differing needs of men developed through ages of the upward struggle nor of their different capabilities of turning goods to account if you are going to dabble at all in theories of ideal distribution why not have one that is genuinely is material the true distribution would requir that each man should possess what goods he could animate and vitalize even so how vastly would possessions dif fer in amount and quality life could be adjusted on this basis it would automatically become simplified charged with beauty and with character we should slough off ugly and useless possessions or if we retained through affection things ugly in themselves that very affection would impart to them certain importance and distinction we should then at least live in world in which everything had significance think of the infinite satisfaction of that you mean when you say if life could be adjusted on this basis honoria grace inquired you implying some kind of final socia listic state which calls an omniscient distributor of goods who shall know how much each man can vitalize grace i am not fool even when i am evolving reformed society returned honoria promptly conceptions of an improved state demand god their chief executive and an enormous force of government officials with the fine honor which thus far has only been developed in human nature by conditions entirely different from those the visionaries are forecasting unquestionably we have fallen into the habit of thinking that if we only pass law any wrong at which we aim is regulated in fact however so long that law only expresses the practice of minority its enforcement will be evaded legislation without character is helpless motor without fuel my little reform like every other effective change must proceed from within outward i believe that if i wish to live in world where nobody has more food clothes houses wealth power than he can make significant and vital use of it is up to to remake my own life on that basis first i am if not the only woman whom i can reform at least the most suitable subject my experimentation and i admit that i have too many possessions sometimes i am ridden to exhaustion by the care of my things modest they are when compared to the goods of my neighbors i know that if thousands of people did not feel i the simple life slogan would never have acquired the popularity it had some years ago we longer hear much of the simple life but we need it increasingly personally i am persuaded that the method i am trying to set forth is workable should human being seeking to get the most out of life take lessons from the husbandman seeking to get the richest returns from the soil it used to be thought that to cultivate many acres superficially was the way to feed the world and enrich the farmer but the study of the soil science has taught us that we must resort instead to the intensive farming which gives greater returns from reduced acreage what is true of the returns earth makes to our granaries is true of the returns life makes to our spirits we need science of intensive living that we may get the larger crop from the smaller field it will be worked out by women and it must begin in their domain which still is in spite of the sociologists the home norwegian maid who cared my rooms at the hotel last winter had figured out something of the sort herself said grace i had put few bits of things about she said to i like dis room it looks like norway dere iss more moneys in america but in norway iss more pretty even kitchen iss good to see dere iss shelves an copper all shiny all so i like dem way best it iss better not so much moneys to haf but to be more happy wit one is the doctrine in nutshell in its poorer more restricted days the world learned that secret of the art of living and it still lingers in corners that our blatant crashing civiliza tion passes that norwegian peasant daughter may know far more than an american girl who has always had everything about the priceless secret of being happy wit one it is the richest knowledge woman can possess the project gutenberg ebook of atlantic classics https is the real reason why people go on piling up money after they have enough martha demanded i imagine said honoria excessive accumulation is form of egotism now if public opinion the or what you please once demanded that we vitalize all our possessions if it were once admitted to be unspeakably gross to demand more property than we can animate gross it now is to then the stress upon possession would be transferred at once from how much to how and large possessions would really become what some of the undistinguished rich now fondly imagine them to direct and sensitive register of the finer qualities martha suddenly and irresistibly chuckled i have story you honoria she said lot of ranchers over there she vaguely gestured toward the southwest across the hills grown suddenly rich raising sugar beets and have bought motor and other paraphernalia proper to their improved condition one of them was heard to say i these college graduates that teach school here really think they good us rich folks that is the real attitude of your undistinguished rich toward the gifts of culture and the finer qualities said grace the sages always said give neither poverty nor riches why should your propaganda succeed where job and socrates have failed job lived long while ago if the race were going to be converted to his view the process ought to be more advanced you will need very strong arguments your doctrine of limitations are to be had the picking up returned honoria kind will you have reasonable limitation on the material side always brings some amazing flowering of mind or spirit like the blossoming of plant if you want racial argument consider the poorest people in europe and therefore the richest in spirit poverty forced them to concentrate their attention upon their neighbors there resulted an astonishing increase in sympathy wit and general you want an argument from art consider the middle ages peering out of narrow world hemmed in by ignorance and squalor the mediæval artist caught sight of beauty and immediately loved it with such fervent personal passion that everything he made in its image was vital and wonderful his world broadened in the renaissance much of his art grew florid and meaningless lacking that marvelous intimate quality of the earlier restricted day you want an argument from literary material there the picciola of saintine you can make an imperishable literary masterpiece out of convict love tiny plant struggling up between two stones in but you can not make men listen to tales of great possessions the interest in monte cristo centres upon the process of acquir ement and it is the same in any successful midas is only fit to point moral never to adorn you want an argument from philology consider that the diminutives in every language show the lesser thing to be the dearer thing always remember marie antoinette and the little trianon consider the increasing specialization in which always falls on its feet i know thousand ar guments the thing i am in need of is converts you could get them said martha might really be woman reformation only it would begin at home instead of at the polls other permanent thing is there in life but the hearthstone nations rise and fall laws and institutions come and that remains the one fixed point in human society i take it therefore it is the one point from which the lever can successfully be brought to bear on human society if anything is to be moved or altered the force must be applied there human society has changed honoria urged grace at all our new powers and possessions steam and electricity have remade the world and we are not yet adjusted to the alteration generation ever lived under our conditions thus we have traditions handling our new environment heritage of ancestral wisdom tells us what of the hundreds of new opportunities to accep t what to reject save in so far we are thinking that is not very are much at the mercy of our desires babies in grabbing now this and now that heaping up lapful of futilities and calling it life but why should we make steam and electricity serve our greed only why use them chiefly to darken the world and make life horror dare you affirm that we women and our demands are not at the very centre of the tragic tangle of modern living is all this horrible of business largely an outgrowth of our exactions what men business anyhow except to get us what we want homes are to other material possessions what souls are to the centre from which the life moves outward if there is greed in the home is there not bound to be less greed in the of fices i not so sure honoria grace returned amount of intensiveness in the home would eliminate man love of power its own sake the project gutenberg ebook of atlantic classics https yet is the lust power secondary development we begin by being greedy because we want things we keep on after we have more things than we know what to with because greed has created the power it is the aftermath from that ugly root if the pressure the home puts on the man money were suddenly slackened all along the line above the point of poverty might not the matter of unseemly accumulations correct itself if we women of the more favored classes avowedly undertook to give quality to our belongings instead of demanding belongings which we hope will confer quality upon us there would surely be both lessenin g in the stress of life and an improvement in its texture i can think of nothing else but the golden rule that would help to solve so many menacing problems such the high cost of living the commercialization of life and the divorce problem oh it would be very that attitude if we could only achieve it would plain christianity all your reforming and it better demanded martha abruptly it christianity were more generally condition instead of theory among us i would undertake to say why the sanctions of common sense seem more precious to the present generation than the sanctions of religion when in so many points they are identical but i must conform my theorizings to the fact yet with all our neglect of religion the traditions of the spirit have not changed they are the same from everlasting to everlasting and one of the things the nineteenth century most wonderfully made clear was that the evolution of the spirit is the thing nature has been seeking hundreds of millions of years i suppose that process with the tremendous impetus of all creation behind it is really going to be upset by the turmoil of one materialistic generation but i believe that if we go with the current of materialism we and all our works shall be tossed aside refuse thrown into nature i tell you i ca bear the disgrace of it you almost persuade to be intensive said grace i am not reconciled to the doctrine at one question of beauty i admit that one can not vitalize lot of senseless luxury i admit too that comfort and certain amount of beauty can always be successfully domesticated and charged with personality you phrase it and that the result is completely satisfying but is one never to indulge one self in all the beauty money will buy never to have everything of an absolute perfection you are against great houses but there is mountly house at home it is big but so beautiful that you are at home in it all over what of it and others like it and beautiful it is but it is on my side of the argument none the less if you remember the architect was also the decorator it is the triumph of his imagination he designed it background woman of opulent beauty and domestic tastes he ransacked europe the furnishings tapestries all sorts of exquisite ancient things he was great artist and he created work of art the family fit into the picture more or less awkwardly it is his house not theirs at all and i truly believe that the ultimate purpose of our houses excludes our going up and down another stairs i believe in all the beauty one can vitalize it is essentially wholesome it does not lend itself to morbid demands the collector passion looks like greed and doubtless time it is greed but sooner or later sickens them their adorable possessions teach them there is profanation in having more wonderful things than they can enter into personal relation with therefore the inevitable end of all overgrown collections is the museum or the i have seen it too often not to know it is true if you want perfect illustration of this in literature read wharton the daunt diana it cuts down like knife to the essential fact that our relations with beauty must be limited enough to have the personal quality you see automatic destruction of greed that beauty finally teaches to the collector is the same automatic destruction of it that i dare think intensive living in our homes might bring to all greed it is proof of the theory on another plane i think one might own mountly house without greed persisted grace wistfully house at all i naturally refuse to think of myself ending my days in any less perfect domicile what you mean by the ultimate purpose of our houses that said honoria with quick indrawing of her breath the very core of all my thought and i know how to make you see it she rose abruptly and walked to the end of the veranda she stood there while looking across at the spreading gables of her own brown bungalow with the yearning on her face that only know yonder was her home set on mighty shoulder of the earth facing the sunset and the sea it clung to the soil the brown rocks cling behind it were the mighty sierras with their crests of snow before it the sweetest land god ever smiled upon within it all the treasures of her eyes her mind her heart just it stood there in the february sun it was an abode compact of love of aspiration of desire the ancient love of man his shelter had gone into it and the love of woman the place of her appointed the project gutenberg ebook of atlantic classics https beauty and hope of peace were in its making its walls had heard the her children had played about its doors out from it had been borne her dead inconsiderable speck on the vast that it was it could defy time and the elements even she defied them she had given it of her own immortality i have not yet said it all she said little thickly is hard to say even to you i have found an attitude of mind path way of life i call intensive lack of better name and i believe in it not only because it increases my sane satisfaction in living but also because it finally leads of all this tangle of our material lives into the eternal spaces i see the world of men business activities chiefly place of wrath and greed and yet even the most grasping must be blindly seeking through their greed an ultimate more houses or more automobiles or railroads or mines or even power but something dimly apprehended beyond all these and more than that is good and that endur es we all want the enduring thing one man sees it here another there i see it in my house i tell you the greeks and romans did not make religion of the hearthstone they merely recognized the religion that the hearthstone is under that quiet roof i have learned that it is woman business to take stones and make them bread only she can make our surroundings live and nourish us the need bread woman needs are two deeper than all cravings save the mother passion in our endless past is the the trees that sweep my chimney have their roots at the world core the flowers in my dooryard have grown there thousand years what millenniums have done shall decades undo we are not so shallow so plastic that we will go into the mills the shops the offices if we must but we know we are of f the track of life neither our desire nor our power is there i have talked glibly enough about restricting superfluous possessions the sake of developing finer quality in those we have i have said only personality gives that quality to our i have not said the final thing it is this i believe that in the humble business of loving the material things that are given to us to own and love in shaping our homes around them in making them vital and therefore beautiful so that they serve our spirits in their turn we are not only making the most of our resources in this life but are doing more than that somehow i can not tell you how i know that we are getting them the timeless places in making them vital we are making them enduring tells us to lay up ourselves treasures in heaven what did that mean to you when you were young i thought it meant procession of and charities more or less lifeless because the offering was made slightly against the grain i had idea that when i loved somebody very much or pitied somebody very much when i shared my heart or shared my roof eagerly that i was doing the commanded thing still less did i realize when i worked hard to make my home more comfortable or more beautiful that i was sending vibrations from my everyday world right into the eternal deed an actual hammer stroke on my house not made with hands but so sure that our mortal shall put on immortality i now hold it that what we first find in the eternal world will be the things into which we have unstintingly flung our vitality our feeling while we are briefly here we have continuing city but when i am making my house live i and other putting into it i best may something of the serenity of athens and the sacredness of jerusalem and the beauty of siena then it is taking its place beside my greater loves then i am creating home not only in this world but in the next i have put something over into the eternal world that fire can not burn nor floods destroy nor moth and rust corrupt it is safe even from myself forever heaven can be holy to if i have not made this spot holy i shall not ask even from the mercy of the merciful heavenly mansion if i have failed to make this earthly dwelling live eternity begins beside

mary stuart the hostess was distinguished her visitors and never before i went to chenonceaux did i associate naiads and dryads and poems of welcome with catherine but we must allow this monstrous personage an eye good houses she preferred chenonceaux to all her preferred it so much indeed that she made another lady get out of it exchanging it the decidedly inferior residence of chaumont and we have catherine to thank i fear the strangely felicitous fancy that placed upon the arches built from the rear of the house to the farther side of the river by her rejected predecessor diane poitiers

dedans le lit la rivière dessus un pont qui porte cent toises long these verses bump down heavily upon the bridge and despite their scrupulous statistics to its length they scarcely measure the excellence of chenonceaux but rather the gap between french verse and french architecture in the sixteenth century villon could have come nearer the mark but villon was long gone before the ancient

know the country where chenonceaux stands you know the river have you ever gone there from tours or come there the opposite way from bour ges through vierzon and montrichard the region shares secret with certain rare people whom all of us are glad to count among our acquaintance certain men and women immediately on our first meeting them make us desire to meet them again not because they have uttered remarkable thoughts or reminded us of venus or apollo perhaps they have said nothing that you and i could say and we may know people much better looking but they is it that they radiate we feel it we bask in it it flows over us it is sunlight or moonlight but of their own when these shining creatures come into the room happiness enters with them how they it it gets us nowhere to say that there is in the tone of their voice or in the look of their eyes what is the something i glad i know mystery is growing so scarce that i am thankful anything which can not be explained now this rare quality and flatter yourself that you understand it because you happen to know its name is possessed not only by men and women but also by places and more than with people has it anything to with their being remarkable or beautiful the white mountains in new hampshire have trace of it it fills the mountains of north carolina there is almost none along our atlantic seaboard but it hangs over and haunts nearly every foot of our pacific coast whenever one of these happy spots has been long known to man man has invar iably cherished it in word and deed his chronicles celebrate it he sets it

done beneath the spell of place which has charm thus touraine to the frenchman beau pays touraine the page in meyerbeer huguenots sings of it in that opera second act which takes place at chenonceaux i i rain falls in that country yet when i think about it sunshine invariably sparkles through the the kind that glares and burns but the kind that plays gently among leaves and shores and shadows sunshine upon the twinkling feathered silver of the poplars the grapes in sloping vineyards the green islands and tawny bluffs of the loire the quiet waters of the indre and the cher jocund harmony

hundreds of thousands of square comfortable unoffending miles in the united states which you would never wish to see which you would never wish to see once whereas even i write i am homesick touraine though it is my home once again i must draw the parallel between human qualities and the ways of our mother earth we place at the top of our esteem those people who take chivalrously the heavy blows of life who are not brave merely but gallant we draw scant inspiration from the sight of somebody who is all too obviously and dutifully bearing something who goes day after day with set and sombre

the earth countenance smiling and serene decorous it is always only the irregularities of the loire and its channel seem to bear any reference to the conduct of those beautiful historic ladies who dispersed their reputations in the vicinity even man did not always build langeais or loches urbane and gracious amid their parks or on their bluffs rise those dwellings planned when france architectural genius was in its happiest not its loftiest they look like the good society which once assembled in them their mere aspect suggests the wits the brilliant talkers and listeners of day

your eye it will be ideau or something less famous or best of all chenonceaux to which i now return i i i saw it first upon an afternoon when air was stirring even in the poplars when the green of touraine was changing to gold golden fruit pears and apples where summer fruit had been golden leaves flickering down from high branches or raked into golden heaps while the faint sweet smoke of burning twigs hovered in the autumn day it was the moment and scene of the year when just because other things have ceased to grow memories blossom in the mind and on every golden heap of leaves retrospect seemed to be sitting we visitors were three i can recall the first sight of the château yellow façade framed by the distant end of the high formal avenue into which we turned to approach it all sorts of feet had stepped where we were walking almost four centuries of distinguished feet had gone in and out of that beautiful front door but over its appealing associations the still more appealing aspect of the wonderful house triumphed if i knew about le devin du village then the scene of its first performance interested much more because that long and gallery was built right over the water right across the cher upon arches that the glassy surface of the stream reflected symmetrically i was captured then and ever by the beauty and the originality of this residence our best country houses take earth and air into partnership but this abode of grace possessed embraced little river to go in at your front door on one green margin and come out of your back door on the other to dwell in masterpiece that was house and bridge in can still recover my first sensations of delight at this triumph of french art concier ge did let us go out of the back door and my disappointment was cherished through long years until its sequel which i shall presently reach this first afternoon became chapter in the most delightful of from which i quote the following took our way back to the grand monarque and waited in the little inn parlor late train to tours we were not impatient we had an excellent dinner to occupy us and even after we had dined we were still content to sit while and exchange remarks upon the superior civilization of france where else at village inn should we have fared so well at the little inn at chenonceaux the cuisine was not only excellent but the service was graceful we were waited on by mademoiselle and her mamma it was so that mademoiselle alluded to the elder lady she uncorked us bottle of vouvray mousseux on another page of this same you may read how at the hôtel in tours the château of amboise was described to us by an english lady of type that i sadly miss one met her everywhere then she was more fragile sister of that robust spinster who used to climb all the alps in practical but awfu l garments she did often venture to speak to you fear you were respectable or might think she was when she did it was apt to be with explosive shyness running all her words together she did about amboise curious and furious she always pronounced to rhyme with glorious and victori ous and it invariably made think of save the queen in my interest to whether we should again have the excellent fare and gracefu l service which i so well remembered at the little inn and whether now at last my wish to step out of that back door on the river farther side were to be gratified chenonceaux itself had so dropped out of my thoughts that the project gutenberg ebook of atlantic classics https burst upon my sight bursting is of course thing which that delicate and restrained edifice could never really only i was thinking about it our party we were four on this second visit and it was came into the avenue ther at the other end stood the fair gay vision of the château and its beauty and wonder so suddenly waked my admiration that i exclaimed young it looks yes it did look new but it looked young youth is the particular and essential note of this enchanted building none of its neighbors have it not even or blois which are its rivals though never its equals chenonceaux was four hundred years old in january age makes one type of person decrepit and so it is with houses but chenonceaux if ever it come to show its years will belong to the other type it will look venerable did it you think catch its secret from the ring of charlemagne by whose sorceries its mistress diane poitiers was accused of preserving her youth this lady success with françois premier so disconcerted the amiability of the duchesse that she constantly reminded diane she was born on the day diane was i resist the temptation to dwell upon diane and everybody else linked to chenonceaux by history it all accessib le to you in books and i proceed with the visit our party of four made this spring day touraine was now all delicate in green lovely gracious discreet in its budding leaves when the leaves had flickered down spangling the air and grass and with their gold we had met at the little inn the same welcome the same excellent cuisine the same agreeable vouvray mousseux mademoiselle was not there but mamma was her premises and herself showed ill effect from the prosperity brought to her through the i have already quoted in its author plan it was now become established one and he petitioned in letter from mamma had corrected certain error in the first edition page 60 you may read that we took our way back to the grand monarque in later editions it is the hôtel du the confusion to travelers the injury to her custom ensuing from the wrong name madame had represented to the author and now all was well the inn was any larger but more and more each season were pilgrims with expectant appetites led to her door monsieur she said to eagerly when i narrated to her how i had been present at the germination of her renown voilà she showed the precious she treasured it though she could read it because it was in english and i came in her smiles and cordiality which really belonged to the author you will have perceived our party this time took their déjeuner not their dinner at the the good omelette and cheese and fruit and wine mamma prosperity and her state now she was really an elderly woman this had brought us in peaceful and pleased spirits to the château when we had seen the rooms downstairs and the concier ge was conducting the other some ten or the second story our party under my guidance stole away to the back door door implies dishonorable passage through pantry and kitchen we simply did go up the staircase in the wake of the concier ge but independently along the hall instead and thus across the cher through catherine celebrated gallery le devin du village came into my mind and i wondered which figure was the more diverting rousseau composing opera or richard wagner dabbling in philosophy the door was open i emer ged the happy leader of my party upon stone steps crossed little bridge and our triumphant feet trod the grass beneath the trees which shaded the river bank i had my wish and my obedient band followed i fear my complacent back and anabasis manner expressed some sentiment like this observe how it pays to see france with person who knows the ropes we sauntered we expatiated we paused before what i call by metonymy the great bell and chain suspended from strong framework from this point the château with its fine detached cylindrical donjon tower of the fifteenth century looked in the afternoon light particularly well those poor sheep with the concier ge were getting this view we must have lingered by the tocsin quarter of an hour enjoying ourselves before returning to the back door it was shut it was locked rattling made impression upon it nor shaking nor kicking we knocked then fancying this to be an accident next we called or rather i the party personal conductor and competent guide began to call nothing happened i augmented my efforts catherine gallery famous scene of the first performance of rousseau devin du village responded with cavernous echoes between these reigned silence and gentle breeze rustled the young leaves of the chestnu ts we abandoned the door and went few steps down the river to where our gesticulations could be seen from the windows of chenonceaux we made these gesticulations with our four umbrellas whilst i shouted continually not window blinked it might have been sorcerer palace and we his four new victims presently to be roasted boiled or changed into cats we looked down the escape up the river was bridge but what impediment might lie between and even if the way were clear to go round by the project gutenberg ebook of atlantic classics https would lose us our train to tours one of us in her deep voice said that she hoped the breasts would find her body and cover it with leaves again we flourished our four umbrellas during vociferations from at the imperturba ble château then quite suddenly something did happen out of window in the donjon tower of the fiftee nth century was thrust head and from across the river it wagged at us malevolently it was the concier ge the shock of discovering he had locked us out purposely in punishment of our independent excursion threw into extreme rage my anabasis manner had already dropped from but xenophon got his party successfully back and this same task was now searchingly compellingly to more malevolent wagging from the tower was all that resulted from my next demonstrations in these i was now alone my party at the apparition of the concier ge had become abruptly quiet thinking doubtless that loud calls and wavings would diminish my dignity less than theirs whose years and discretion were more than mine therefore my compani ons brandished their umbrellas more but stood upon the banks of the cher decorously in reserved attitude patient yet stately if awaiting the tumbril i meanwhile hurled international threats across the river these wrought change in repose my french halts but when roused it acquires both speed and point yet none of my idioms disturbed the concier ge at his window and now i was visited by inspiration i seize d the chain and rang the tocsin it sounded if attila were coming at once somebody would have come undoubtedly whole arrondissement i should think after few moments of that din the head disap peared in few more the door was unlocked and my companions preceded with restraint yet with celerity across catherine gallery and out of chenonceaux front door and away down the avenue to the railway whilst i delivered some final idioms to the concier ge i am happy to record that these made him livid and in the presence of highly attentive audience had in truth small idea with whom we were dealing some time later we got final news of him he had committed murder been caught tried convicted sentenced and executed you will remember the british lady at the hôtel in tours who in her description of amboise pronounced curious to rhyme with glorious her kind was still pervading the quieter hotels of the continent the hôtel was still quiet while her more muscular sister was still climbing all the alps in valiant weeds this time another of the identical type sat next at the table and from the corner of my eye i perceived her to be making endless and surreptitious dives with her head at my bottle of vouvray mousseux becoming sure that this was neither vitus dance nor kleptomania but desire to learn the name of my wine i made her slight bow turning my bottle so that she could more easily read its label at which she squeaked skittishly i i i the ictorian spinster was gone the automobile was come the much expanded hôtel was quiet more and had abandoned the table small tables when next i saw chenonceaux eager i had been to return to it still more did i desire to enjoy that particular pleasure which one takes in introducing scene one delights in to friend we were this time we had been the first time party of three and the day was july 4 1914 but in the cathedral of bour ges that morning and at montrichard and along the cher that forenoon firecracke rs seemed remote later the hôtel had illuminations and national melodies the benefit of its american having now swelled to the lucrative proportions of invasion but chenonceaux had changed chenonceaux looked just young ever its bright serene aspect showed confusion at changing masters so often to my friends it more than fulfilled my promises it while it was even fairer than my memory the concier ge woman this time told her band of sightseers enough but much less than she knew she had acquired one somehow divined and discerned certain scorn her sightseers she had found one saw the affluent automobile to be the chariot of informed stomachs but seldom of intelligences which had ever heard or would ever care to hear about madame dupin and her many distingui shed guests they knew their michelin where to buy pétrol along the road which roads to avoid and the road they had particularly avoided was the one conducting to civilization some of them were present on this occasion with their goggles their magenta veils and their brass voices to these the concier ge imparted what she deemed them able to digest she did mention the devin du village i did this brought an immediate rappr ochement we lingered with her behind the departing goggles she knew and loved her chenonceaux her scorn fell from her but she told us nothing so interesting the fact that during the last twelvemonth twenty thousand visitors had given each their required franc to see the place the château at this rate will pay its way down the the project gutenberg ebook of atlantic classics https what of the if the ictorian spinster and the table had survived the pace of the new century what had the automobile done to the innocent village inn i hope you will be glad to learn that it much i have now reached the third of those meals which i mentioned at the outset the seem ed little larger were lunching in two rooms instead of one and out behind kitchenward there was hint of bustle and of chauf feurs and perhaps the personal note of welcome was fainter but it was quite absent and still the food was excellent still the service was courteous pleasant young woman waiting and i felt that here was good small tradition still somewhat holding out against the beleaguering pressure of the wholesale so i spoke to the pleasant young woman and inquired if the old patronne were still living si monsieur i was to my astonishment answered deux pas the personal note of welcome warmed up on learning that i was an old visitor here the patronne would value call from one who remembered her good cooking she was now very old she had sold the business and the she lived very quietly would i not go to see her and her house was pointed out to along the street of the little white village i went slowly in the midsummer warmth the trailing and basking on the walls the trees the light and laziness of earth and sky conveyed the same hush of repose that had exhaled from the golden autumn and the delica spring i remembered so well in this july sunshine also the pleasant land lay dreamy and unvexed at door standing slightly open i knocked though pause followed i felt i had been heard then i was bidden to enter by very old voice two rooms were accessible from the tiny hall but i entered the right one and there by the window sat the patronne i had remembered her moving alertly round her table quiet and vigorous above average height all of this was gone and her dark feeble eyes looked at i felt in them certain apprehension and found myself unpremeditatedly saying i trust you will not think ill of an intruder when you learn why it is that he has ventured to knock at your door they assured you would like my visit here is my little story one sunday afternoon in september 1882 three travelers came to the i was one of them and never forgetting your excellent meal and service i returned at my first opportunity in april meanwhile that good meal of yours and you its hostess had been mentioned in book by another of those three guests and you told of the prosperity this had brought you since that visit years ago i have become writer of books too of you will not have heard but you canno t have forgotten henry james whose praise brought so many guests to the her eyes during my speech had awakened and now she stood up servant is absent she said you would not have had to come in so but my son lives close by in that lar ge place he will like very much to see you i will call him she would have gone him on her trembling feet but this i begged she would not i had but five minutes friends were waiting i am ninety years old she said monsieur il est bien triste vieillir one has nothing any more she became suddenly moved and tears fell from her i need not recall the little talk we had then strangers though we were we did not speak strangers the memories that rose in each of us so separate so different flowed together in some way united beneath our spoken words and made them sacred but i may record that she got out her old books to show her of the little old modest volumes where in many handwritings through many years the names of her guests had been inscribed they had come from almost everywhere in the world longer strong enough she had parted with the business and the but from these tokens of her past she could not part she clung to the inanimate survivals of her good days and her renown and on blank page of the last volume which she placed before putting pen in my hand i wrote briefly her of my three pilgrimages to her petit pays of the international distinction of her son she was touchingly and justly proud famous peonies have spread his name wide their cultivator and producer this too was the in its way responsible perhaps i may not see it again or its grand neighbor the château that secular shrine of vivacious and select past but i shall need micheli n or baedeker or joanne to guide my memories thither they are with every moment and breath of them my perpetual delight safe possession unweakened and undimmed and to conjure them before it needs more than the haunting syllables of chenonceaux and the quaint cherished volumes of the patronne in chenonceaux the project gutenberg ebook

against his ear shell doth fondly hold to hear the murmur that is his own blood and half believes the he told so i within this shell mistake my sea of musing the tide of history the other side by margaret sherwood l ike every other attentive reader of our periodical literature i am increasingly aware of our persistent exposure of sin and in high places and in low like many another attentive reader i am growing bit rebellious against this constant demand and supply in the matter of information regarding recent evil have we not grown in the search this special kind of news we take vice with our breakfast porridge perjury with our coffee our essayists vie with one another in seeing who can write up the most startling story of crimes and it is bankrupt family nowadays that can not produce one member to expose civic or political corruption undoubtedly much genuine ethical impulse lies back of all this undoubtedly too much of the picturesque and spectacular treatment springs from desire to startle and ministers in many reader who would scorn paper fiction to love of the sensational surely it must seem to the people of other countries that we take pride in the immensity of our sins we take pride in niagara in the length of the mississippi in the extent of our western plains many may be and must be the good effects of throwing the searchlight upon dark places but the constant glare of the searchlight bids fair to rob us of our normal vision of life my poor mind has become storehouse of misdeeds not my own i am sick with iniquity i walk abroad under the shadow of infamy and i sup with horrors i shrink from meeting my friends that they are not the best people in the world but i dread lest they pour into my ears some newly acquired knowledge of others the sun of noonday is clouded by graft bribery treachery and corruption and i fear to close my eyes in the dark because of the pictured crimes that crowd before them suppose poor christian had had to drag after him not only his own bag of transgressions but those of worldly wiseman ways and all the denizens of vanity fair what chance would he ever have had of getting out of the slough of despond it is not that i wish to shirk i am not afraid of facing anything that i ought to know and i have not the slightest doubt that we are all in great measure responsible our neighbors sins but i am not sure the project gutenberg ebook of atlantic classics https are taking the wisest way to mend them it seems to incontestable that with the large issues of individual and of national in mind we are the exposure and slighting the incentives to right action emphasizing the negative at the expense of the positive and that with our weakening convictions regarding the things that are right it is dangerous to go on loudly proclaiming the things that are wrong we are much in the position of village improvement society which has pulled down bridge because it is rotting and is impotent to build another and better we have invested our national all in wrecking machinery and have nothing left constructive tools it is said that in our explosive setting forth of civic and national g we are all too prone to stop with the explosion if mere knowledge of these things would set them right mere knowledge never yet set anything right only the ceaselessly active creative will can fashion world of law out of chaos of the criticism often made that exposure of wrong should be followed more closely than is done here by constructive action if anything is to be really effected it is not my task to speak the aspect of the matter which interests especially concerns the youth of the land it is the educational aspect not through loud wailing over evil can nation be built but through resolute dwelling with high ideals in certain ugly tendencies of recent years among the young instance the unabashed sensuality of much of the modern dancing may we not detect perhaps cynical assumption that life is at basis corrupt natural result of continued harping on evil things and of failure to keep before them images of moral beauty our magazine writers would be far better employed if instead of making our ears constantly resound with reports of civic iniquities they were part of the time at least studying plato republic and filling mind and soul with the hope of the perfect state wrong things we dare hope are of small and fleeting consequence compared with the right it is not the sin of judas iscariot but the righteousness of his master that has brought the human race gleam of hope and possible redem ption when i was told not long ago of student in one of our great universities who had elected 16 i could not help reflecting that he might far better have taken idealistic philosophy whether or not our study of evil should be lessened our study of the good needs to be vastly strengthened we are losing the vision old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions said the prophet in promising wonders in the heavens and in the earth after his account of fasting weeping mourning and beating the breast there is time beating the breast and tearing the hair and of this we have had our day but perpetual sitting upon the and howling will not raise the walls of state sitting there may in time even become luxury can it be that we are doing so much of it partly because it is easier and because the task of building up and shaping is too hard us take away from youth the power of seeing visions of dreaming dreams and you take away the future it would behoove us to remember perhap s that the eras of great deeds have not been eras of analysis but eras when the creative imagination was at work yet our modern mental habit is overwhelmingly habit of analysis which science in teaching us to pick the world to bits is partly though not wholly responsible it has brought us an immense amount of interesting information it has brought also danger whose gravity we can hardly estimate in the constant lessening of the synthetic power the power to image to fashion high ideals and to create along the line of the imagining is weakening instead of growing more strong in the glorious days of queen elizabeth in the unparalleled days of periclean athens great ideals formed themselves before men eyes and great achievements follow ed emotion hope vision shaped human nature to great issues i wonder what influence those perfect marble representations of perfect form had upon the very bodies of the youths and the maidens of athens what creative force they exercised imaginative grasp of the perfect reaching forward toward perfec tness in the human being i wonder what influence the character of sir philip sidney alone with thoughts seated in heart of courtesy has had upon succeeding generations of english youth man to be greatly good said shelley imagine intensely and comprehensively here my quarrel with our present intellectual trend and our present system of education becomes more acute we are not only losing the habit of mind that fosters idealism but we are more and more breaking with the past the door of that storehou of noble thought and noble example is being slowly but firmly closed and there is little in modern teaching that can meet the inroads made by the devastating knowledge of evil of which we have been speaking little that can build up where this tears down study of greek life with its incomparable power of shaping existence toward the beautiful is all but cast aside most unfortunately now when with the rush of ignorant peoples to our shores it might have potency never attained before the ignorance of contemporary youth regarding that other and finer loveliness of books is amazing more and more we are stripped of the humanities the incredulity of science in contemplating philosophy art literature part of the educational curriculum is full of menace there has never been i think in the history of the civilized world time when people were the project gutenberg ebook of atlantic classics https to cast off the past in our eager marathon race of material and physical progress we want to go lightly equipped possible the æroplane carries small luggage our light modern mind is ever ready to throw overboard even its precious heritage in its eagerness swift flight earlier days have reverenced the old we reverence the new and are all too insistently contemporaneous we need we never needed before broader and deeper study of history of philosophy of literature most of our young knowledge of the mental and spiritual past of the race is of far greater importance than knowledge of the physical past at the amœba stage or any other science much it can us can never meet our deepest need the world of imaginative beauty and the world of ethical endeavor are apart from its domain it has spring to touch the will yet that which has the magnificent inheritance of our literature is more and more neglected the latest machinery that applied science has devised or the most recent treatise on insect bird or worm it is well to study insect bird and worm they are endlessly interesting but i maintain that neither the full sum of knowledge concerning them nor even the ultimate fact about the ultimate star can be substitute knowledge of the idealism of thomas carlyle of the categorical imperative of kant that study of the humanities which means preserving the upbuilding of youth that which was best and finest in the past we go on toward the future if the swift retort should come from those who think the present the only of attainment and the physical world the only source of wisdom that the past is full of villainies of lapses from high standards one can but say that ethical purposes our study should be frankly selective study emphasizing the fine and high subordinating the evil there is hypocrisy in such selection there is deliberate choice of the higher upon which to dwell format ive power quickening feeling and imagination i have heard it said that woman by resolute dwelling on things noble and pure may shape the inner nature of her unborn child and i have faith to believe it even so should the nation yet to be be shaped by resolute dwelling on the good it was not all cowardice many present writer thinks that led the mothers of earlier days to say little to their sons and daughters regarding evil things and much regarding right things doubtless greater frankness would have been better yet i doubt if our protracted dwelling on the evil will produce better results should any one object that this emphasis on the good means suppression of the truth we can but reply that the rational soul the truth is not necessarily the mechanically sum of all the facts that we have forgotten the distinction between which has indeed come to pass but which may be truth which endures is one of the many signs of what william sharp calls the degradation of our time much of our modern thinking and teaching much of our realistic fiction rests upon failure to make the distinction much that is indisputable in individual instances of may be thank god false in the long run is not true scientifically true we hear often in regard to some fine hope or aspiration of the race but in the real import of the term there is such thing scientific truth it is pity that word of such profound and distinctive meaning should come to be more and more exclusively identified with the observation of physical phenomena and the formulation of physical laws whereas the very of the word true from treowe signifying faithful gives justification the idealist belief that vital truth is partly matter of the will not of mere perception and of intellectual deductions drawn therefrom we have need of deeper truth than that of mere fact and the truth that shall set us free is truth of choice of selection it embraces that part of human thought and human experience which is worth keeping faithfulness to the best and finest in the past and in the present rather than horrified gaping at the present worst is the attitude that means continued and bettered life we become what we will what are we offering in the way of concrete examples or of finely expressed thought about virtue to the young to the ignorant nations who are pouring in upon us that will help them form their vision of the perfect with our narrowing knowledge of the greater past our choice of heroes becomes more and more local and national yet our hierarchy of sacred dead is too small to afford that variety of heroic action and heroic choice that should always be kept before the minds of youth we teach them that geor ge washington never told lie we teach them there could be nothing lincoln but those two figures are lonely upon olympus and the great tragic story of the way in which lincoln faced the greatest crisis in our history will not alone suffice to help the everyday citizen shape his thought and action toward constructive idealism the lesser heroes of our young republic have acquitted themselves nobly in this struggle and in that but the struggles have been too closely akin in nature to give the embryo hero that breadth and depth of nurture that he requires we need an enlar ged vision of history and the sight of great men of all ages faithful to small tasks to great we need the companionship of heroes of other times and of other nations and not of military heroes alone saint francis with his unceasing tenderness to man the project gutenberg ebook of atlantic classics https father damien at work among the lepers might far better occupy the pages of our magazines than the pictured deeds of criminals and the achievements of contemporary multimillionaires if we need wider range of concrete examples of the good we need still more wider range of nobly expressed ideals our thought grows narrow we smother lack of breathing space benjamin franklin philosophy was far from grasping the best of life yet we remember him better than we our emerson whose plea spiritual values the only real ones is lost in the louder and louder groaning of the wheels of our machinery the idealism that is taught the young in sunday schools is too often inextricably bound up with unnecessary theology and many and many pupil in discarding the latter discards the other also the ideal of success upheld in much journalistic admonition is often rather mean and low the young of this country need printed incentives to urge them into commercialism and the victories of trade the best influences that are being brought to bear upon them are those which concern social responsibilities and the needs of the poor yet all this thought and endeavor should supplement and not supersede it is doing deep concern with the things of the spirit and admonition regarding hygiene one self or others is substitute sense sublime of something far more deeply interfused whose dwelling is the light of setting suns and the round ocean and the living air and the blue sky and in the mind of man motion and spirit that impels all thinking things all objects of all thought and rolls through all things the great things of the past in all nations history can teach us the possible both literature and philosophy can teach us we must forego noble expression of idealistic faith lest we impoverish our own souls and beggar those who come after us the pure intellectual passion of bacon advancement of learning the noble stoicism of marcus aurelius the spiritual vision of plato of spenser the heroic strain of wordsworth sonnets and his warrior shelley ardent and generous sympathy browning dynamic spiritual force should make up part of our life and thought checking our insistent impulse toward mechanical things and correcting the evil within and without more than anything else we need revival of interest in great poetry therein of all sciences said sir philip sidney our poet the monarch he doth not only show the way but giveth so sweet prospect into the way will entice any man to enter it he cometh to you with words set in delightful proportion either accompanied with or prepared the skill of music and with tale forsooth he cometh unto you with tale which holdeth children from play and old men from the and pretending more doth intend the winning of the mind from wickedness to virtue the poet picture of the good the great image causes noble passion wakes us out of our calm and stirs us almost beyond our possibilities the imagination is the power in human nature through it alone can the human soul come to its own only that which is fine and high can feed it aright while baseness can make of it destructive tool of terrible power i think back to childhood i can remember the devastating effect that one tale of cruelty had upon my mind haunting by day in vivid pictures turning my dreams to horror and making while the obsession lasted believe that the world of grown folk must be all alike cruel so too the compelling vision of the good came through concrete instances and the people both the living and the dead in whom i passionately believed shaped all my faith the imagination of youth is power like it machine that can equal it in dynamic force nothing so full of power so full of danger we become that which we look upon contemplate remember it is this that i dread the ultimate effect of the long imaginative picturing of our neighbor sins now presented in our periodicals images of evil can hardly help dimming and tarnishing the bright ideals of youth is there all our modern wisdom can we find limiting our exposure of crime to the people who can be of service in helping check it and keeping it from those who can not help but can only be silently hurt mome nt an hour of some fresh vision and child destiny is perhaps decided good or one afternoon reading of spenser made the boy keats poet who knowing the potency of brief experience in the flush of youth can doubt the lasting wrong wrought again and again by the sudden shock of contact with things evil the project gutenberg ebook of atlantic classics https images of wrong must of necessity come to the young let them not be multiplied in our feverish and morbid fashion of above all let them be crowded out by constant suggestion of noble images and noble thought which will work both consciously and subconsciously shaping the dream when the dreamer is least aware to hold up before the ardent and impressionable young that which they may become in strength in purity would surely be better than placing before them this perpetual picture show of our civic and national transgressions i can but believe i read article after article of exposure that this continued presentation to youth of the unholy side of life with our increasing tendency to make education mere matter of the intellect and of the eye is bound to lessen the moral energy of the race would it not be better if we were more diligent in searching history philosophy literature things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report and in bidding the young think on these things on authors by margaret preston montague i w rite myself therefore i feel free to say what i please about authors but if you sir or madam who read but not write were to give voice to the reflections that are even now beginning to distill from my pencil i should doubtless resent them and here indeed i am faced by the sudden reflection that much of what i say myself i might resent in the mouths of others this leads to whole new train of thought which however i refuse to take and board instead the one i set out authors unlimited there are many things to be remarked about authors but in so short paper it is possible to touch upon only very few one of the first facts that strikes the investigator in this field is that member s of my profession not always appear to endear themselves to those with whom they have dealings you think of authors i once asked an editor i hate he answered without moment hesitation another editor assured with weary sigh that authors were cattle this affords writer little leap of amusement so editors suffer from authors even authors from editors well yes we are kittle cattle but some of this is due doubt to what people expect of us i was presented once to lady who immediately fixed with an eager eye i am making study of the habits of authors she announced here dreadful sinking of the heart assailed tell at what hour you retire at ten i answered wretchedly at that i had expected her eyebrows went up author of when all was dark she informed up all night she says she can not sleep until she has savored the dawn however she was kind enough to give another chance you eat she asked hearty meals day i answered breakfast she pleaded geor ge dreamer never takes more than three drops of brandy on lump of sugar in the morning just the sight of cof fee cup will upset his work week and then she left sure i have doubt that real author could confess to such distressingly normal habits mine doubtless she is an eager reader of all those little paragraphs informing us how authors write how this one has to have his black mammy rub his head an hour before he can even think of work and that one confesses that to write love scene she must have the odor of decayed bananas in the room well the the project gutenberg ebook of atlantic classics https be sadder place without these little paragraphs would that i had something of like nature to offer but alas i have black mammy and the smell of fruit leaves my hero cold also to give forth such gems of information one must be able to observe certain rule it is laugh or you might wake up this rule is always sacredly in force at literary gatherings the fact of being an author and of being at an authors meeting induces it appears an intense seriousness in my younger days i did not realize this and once at gathering of this nature i asked carefree question you think i inquired of the author next it is possible an unmusical person to write verse i confess now that i put the question somewhat in the spirit of the irishman who asking after his friend health added that i care damn but it makes conversation heaven defend from ever again making so much conversation gleam shot up in my author eye us go over and ask professor he cried wrote what poets can not he just the man to tell us and before i could escape he dragged through the press of authors and flung before the professor with the tag but aspires to write verse this possible i know now how the beetle feels benea th the microscope seeing the little group we made two young authors up and more and more and more they surrounded to listen to inspect to comment they asked one another eager questions about they compared notes they appealed to the author of what poets can not and always their dreadful eyes were fixed upon never never again will i dare the dreadful seriousness of an authors meeting with an idle question i have also learned another lesson it is how to converse with authors i shudder now to think of my early and crude attempts in this matter the remembrance of one particular occasion stands out with dreadful vividness i had been introduced to distinguished writer she raised her eyes to mine wan instant pale flicker of recognition passed over her face and readers nay let call you friends while i make this terrible confession i broke that silence i was young i did not understand i now i have never been able since to read ancient know too well the awfulness of having shot an albatross lady i said to my inexpe rienced self not care to converse she expects you to so accordingly i broke into light and cheerful talk something in conversation corresponding i fear to what in dry goods the clerk recommends nice line of spring styles i realize that only series of illustrations can make the situation clear imagine then if you please tinkling cymbal serenading smouldering volcano puppy trying to woo the sphinx to game of tag sunlit waves breaking upon and bound coast and you may get faint idea of the situation i began almost immediately to experience that sensation of which speaks with so much feeling i beheld one after another of my little remarks dash itself to nothingness against that stern and coast only the time and the place kept from burstin g into tears fortunately it did not last too long in another minute one or the other of us would have shattered into the maniac wild laughter and i have every reason to fear that i should have been that one other s however realizing the awful thing i was doing rushed up and separated us sympathetic hands were stretched to her low words were murmured and she was drawn into secluded corner where her silence might be preserved from any further onslaughts of like sacrilegious nature but one stretched hand to sympathetic words were murmured in my ear i now know that in conversations with authors there should be long pauses this is because every remark after being received by the ear must be submitted to strict brain analysis and then given before it is proper to venture reply i have found also that in answering too quickly i myself lose caste i now make it point never to respond to question addressed to by an author until i have counted twenty if the author is very distinguished i make it fifty good measure much more remains to be said about authors i realize that i have it were merely scraped the surface of the subject space however allows only room to add one last anecdote but this one may indeed prove more illuminating than all that has gone before once then in certain city where i was visiting i was invited to attend meeting of its authors club at this meeting i instructed myself before going will probably encounter the most serious species of author native to this climate accordingly i set forth with light and expectant heart i entered the hall i was aware of another person entering from an opposite door serious awkward person with just that peculiar vague and almost expression that i have come to associate with writers in general my child the

hours of the spot where i pen these reflections and i was grown man and had voted before i saw the sea or any eastern city in attempting to illustrate the provincial point of view out of my own experiences i am moved by wish to celebrate either the hoosier common has not lacked nobler myself but by the hope that i may cheer many who flung by fate upon the world byways shuffle and shrink

knew my childhood bugle grieving melody used to float often through the summer twilight highway lay hidden in the little vale below and beyond it the unknown musician was quite concealed and was never visible to the world i knew those trumpetings have lingered always in my memory and color my recollection of all that was near and dear in those days men who had left camp and field the soberer routine of civil life were not yet fully domesticated my bugler was merely solacing himself lost joys by recurring to the vocabulary of the trumpet i am confident that he enjoyed himself and i am equally sure that his trumpetin gs peopled the dusk with great captains and mighty armies and touched with certain militancy all my youthful dreaming american boy born during or immediately after the civil war can have escaped in those years the vivid impressions derived from the sight and speech of men who had fought its battles or women who had known its terror and grief chief among my playthings on that peaceful hillside was the sword my father had borne at shiloh and on to the sea and i remember too his uniform coat and sash and epaulets and the tattered guidon of his battery that falling to my lot toys yet imparted to my childish consciousness sense of what war had been the young imagination was kindled in those days by many and great names lincoln grant and sherman were among the first lispings of northern children of my generation and in the little town where i was born lived men who had spoken with them face to face i did not know until i sought them later myself the

field of observation opening through my parents removal to the state capital i had myself beheld grant and sherman and every day i passed in the street men who had been partners with them in the great heroic sad splendid struggle these things i set down background the observations that follow text than point of departure yet i believe that bugler sounding charge and retreat and taps in the dusk and those trappings of war beneath whose weight i strutted upon that hillside did much toward establishing in certain habit of mind from that hillside i have since ineluctably viewed my country and my

the maple the beech the nuts he returned kane arctic voyage to friend of whom he had borrowed it with the remark that most of the phenomena noted might be observed in concord the complacency of the provincial mind is due less i believe to stupidity and ignorance than to the fact that every american county is in sense complete political and social unit in which the sovereign rights of free people are expressed by the courthouse and town hall spiritual freedom by the village spire and hope and aspiration in the every reader of american fiction particularly in the realm of the short story must have observed the great variety of quaint and racy characters disclosed these are the dramatis personæ of that great american novel which some one has said is being written in installments writers of fiction hear constantly of characters who would be well worth their study in reading two recent novels that penetrate to the heart of provincial life white certain rich man and watts nathan burke i felt that the characters depicted might with unimportant exceptions have been found almost anywhere in those american states that shared the common history of kansas and ohio winston churchill in his admirable novels of new england has shown how closely the purely local is allied to the universal w oodchuck sessions have been held by many american legislatures when david harum appeared characters similar to the hero of that novel were reported in every part of the country i rarely visit town that has not its cracker philosopher or poet who would shine but the callous heart of the magazine editor or an artist of supreme though unrecognized talent or forensic orator of wonderful powers or mechanical genius whose inventions are bound to revolutionize the industrial world in maine in the back room of shop whose windows looked down upon tidal river i have listened to tariff discussions in the dialect of hosea biglow and few weeks later have heard farmers along the wabash debati ng the same questions from point of view that revealed masted ships or pine woods with new sense of the fine tolerance and sanity and reasonableness of our american people james whitcomb riley one of the shrewdest students of provincial character introduced one day to friend of his in village near indianapolis who bore striking resemblance to abraham lincoln and who had something of lincoln gift of humorous narration this man kept country store and his attitude toward his customers and in general was delicious in its drollery men said to be lincoln have not been rare in the mississippi valley and politicians have been known to encourage belief in the resemblance colonel higginson has said that in the cambridge of his youth any member of the harvard faculty could answer any question within the range of human knowledge whereas in these days of specialization some man can answer the question but it may take week investigation to find him in poor virgin sir an thing sir but mine own dare say it was possible in that post bellum to find men competent to deal with almost any problem these were mainly men of humble beginnings and all essentially the product of our america n provinces i should like to set down briefly the ineffaceable impression some of these characters left upon i am precluded by variety of considerations from extending this recital the rich field of education i ignore altogether and i may mentio n only those who have gone it is beside my purpose to prove that mine own people are other than typical of those of most american communities i check my exuberance sad indeed the of fending if i should protest too much i i in the days when the bugle still mourned across the vale lew wallace was citizen of my native town of crawfordsville there he had amused himself in the years immediately before the civil conflict in drilling company of zouaves known the montgomery guards of which my father was member the project gutenberg ebook of atlantic classics https was the nucleus of the eleventh indiana regiment which wallace commanded in the early months of the war it is not however of wallace military services that i wish to speak now nor of his writings but of the man himself i knew him later at the capital at time when in the neighborhood of the federal building at indianapolis any boy might satisfy his longing heroes with sight of many of our hoosier olympians he was of medium height erect dark to swarthiness with finely chiseled features and keen black eyes with manners the most courtly and voice unusually musical and haunting his appearance his tastes his manner were strikingly oriental he had strong theatric instinct and his life was filled with melodrama even his curiosity led him into the study of many subjects most of them remote from the affairs of his day he was both dreamer and man of action he could be than the idlest flowers yet he was always busy about something he was an aristocrat and democrat he was wise and temperate whimsical and injudicious in breath youth he had seen visions and an old man he dreamed dreams the mysticism in him was and he was always little aloof man apart his capacity detachment was like that of sir richard burton who at great company given in his honor was found alone poring over puzzling arabic manuscript in an obscure corner of the house wallace like burton would have reached mecca if chance had led him to that adventure wallace dabbled in politics without ever being politician and i might add that he practiced law without ever being by any high standard lawyer he once spoke of the law most detestable of human occupations first and last he tried his hand at all the arts he painted little he moulded little in clay he knew something of music and played the violin he made three essays in romance boy and man he went soldiering he was civil governor and later minister to turkey in view of his sympathetic interest in eastern life and character nothing could have been more appropriate than his appointment to constantinople the sultan abdul hamid harassed and anxious used to send him at odd hours of the night to come and talk to him and offered him on his retirement number of positions in the turkish government with all this rich experience of the larger world he remained the simplest of natures he was interested in new in new book and carried both to his houseboat on the kankakee where at odd moments he retouched manuscript the press and discussed politics with the natives here was man who could talk of the song of roland zestfully though it had just been reported from the telegraph of fice i frankly confess that i never met him without thrill even in his last years and when the ardor of my youthful hero worship may be said to have passed he was an exotic our hoos ier arab our of the bazaars when i saw him in his last illness it was though i looked upon gray sheik about to fare forth unawed toward unmapped oases lesson of the civil war was more striking than that taught by the swift transitions of our citizen soldiery from civil to military life and back again this impressed boy and i used to wonder i passed my heroes on their peaceful errands in the street why they had put down the sword when there must still be work somewhere fighting men to the judge of the federal court at this time was walter gresham brevetted brigadier who was destined later to adorn the cabinets of presidents of two political parties he was cordial and magnetic his were the handsomest and friendliest of brown eyes and noble gravity spoke in them among the lawyers who practiced before him were benjamin harrison and thomas hendricks who became respectively president and those hoosiers who admired gresham ardently were often less devotedly attached to harrison who lacked gresham warmth and charm general harrison was akin to the covenanters who bore both bible and sword into battle his eminence in the law was due to his deep learning in its history and philosophy short of stature and without grace of person voice pitched rather high was remarkably interesting and persuasive speaker if i may so put it his political speeches were addressed to trial judge rather than to jury his appeal being to reason and not to passion or prejudice he could in rapid flights of campaigning speak to many audiences in day without repeating himself he was measured and urbane his discourses abounded in apt illustration he was never dull he never stooped to pietistic trap or chanted the jaunty chauvinism that has so often caused the hoosier stars to blink among the democratic leaders of that period hendricks was one of the ablest and man of many attractive qualities his dignity was always impressive and his appearance suggested the statesman of an earlier time it is one of immortality harsh ironies that man who was gentleman and who stood moreover pretty squarely the policie s that it pleased him to defend should be published to the world in

affectionate regard by wide constituency he was an independent and vigorous character who never lost certain raciness and tang on my first timid venture into the fabled east i rode with him in from washington to new york on slow train at some point he saw peddler of fried oysters on station platform alighted to make purchase and ate his luncheon quite democratically from the paper parcel in his car seat he convoyed across the ferry asked where i expected to stop and explained that he did not like the european plan he liked he said to have swing at bill of fare i used often to look upon the towering form of daniel voorhees whom sulgrove an indiana journalist with gift translating macaulay into hoosierese had named tall sycamore of the wabash in crowded hotel lobby i can still see him cloaked and the centre of the throng and my strict upbringing in the antagonistic political faith did not diminish my admiration his eloquence such were some of the characters who came and went in the streets of our provincial capital in those days i i i in discussions under captions similar to mine it is often maintained that railways telegraphs telephones and newspapers are knitting us togethe r so that soon we shall all be keyed to metropolitan pitch the proof adduced in support of this is of the most trivial but it strikes wholly undesirable that we should all be ironed out and conventionalized in the matter of dress example the women of our town used to take their fashions from godey and peterson via cincinnati but now that we are only eighteen hours from new york with path from the wabash to paris my counselors among the elders declare that the tone of our i may use so perilous changed little from our good old black alpaca days the hobble skirt receives prompt consideration in the street of any town and is viewed with frank curiosity but it is only one day wonder lively runawa y or the barbaric yawp of new street fakir may dethrone it at any time new york and boston tailors solicit custom among us biennially but nothing is so stubborn our provincial distrust of fine raiment i looked with awe in my boyhood upon pair of mammoth trousers that were flung high from flagstaf f in the centre of indianapolis in derision of democratic candidate governor james williams who was addicted to the wearing of jeans the democrats sagaciously accepted the challenge made blue jeans the and defeated benjamin harrison the candidate of the republicans harmless demagoguery this or bad judgment on the part of the republicans and yet i dare say that if the sartorial issue should again become acute in our politics the banner of bifurcated jeans would triumph now then hoosier statesman who occupies high office once explained to his refusal of sugar his coffee by remarking that he did like to waste sugar that way he wanted to keep it his lettuce i not urge sugared lettuce symbolizing our higher provincialism but mayonnaise may be poison to men who are nevertheless competent to construe and administer law it is much more significant that we are all thinking about the same things at the same time than that farnam street omaha and fifth avenue new york should vibrate to the same shade of necktie the distribution of periodicals is so managed that california and maine cut the leaves of their magazines on the same day rural free delivery has hitched the farmer wagon to the telegraph office and you ca buy his wife butter now until he has scanned the produce market in his newspaper this immediacy of contact does not alter the provincial point of view new york and texas oregon and florida will continue to see things at different angles and it is the good of all of us that this is so we have national political social or intellectual centre there is in new york in london during which all persons distinguished in any of these particulars meet on common ground washington is our nearest approach to such but it offers only short vistas we of the country visit boston the symphony or new york the opera or washington to view the government machine at work but nowhere interesting people representative of all our ninety millions ever assemble under one roof all our capitals are lowell put it and we shall hardly have centre while our country is so nearly continent nothing in our political system could be wiser than our dispersion into provinces sweep from the map the lines that divide the states and we should huddle like sheep suddenly deprived of the protection of known walls and flung upon the open prairie state lines and local pride are in themselves pledge of stability the elasticity of our system makes possible variety of governmental experiments by which the whole country profits we should all rejoice that the parochial mind is so open so eager so earnest the project gutenberg ebook of atlantic classics https even the most buckramed conservative on the eastern coastline scornful of the political follies of our provinces must view with some interest the dallyings of oregon with the referendum and of des moines with the commission system if milwaukee wishes to try socialism the rest of us need not complain democracy will cease to be democracy when all its problems are solved and everybody votes the same ticket states that produce the most cranks are prodigal of the corn that pays the dividends on the railroads the cranks despise indiana amiable feeling toward new york is not altered by her sister rejection or acceptance of the direct primary benevolent device of noblest intention

saddened by the tameness of its sentiments i remember it must have been in 1884 the shrinking horror with which i saw daily in the indiana republican organ quotation from wade hampton to the effect

and enslaved it would be trifle hard them to cherish their respectability and enjoy their freedom if their misery were dinned into their ears they would naturally cease being cheerful if they were convinced that tears are their portion they would longer have the temerity to laugh indeed their mirth is frankly repellent to the dolorous writers of burst of hollow laughter from hopeless heart is

through the chill dawn and yet and yet mockery of nobler aspirations were going to work and they went laughing the dismalness of serious writers especially if humanity be their theme is steeping us in

learn that him meant the debtors prison in vain he tried to get rid of his conductor bob fagin by name protesting that he was well enough to walk alone bob knew he was not and stuck to his side together they pushed along until little charles was fainting with weakness and fatigu then in desperation he pretended that he lived in decent hous near southwark bridge and darted up the steps with

in heaven over that melancholy and mean reform i i achieve what man may to bear what man must the struggle life began this has been the purpose and the pride of humanity we americans were trained from childhood to believe that while in the final issue each of us must answer himself the to all scope effort and chance of victory this was not mere fourth of july oratory nor the fervent utterances of preside ntial campaigns it was serious and sober faith based upon some knowledge of the constitution some inheritance of experience some element of democracy which flavored our early lives the mere sense of space carried with it profound and eager hopefulness those of us whose fathers or whose grandfathers had crossed the sea to escape from more cramping conditions felt this atmosphere of independence keenly and consciously those of us whose fathers or whose grandfathers brought up their families in an alien land with decent industry and thrift were aware even in childhood that the republic had fostered our growth therefore am i pardonably bewildered when i hear american workmen called and of starvation and american employers called oppressors and on their thrones this fantastic nomenclature seems immeasurably removed from the temperate language in which were formulated the temperate convictions of my youth the assumption that the american laborer stands where the french laborer stood before the revolution where the english laborer stood before the passing of the first reform bill and the repeal of the corn laws shows lack of historical perspective the assumption that all strikes represent an agonized protest against tyranny an agonized appeal from injustice is perversion of truth the assumption that in the united states is the blot upon civilization that it was in england seventy years ago denies the duty of comparison if the people who write verses about crucified would make table of the wages paid to skilled and unskilled workmen from the chicago carpenter to the philadelphia the project gutenberg ebook of atlantic classics https might sing in more cheerful strain if the people who echo the bitterest lines of browning of the children would ascertain and bear in mind the proportion of little boys and girls who are going to school in the united states how many years they average and how much the country pays their education they might spare us some violent invectives even robert hunter permits himself the use of the word when speaking of and this in the face of legislation which every year extends its area and grows more stringently protective there is great deal of loose writing on this important theme and it stands in the way of amendment it is assumed that parents are seldom or never to blame sending their children to work the snatches them from their mothers arms it is assumed that the child who work s there were employment at school or at play happy healthy and one even alludes to the cruel poverty of the south which generations before the cotton mills were built stunted the growth and sapped the strength of southern children they lived we are told lesome rural life and the greed of the capitalist is alone responsible the blighting of their pastoral paradise there is need to write like this the question at issue is grave and simple one it makes its appeal to the conscience and the sense of the nation and every year sees some measure of reform if baby girl in an american city child of three or five is forced to toil all day winding artificial daisy stems at penny hundred let the name of her employer and the place of her employment be made public the society the prevention of cruelty to children can deal peremptorily with such case it is not even the privilege of parents to work little child so relentlessly if the pathetic story is not supported by facts or is not in accord with facts it is neither wise nor well to publish it why should sober periodical like the labor bulletin devoted to good cause print

plainly impoverished her hansel and gretel are not more distinctly within the boundaries of fairyland than are these entrapped children the witch is not more distinctly hobgoblin than is the capitalist of such fervid song the sickly and unreasoning tone whic h pervades the literature of poverty is demoralizing there is nothing helpful in the assumption that effort is vain resistance

course but we depreca the brevity of this notice also the cook and chambermaid are new and remarkably inexpert brother however declines to feel any concern his confidence in our power to cope with emer gencies is flattering if exasperating there is nothing in the markets at this time of year guests have malignant facility in choosing such times we scour the country forty miles in search of green vegetables we confide in the fishmonger who grieves sympathetically over the because all crabs are now and he be deceiving us if he said otherwise still we are determined to have luncheon prepared in the house last time the august judge dined with us we summoned caterer from hundred miles away and though the caterer food was good it was late we love promptness and we are going to have it ladies knew all about efficiency long before frederick taylor only they could teach it to servants and he would find he could either but every mistress of house knows how to make short cuts and is expert at production in emer gencies the casual brother says there will be one or two dozen people at luncheon he will telephone us fifteen minutes before they arrive yes really that the best he can the project gutenberg ebook of atlantic classics https we prepare one or two dozen people and they must sit down to luncheon because men hate buffet meal we struggle with the problem how many chickens are required twelve or people the answer however is really obvious enough will be enough twelve day after arrives the garden er comes in to lay and carry tables we get out china and silver we make salad and rolls and cake we guide the cook faltering steps over the critical moments of soup and chicken we the oysters in our own particular way which we fancy inimitable we arrange bushels of flowers in bowls vases and baskets and set them on mantels tables everywhere that flower can find footing the chauf feur comes in proudly with the flower from the limousine and we fill it in honor of the distinguished guest then we go outside to see that the approach to the house is satisfactory the bland old gardener points to the wall and says with innocent joy it ai that ivory the prettiest thing you ever saw in your life and we ca deny that the lawn looks well with ivy and cosmos and innumerable chrysanthemums the cook and chambermaid will have to help wait on the table the chambermaid who is what the butler contemptuously calls educated nigger and so knows nothing useful announces that she has white uniform all she has is cold in her head we give her blouse and skirt wondering why providence does eliminate the unfit we run upstairs to put on our costliest shoes and stockings and our most perishable gown the leisurely brother gets us on the wire to say that there will be twenty guests in ten minutes descending we reset the tables to seat twenty guests light the toss together twenty juleps and few over luck repeat our clear instructions to the goggling chambermaid desperately implore the butler to see that she keeps on the job drop last touch of flavoring in the soup and are sitting by the fire with an air of childish gayety and carelessness when the train of draws up to the door here is the judge courteous and authoritative here is his assiduous suite the room fills with faces well known in every country that an illustrated newspaper can penetrate from the golden gate and the rio grande from new york and alabama these men have come together intent on wresting to themselves the control of the western hemisphere now they are sort of highly respectable guerillas very likely they will be magnates theoretically we are impressed actually they have mannerisms and some of them wear spectacles we reflect that the triumvirs very likely had mannerisms too and antony himself might have been glad to own spectacles we try to feel reverence the high calling of these men we hope they like our luncheon the butler brings in the juleps and we maintain detached look though those juleps were just happy thought of the butler himself and we were much surprised anybody the judge wo have one but most everybody else will the newspaper men look love and gratitude at the butler that earnest youth is the judge secretary the huge man expects to be governor after november fifth if dreams come true the amiable old gentleman who never leaves the judge side has come two thousand miles out of pure political enthusiasm to protect the candidate from assassins he can it too we conclude when we look past his smiling mouth into his steely eyes here is the campaign manager business man and this pretty little newspaper from utah implores us to get an utterance on suffrage from the judge just word it will save him thousands of votes well she dear little thing but we ca take advantage of our guest luncheon is announced brother slightly apologetic murmurs that there are entirely unforeseen he babbles incoherently but it all right we women wo come to the table voting and eating and things like that are better left to the men anyway why should women want to either when they have fathers and brothers to it them we can sit in the gallery and watch it very nice us and exclusive nothing promiscuous yes go on we wait whoever is listening to our conversation professes heartbreak at our decision and edges toward the rapidly filling we sit down to play lady of leisure in various affected attitudes we are not going near the kitchen again the luncheon is simple everything is perfectly arranged the servants can it all it mere machine the project gutenberg ebook of atlantic classics https afar we observe the soup vanishing then one by one we stammer i wonder if the rolls are coffee is impossible silently up the front stair and scurry down the we cover the perishable gown with huge white apron we send up fervent prayer the costly shoes and go where we are needed most we save the day good coffee with the precision of juggler we rescue plates from the chambermaid who is overcome by this introduction to the great world and dawdles contemplatively through the pantry door charmed with our proficiency she stands by our side and watches us clear shelf of china in the twinkling of an eye if she could find stool she would sit at our feet making motion studies but she could find it if it were already there she could find anything we order her back to the where she takes up strategic position by the window from which she can idly survey the mob outside and the hungry men within the last has passed through the doorway cigars and matches are circulating in the butler capable hands more need us we shed the enveloping aprons disappear from the kitchen and materialize again elegantly useless in the nobody can say that luncheon was hot and promptly served chairs begin to clatter they are rising from the table brass band outside bursts into being brother had foretold that band to us and we had expressed vivid doubts he said it would cost eighty dollars now eighty dollars in itself is respectable sum sum capable even of exerting some mild fascination but eighty dollars viewed in relation to band becomes merely ludicrous we said an band was thing innately impossible like or dachshund brother attested that the next best grade of band would demand eight hundred we justly caviled at eight hundred we inquired why any band brother claimed that it would make cheerful noise and we yielded so at this moment the band begins to make noise we perceive at once that the price was accurately gauged it is unquestionably an band we begin to believe in dachshunds to these supposedly cheerful strains the gentlemen stream into the they beam repletely they tell us what fine luncheon it was they are eloquent about it all the conditions of their entertainment were ideal they would have us believe they imply that we are mighty lucky in that our men can provide us with such luxurious existence they smile with majestic benignity at these fair but frivolous pensioners on masculine bounty american women are petted helpless dolls anyway foreigners have said so they clasp our useless hands in fervent farewells they proceed in state to the waiting cars they hope we will follow them to the meeting oh yes we will come though incapable of apprehending the high problems of government led by the honest band surrounded by flags followed by cheers they disappear in magnificent procession now we may straggle to the and eat cold though matchless oysters tepid chicken and in general whatever there is any left of the chambermaid has broken lovely old minton plate we are glad we did use the that were made in france dolly madison she would have enjoyed wrecking those we hurry because we want to miss the meeting altogether we think enviously of the men in our secret souls we like to campaign we love to talk better than anything else in the world and we could make nice speeches too but we must the oysters and the odd jobs and

is two short blocks from my office near park row to the subway station where i take the express belshazzar court eight months in the year it is my endeavor to traverse this distance quickly i can this is done by cutting diagonally across the street traffic by virtue of the law governing triangles i thus save much fifty feet and one fifth of minute of time in the course of year this saving amounts to sixty minutes whic h may be profitably spent over presentation of moonshiner bride supplemented by an intimate picture of lumbering in saskatchewan but with the coming of warm weather my habits change it grows more dif ficult to plunge into the murk of the subway foretaste of the languor of june is in the air the turnstile in our office building which have been put aside brief periods during the first deceptive approaches of spring only to come back triumphant from elba have been definitively removed the pace their girders twenty floors high almost in form and their pneumatic hammers scold and chatter through the sultry hours the are bright with new compounds whose names ingeniously reflect the world progress from day to day in politics science and the arts from my window i can see the long black steamships pushing down to the sea and they raise vague speculations in my mind about the cost of living in the vicinity of sorrento and fontainebleau on such day i am reminded of my physician orders issued last december to walk mile every afternoon on leaving my office so i stroll up broadway with the intention of taking my train farther at fourteenth street the doctor did not say stroll he said brisk walk with head erect chest thrown out diaphragm well contracted and general aspect of money in the bank but here enters human perversity the only place where i am in the mood to walk after the prescribed military fashion is in the open country just where by all accounts i ought to be sauntering without heed to time studying the lovely texts which nature has set down in the modest selected from her inexhaustible fonts the minion of ripening berries in the nonpareil of crawling insect life the agate of tendril and filament and the diamond of the dust i stride along and see little and in the city where i should swing along briskly i lounge what is there on broadway to linger over on broadway nature has used her biggest fattest tall flat building fronts brazen with many windows and ribbed with commercial gilt lettering six feet high shrieking proclamations of auction sales written in letters of fire on vast canvass es railway posters in scarlet and blue and green rotatory barber poles striving at the national colors and producing vertigo banners escutcheons crests in all the primary none of these things needs poring over and i know them with my eyes closed i know the windows where lithe youths in gymnasium dress demonstrate the virtue of home exercises the windows where other young men nothing but put on and take off patent reversible collars where young women deftly roll cigarettes where other young women whittle at sticks with miraculously stropped razors i know these things by heart yet i linger over them in flagrantly unhygie nic attitudes my shoulders bent forward and my chest and diaphragm in position precisely the reverse of that prescribed by the doctor perhaps the thing that makes linger before these familiar sights is the odd circumstance that in broadway nature is almost never herself but is either supernatu ral or artificial nature instance never intended that razors should cut wood and remain sharp that linen collars should keep on getting cleaner the longer they are worn that glass should not break that ink should not stain that gauze should not tear that an object worth five dollars should sell but all these things happen in broadway windows williams whom i meet now and then who sometimes turns and walks up with to fourteenth street pointed out to the other day how strange thing it was that the one street which has become synonym life to all good suburban americans is not real at all but is crowded either with miracles or with imitations the windows on broadway glow with wax fruits and with flowers of muslin and taffeta drawn by bounteous nature from her storehouses in parisian garret workshops broadway ostrich feathers have been plucked in east side tenements the huge cigars in the tobacconist windows are of wood the enormous bottles of champagne in the saloons are of cardboard and empty the tall scaffoldings of proprietary medicine bottles in the drug shops are of paper said williams the jewelry sold in the japanese auction stores is not genuine and the sellers are not japanese the project gutenberg ebook of atlantic classics https bustling mart of commerce the generation after the civil war used to say is only world of illusion artificial flowers artificial fruits artificial limbs tobacco rubber silks woolens straws gold silver the young men and women who manipulate razors and elastic cords are real but not always williams and i once stood long while and gazed at young woman posing in window and argued whether she was alive ultimately she winked and williams gloated over but how i know her wink was real at any rate the great mass of human life in the windows is artificial the ladies who smile out of charming morning costumes are obviously of lining and plaster their smug herculean husbands in pajamas preserve their equanimity in the severest winter weather only because of their constitution the baby reposing in its beribboned crib is china and excelsior illusion everywhere but the broadway crowd is real you only have to buffet it five minutes to feel in eyes and arms and shoulders how real it is when i was boy and was taken to the circus it was always an amazing thing to that there should be so many people in the street moving in direction away from the circus something of this sensation still besets whenever we go down in the subway from belshazzar court to hear caruso the presence of all the other people on our train is simple enough they are all on their way to hear caruso but what of the crowds in the trains that flash by in the opposite direction it is not question of feeling sorry them i try to underst and and i fail but on broadway on late summer afternoon the obverse is true the natural thing is that the living tide it presses south shall beat back halt eddy around i know that there are people moving north with but i am not acutely aware of them this onrush of faces conver ges on alone it is i against half the world and then suddenly out of the surge of faces one leaps out at it is williams whose doctor has told him that the surest way of fighting down the lust tobacco is to walk down from his office to the ferry every afternoon williams and i salute each other after the fashion of broadway which is to exchange greetings backward over the shoulder this is the first step in an elaborate minuet because we have passed each other before recognition came our hands fly out backward now we whirl half around so that i who have been moving north face the west while williams who has been traveling south now looks east our clasped hands strain at each other we stand there poised flight after the first greeting quarter of minute perhaps and we have said but if the critical quarter of minute passes there ensues change of geographical position which corresponds to change of soul within us i suddenly say to myself that there are plenty of trains to be had at fourteenth street williams recalls that another boat will leave battery place shortly after the one he is bound so the tension of our outstretched arms relaxes i who have been facing west complete the half circle and swing south williams veers due north and we two men stand face to face the beat and clamor of the crowd fall away from us like stage mob we are in broadway but not of it what the good word says williams when two men meet on broadway the spirit of optimism strikes fire we begin by asking each other what the good word is we take it granted that neither of us has anything but chronicle of victory and courage to relate what other word but the good word is tolerable in the lexicon of living upstanding men failure is only the dead surrender is the man with yellow in his nature so williams and i pay our acknowledgments to this best of possibl worlds i give williams the good word i make allusion to the fact that i have spent miserable night in communion with neuralgia how can that possibly concern him another manuscript came back this morning from an editor who regretted that his is the most unintelligent body of readers in the country the third cook in three weeks left us last night after making vigorous reflections on my wife good nature and my own appearance only an hour ago i was watching the long black steamers bound sorrento and fontainebleau the monotony of one treadmill work the flat unprofitableness of scribbling endlessly on sheets of paper had become almost nausea but williams will know nothing of this from why should he he may have been sitting up all night with sick child at this very moment the thought of the little parched lips the moan the unseeing eyes may be tearing at his entrails but he in turn gives the good word and many others after that and we pass on but sometimes i doubt this splendid optimism of people on broadway in the subway and in the shops and it really sign of high spiritual courage or is it just lack of sensibility we find it easy to keep stiff upper lip to buck up to never say die because we are brave men or simply because we lack the sensitiveness and the imagination to react to pain it may be even worse than that it may be part of our commercial gift putting up good front sometimes i feel that williams has right to be walking down broadway on business when there is stricken child at home the world can not possibly need him at that moment much his own flesh and blood does it is not courage it is brutish indifference at such times i am tempted to dismiss the project gutenberg ebook of atlantic classics https this fine talk about feelings that run deep beneath the surface and bruised hearts that ache under the smile if man really suffers he will show it if man cultivates the habit of not showing emotion he will end by having none to show how much of broadway optimism here i am paraphrasing william james principles of psychology which the reader can just well consult himself in the latest revised edition of also i am exaggerating most likely williams children are all in perfect health and my envelope from the editor has brought check instead of rejection slip it is on such occasion s that williams and i after shaking hands the way locomotive takes on water on the run wheel around halt and proceed to buy something at the rate of two quarter if any one is ever inclined to doubt the spirit of american fraternity it is only necessary to recall the number of commodities men that sell two cents in theory the two cigars which williams and i buy cents are worth fifteen cents apiece matter of fact they are probably cigars but the shopkeeper is welcome to his extra nickel it is small price to pay the seal of comradeship that stamps his pair of cigars selling single quarter two men who have concluded business deal in which each has commendably tried to get the better of the other may call cent perfectos or dreadnoughts i understand there are such but friends sitting down together will always demand cigars that go round sum two quarter or three fifty if the editor check is what it ought to be when people speak of the want of real comradeship among women i sometimes wonder if one of the reasons may not be that the prices which women are accustomed to pay are individualistic instead of fraternal the soda fountains and the street cars not dispense goods at the rate of two items single coin it is infinitely worse in the depa rtment stores treating friend to something that costs is inconceivable but i have really wandered from my point be good says williams and rushes of f to catch his boat the point i wish to make is that on broadway people pay tribute to the principle of goodness that rules this world both in the way they greet and in the way they part we salute by asking each other what the good word is when we say we enjoin each other to be good the humorous assumption is that gay devils like williams and need to be constantly warned against straying off into the primrose paths that run out of broadway simple humorous average american man you have left your suburban couch in time to walk half mile to the station and catch the the city you have read your morning paper discussed the weather the tariff and the prospects lettuce with your neighbor and made the office only minute late you have been fastened to your desk from nine to five with half an hour lunch which you have eaten in clamorous overheated restaurant while you watched your hat and coat at odd moments during the day the thought of doctor bills rent bills school bills has insisted on receiving attention at the end of the day laden with parcels from the market from the hardware store from the seedman you are bound the ferry to catch the when you meet smith who having passed the good word sends you on your way with the injunction to be to play roulette not to open wine not to not to ride not to haunt the stage door be good simple humorous average suburban american i take back that word suburban the sunday supplement has given it meaning which is not mine i am speaking only of the suburban in spirit of simplicity meekness which is of the soul only outwardly there is nothing suburban about the crowd on lower broadway the man in the street is not at all the diminutive apologetic creature with side whiskers whom opper brought forth and named common people who begat the anger who begat the and the ultimate consumer the crowd on lower broadway is alert and well set up yes though one hates to it i must say the men on the sidewalk are young limber almost insolent young men there are not very many old men in the crowd though i see any number of young men seldom you detect the traditional signs of age the sagging lines of the face the relaxed abdominal contour the tamed spirit the young the the but rarely quite the old i am speaking only of externals eager faces are very frequently disappointing very ordinary mind may be working behind that clear sweep of brow and nose and chin i have known the shock of young men who look like kings of wall street and speak like shoe clerks they are shoe clerks but the appearance is there that athletic carriag which is helped out by our triumphant clothing i suppose i ought to detest the tailor tricks which iron out all ages and all stations into uniformity of padded shoulders and trim and hips i imagine i ought to despise our habit of wearing elegant shoddy where the european chooses honest clumsy woolens but i am concerned only with externals and in outward appearances broadway crowd beats the world æsthetically we simply are in class by ourselves when compared with the englishman and the teuton in their skimpy garments let the project gutenberg ebook of atlantic classics https and german ambassadors at washington their worst this is my firm belief and i will maintain it against the world the truth must out ruat cœlum ich kann nicht anders j y suis j y r williams laughs at my lyrical outbursts but i am not yet through i still have to speak of the women in the crowd what an infinitely finer thing is woman than man of her class to see this yourself you have only to walk up broadway until the stream breaks off and the tide begins to run from west to east you have passed out of the commercial district into the region of factories it is well on toward dark and the barracks that go by the unlovely name of loft buildi ngs are pouring out their battalions of the crowd has become mass the nervous pace of lower broadway slackens to the steady patient tramp of host it is an army of women with here and there flying detachment of the male on the faces of the men the day toil has written its record even on the wom en but in much coarser hand fatigue has beaten down the soul of these men into brutish indifference but in the women it has drawn fine the flesh only to make it more eloquent of the soul instead of listlessness there is wistfulness instead of vacuity you read mystery innate grace rises above the vulgarity of the dress cheap tawdry blouse and imitation walk shoulder to shoulder with the shoddy coat of the male copying fifth avenue fifty cents may attain to five dollars but the men shoddy is merely horror whereas woman transfigures and subtilizes the cheap material the spirit of grace which is the birthright of her sex can not be even by the presence of her best young man in sunday clothes she is finer by the heritage of her sex and america has accentuated her title this america which drains her youthful vigor with overwork which takes from her cheeks the color she has brought from her slavic or italian peasant home makes restitution by remoulding her in more delicate more alluring lines gives her the high privilege of neurosis williams and i pause at the subway entrances and watch the earth suck in the crowd it lets itself be swallowed up with meek our amazing political philosophers have deplored the fact they have urged us to be quicker more resentful of being stepped upon more inclined to write letters to the editor i agree that only in that way can we be rid of political bosses of brutal policemen of of extortioners of insolent waiters of janitors of indecent congestion in travel of unheated cars in the winter and windows in summer i am at heart with the social philosophers but then i am not typical of the crowd when my neighbor elbow injects itself into the small of my back i twist around and glower at him i forget that his elbow is the innocent mechanical result of whole series of elbows and backs extending the length of the car to where the first cause operates in the form of shoulder ramming the human cattle into their stalls in the faces about there is resentment instead of smashing windows instead of raising barricades in the subway and hanging the with their own lanterns about their necks the crowd sways and bends to the lurching of the train and young voices call out cheerfully of room ahead horribly we have taken phrase which is the badge of our shame and turned it into jest plenty of room ahead if this were squat proletarian race obviously predestined to subjection one might understand but that crowd of trim americans alert insolent i have called them that they should submit is puzzle perhaps it is because of the fierce democracy of it all the crush the enforced intimacies of physical contact the feeling that man natural condition is to push and be pushed to shove ahead when the opportunity offers and to take it like man when chance presents is equality seat in the subway is like the prizes of life which men have fought in these united states you struggle you win or lose if the other man wins there is envy admiration rather provided he has not shouldered and elbowed out of reason that freedom from envy is passing and perhaps the of the crowd in the subway will pass i see signs of the approaching change people not call out of room ahead so frequently they used to when dangling from the strap in the subway in front of baseball bulletins on park row in the face of so much oppression and injustice where is the supposed cruelty of the i am ready to affirm on oath that the mob is not vindictive that it is not cruel it may be bit fickle bit mischievous but in the heart of the crowd there is evil passion the evil comes from the leaders the demagogues the professional distorters of right thinking and right feeling the crowd in the bleachers is not the clamorous brute mob of tradition i have watched faces in the bleachers and in the and seen little of that fury which is supposed to animate the fan the most part he sits there with folded arms eager but after all conscious that there are other things in life besides baseball it is the leaders the baseball editors the cartoonists the humorists the professional stimulators of pride with their exaggerated gloatings over game won their poisonous attacks the project gutenberg ebook of atlantic classics https losing team who are responsible it is these demagogues who drill the crowd in the gospel of loving only if i keep on i shall be in politics before i know it if you see in the homeward crowd in the subway face over which the pall of depression has settled that face very likely is bent over the comic pictures in the evening paper i can not recall seeing any one smile over these long serials of humorous adventure which run from day to day and from year to year i have seen readers turn mechanically to these lurid comics and pore over them foreheads puckered into frown lips unconsciously spelling out the long legends which issue in the form of little balloons and lozenges from that amazing portrait gallery of dwarfs giants shrilling viragos and their diminutive husbands children quadrupeds insects entire zoölogy if any stimulus rises from these pages to the puzzled brain the effect is not visible i imagine that by dint of repetition through the years these grotesque creations have become reality to millions of readers it is longer question of humor it is vice the desperate desmonds the and the dingbats have acquired horrible fascination otherwise i can not see why readers of the funny page should appear to be memorizing pages from euclid this by way of anticipation what the doctor has said of exercise being habit which grows easy with time is true it is the first five minutes of walking that are wearisome i find myself strolling past fourteenth street where i was to take my train belshazzar court never mind street will well i am now on different broadway the crowd is longer north and south but flows in every direction it is churned up at every corner and spreads itself across the squares and open places its appearance has changed it is longer factory population women still predominate but they are the women of the professions and trades which centre about madison women of independent standing women from the magazine offices the publishing houses the insurance offices you detect the bachelor girl in the current which sets in toward the home quarters of the undomesticated the little bohemias the foreign whose fixed table prices flash out in illumined signs from the side streets still farther north and the crowd becomes tinged with the current of that broadway which the outside world knows best the idlers begin to mingle with the workers men in english cloth es with canes women with plumes and jeweled reticules you catch the first of little old new york the first stirrings of this gayer broadway die down quickly almost they manifested themselves the idlers and those who minister to them have heard the call of the dinner hour and have vanished into hotel doors into shabbier quarters by means in keeping with the cut of their garments and their apparent indifference to useful employment soon the street is almost empty it is not beautiful broadway in this garish interval between the last of the matinée and shopping crowd and the vanguard of

short blocks from belshazzar the project gutenberg ebook of atlantic classics https in men by katharine fullerton gerould n ever i fancy has it been more true than it is that fiction reflects life the best fiction has always given us kind of precipitate of human don quixote and tom jones are equally and true in sense all time but our modern books give us every quirk and turn of the popular ideal and fifty years hence if read at all may be too words and to any one who has been reading fiction the last twenty years it is cryingly obvious that fashions in human nature have changed my first novel was jane eyre and at the age of eight i fell desperate ly in love with fairfax rochester instance could serve better to point the distance we have come i was not an extraordinary little girl except that perhaps i was extraordinarily fortunate in being permitted to encounter the classics in infancy and i dare say that if i had not met rochester i should have succumbed to some imaginary gentleman of quite different stamp it may be that i should have fallen in time and chance permitted v or the beloved vagabond but i doubt it in the first place novels longer assume that it is the prime business of the female heart at whatever age to surrender itself completely to some man consequently the men in the novels of are not calculated they once were to hit the fluttering mark the emotions are the last redoubt to be taken modern tactics direct the assault people are always telling us that fashions in women have changed what seems to almost more interesting is that fashions in men the stable sex have changed to match the new woman by which i mean the very newest would not fall in love with rochester it is therefore to the novelists to create heroes whom the modern heroine will fall in love with this to the popular satisfaction they have done and not only in fiction have the men changed in life too the men of are quite different i know because my friends marry them it is immensely interesting this difference one by one the man has sloughed off his most masculine we knew them characteristics gone are rochester who fought the duel with the vicomte at dawn and burgo fitzgerald the only love of that incomparable woman lady glencora palliser who breakfasted on curaçao and pâté foie gras longe r does blanche ingram declare english hero of the road would be the next best thing to an italian bandit and that could only be surpassed by levantine pirate blanche ingram humanit arian hero some one who has particular respect convicts and fallen women and whose favorite autho r is tolstoï he must qualify the possession of her hand by long voluntary residence in the slums he may inherit ancestral acres only if he has concerning them socialistic intentions he must be too altruistic to kill grouse and if he is to be wholly he must refuse to eat them he must never order and cof fee his only permitted weapon is benevolent legislation i not mean that he is to be christianity has at least taught us that it is well the hero to be in the pink of condition he may any day have street fight on his hands and he should have the tongue of men and of angels gone is the inarticulate forever the modern hero has read books that burgo fitzgerald and guy livingstone and rochester never heard of he is ready to address any gathering and to argue with any antagonist until dawn he is preferably personally unconscious of sex until the heroine arrives but he is by means effeminate he is very complicated and interesting creature some mediæval traits are discernible in him but the eighteenth century would not have known him human what has he lost this hero and what has he gained how did it all begin in life doubtless it began with feminine change of taste brilliant plumage has ceased to allure and i suspect the peacock tail much the anthropoid ape is destined to elimination we women of are distrustful of the peacock tail we are mortally afraid of being misled by it and of discovering too late that the peacock soul is not quite the thing never has there been among the feminine young more scientific talk about the project gutenberg ebook of atlantic classics https never among the feminine young such scientific distrust of it before young woman suspects that she wants to marry young man she has probably discussed with him exhaustively the penal code white slavery eugenics and the everlasting miracle of that she should want in these circumstances to marry him at all she probably does not unless his views have been wholly to her satisfaction and with those views what has the perpetual glory of the peacock tail to so much life in our english fiction i am inclined to believe that geor ge eliot began it with daniel deronda but in our own day meredith did more up to the time of meredith the dominant male was the fashionable hero tom jones and sir charles grandison and fairfax rochester and warrington are different possible but all of them in their several ways keep up one male tradition in fiction it is within our own day that that tradition has entirely changed have you ever noticed how inveterately in meredith novels the schoolmaster or his spiritual kinsman comes out on top lord ormont can not stand against matey weyburn lord fleetwood against owain wythan sir willoughby patterne against vernon whitford the little girl who fell in love with rochester would have preferred any one of these gentlemen yes even sir willoughby to his rival but i dare say the event would have proved her wrong certainly the wisdom of the ladies choice was never doubtful to meredith himself the soldier and the aristocrat can not endure the test they are put to by the sympathetic male with penchant the enfranchised woman vain lord ormont to accede to aminta taste publicity vain lord fleetwood to become the humble wooer of carinthia jane each has previously been convicted of pride now in an earlier day woman would have looked at man who was not was not even little too proud pride by which lucifer fell was the chief of the gentleman moreover in that earlier day women did not expect their heroes to explain everything to them certain amount of reticence measure of silence was also one of the hallmarks of the gentleman if bit of mystery could be thrown in so much the better it gave her something to exercise her imagination on think of the byronic conrad lara and the rest if they had told all where would they have been think of lovelace and heathcote and darcy and brian bois guilbert heroes once were always disdaining to speak and spurning their foes nowa days hero disdains to speak and hero ventures to spurn of all his foes he is humble of heart and very loquacious humphry ward has inherited from geor ge eliot and the latest heroes of galsworthy and hewlett example are the children of vernon whitford matey weyburn and owain wythan of whom it is not explicitly written that they had any others they are humani tarian and democratic they are ignorant of hatred they are inclined to think the necessarily better than the and they are quite sure that women are superior to men true galsworthy always seems to be looking backward he never forgets the ancient tradition that he is combating his young aristocrats who eschew the ways of aristocracy are unhappy and virtue in their case is only reward perhaps that is why his novels always leave us with the medicinal taste of inconclusion in our mouths but take handful of heroes elsewhere the reverend john hodder the smith v or even coryston the socialist peer where in the lot of them you find either pride or reticence in the old sense where in any one of them you find the satanic charm which one would harriet byron or jane eyre or catherine earnshaw or elizabeth bennett have looked at with eyes of love the charm the phrase is out milton i suspect is responsible the tradition that has lasted so long and is now being broken utterly to pieces milton made satan delightful and our good protestant novelists long time followed his lead in that they gave their delightful men some of the satanic traits proud they were and scornfully silent we have recalled and conven tional to the last degree that is in the stricter sense by which it is not meant that portraits they were unconvincing or that men they never offended grundy they were conventional in that they followed convention in that they were to large extent predicable they were jealous of their honor and believed it vindicable by the duel they had doubt that good women were better than bad and that pedigree in human beings was important pedigree in animals and though they might be quixotic on occasion they were not democratic pour deux sous the barmaid was not their sister nor the stevedore their brother the satan of paradise lost we all remember was splendid snob moreover they were not merely out of books the faust idea having prevailed many centuries has at last been perhaps our sober sense may tell us rightly but not so long ago there was still something more repellent to the female imagination about the man who chose not to know than about the man who chose not to abstain i not mean that we were supposed always to be looking tom jones or roderick might be looking sir charles grandison less but at least when we found our hero we expected to find him wiser than we nowadays girl rather likes to give man often in fiction at least has to meredith railed against the virginal the project gutenberg ebook of atlantic classics https heroine well our heroines now are never veiled virginal dolls but sometimes our heroes are lancelot has gone out and galahad has come in i suspect that there is literary law of compensation and that ibsen and strindber g to the contrary notwithstanding there has to be veiled virginal doll somewhere in really taking romance perhaps it is fair that the sterner sex should have its turn at guarding ideals by the hearthstone while women make the grand tour let not be misunderstood i am not referring particularly to that knowledge which any man is better without but to the odyssean experienc which in their respective measures heroes were wont to have behind them and saw the cities and the counsels knew of many men and many time at sea within his heart he bore calamity they had at least seen the towns and the minds of men and their morals were the less likely to be upset by conventional assault upon them does any one chance to remember i wonder theron ware led to his by his first experience of chopin nocturne it would have taken more than chopin nocturne to make any of our seasoned heroes something that he did not wish to they knew something of society and ergo of women they had experienced directly or vicariously human romance and they had read history nowadays they are apt to know little or begin society women or romance except what may be got from books on sociology and they pride themselves on knowing history history with its eternal stress es and selections is nothing if not aristocratic and our heroes nowadays must be democratic or they die it is an age of complete faith in the superiority of the lower swing of the pendulum doubt from the other extreme of thinking the lower classes morally and æsthetically negligible is detestable now in matters of intellect and breeding in matters of finance and politics the man with the has got past the office into the if your hero has the bad luck not to have been born in the slums he must at least have the wit to take up his habitation there soon he comes of age we have learned that riches are corrupting but except in the special sense of reports we have not yet learned that poverty is rather more corrupting than wealth sophistication whether social intellectual or æsthetic is now the deadly sin if we are sophisticated we may not be good enough ellis islan and there goes another of the hallma rks of the gentleman he was once known to fiction our hero in old days might not have condescended to the glittering assemblies of fashion but there was never any doubt that if he had he would in spite of himself have been king of his company soon he entered the room he might have been hard up but his necktie would not have been black sea holding life school of fat white fish he might have been lonely or gloomy but he would not have been diffident and he would never never never have at the heroine godlike friend had carelessly put his into the butter says asticot at the outset of the beloved vagabond now in picaresque novels we were always meeting people who did that sort of thing but they were not gentlemen whereas the beloved vagabond is of noble birth and despite his ten years abeyance finds the countess quite ready to marry him she does not marry him in the end to be sure but we are permitted to feel that there was something lacking in her because paragot manners at tea did not please her the hero of old had what used to be called sense of fitness and saving sense of humor which combined to prevent his entering ballroom john the baptist the same lucky combination would have prevented literature at wooing the millionaire child with dusty commonplaces of the higher criticism or jeremiads against the daughters of heth but perhaps millionaires children take that sort of thing manners to the argument that performance of the kind takes courage one can only reply that judging from the enthusiasm with which the preaching hero is received by the heroine it apparently does not and in any case the hero is too sublimely ignorant of what socially constitutes courage to deserve any credit it sometimes of course like galswor thy men he perceives with some inherited sense that his kind of thing is not likely to be welcomed and then he goes sadly and sternly away leaving the girl to accept wooer with more technique but usually he cuts out everybody the chief of gentleman now is the desire to reform his own class out of all recognition women we know have long wanted to be talked to if they were men and the result is that heroines now let themselves be lectured at in way that very few men would endure alison parr marries the rev john hodder and carlisle heth would have married if he had lived well clara middleton married vernon whitford and carinthia jane married owain wythan and aminta married matey the project gutenberg ebook of atlantic classics https may have seemed to be speaking cynically that i can give my word of honor i am not it is well that we have come to realize that there are some adventures which in themselves add lustre to man name it is well that we take thought the lower strata of our actual reforms i fancy show their authors taking thought not but certainly brutality or the indifference which is negative brutality is not beautiful or moral thing and certainly we not particularly sympathize with thackeray shedding tears he went away from his publishers because they had obliged him to save pendennis chastity that dreadful person arthur pendennis would surely not have been made any less dreadful by being permitted to seduce fanny bolton it is right to think of the poor it is right to bend our energies citizens to the economic bettering of their lot one could sanely regret our doing so but there is always danger in saying the thing which is not and in pretending that because some virtues have hitherto not been recognized the virtues that have been recognized are good one sympathizes with towneley in that incomparable novel the way of all flesh when ernest asks him you like poor people very much yourself gave his face comical but screw and said quietly but slowly and decidedly and escaped course some poor people were very nice and always would be so but though scales had fallen suddenly from his eyes he saw that one was nicer being poor and that between the upper and lower classes there was gulf which amounted practically to an impassable barrier it is great pity that samuel butler did not live longer and write more novels but in regretting him we shall well to remember that though publication was delayed until some time after the author death the bulk of the way of all flesh was written in the the way of all flesh is not sympathetic to the contemporary mood it is one of those books so much ahead of its time except perhaps in ecclesiastical matters that the time has not yet caught up with it it was doomed inevitably to an interval of oblivion the case reminds one of richar d fever el only in one way is the way of all flesh quite contemporary the hero thinks so well of the prostitute that he marries her on the other hand to be sure he bitterly regrets it which is not contemporary i not mean that the hero marrying her is especially in the literary fashion but his thinking well of her is you will notice that in our moral fever we not leave the prostitute out of our indeed she must be there to give spice of old only now instead of being entangled with her the young gentleman preaches to her and she loves him it perhaps this is what happens nowadays in real life i not pretend to know but i suspect it is true i fancy the only kind of person who could invent the contemporary plot is the kind who would live it the wildes t imaginings of the people who are made differently would hardly stretch to it and not only does the hero find himself immensely touched by the tragedy of the disreputable woman is after all in certain cases plausible enough burns to introduce his fiancée to her now that again may be life winston churchill example should know better than i it is certainly world with the sense of value s gone wrong and when we have lost our sense of values we shall presently lose the values well the girl herself is often to blame did not the fiancée of simon gex go of her own initiative to see the amer and come away to renounce him convinced that the tamer was the nobler woman which emphatically she was not but then we know from long experience of locke he can not keep his head with about and sawdust is incense to him let locke have his little foibles by all means but even locke should not have made the spoiled darling of society marry the er one side of her face having been nearly clawed off and then go with her into city missionary work yet i not believe it is really locke fault the public at present loves sister the woman with past and loves city missionary work if possible more the fact is that with all our imitation of every one who is not imitating tolstoï is imitating has failed to save us we have taken all his prescriptions one we have emancipated our women and emasculated our men we have cast down the mighty from their seats and exalted them of low degree we have learned all the radical shibboleths and say them our morning prayers and we have faced the fact of sex so squarely that we can hardly see anything else but we have not learned his saving hatred of the sentimentalist miss may sinclair has admirably pointed out in her study of the three brontës that charlotte brontë was exceedingly modern in her detestation of sentimentality modern she may have meredith but not modern with the present novelists they are almost too sentimental to be endured and there is the whole trouble we think thackeray an old fool being sentimental over amelia sedley but how does it better the case to be sentimental instead over the heroine of the promised land amelia sedley was all in all much nicer person if not half so clever she may have sniveled good deal but she was capable of loving some one else better than the project gutenberg ebook of atlantic classics https course i have cited only few that happened to come most easily to mind but let any reader of fiction run over mentally group of contemporary heroes and see if the substitutions i have named have not pretty generally taken place has not pride given way to humility reticence to glibness to wild democracy the code of manners to an uncouth unworldliness and honor in the old sense to burning passion old reform not these men lead us into the heterogeneous company of the unclassed of both ask us to look upon them saints in motley has not the world of fiction changed in the last twenty years the hero in old days sometimes fell foul of the law by getting into debt but we were not supposed therefore to be on his side against the law now the hero does not perhaps get into legal difficulties himself but he is always passionately on the side of the people whom laws were devised to protect the respectable from the scientific tendency to consider that aristocracy consists merely in freed om from certain physical taints has permeated fiction not one man good another asked the demagogue course he is and great deal better replied the excited irishman in the crowd we are in the thick of popular mania thinking all the undesirables good deal better the modern hero is to my mind in intention if not in execution an admirable figure and though one rather expects him any day to give his whole fortune gross of green spectacles one will not that find him any less likable some day he will rediscover the dantesque hierarchy of souls implicit in humanity and then perhaps he will get back his charm some one is probably bursting to observe that we have school of realists at hand and that one can accuse wells and bennett of that we have shaw and granville barker and masefield mounted auxiliar ies in the field i grant bennett i am not so sure about wells but certainly wells is not sentimental william morgan winston churchill meredith nicholson theodore dreiser harrison and miss ellen glasgow are sentimental if he is sentimental at all it is rather over ideas than people masefield i am inclined to think is simply catering to the special audience that thomas hardy by his silence has left gaping and empty let us look into the matter little is one of the most difficult catchwords in the world to define and you can get roomful of intelligent people quarreling over it any time perhaps our purposes it will serve merely to say that the sentimentalist is always in one way or another disloyal to facts he can not be trusted to give straight account because his own sense of things is more valuable to him than the truth he has come in on the top of the pragmatic wave and the sands of are strewn thick with him he serves in kipling phrase the god of things they ought to be according to his private feeling his own perversion may be æsthetic or intellectual or moral or sociological but he is always recognizable by his tampering with truth now wells does tamper with truth he did it example in the case of ann veronica he wanted ann veronica to be nice girl under twenty and he wanted her even more to be unduly awakened to certain physical aspects of sex it was sentimentality that made him draw her he did determination to prove that the girl who loved he wanted her to love was just conventional any one else you can not have your cake and eat it too but the sentimentalist blindly refuses to accept that accordingly we get the unconvincing creature that wells wanted to believe existed wells heroes may not seem to bear out my argument so well galsworthy to be sure wells is not so sentimental galsworthy and he has not like the author of the man of property and fraternity and justice idea galsworthy always deals with man who is in love with some other man wife and his world is thereby narrowed wells is interested in good many things and his politics are not purely philanthropic most of our novelists politics are but wells heroes even when they are fairly fortunate are preoccupied with their own notions of sociological duty even more than they are preoccupied with passion though their passion is enough when it comes would any one except wells hero take trip to india and come away having seen nothing but the of bombay always the author sympathy is with the under dog whether it is kipps or polly living out his long foredoomed existence or geor ge ponderevo analyzing bladesover with diabolic keenness and aching contempt i spiritual guttersnipe in love with unimaginable goddesses says ponderevo in burst of frankness there you have the wells hero to the life and bennett people are only spiritual guttersnipes who are not in love with unimaginable goddesses the point is that the guttersnipe is havin g his turn in fiction if our american heroes are not guttersnipes themselves it is their sign of grace to be supremely interested in guttersnipes in one way or the other the guttersnipe must have his proper prominence of course there are differences and degrees few heroes get nearer the lower classes than passionate desire reform tickets and municipal sanitation but ordinarily they must go through ernest pontifex state of believing that poor people are not only more important but in every way nicer than rich people and few of them go back utterly on that belief the project gutenberg ebook of atlantic classics https perhaps that more than anything else marks the change of fashion in men gentlemen were always in their way benevolent but formerly they had not achieved the paradox that the object of benevolence is ex officio more interesting than the bestower books have been written before now in the interest of reform they tell us that justice set the home secretary to thinking well marcus clarke actually caused the reform of the australian penal settlements by his now forgotten novel the term of his natural life the hero of marcus clarke book was innocent and unjustly condemned the hero of justice is guilty wanton cruelty is wicked whether the victim be bad man or good one but the difference between these two heroes is not so purely accidental at first blush it may seem the author of his natural life starting out to capture sympathy showed the brutal system wreaking itself on an innocent man of good family condemned another guilt galsworthy equally eager to capture sympathy makes his protagonist guilty of the theft having tried in vain to incriminate an innocent person each writer depended doubtless on public sentiment his effect in marcus clarke time public sentime unfortunate the fact may could not have been aroused to such pitch by the sufferings of liar and thief by the sufferings of an innocent man who is consciously paying another person penalty the humanitarian hero had not come into nor yet the guttersnipe but marcus clarke book did its that even in the we were not so callous we seemed i said earlier that in life well in literature men had changed one instances obviously must be from books and not from one acquaintance but i spoke truth philanthropy is the latest social ladder but it would not be so if the people on the top rung were not interested in philanthropy there has been whatever reason tremendous spurt of interest in sociological questions our young men of high ideals find themselves fighting of necessity on different battlefield from any that strategists would have chosen thirty years ago moreover philanthropy being woman way into politics women have been giving their calm or hysterical attention to problems which thirty years since did not problems exist them i said that the change of taste in women would probably account much of the change of fashion in men schoolmate of mine writing some years since of her engagement said in nearly these words is tremendously interested in city missionary work it would have been quite perfect if we had had that in common both were spoiled darlings of fortune but the statement was quite sincere undoubtedly without that it would not have been perfect in the eyes of either the mere conversation of the marriagea ble young has changed past belief service has usurped so many subjects have many people stopped to realize i wonder how complete ly the psychological novel and the play in the old sense have gone out of date the psychology of hero and heroine their emotional attitudes to each other are largely worked out now in terms of their attitudes to impersonal questions their religious or their sociological the individual person al reaction counts less and less if they agree on the same panacea the social evils the author can usually patch up passion sufficient them to marry on gone the most part are the pages of intimate analysis intimate analysis is needed any longer the play we have it still with us but in another form the doll house and the second tanqueray are both antiquated we not call drama problem play now unless it preaches new kind of legislation and sex its finer aspects it longer interests us there was great deal more sex in its subtler manifestations in the old novels and plays than in the new ones not so long ago novel was love story and it was of supreme importance to hero whether or not he could make the heroine care him it was also of supreme importance to the heroine the romance was all founded on sex and yet sex was hardly mentioned our heroes and heroines still marry but when they consider sex at all they are apt to consider it biologically not romantically we public are more frankly interested in sex than ever but we think of it objectively and little brutally in terms of demand and supply and so we get often the pathetic spectacle of the hero and heroine having time to make love to each other in the good way because they are so busy suppressing the district and compiling statistics of disease much of the frankness doubtless is good thing but beyond doubt it has cheapened passion passion among civilized people is subtle thing it is wrapped about with dreams and imaginings and can bring human beings to salvation well to perdition but when it is shown to us the mere province of courtesans small wonder that we turn from it to the hero who will have difficulty in feeling or inspiring it especially since we are told at the same time that even the courtesan plies her trade only from direst necessity after all the only safe person to fall in love with nowadays is reformer socially financially and sentimentally and most women at least could

the love with the reach the hundred thousand mark if there are any of us left who regret the gentlemen of still prefer our darcy or even our plantagenet must write our own novels and divine our own heroes under the protective coloring of their conventional breeding they are not being at present either in life or in literature confession in pr ose by walter prichard eaton u nlike jourdain who had been speaking prose all his life without knowing it i have been writing it nearly all of mine quite consciously and earning my living thereby since i was years old i am now i have been professional writer of prose then thirteen shall i say writer of professional prose much of this writing has been done various american magazines still more has been done to fill the ravenous columns of american newspapers some even has been immured between covers i have tried never to write sloppily though i have of necessity often written hastily i can honestly say too that i have tried at times to write beautifully by which i mean rhythmically with conscious adjustment of sound and melody to the sense with the charm of further to heighten heightened thought but i can also honestly say that in this latter effort i have never been encouraged by newspaper editor and i have been not infrequently discouraged by magazine editors not all magazines compel you to chop up your prose into maximum paragraph length of ten lines does certain one of large circulation not all newspapers compel you to be did one which i worked compel us all but the impression among editors is prevalent none the less that conversational downrightness and sentence and paragraph brevity are the and of prose style or at least of so much of prose style can be grasped by the populace who read their publications and that beau tiful writing must be writing and therefore never too much to be avoided so i started out from the classroom of professor lewis gates one of the keenest and most inspiring analysts of prose beauties this country has produced to be professional writer of prose and dreamed youth will of wrapping my singing robes about and ravishing the world i was soon enough told to doff my singing robes the overalls of journalism and i have become writer of professional prose instead these remarks have been inspired by long and wistful evening just spent in perusing professor saintsbury new book called the history of english prose rhythm i shall hold brief the good professor method of scansion it matters little to indeed how he chooses to scan prose what does matter to is that he has chosen to scan it at all that he has brought forward the finest examples in the stately procession of english literature and demonstrated with all the weight of his learning his autho rity his fine enthusiasm that this prose is less consciously wrought to pleasing numbers than is verse we who studied under professor gates knew much of this before if not in so detailed and methodical fashion charles lamb knew it when he wrote ourself in these our humbler lucubrations tune our best measured cadences prose has her cadences not unfrequently to the charm of the drowsier watchman blessing the doors or the wild sweep of winds at midnight sir thomas browne was not exactly unaware of it he prepared his urn burial the printer nor the authors of the king james version of the bible when they if you prefer rhapsodic chapters of isaiah but it is pleasant and not unimportant to be once more reminded in generation when written speech has sunk to the conversational level of the man in the street that has her cadences and to at least it is melancholy also i would strive to write such prose in my stumbling fashion were i the project gutenberg ebook of atlantic classics https about fine art i am so often called upon to i would endeavor with what might lay in to write about it finely suppose that art chances to be the drama why when some compact weighty and worthily performed example comes to our stage should i be expected to toss off description of it in style less compact and weighty and worthily conducted on the rare occasions when new play chances to be poetic am i not justified in writing of it in poetic prose how else indeed can i truly render back to my readers the subtler aspects of its charm but such writing there is little room in our hurrying and press though now and then despised dramatic editor is found who understands even the drama itself strives to be at all costs under the banner of and profanity flourishes on our stage in what we must infer to be most manner while we have almost forgotten that the spoken word can be melodious or imaginative criticism cries at its heels and helps with flippant jest and broken syntax and cacophonous combinations of our poorest vernacular in the general debasement not tell that men not exist who could write differently of the stage men exist who can and write differently it every worthy dramatis t can be paralleled by at least one worthy critic and more probably by three or four since the true creative instinct in drama is perhaps the rarest of human attributes save only charity but the editors appear to have determined that the public does not want such perhaps the editors are right at least the public does not often get them we are speaking now of prose not of opinions and we may safely introduce the name of living critic william winter nearly half century winter has written prose about the theatre and although that prose was produced morning newspaper it was carefully and consistently balanced and welded and when the subject demanded it rose according to its creator ideas of beauty into the heightened eloquence of sentence rhythm and syllabic harmo ny leisure may improve but haste can not prevent the rhythm of prose provided the instinct it resides in the writer and the opportunity exists practice and expression two examples of winter use of rhythm come to my memory and i quote only phrases not whole sentences merely because i am sure of more writing one morning of new and very play presented the previous evening by actress he said bernhardt at least made her sexual monsters interesting wielding the lethal hatpin or the deadly hatchet with gallic grace and sweet celerity again in reviewing pinero iris he took up two of henry arthur jones phrases recently made current in lecture and played with them ending with mellifluous scorn are the great realities of modern life flowers of disease and blight that fringe the charnel house of the serious drama these are certainly examples of rhythmic or cadenced prose and they are examples taken from journalistic reviews they admirably express the writer point of view toward his subject matter but they also reveal his care the manner of expression they satisfy the ear and therefore to one at all sensitive to literature they are doubly satisfying the arrow of irony is ever more delightful when it sings on its flight the trick then can be done winter too often perhaps modern ears performed it by recourse to the johnsonian balance of period and almos t uniform swelling roll but that is neither here nor there the point is that he performed that it is longer performed by the new gene ration either in newspaper columns or we will add at once anywh ere else rhythmic prose prose cadenced to charm the ear and by its melodies and harmonies properly adjusted to heighten with an under the emotional appeal of the ideas expressed is longer written it appears to be longer wanted we are fallen upon harsh and colloquial times one with any ear at all would deny emerson style even if his rhythms are often broken into the of carlyle one would deny irving style or poe poe at his best indeed to hark far back cotton mather in many passages of the magnalia where to quaint iambic simplicity he added biblical fervor which redeem s and melodizes the monotony math er suggests milton irving suggests addison emerson suggests carlyle poe shall we say is often the too conscious workman typified by quincey but thereafter in this country we descend rapidly into imitations into rhythm become in truth mere writing until its death within recent memory yet we not find even the true cadenced prose either uninteresting or out of date emerson is modern the morning paper newman description of the ideal site university in the clear air of attica beside the blue ægean charms us still with its perfect blend of sound and sense its clear intellectual idea borne on cadenced undersong of distant surf upon the shore and the exquisite epilogue to the apologia with its chime of proper names still brings moisture to our eyes the triumphant tramp of gibbon the headlong imagery and biblical fervor of ruskin the languid music of walter pater each holds its separate charm and the charm is not archaic is such prose impossible any more certainly it is not the heritage of the language is still ours the birthright of our noble english tongue simply we not dare to let ourselves go we seem tortured with the modern blight of and while the cheaper magazines are almost blatant in the project gutenberg ebook of atlantic classics https fery they are none the less cravenly submissive to what they deem popular demand and turn their backs on literature on style something abhorrent to race which has been fed on the english bible three hundred years their ideal of prose style now seems to consist of series of staccato yips it really can not be described in any other way the intricate sentence celebrated by walter pater would give many modern editor shiver of terror he would visualize it mowing down the circulation of the magazine like machine gun rhythm and beauty of style can hardly be achieved by staccato yips the modern magazine writer trying to be rhetorically effective trying to rise to the demands of heightened thought or emotional appeal reminds one of that enthusiastic german tympanist who wrote an entire symphonic poem i read one of the autumn crop of new novels the other day curiously enough it was written by music critic who in his reviews of music is constantly insisting on the primal importance of melody and harmony who is an arch foe of the modern programme school and the tone scale of debussy but the prose of his novel was utterly devoid of these prized elements melody and harmony heavy or sometimes turgid journalistic common placeness sat upon it i will not be unfair and tear an illustration from some passage of rightly simple narration i will take the closing sentences from one of the climactic chapters when the mood had supposedly risen to intensity and if ever the prose would have been justified in rising to reinforce the emotion the house was aroused to extravagant demonstrations across the footlights it looked like brilliantly realistic piece of acting and the audience was astonished at the vigor of the hitherto cold americano nagy was not deceived crushed dishevelled breathless she knew that her dominion over him was gone forever she had tried to show him his soul and he had begun to see the light now an ear attuned to the melodies of english prose must surely find this commonplace and the closing sentence of all actually harsh the tonalities of strauss or debussy seem to the writer let us even if little unfairly set it beside passage from henry esmond again climactic passage but one where the style is climactic also rising to the mood you will please sir to remember he continued that our family hath ruined itself by fidelity to yours that my grandfather spent his estate and gave his blood and his son to die your service that my dear lord grandfather lord you are now frank by right and title too died the same cause that my poor kinswoman my father second wife after giving away her honor to your wicked perjured race sent all her wealth to the king and got in return that precious title that lies in ashes and this inestimable yard of blue ribbon i lay this at your feet and stamp upon it i draw this sword and break it and deny you and had you completed the wrong you designed us by heaven i would have driven it through your heart and more pardoned you than your father pardoned monmouth frank will the same wo you cousin this justly famous passage be it noted is dialogue we especially not dare to rise above conversational level in dialogue we should be accused of being does one speak beautifully any more then even in real life are the so shattered in the modern anatomy that connection is established between emotions and the musical sense does an exquisite mood longer reflect itself in our voice in our vocabul ary does lover rise to eloquence in the presence of his adored if that is the case surely we now speak unnaturally and it should be the duty of literature to restore our health nor need such speech in fiction float clear away from solid ground notice how thackeray in his closing will the same wo you cousin his rhetoric to the earth we are let it be said again in the grasp of realism and realism but imperfectly understood just our drama aims to reproduce exactly room upon the stage and to set actors to talking therein the exact speech of every day so our oratory is the reproduction of conversation and our novels when they are worthy of consideration are reproductions of patiently accumulated details set forth in impatiently assembled sentences but all this does not of necessity constitute realism because its effect is not of necessity the creation of illusion however truthful the artist purpose of what avail in the drama example are solid rooms and conversational vernacular if the characters not come to life in our imaginations so that we share their joys and sorrows of what effect are the realistic details of novel whether of incident or language if we not its story we read surely the answer is plain and therefore any literary devices which heighten the mood us are perfectly justifiable weapons of the realist even they are of the romanti cist one of these devices is consciously wrought prose the present we plead its employment on higher ground than this of practical expediency but how you may ask not you dear reader who understand but some other chap poor dog of an author perhaps consciously wrought prose aid in the creation of illusion how can it be more than pretty the project gutenberg ebook of atlantic classics https us turn answer to sir thomas browne to garden of cyrus to the closing numbers hippocrates hath spoke so little and the oneirocritical masters have left such frigid interpretations from plants that there is little encouragement to dream of paradise itself nor will the sweetest delight of gardens afford much comfort in sleep wherein the dulness of that sense shakes hands with delectable odours and though in the bed of cleopatra can hardly with any delight raise up the ghost of rose that is archaic perhaps and not without certain taint of quaintness to modern ears but how drowsy it is how minor its harmonies how subtly soothing its languid melody it tells surely in what manner consciously wrought prose may aid in the creation of illusion the mood of sleep was here to be evoked and lo it comes from the very music of the sentences from the drowsy lullaby of selected syllables we might choose quite different example from seemingly most unlikely source from the plays of geor ge bernard shaw one hardly thinks of shaw with style but rather with stiletto his prefaces have been too disputative his plays too epigrammatic the cultivation of prose rhythms yet his prose is almost never without certain crisp accuracy of conversational cadence his ear almost never betrays him into sloppiness and when the occasion demands his style can rise to meet it the truth is shaw is seldom emotional so that his crisp accuracy of speech is most often the fitting garment his thought but in john bull other island his emotions are stirred and when larry doyle breaks out into an impassioned description of ireland the effect on the imagination of the heightened prose when good actor speaks it is almost startling the climate is different here if the life is dull you can be dull too and great harm done going off into passionate dream but your wits ca thicken in that soft moist air on those white springy roads in those misty rushes and brown bogs on those hillsides of granite rocks and magenta heather you such colors in the sky such lure in the distances such sadness in the evenings oh the dreaming the dreaming the torturing never dreaming dreaming dreaming dreaming savagely debauchery that ever coarsened and brutalized an englishman can take the worth and usefulness out of him like that dreaming an irishman imagination never lets him alone never convinces him never satisfies him but it makes him so that he ca face reality nor deal with it nor handle it nor conquer it he can only sneer at them that and bitterly at broadbent be agreeable to strangers like woman on the streets this to be sure is prose to be spoken not prose to be read different laws prevail different effects are sought but the principle of cadence calculated to fit the mood and by its melodic or here its percussive character to heighten the emotional appeal remains the same but beyond the argument cadenced prose an aid to illusion employed in the proper places is where intensity of imagery or feeling can benefit by it the higher plea sheer lingual beauty its own sake shall realism preclude all other effects of artistic creation because the men on our streets the women in our homes talk sloppily shall all our books be written in their idiom all our stage characters reproduce their commonplaceness nearl y all our magazines and newspapers give attention to the graces of style i am pleading newman of the news story nor am i seeking to arm our with the pen of sir thomas browne i would not send walter pater to report footba ll game though stevenson could doubtless improve on most of the editors nor ask that emerson write our editorials but there is poor way and there is fine way to write everything and inevitably the man who has an ear the rhythms of prose who has been trained and encouraged to write his very best will fit his style appropriately to his subject he will not seek to cadence his sentences in bald narration or in exposition but he will nevertheless keep them capable of natural and pleasant phrasing he will avoid monotony jarring syllables false stress and ugly or tripping terminations which throw the voice one feet are thrown by an unseen obstacle in the path his paragraphs too will group naturally falls his thought but when the subject he has in hand rises to invective to exhortation to the dignity of any passion or the sweep of any vision then if his ear be tuned and his courage does not fail him he must inevitably write in cadenced periods the effectiveness of his work depending on the adjustment of these cadences to the mood of the moment on his skill an artist in prose and just now the courage of our young men fails the unrestrained abandonment of all art to realism of every sort of printed page to bald colloquialism has dulled the natural ear in all of us comely prose and made us deaf to more stately measures the complete democratizing of literature has put the fear of plebeian ridicule in our hearts and the wider magazine circulation it would seem the more harm it does to english prose because in direct ratio to its sale are its pages given over to the philistines and the dignity and refinement of thought which could stimulate dignity and refinement of expression are unknown to its contributors or kept carefully the project gutenberg ebook of atlantic classics https have often fancied in penitential moments day of judgment us who write when we shall stand in flushed array before the ultimate critic and answer the awful question have you done with your language there shall be searchings of soul that morning and searchings of forgotten pages of magazines and sellers and books of every sort the cadence that may bring salvatio but many shall seek and few shall find and the goats shall be sorted out in droves condemned to an eternity of torture none other than the everlasting task of listening to their own prose read aloud have you done with your language it is solemn question all of us you who speak well us who write our language is priceless heritage it has been the ladder of life up which we climbed with it we have bridged the sundering flood that forever rolls between man and man through its aid have come to us the treasures of the past the world store of experience by means of it our poets have wrought their measures our philosophers their dreams bit by bit precious mosaic after precious mosaic the great body of english literature has been built up in verse and prose the crown of that division of language we call our own consciously finding itself three centuries ago our english prose blossomed at once into the solemn splendors of the king james bible and then into the ornate magnificence of sir thomas browne never again till our day to lose consciousness of its power to forget its high and holy task the task of maintaining our language at full tide and ministering to style and beauty there were fluxes in the fashions naturally little of browne music being found in the almost conversational fluency but not laxness of addison even the suave addison himself has vanished in the tempestuous torrents of carlyle but there always was an addison carlyle newman walter pater whose work loomed large in popular regard whose influence was mighty in shaping taste prose style who now we may ask looking around us in america looms large in popular regard writer of ample vision amply and beautifully clothed in speech and whose influence is mighty in shaping taste prose style it is not enough to have the worthies of the past upon our shelves each age must have its own inspiration again we hear the solemn question have you done with your language only ireland may answer have our geor ge moore and we had our synge not long we stoned his plays we have stifled our language we have debased it we have been afraid of it but some day it will reassert itself it is stronger than we alike our overlord and avatar deep in the soul of man dwells the lyric impulse and when his song can not be the song of the poet it will shape itself in rhythmic prose that it may still be cadenced and modulated to change with the changing thought and sound an obligato to the moods of the author spirit how wonderful has been our prose and chastely rich when hooker wrote it striding triumphant over the pages of gibbon on tireless feet ringing like trumpet from emerson white house in concord modulated like soft heard afar in newman lyric moods clanging and clamorous in carlyle in walter pater but the soft fall of water in marble fountain while exquisite odors flood the roman twilight and late bees are murmurous little of all perhaps in stevenson we too we little fellows of could write they wrote consciously rhythmically if we only cared if we only dared we ask the opportunity the encouragement alas that also means more liberal choice of graver subjects and more extensive employm ent of the essay form milton could hardly have been miltonic on lesser theme than the fall of the angels and walter pater wrote of the mona lisa not lizzie smith of davenport iowa it is doubtless of interest to learn about lizzie but she hardly inspires us to rhythmic prose in the chair by ralph the project gutenberg ebook of atlantic classics https bout once in so often man must go to the barber what with contemptuous brevity is called haircut he must sit in big chair voluminous bib prettily decorated with polka dots tucked in round his neck and let another human being cut his hair him his head with all its internal mystery and wealth of thought becomes the time being mere poll worth two dollars year to the an irregularly shaped object between summer squas h and canteloupe with too much hair on it very likely several friends and acquaintances have advised him his identity vanishes rule the less he now says or thinks about his head the better he has given it to the barber and the barber will he pleases with it it is only when the man is little and is brought in by his mother that the job will be done according to instructions and this is because the man mother is in position to see the back of his head also because the weakest woman under such circumstances has strong convictions when the man is older the barber will sometimes allow him to see the haircut cleverly reflected in two mirrors but not one man in in ten dare express himself dissatisfied after all what does he know of haircuts he who is barber women feel differently and i know of one man returning home with new haircut who was compelled to turn round again and take what his wife called his head to another barber by whom the haircut was more happily finished but that was exceptional and it happened to that man but once the very word is objectionable it snips like the scissors yet it describes the operation more honestly than the substitute euphemism indicating jaunty habit of dropping in frequently at the barber and so keeping the hair perpetually at just the length that is most becoming most men although the knowledge must be gathe red by keen patient observation and never by honest confession there is period lasting about week when the length of their hair is admirable but it comes between haircuts the haircut itself is never satisfactory if his hair was too long before and on this point he has the evidence of unprejudiced witnesses it is too short now it must grow on it that brief period it is right æsthetically suited to the contour of his face and the cut of his features and beginning already imperceptibly to grow too long again soon this growth becomes visible and the man begins to worry i must go to the barber he says in harassed way i must get haircut but the days pass it is always and and morrow when he goes he goes suddenly there is something within us probably our immortal soul that postpones haircut and yet in the end our immortal souls have little to with the actual process it is impossible to conceive of one immortal soul cutting another immortal soul hair my own soul i am sure has never entered barber shop it stops and waits at the portal probably it converses on subjects remote from our bodily consciousness with the immortal souls of barbers patiently waiting until the barbers finish their morning work and come out to lunch even during the haircut our hair is still growing never stopping never at rest never in hurry it grows while we sleep was proved by rip van winkle and yet perhaps sometimes it is in hurry perhaps that is why it falls out in rare cases the contagion of speed spreads the last hair hurries after all the others the man is emancipated from dependence on barbers i know barber who is in this independent condition himself the barber can more cut his own hair than the rest of us and yet sells his customers preparation warranted to keep them from attaining it seeming anomaly which can be explained only on the ground that business is business to escape the haircut one must be quite without hair that one can not see and reach and herein possibly is the reason fashion which has often perplexed students of the norman conquest the norman soldiery wore hair on the backs of their heads and each brave fellow could sit down in front of his polished shield and cut his own hair without much trouble but the scheme had weakness the back of the head had to be shaven and the fashion doubtless went out because after all nothing was gained by it one simply turned over on one face in the barber chair instead of sitting up straight fortunately we begin having haircut when we are too young to think and when also the process is sugar by the knowledge that we are losing our curls then habit accustoms us to it yet it is significant that men of refinement seek the barber in secluded places basements of hotels choice where they can be seen only by barbers and by other refined men having or about to have haircuts and that men of less refinement submit to the operation where every passer can stare in and see them bibs round their necks and their shorn locks lying in pathetic little heaps on the floor there is barber shop of this kind in boston where one of the barbers having head to play with plays on cornet doubtless to the further distress of his immortal soul peeping in through the window but this is unusual even in the city that is known far and wide the home of the boston symphony the project gutenberg ebook of atlantic classics https remember was the only one available in small cut my left ear the deed distressed him and he told story it was pretty little cut he it with reminded him of another gentleman whose left ear he had nipped in identically the same place he had done his best with alum and apology he was now doing two months later the gentleman came in again by golly said the barber with kind of wonder at his own cleverness i did nip him again in just the same place man can shave himself the armless wonder does it in the dime museum byron did it and composed poetry during the operation although i have recently seen scientifically explained the facility of composition was not due to the act of shaving but to the normal activity of the human mind at that time in the morning here therefore man can refuse the offices of the barber if he wishes to make one of dozen apparently inanimate figures their faces covered with soap and their noses used convenient handles to turn first one cheek and then the is his own lookout but human ingenuity has yet to invent barber shears it has tried near genius once made an appara kind of helmet with multitudinous little scissors inside he hopefully believed would solve the problem but what became of him and his invention i have not heard perhaps he tried it himself and slunk defeated into deeper obscurity perhaps he committed suicide one can easily imagine that man who thought he had found way to cut his own hair and then found that he had would be thrown into suicidal depression there is the possibility that he succeeded in cutting his own hair and was immediately away where nobody could see him but the hardened attendants by his sensitive family the important fact is that the invention never got on the market until some other investigator succeeds to more practical purpose the rest of us must go periodically to the barber we must put on the here however there is at least an oppo rtunity of selection there are bibs with arms and bibs without arms and there is certain amount of satisfaction in being able to see our own hands carefully holding the newspaper or periodical wherewith we pretend that we are still intelligent human beings and here again are distinctions the patrons of my own favored barber shop have arms to their bibs and pretend to be deeply interested in the illustrated london news the patrons of the barber shop where i lost part of my can not see the place but those whom i take into my confidence tell that it has long since grown sleeves to their bibs but nevertheless managed awkwardly to hold the police gazette and this opportunity to hold the police gazette without attracting attention becomes pleasant feature of this type of barber shop i example found it my ear was forget my position in the examination of this journal than in the examination of the illustrated london news the pictures strictly speaking are not so good either artistically or morally but there is tang about them an what and it is always wisest to focus attention on some such extraneous interest otherwise you may get to looking in the mirror not that one thing there is the impulse to cry out stop cut it all of f barber spare that hair leave some upon my brow months it sheltered and i protect it now please these exclamations annoy barber rouse demon of fury in him he reaches machine called tell him how to cut hair will you little more and he shave your and not only either like the norman soldiery at the time of the conqu est even if you are able to restrain this impulse clenching your bib in your hands and perhaps dropping or tearing the illustrated london news the mirror gives you strange morbid reflections you recognize your face but your head seems somehow separate balanced on kind of mountain with two hands holding the illustrated london news you are afraid momentarily that the barber will lift it off and go away with it then is the time to read furiously the weekly contribution of chesterton but your mind reverts to story you have been reading about how the tulululu islanders savage but ingenious people preserve the heads of their enemies so that the faces are much smaller but otherwise quite recognizable you find yourself looking keenly at the barber to discover any possible trace of tulululu ancestry and what is he going to get now krees is he going to paint you and if color the question of color becomes strangely important if it made any real difference green red purple blue he uses the brush dry tickling your forehead tickling your ears tickling your nose tickling you under the chin and down the back of your neck after the serious business of the

leaps to his feet anxious to give his head to the barber boy hastily sweeps up the hair that was remote from you if it had belonged to the man who is always waiting and whose name is next oh it is the passing of indoors by zephine humphrey indoors is going we may just well make up our minds on this revolutionary point and accept it with such degree of hardy rejoicing or shivering regret our natures prompt in us the movement has been long under way gradually working the perfect ejection which seems now at hand we might have recognized the dislodging process long ago had we been enough it began shall say when it did begin surely not in the shaggy breasts of those rude ancestors of ours whom we hold in such veneration and to whose ways we seem to ourselves to be so wisely returning they dragged their venison into the depths of cave darker and closer than any house and devoured it in great seclusion perhaps it began in the san marco piazza at venice with the little tables under the colonnades so delightful so charming thus the tourists they sipped their coffee and dallied with their ices they were right it was delightful and charming and so it is to this day but it was perhaps the thin edge of the wedge which is turning us all out now supper was the first regular meal to follow the suggestion country supper on the piazza in the warm summer evening that also was delightful of course and not at all alarming all nations and ages have practiced the sport of occasional festive repasts out of doors when the weather has permitted but breakfast was not long in following suit and when dinner that most conservative conventional of meals succumbed to the outward pressure and spread its congealing gravies in the chilly air we were in the thing in good earnest the new custom was on longer matter of times and seasons the weather had nothing to with it now and in really zealous families the regular summer was out of doors summer sounds well since summer and warmth go together traditionally but not always actually in new england where bleak rains overtake the world now and then and clearing west winds come racing keenly it was soon essential to introduce new fashion in dinner garments overcoats sweaters and heavy shawls felt hats and muf flers while i run upstairs to get pair of mittens your soup first dear it will be quite cold if you leave it the adherents of the new doctrine are very conscientious and faithful was only to be expected we are valiant race in the matter of our enthusiasms and can be trusted to follow them sturdily buckling on armor or overcoats or whatever other special equipment the occasion demands conscientiousness is good trait but there is perhaps more of the joy of life in some other qualities sleeping outdoors was the next great phase in the movement that also began casually enough and altogether charmingly one lingered in the hammock watching the stars musing in the still summer night until lo there was the dawn beginning behind the eastern hills wonderful experience not much sleeping about it truly is commonly not much sleeping about great experiences so the project gutenberg ebook of atlantic classics https the heart said to why not have this always why not sleep outdoors every night which is of course exactly the way in which human nature works very reasonable very sane and convincing but unfortunately never quite so successful it should be that which has blessed us once must be secured in perpetuity our souls to feast on continually revelation must fold its wings and abide with us so we soberly go to work and strip all the poetry of divine chance all the delight of the unexpected from our great occasions by laying plans their systematic recurrence he who bends to himself joy does the winged life destroy but he who kisses joy it flies lives in eternity sunrise it is pity that william blake could not teach us that once all matter of fact of course great occasions care nothing at all our urging and plan is an institution which they cordially abhor the stars and the dawn not condescend to such paraphernalia waylaying them rubber blankets air and mosquito netting with stout club close at hand in case of tramps or skunk one experience of my own recurs to my memory poignantly here and i think i can not better than set it forth i had passed an unfor gettable night all alone in meadow detained by the evening almost insensibly into midnight tingling silences and thence into the auste re dawn it was an episode such should have sealed my lips forev er but i profanely spoke of it and at once the contagion of interest spread through the little village fun did you have your rubbers on did you sit in chair i should think you would have sat in much more comfortable well i tell you what let it together lot of us so we wo be afraid let climb mountain the sunset and dawn will be beautiful from mountain we did it i blush to confess that some of us did it it was an excursion planned and discussed matter of two weeks full moon being part of the programme and there was accident unforeseen event unprovided the procession that wended its way toiling and puffing up the ascent of haystack favored mountain selected the high pedestal of our rapture the auspicious night was about sad and withal funny an affront the secrecy of beauty ever received blankets steamer rugs pillows shawls hammocks we groaned beneath the burden of all these things we lost the way of course and had to beat the woods in every direction we were tired and hot perhaps but we knew what our rôle was and when we reached the top of the mountain we all of us stood very solemnly in row and said beautiful it was beautiful that was just the finen ess of the night triumph over at least i can not speak the other to this day be it said in parentheses whenever we mention that night on haystack we lift our eyes in ecstasy and one of us has ever confessed any sense of lack but honestly honestly at the last dear stalwart relief of honesty that experiment was beautiful that the spirit should have been lifted out of the body and would have been had it stood alone had it not already exhausted itself in plans and expectations beneath us sea of misty rolling hills all vague and blended in the light of the soaring moon above us such sweep of sky only command around us silence silence yet the unstrenuous orchard at home with its tranquil acceptance of such degree of sunset light was granted to it and of the moon presence when she rose above the apple trees would have conveyed the night message thousand times more clearly it is seldom worth while to describe any failure of the spirit very minutely and tragedy is not the tone this paper would assume but one slight episode of the dawn following that fatal night must be related we were gathered on the eastern edge of our mountain top tousled gray disheveled lot and weary does the reader understand the significance of the term prevent the dawn he does if he has stood and waited the sun to the moon or any of the constellations that matter all heavenly bodies retard their progress through the influence of being waited now dozen times we warned one another there with our faces toward the quickening east yet glittering lambent rim slid up to greet our eyes at last decent comely cloud came to the rescue of the sun halting and embarrassed and settled snugly all about the mountain of the into this the sun was born so obscurely that it rode high above the mountain edge shorn and dull rubber ball before we discovered it some one began stammering and then there was dramatic pause brave and determined though we were in our pursuit of ecstasy we could not burst forth into song like memnon statues at the sight of that belated orange the lord sun not at all it was the merest varlet in this dilemma of our hearts funny little wailing cry came from the cliff edge i want my money back i want my money back it was perfect commentary on the project gutenberg ebook of atlantic classics https situation fine and humorous and true an utterance could be asked on the foiled occasion we laughed at it and all the air was straightway clearer us then down the we trooped and went home to bed of course i am not unaware of the impatience of some readers if they have taken pains to scan so far this earnest exposition the outdoor movement is not one primarily of sentiment but of health and happiness and the story just related is aside from the point that may be true i certainly stand in respect of the great claims of the physical side of the subjec t and would not deal with them by all means let all people be well possible but it is still the other side the side of sentiment and rapture which is most pleadingly often brought home to it is pitiful how helpless we are against the invasions of new enthusiasm like sober conservative folk i still sleep in my bed in my room but the satisfaction i used to take in the innocent practice is broken of late by haunting fears that i may not be able to keep it up my friends will not let alone all things why you sleep out here on this little upper piazza precisely the

piazza has roof but what would cold bath be if not distinctly so much to the good in view of the toilet operations of the following morning there is course left but that final one should in honesty have come first damning myself by the hopeless assertion i want to sleep out of doors this locks the argument and the barrier stands complete shutting off in world by myself interrupting the genial flow of sympathetic friendship but i love my friends therefore it follows that i tremble my further repose in my bed i fear i shall yet utter midnight sighs on that piazza floor indoors dear indoors i would i might plead its cause little here does one ever pause to reflect that there was never any outdoors at all until indoors was created the two had simultaneous birth but it was an appurtenance of the latter that marked the distinction and gave the names little humiliating that might have seemed to any creatures less generous than woods and have been here really from the beginning ages and ages in glorious life and then to take their first generic name find their first classification all of them in lump together what lump the other side of fragile barrier to mushroom construction one wonders that those who exalt the outdoors everything nowadays not find some better title it than its dooryard term but those who love the indoors too though they may smile at the calm presumption of its dubbing the universe accept the conclusion without any question man is after all the creature of creatures and his life is of first importance we not hear that the woodchuck speaks of or the bird of

the pictures on the walls or more happily how serene and reposeful or how matter morbid and passionate flippant austere boisterous decorous everything room may be which human creature may be and that
