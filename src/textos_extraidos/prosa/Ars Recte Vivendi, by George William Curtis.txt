of fered to the public contents pref ace extra vagance at college brains and bra wn hazing the soul of the gentleman thea tre manners woman dress secret societies tobacco and heal th tobacco and manners duelling newsp aper ethics extra vagance at college young sardanapalus recently remarked that the only trouble with his life in college was that the societies and clubs the boating and balling and music and acting and social occupations of many kinds left him time study he had the best disposition to treat the faculty fairly and to devote proper attention to various branches of learning and he was sincerely sorry that his other college engagements made it quite impossible before coming to college he thoug ht that it might be practicable to mingle little latin and greek and possibly touch of history and mathematics with the more pressing duties of college life but unless you could put more hours into the day or more days into the week he really did not see how it could be done it was the life of sardanapalus in college which was the text of some sober speeches at commencement dinners during the summer and of many excellent articles in the newspapers they all expressed feeling which has been growing very rapidly and becoming very strong among old graduates that college is now very different place from the college which they remembered and that young men now spend in college year what young men in college formerly thought would be very handsome sum them to spend annually when they were established in the world if ars recte vivendi by george william curtis https should chance to recall little book of reminiscences by tomes which was published few years ago he will have vivid picture of the life of forty and more years ago at small new england college and the similar records of other colleges at that time show how it was possible poor clergyman starving upon meagre salary to send son after son to college the collegian lived in plain room and upon very plain fare he had extras and the decorative expense of sardanapalus was unknown in the vacations he taught school or worked upon the farm he knew that his father had paid by his own hard work every dollar that he spent and the relaxation of the sense of the duty of economy which always accompanies great riches had not yet begun sixty years ago the number of americans who did not feel that they must live by their own labor was so small that it was not class but there is now class of rich men sons the average rate of living at college differs one of the newspapers in discus sing the question said that in most of the new england colleges steady and sturdy young man need not spend more than six hundred dollars during the four years this is obviously too low an estimate another thinks that the average rate at harvard is probably from six hundred to ten hundred year another computes fair liberal average in the smaller new england colleges to be from to hundred dollars the four years and the last class at williams is reported to have ranged from an average of six hundred and ﬁfty dollars in the ﬁrst year to seven hundred and eight dollars in the senior but the trouble lies in sardanapalus the mischief that he does is quite disproportioned to the number of him in class of one hundred the number of rich youth may be very small but college class is an american community in which every member is necessarily strongly af fected by all social inﬂuences few fellows living in princely extravagance in superbly furnished rooms with every device of luxury entertaining profusely elected into all the desirable clubs and societies conforming to another taste and another fashion than that of the college form class which is separate and exclusive and which looks down on those who can not enter the charmed circle this is galling to the pride of the young man who can not compete the sense of the inequality is constantly refreshed he may indeed attend closely to his studies he may scorn delights and live laborious days he may hug his threadbare coat and gloat over his unrugged ﬂoor the ﬁtting circumstance of plain living and high thinking it is always open to character and intellect to perceive and to assert their essential superiority why should socrates heed sardanapalus why indeed but the average young man at college is not an ascetic nor devotee nor an absorbed student unmind ful of cold and heat and disdainful of elegance and ease and the nameless magic of social accomplishment and grace he is youth peculiarly susceptible to the very inﬂuence that sardanapalus typiﬁes and the wise parent will hesitate before sending his son to sybaris rather than to sparta when the presence of sardanapalus at harvard was criticised dangerous and lamentable the president promptly denied that the youth abounded at the university or that his inﬂuence was spread he was there undoubtedly and he sometimes misused his riches but he had not established standard and he had not affected the life of the university whose moral character could be favorably compared with that of any college but even if the case were worse it is not evident that remedy is at hand the president suggested there are two kinds of rich youth at college there are the sons of those who have been always accustomed to riches and who are generally neither vulgar nor extravagant neither ostentatious nor profuse and the sons of the new rich who are like men drunk with new wine and who act accordingly the new rich parent will naturally send his son to harvard because it is the oldest of our colleges and of great renown and because he supposes that through his college associations his son may pave path with gold into society harvard on her part opens her doors upon the same conditions to rich and poor and gives her instruction equally and requires only obedience to her rules of order and discipline if sardanapalus fails in his examination he will be dropped and that he is sardanapalus will not save him if his revels disturb the college peace he will be warned and dismissed all that can be asked of the college is that it shall grant grace to the golden youth in the hope of endowment from his father and that it shall keep its own peace this last condition includes more than keeping technical order to remove cause in the civil service really means not only to remove penal offence but habits and methods that destroy discipline and efﬁciency so to keep the peace in college means to remove the necessary causes of disturbance and disorder if young sardanapalus by his extravagance and riotous profusion and dissipation constantly thwarts the essential purpose of the college demoralizing the students and obstructing the peaceful course of its instruction he ought to be dismissed the college must ars recte vivendi by george william curtis https conditions under which its work may be most properly and efﬁciently accomplished and to achieve its purpose it may justly limit the liberty of its students the solution of the difﬁculty lies more in the power of the students than of the college if the young men who are the natural social leaders make simplicity the unwritten law of college social life young sardanapalus will spend his money and heap up luxury in vain the simplicity and good sense of wealth will conquer its ostentation and reckless waste october 1886 brains and bra wn it is towards the end of june and in the ﬁrst days of july that the great colleg aquatic contests occur and it is about that time the soldiers at monmouth knew in 1778 that sirius is lord of the ascendant this year it was the hottest day of the summer marked by the mercury in new york when the harvard and yale men drew out at new london their race fifty years ago the crowd at commencement ﬁlled the town green and streets and the in which the graduating class were the heroes of the hour the valedictorian the salutatorian the philosophical orator walked on air and the halo of of many kinds was not brighter or more intoxicating than the brief glory of the moment on which they took the graduating stage under the beaming eyes of maiden beauty and the profound admiration of college comrades willis phil slingsby has told the story of that college life ﬁfty and sixty years ago the collegian danced and drove and ﬂirted and dined and sang the night away robert tomes echoed the strain in his tale of college life little later under stricter social and ecclesiastical conditions there was more serious vein also in 1827 the kappa alpha society was the ﬁrst of the younger brood of the greek of the phi beta kappa of in 1832 father eells he is affectionately called founded alpha delta phi brotherhood based upon other aims and sympathies than those of philip slingsby but one which appealed instantly to clever men in college and has not ceased to attract them to this happy hour the easy chair has just now commemorated but neither in the sketches of slingsby nor in the memories of those commenc ement triumphs is there any record of an absorbing and universal and overpowering enthusiasm such attends the modern college the race of this year between the two great new england universities harvard and crimson and the twilight contest says the careful chronicler did not occur until seven at six he describes the coming of the grand armada and the expectant scene in these words the block island came down from norwich with every square foot of her three decks occupied the elm city brought mass of yale sympathizers from new haven and the big city of new york ﬁlled her long with new london spectators special train of eighteen cars came up from new haven blue ﬂag ﬂuttering from every window the striking contrast to the life and bustle of the lower end of the course was the quiet river at the the college launches the huge tug america the manhasset loaded with correspondents the tug burnside swathed in crimson by her charter party of harvard men and the

special train of eighteen cars or long train of vast enthusiastic multitude ever arrive at any college upon any commencement day in philip slingsby time to greet with prolonged roars of cheers and frenzied excitement the surpassing eloquence of salutatorian smith or the melting pathos of valedictorian jones did so we read in the veracious history of day the newspape ever college town resound with perfect babel of noises from eight in the summer eveni ng until three in the summer morning the town lighted with burning and blazing with ﬁreworks the ars recte vivendi by george william curtis https and ten thousand people hastening to the illuminated station to receive the victors in triumph brown had vanquished the calculus or jones discovered comet or robinson translated the daily gong and gas blower into the purest choctaw in word was such tumult of acclamation the president himself swinging his reverend hat and the illustrious alumni far and near when the glad tidings were told beaming with joyful complacency like pickwick going down the slide while samivel weller adjur ed him and the company to keep the pot produced by any scholastic performance or success or triumph whatever echo undoubtedly answers and she asks also whether in such competition when the appeal is to youth eager strong combative full of physical impulse and prowess in the time of romantic enjoyment and heroic susceptibility study is not heavily handicapped and books at sorry disadvantage with boats this is what echo distinctly inquiries and what answ er shall be made to echo who is the real hero to young slingsby who has just ﬁtted himself to enter victor in the or the noblest scholar of them all the answer seems to be given unconsciously in the statement that the number of students applying entrance is notably larger when the college has scored an athletic victory but this answer is not wholly satisfactory there may be an observable coincidence but young men usually prepare themselves to enter particular college and not await the result of but the fact remains that the true colleg hero of is the victor in games and sports not in studies and it is not unnatural that it should be so it is partly reaction of feeling against the old notion that scholar is an invalid and that boy must be down in his muscle because he is up in his mathematics but lincoln said in his debate with douglas it does not follow because i think that innocent men should have equal rights that i wish my daughter to marry negro it does not follow because the sound mind should be lodged in sound body that the care of the body should become the main and virtually the exclusive interest yet that this is now somewhat the preva iling tendency of average feeling is undeniable and it is tendency to be considered by intelligent collegians themselves the true academic prizes are spiritual not material and the heroes college emulation are not the gladiators but the sages and poets of the ancient day and of all time the men that the college remembers and cherishes are not and and and boxers and fencers and heroes of good fellows they are but the patriots and scholars and poets and orators and philosophers three cheers brawn but three times three brain september 1887 hazing if bell had rung and the venerable dormitories and halls upon the green were pouring forth crowd of youth loitering towards the the easy chair like college professor meditating serious themes and with grave purpose steps to the it begins by asking the young gentlemen who have loitered into the room and are now seated what they think of bullying boys and hunting cats and tying kettles to dog tail and seating comrade upon tacks with the point upward undoubtedly they reply with digniﬁed nonchalance that it is all child play and contemptible undoubtedly young gentlemen answers the professor and to multiply nathan remark to david you are the men american youth you cherish wrathful scorn the english boy who makes another boy his fag and you express sneering pity the boy who consents to fag you have read birch and his young friends and you would like to break the head of master hewlett who shies his shoe at the poor shivering craven nightingale and you justly remark that close observation of john bull seems to warrant the conclusion that the nature of his bovine ancestor is still far from ars recte vivendi by george william curtis https his descendant and what is the secret of your feeling simply that you hate bullying why then young gentlemen you bully you retort perhaps that fagging is unknown in america and that youth would not tolerate it but permit the professor to tell you what is not unknown in america crowd of older young gentlemen surrounding one younger fellow forcing him to disagreeable and disgusting things pouring cold water down his back making fool of him to his perso nal injury he being solitary helpless and this is not unknown in america young gentlemen but it is all very different from what we have been accustomed to consider american if we would morally deﬁne or paraphrase the word america i think we should say that is what it means that is what the brownist puritans the precursors of the plymouth pilgrims left england to secure they did not bring it indeed at least in all its fulness across the sea let us say young gentlemen that its potentiality its possibility rather than its actuality stepped out of the mayﬂower upon plymouth rock but from the moment of its landin g it has been asserting itself you need not say baptist and quaker i understand it and allow it all but has prevailed over ecclesiastical hatred and over personal slavery and what are called the new power monopoly capital and only new forms of the old ef fort to secure fair now the petty bullying of hazing and the whole system of college tyranny is most contemptible denial of it is disgrace to the american name and when you stop in the wretched business to sneer at english fagging you merely advertise the beam in your own eyes it is not possible surely that any honorable young gentleman now attending to the lecture of the professor really supposes that there is any fun or humor or joke in this form of college bullying turn to your evelina and see what was accounted humorous what passed practical joking in miss burney time at the end of the last century it is not difﬁcult to imagine johnson who greatly delighted in evelina supposing the intentional upsetting into the ditch of the old french lady in the carriage to be joke man who unconsciously has made so much fun others the great lexicographer johnson seems to have been curiously devoid of sense of humor but he was genuine englishman of his time true john bull and the fun of the john bull of that time recorded in the novels and traditions was entirely bovine the bovine or brutal quality is by means wholly worked out of the blood even yet the taste pugilism or the pummelling of the human frame into jelly by the force of ﬁsticuf fs form of enjoyment or entertainment is relapse into barbarism it is the instinct of the tiger still surviving in the white cat transformed into the princess i will not call it young gentleme n the fond return of melusina to the gambols of the mermaid or undine momentary unconsciousness of soul because these are poetic and pathetic suggestions the is disgusting and inhuman but at least it is voluntary encounter of two individuals but college bullying is unredeemed brutality it is the extinction of jekyll in hyde it is not humorous nor manly nor generous nor decent it is bald and vulgar cruelty and class in college should feel itself worthy of the respect of others or respect itself until it has searched out all offenders of this kind who disgrace it and banished them to the remotest coventry the meanest and most cowardly fellows in college may shine most in hazing the generous and manly men despise it there are noble and inspiring ways working off the high spirits of youth games which are rich in poetic tradition athletic exercises which mould the young apollo to drive young fellow upon the thin ice throu gh which he breaks and by the icy submersion becomes at last cripple helpless with inﬂammato ry young man in his senses thinks this to be funny or anything but an unspeakable outrage or to overwhelm with terror comrade of sensitive temperament until his mind of satan might delight in such revel but young americans young gentlemen never the hazers in college are the men who have been bred upon dime novels and the spirit at least if not in whom the training and instincts of the gentlema n are unknown that word is one of the most precious among english words the man who is justly entitled to it wears diamond of the purest lustre tennyson in sweeping the whole range of tender praise his dead friend arthur hallam says that he bore without abuse the grand old name of gentleman without abuse is the wise qualiﬁcation the name may be foully abused i read in the morning paper young gentlemen pitiful story of woman trying to throw herself from the bridge you may recall one like it in hood bridge of sighs the report was headed to hide her shame her shame why gentlemen at that very moment in bright and bewildering rooms the arms of lothario and lovelace were encircling your sisters waists in the intoxicating waltz these men go unwhipped ars recte vivendi by george william curtis https epithet they are even enticed and ﬂattered by the mothers of the girls but all that they not bear without abuse the name of gentleman and sidney and bayard and hallam would scorn their profanation and betrayal of the name the soul of the gentleman what is it is it anything but kindly and thoughtful respect others helping the helpless succoring the needy befriending the friendless and forlorn doing justice requiring and withstanding with every honorable means the bully of the church and caucus of the the street the college respect young gentlemen like charity begins at home only the man who respects himself can be gentleman and gentleman will willingly annoy torment or injure another there will be further recitation today the class is dismissed march 1888 the soul of the gentleman to ﬁnd satisfactory deﬁnition of gentleman is difﬁcult to discover the philosopher stone and yet if we may not say just what gentleman is we can certainly say what he is not we may afﬁrm indisputably that man however rich and of however ﬁne title in countries where rank is acknowledged if he behave selﬁshly coarsely and indecently is not gentleman from which young gentlemen it follows the good professor used to say at college he emer ged from hopeless labyrinth of postulates and preliminaries an hour long that the guests who abused the courtesy of their hosts upon the late transcontinental trip to drive the golden spike may have been persons of social eminence but were in honorable sense gentlemen it is undoubtedly difﬁcult word to manage but gentlemanly conduct and ungentlemanly conduct are expressions which are perfectly intelligible and that fact shows that there is distinct standard in every intelligent mind by which behavior is measured to say that man was born gentleman means not at all that he is courteous reﬁned and intelligent but only that he was born of family whose circumstances at some time had been easy and agreeable and which belonged to traditionally good society but such man may be false and mean and ignorant and coarse is he gentleman because he was born such on the other hand the child of long generations of ignorant and laborious boors may be humane honorable and modest but with total ignorance of the usages of good society he may be upright washington unselﬁsh sidney brave bayard modest falkland but he may also outrage all the little social proprieties is he gentleman because he is honest and modest and humane in describing lovelace should we not say that he was gentleman should we naturally say so of burns but again is it not joke to describe geor ge iv gentleman while it would be impossible to deny the name to major dobbin the catch however is simple using the same word we interchange its different meanings to say that man is born gentleman is to say that he was born under certain social conditions to say in commendation or description of man that he is gentleman or gentlemanly is to say that he has certain qualities of character or manner which are wholly independent of the circumstances of his family or training in the latter case we speak of individual and personal qualities in the former we speak of external conditions in the one case we refer to the man himself in the other to certain circumstances around him the quality which is called gentlemanly is that which theoretically and often actually distinguishes the person who is born in certain social position it describes the manner in which such person ought to behave behavior however can be imitated therefore neither the fact of birth under certain conditions nor certain ease and grace and charm of manner certify the essential character of gentleman lovelace had the air and breeding of gentleman like don giovanni he was familiar with polite society he was reﬁned and pleasing and fascinating in manner even the severe astarte could not call him boor she does not know gentleman probably more gentlemanly than lovelace ars recte vivendi by george william curtis https then admit that she can not arbitrarily deny lovelace to be gentlem an because he is libertine or because he is false or mean or of coarse mind she may indeed insist that only upright and honorable men of reﬁned mind and manner are gentlemen and she may also maintain that only men of truly lofty and royal souls are princes but there will still remain crowds of immoral gentlemen and unworthy kings the persons who abused the generous courtesy of the northern paciﬁc trip were gentlemen in one sense and not in the other they were gentlemen so far they could not help themselves but they were not gentlemen in what depended upon their own will according to the story they did not even imitate the conduct of gentlemen and astarte must admit that they belonged to the large class of ungentlemanly gentlemen december 1883 thea tre manners an admirable actress said the other day that the audience in the theatre was probably little aware how much its conduct affected the performance listless whispering uneasy house makes distracted and ineffective play to an orator or an actor or an artist of any kind who appeals personally to the public nothing is so fatal indifference in the original wallack theatre many years ago the easy chair was one of party in during ﬁne performance of one of the plays in which the acting of the mana ger was most effective it was gay party and with the carelessness of youth it made merry while the play went on the box was directly upon the stage the merriment was gross discourtesy although unintentional both to the actors and to the audience and at last the old wallack still gayly playing his part moved towards the box and without turning his head in voice audible to the offenders but not to the rest of the audience politely reminded the thoughtless group that they were seriously disturbing the play there was some indignation in the box but the rebuke was courteous and richly deserve nothing is more unpardonable than such disturbance during this winter gentleman at one of the theatres commented severely upon the loud talking of party of ladies which prevented his enjoyment of the play and when the gentleman attending the ladies retorted warmly the disturbed gentleman resorted to the wild justice of blow there was an altercation publication in the newspapers and ﬁnally an apology and reconciliation but it is to be hoped that there was some good result from the incident waggish clergyman once saw pompous clerical brother march quite to the head of the aisle of crowded church to ﬁnd seat with an air of expectation that all would ﬂy open at his approach but every seat was full and nobody stirred the crestfallen brother was obliged to retrace his steps he retreated by the pew far down the aisle where the clerical wag was sitting that pleasant man leaned over the door and greeted his comrade with the sententious whisper may it be sanctiﬁed to you dear brother every man will wish the same blessing to the rebuke of the maids and youths in theatres and whose conversation however lively is not the entertainment which their neighbors have come to hear two or three winters ago the easy chai r applauded the conduct of thomas who at the head of his orchestra was interrupted in the midst of concert in washington by the entry of party which advanced towards the front of the hall with much chattering and rustling and seated themselves and continued the disturbance the orchestra was in full career but thomas rapped sharply upon his stand and brought the performance to an abrupt pause then turning to the audience he doubtless with evident and natural feeling i am afraid that the music interrupts the conversation the remark was greeted with warm and general applause and waiting until entire silence was restored the conductor raised his baton again and the performance ended without further ars recte vivendi by george william curtis https easy chair improved the occasion to preach short sermon upon bad manners in public places but to its great surprise it was severely rebuked some time afterward by cleopatra herself who said with some feeling that she had two reasons complaint the ﬁrst was that her ancient friend the easy chair should place her in the pillory of its public animadversion and the other was that the easy chair should gravely defend such conduct that of thomas remonstrance could be more surprising and nothing more unexpected than that cleopatra should differ in opinion upon such point to the personal aspect of the matter the easy chair could say only that it had never heard who the offenders were and that it declined to believe that cleopatra herself could ever be guilty of such conduct her majesty then explained that she was not guilty she was not of the party but it was composed of friends of hers who seated themselves near her and when the words of thomas concentrated the gaze of the audience upon the disturbers of the peace her majesty known to everybody was supposed to be the ringleader of the émeute the story at once ﬂew abroad upon the wings of those swift birds of she called washington correspondents and she was mentioned by name the chief of fender it was not difﬁcult to persuade the most placable of queens that the easy chair could not have intended personal censure but the chair could not agree that thomas conduct was unjustiﬁable cleopatra urged that the conductor of an orchestra at concert is not responsible the behavior of the audience an audience she said can take care of itself and it is an unwarrantable impertinence conductor to arrest the performance because he is irritated by noise of whispering voices or of slamming doors i saw you easy chair she said on the evening of rachel ﬁrst performance in this country what would you have thought if she had stopped short in the was corneille les horaces you she was anno yed by the rustling of the leaves of thousand books of the play which the audience turned over at the same moment the easy chair declined to step into the snare which was plainly set in its sight it would not accept an illustration an argument the enjoyment at concert it contended which the audience has paid in advance and to which it is entitled depends upon conditions of silence and order which it can not itself maintain without serious disturbance it may indeed cry hush and put him out but not only would that cry be of doubtful effect but experience proves that concert audience will not raise it if the audience were left to itself it would permit late arrivals and all the disturbance of chatter and movement to twist the line of goldsmith those who came to pray would be at the mercy of those who came to scoff and such mercy is merciless the conductor stands in loco parentis he is the advocatus angeli he does the audience what it would not itself he protects it against its own fatal he insists that it shall receive what it has paid and he will deal with disturbers they deserve the audience conscious of its own impotence recognizes at once its protector and gladly applauds him doing it what it has not the nerve to itself audience whose rights were defended thomas defended those of his washington audience ever resented the defence responded cleopatra briskly the same imbecility prevents very well then such an audience plainly needs strong and resolute leadership and that is precisely what thomas supplied crowd is always grateful to the man who will what everybody in the crowd feels ought to be done but what individual is quite ready to undertake when cleopatra said that an audience is quite competent to take care of itself her remark was natural she instinctively conceived the audience herself extended into thousand persons such an audience would certainly be capable of dispensing with any mentor or guide but when the easy chair asked her if she was annoyed by the chattering interruption which thomas rebuked she replied that of course she was annoyed yet when she was further asked if she cried hush or resorted to any means whatever to quell the disturbance the royal lady could not help smiling she answered i did not and the easy chair retorted y et an audience is capable of protecting itself meanwhile whatever the conductor or the audience may or may not nothing is more vulgar than audible conversation or any other kind of disturbance during concert sometimes it may be mere thoughtlessness sometimes boorishness the want of the ﬁne instinct which avoids occasioning any annoyance but usually it is due to desire to attract attention and to affect superiority to the common interest it is indeed mere coarse ostentation like wearing diamonds at hotel table or purple velvet train in the street if the audience had the courage which cleopatra attributed to it that part which was annoyed by the barbarians who chatter and disturb would at once suppress the annoyance by an emphatic and unmistakable hiss if this were the practice in public assemblies ars recte vivendi by george william curtis https that at the washington concert would be unknown until it is the practice even were cleopatra self the offender every conductor who has proper sense of his duties to the audience will with its sincere approval what mr thomas did april 1883 woman dress the american who sits in street omnib us or and sees young wom an whose waist is pinched to point that makes her breathing mere panting and pufﬁng and whose feet are squeezed into shoes with high heel in the middle of the sole which compels her to stump and hobble she tries to walk should be very wary of praising the superiority of european and american civilization to that of the east the grade of civilization which squeezes waist into deformity is not in that respect at least superior to that which squeezes foot into deformity it is in both instances barbarous conception alike of beauty and of the function of woman the squeezed waist and the squeezed foot equally assume that distortion of the human frame may be beautiful and that helpless idleness is the highest sphere of woman but the imperfection of our western civilization shows itself in more serious forms involving women the promiscuous herding of men and women prisoners in jails the opposition to reformatories and penitentiaries exclusi vely women and in general the failure to provide matter of course women attendants and women nurses all women prisoners and patients is signal illustration of low tone of civilization the most revolting instance of this abuse was the discovery during the summer that the patients in woman insane hospital in new orleans were bathed by male attendants it should not need such outrages to apprise us of the worth of the general principle that humanity and decency require that in all public institutions women should be employed in the care of women wise proposition during the year to provide women at the the examination of women who are arrested failed to become law it is hard upon the merits of the proposal to understand why women who are arrested may be criminals or drunkards or vagabonds or insane or witless or sick but whatever the reason of the arrest there can be good reason whatever in truly civilized community that woma n taken under such circumstances should be abandoned to personal search and examination by the kind of men to whom that business is usually allotted the surest sign of the civilization of any community is its treatment of women and the progress of our civilization is shown by the constant amelioration of that condition but the unreasonable and even revolting circumstances of much of the public treatment of them may wisely modify ecstasies over our vast superiority the squeezed waists and other tokens of the kind show that our civilization has not yet outgrown the conception of the most meretricious epochs that woman exists the delight of man and is meant to be kind of decorated append age of his life while the men attendant s and men nurses of women prisoners and patients show most uncivilized disregard of the just instincts of sex we are far from asserting that therefore the position of women in this country is to be likened to their position in china where the contempt of men denied them souls or to that among savage tribes where they are treated beasts of burden but because we are not wallowing in the slough of despond it does not follow that we are sitting in the house beautiful the trave ller who has climbed to the mer glace at chamouni and sees the valley wide outstretched far below him sees also far above him the awful sunlit dome of sovran blanc whatever point we may have reached there is still higher point to gain nowhere in the world are women so truly respected here nowhere ought they to be more happy than in this country but that is reason that the new orleans outrage should be possible while the same good sense and love of justice which have removed so ars recte vivendi by george william curtis https to women should press on more cheerfully than ever to remove those that remain december 1882 secret societies the melancholy death of young leggett student at the cornell university has undoubtedly occasioned great deal of thought in every college in the country upon secret societies professor wilder of cornell has written very careful and serious letter in which he strongly opposes them plainly stating their great disadvantages and citing the order of jesuits the most powerful and thoroughly organized of all secret associations and therefore the one in which their character and tendency may best be observed the debate recalls the history of the antimasonic excitement in this country which is however seldom mentioned in recent years so that the facts may not be familiar to the reader in the year 1826 william morgan living in batavia in the western part of new york near buffalo was supposed to intend the publication of book which would reveal the secrets of masonry the masons in the vicinity were angry and resolved to prevent the publication and made several forcible but ineffective attempts that purpose on the 11th of september 1826 party of persons from canandaigua came to batavia and procured the arrest of morgan upon criminal charge and he was carried to canandaigua examination he was acquitted but was immediately arrested upon civil process upon which an execution was issued and he was imprisoned in the jail at canandaigua the next evening he was dischar ged at the instance of those who had caused his arrest and was taken from the jail after nine in the evening those who had obtained the dischar ge instantly seized him gagged and bound him and throwing him into carriage hurried off to rochester by relays of horses and by different hands he was borne along until he was lodged in the magazine of fort niagara at the mouth of the niagara river the circumstances of his arrest and those that had preceded it had aroused and inﬂamed the minds of the people in batavia and the neighborhood committee was appointed at public meeting to ascertain all the facts and to bring to justice any criminals that might be found they could discover only that morgan had been seized upon his dischar ge in canandaigua and hurried off towards rochester but beyond that nothing the excitement deepened and spread great crime had apparently been committed and it was hidden in absolute secrecy other meetings were held in other towns and other committees were appointed and both meetings and committees were composed of men of both political parties investigation showed that masons only were implicated in the crime and that scarcely mason aided the inquiry that many masons ridiculed and even justiﬁed the offence that the committees were taunted with their inability to procure the punishment of the offenders in courts where judges sherif fs juries and witnesses were masons that witnesses disappeared that the committees

great parties state organization followed and in the election of 1830 the antimasonic candidate francis granger was adopted by the national republicans and received one hundred and twenty thousand

adopted by the national republicans and the union became the whig party which in 1838 elected seward governor of new york and in 1840 general harrison president of the united states the spring of this triumphant political movement was hostility to secret society many of the most distinguished political names of western new york including millard fillmore william seward thurlow weed francis granger

secret society he was and two companions were leading him along the edge of cliff over deep ravine when the earth gave way or they slipped and fell from the precipice and leggett was so injured that he died in two hours there was allegation or suspicion of blame there was indeed an attempt of some enemies of the cornell hostility due either to supposed conﬂict of interests or sectarian jealousy

the university and the companions of his son from blame or responsibility he would not allow his grief to keep him silent when word could avert injustice and his modest magnanimity won his sorrow the tender sympathy of all who read his letter every collegian knows that there is secrecy whatever in what is called secret society everybody knows not in particular but in general that its object is really with the charm of mystery added everybody the details of such societies in all countries are essentially the there are certain practical jokes of s in blankets layings in cofﬁns dippings in cold water stringent catechisms moral exhortations with darkness and sudden light and mysterious voices from forms invisible and then mystic signs and clasps and mottoes the whole to conclude with the best supper that the treasury can afford literary brotherhood philosophic fraternity intellectual emulation these are the noble names by which the youth deceive themselves and allure the freshmen but the real business of the society is to keep the secret and to get all the members possible from the entering class each society of course gets the best fellows every touter informs the callow freshman that all men of character and talent hasten to join his society and impresses the fresh imagination with the names of the famous honorary members the freshman if he be he is more so every wonders how the youth who are undeniably commonplace in the daily intercourse of college should become such lofty beings in the hall of secret society or more probably he thinks of nothing but the sport or the mysterious incentive to studious and higher life which the society is to furnish he feels the passionate curiosity of the neophyte he is smitten with the zeal of the hermetical philosophy he would learn more than rosicrucian lore that is vision soon dispelled but the earnest curiosity changes into esprit du corps and the mischief is that the secrecy and the society feeling are likely to take precedence of the really desirable motives in college there is hundredfold greater zeal to obtain members than there is generous rivalry among the societies to carry off the true college honors and if the purpose be admirable why professor wilder asks the secrecy what more can the secret society the intellectual or social training of the student than the open society has any secret society in an american college done or can it more the intelligent and ambitious young man than the union debating society at the english cambridge university or the similar club at oxford there macaulay gladstone

to the hero of zeta eta the secrecy is spice that overbears the food the mystic paraphernalia is relic of the which generous youth disdains there is indeed an agreeable sentiment in the veiled friendship of the secret society which every social nature understands but studen ts are now becoming more truly men they enter college because of the higher standard of requirement it is probable that the glory of the secret society is already waning and that the allegiance of the older universities to the open arenas of frank and manly intellectual contests involving expense dissipation and perilous temptation is returning at least there will now be an urgent question among many of the best men in college whether it ought not to return january 1874 tobacco and heal th we not know if readers upon your side of the water have watched with any interest the present violent onslaught in both england and france upon the use of tobacco sir benjamin brodie of london has declared strongly against its use and at recent meeting at edinbur gh of the british obacco society professor mille r moving the ﬁrst resolution follows that the constituent principles which tobacco contains are highly poisonous the pract ices of smoking and snufﬁng tend in variety of ways to injure the physical and mental constitution continued man who was hard smoker had steady hand but not only had it debilitating and paralyzing effect but he could tell of patients who were completely paralyzed in their limbs by inveterate smoking he might tell of patient of his who brought on an attack of paralysis by smoking who was cured indeed by simple means enough accompanied with the complete discontinuance of the practice but who afterwards took to it again and got new attack of paralysis and who could now play with himself it were because when he wanted day paralysis or an approach to it he had nothing to but to indulge more or less freely with the weed only the other day the among whom the practice was carried even to greater extent than with an estimate of its effects in their schools and academies and colleges they took the young men attending these institutions classiﬁed them into those who smoked habitually and those who did not and estimated their physical and intellectual standing perhaps their moral standing too but he could not say the result was that they found that those who did not smoke were the stronger lads and better scholars were altogether more reputable people and more useful members of society than those who habitually used the drug what was the consequence louis of the good things which he had issued an edict that smoking should be permitted in any school college or academy in one day he put out about pipes in paris alone let our young smokers put that in their pipe and smoke it the resolution was agreed to is it possible to entertain the idea that louis napoleon has increased the tax on tobacco latterly very largely in the hope of discouraging its use and so contributing to the weal of the nation if so it would illustrate one of the beautiful uses of despotic privilege february 1861 ars recte vivendi by george william curtis

grandisonian is usually called pomp ous and grandiloquent old prig certa inly the elaborately dressed gentleman speaking to lady only with polished courtesy of phrase and avoiding in her presence all coarse words and acts handing her in the minuet with inexpressible grace and deference and showing an exquisite homage in every motion was very different ﬁgure from the gentleman in or morning sack chafﬁng lady with the freshest slang and smoking in her face they are undeniably different and the later ﬁgure is wholly free from grandisonian elegance and elaboration but is he much more truly gentleman is he our sidney our chevalier bayard our admirable crichton is that reﬁned consideration and gentle deference which is the ﬂower of courtesy an folly the overwrought politeness is made very ridiculous upon the stage and richardson is undoubtedly hard reading the general consumer of novels it is true also that ﬁne morals not always go with ﬁne manners and that lovelace had fascination of address which john knox lacked the chaff and slang of the bayard of are at least decent and his morals probably purer than those of the courtly and punctilious old sir roger coverleys possibly but it has been wisely said that hypocrisy is the homage paid by vice to virtue the good manners of bad man are rich dress upon diseased body they are the graceful form of vase full of dirty water the liquid

kiss her the woman who does not require of man the form of respect invites him to discard the substance and there is one violation of the form which is recent and gross and might be well cited striking illustration of the decay of manners it is the practice of smoking in the society of ladies in public places whether driving or walking or sailing or sitting there are preux chevaliers who would be honestly amazed if they were told they did not behave like gentlemen who sitting with lady on hotel piazza or strolling on public park whip out cigarette light it and puff tranquilly if they were alone in their rooms or young man comes alone upon the deck of steamer where throngs of ladies are sitting and blows clouds of tobacco smoke in their faces without even remarking that tobacco is disagreeable to some people this is not indeed one of the seven deadly sins but man who uncon cernedly sings false betrays that he has ear music and the man who smokes in this way shows that he is not quite gentleman but some ladies smoke yes and some ladies drink liquor does that mend the matter the easy chair has seen lady at the head of her own table smoking ﬁne cigar you will see great many highly dressed women in paris smokin g cigarettes does all this change the situation does this make it more gentlemanly to smoke with lady beside you in carriage or upon bench on the piazza but some ladies like the odor of cigar not many and the taste of those who sincerely so can not justify the habit of promiscuous pufﬁng in their presence the intimacy of domesticity is governed by other rules but gentleman smoking would hardly enter his own where other ladies sat with his wife without word of apology the easy chair is king james and is more likely to issue blasts of tobacco than blasts against it but king james belonged to very selﬁsh sex which seems often to suppose that its indulgences and habits are to be ars recte vivendi by george william curtis https other reason than that they are its habits therefore the young woman must defend herself by showing plainly that she prohibits the intrusion of which if suffered she is really the victim in other times the easy chair has seen the lovely laura matilda unwilling to refuse to dance with the partner who had bespoken her hand the german although when he presented himself he was plainly ﬂown with wine the easy chair has seen the hapless foolish maid encircled by those bacchic arms and then headlong whirl and dash down the room ending in the promiscuous overthrow and downfall of maid bacchus and musicians if in the grandisonian day the morals were wanting it was something to have the manners they at least were to the imagination memory and prophecy they recalled the idyllic age when ﬁne manners expressed ﬁne feelings and they foretold the return of astræa to her ancient haunts here is young adonis dreaming of and yacht like any other gentleman let us hope that he knows the test of gentleman not to be the ownership of and unique drag but perfect courtesy founded upon ﬁne human rare and indescribable gentleness and consideration which rests upon manner lightly the bloom upon fruit it may be imitated gold and diamonds are but counterfeit can harm it and adonis it is incompatible with smoking in lady face even if she acquiesces september 1879 ii apollodorus came in the other morning and announced to the easy chair that it had been made by common consent arbiter of dispute in circle of young men the question said he is not new one in itself but it constantly recurs it is the inquiry under what conditions gentleman may smoke in the presence of ladies the easy chair replied that it could not answer more pertinently than in the words of the famous princess emilia who upon being asked by youth who was attending her in promenade around the garden what should you say if gentleman asked to smoke he walked with you replied it is not supposable gentleman would propose it naturally that youth did not venture to light even cigarette emilia had parried his question so dexterously that although the rebuke was stinging he could not even pretend to be offended his question was merely form of saying i am about to smoke and what have you to say that he asked the question was evidence of lingering persuasion inherited from an ancestry of gentlemen that it was not seemly to puf f tobacco smoke around lady with whom he was walking apollodorus was silent moment if reﬂecting whether this anecdote was to be regarded general judgment of the arbiter that gentleman will never smoke in the presen ce of lady but the easy chair broke in upon his meditation with question if you had son shou ld you wish to meet him smoking he accompanied lady upon the avenue or were you the father of daughter should you wish to see her cavalier smoking he walked by her side upon your own theory of what is gentlemanly and courteous and respectful and becoming in the manner of man towards woman should you regard the spectacle with satisfaction well replied apollodorus is that rather view when can man but you are not answering interrup ted the easy chair of two youths walking with your daughter one of whom was smoking cigarette or cigar or pipe he attended her and the other was not smoking which would seem to you the more gentlemanly the latter said apollodorus promptly and frankly it appears then returned the easy chair assuming the socratic manner that there are circumstances under which gentleman will not smoke in the presence of lady but to answer your question directly it is not possible to prescribe an exact code although certain conditions may be deﬁnitely stated instance gentleman will not smoke while walking with lady in the street he will not smoke while paying her an evening visit in her he will not smoke while driving with her in the park it is signiﬁcant of radical change in manners that such rules can be laid down because formerly the question could not have arisen the grandfather of apollodorus who was the ﬂower of courtesy could more have smoked with lady with whom he was walking or driving than he could have attended her without coat or collar yet manners change and the grandfather must not insist ars recte vivendi by george william curtis https of his time were best because they were those of his time it is but little while since that gentleman who appeared at party without gloves would have been queer ﬁgure but now should he wear gloves he would be remarked unfamiliar with good usage it does not argue decline of courte sy that the grandisonian compliment and the ineffable bending over lady hand and respectful kissing of the ﬁnger have yielded to simpler and less stately manner the woman of the minuet was not really more respected than the woman of the waltz however the word gentlemanly may be deﬁned it will not be questioned that the quality which it describes is sympathetic regard the feelings of others and the manner which evinces it the manner of course may be counterfeited and put to base uses to say that lovelace has gentlemanly manner is not to say that he is gentleman but only that he has caught the trick of gentleman to call him or robert macaire or richard turpin gentleman is to say only that he behaves gentleman behaves but he is not gentleman unless that word describes manners and nothing more this is the key to the question of apollodorus it is not easy to deﬁne gentleman but it is perfectly easy to see that in his pleasures and in the little indifferent practices of society the gentleman will nothing which is disagreeable to others he certainly will not assume that personal gratiﬁcation or indulgence must necessarily be pleasant to others nor will he make the selﬁsh habits of others plea his own apollodorus listened patiently and then said slowly that he understood the judgment to be that gentleman would smoke in the presence of ladies only when he knew that it was agreeable to them but that the inﬁnite grace and courtesy of women often led them an act of to persuade themselves that what others wish to ought not to annoy them it was very difﬁcult to know whether the practice was or was not offensive to any particular lady and the youth seemed to be unable to draw the conclusion therefore said the mentor it is well to remember the old rule in whist which asked apollodorus when in doubt trump the trick but what is the special application of that rule to this case precisely this that the doubting smok er should follow the advice of punch to those about to marry which asked apollodorus september 1883 duelling years ago at the table of gentleman whose father had fallen in duel the conversation fell upon duelling and after it had proceeded some time the host remarked emphatically that there were occasions when it was man solemn duty to ﬁght the personal reference was too signiﬁcant to permit further insistence at that table that duelling was criminal folly and the subject of conversation was changed the host however had only reiterated the familiar view of general hamilton his plea was that in the state of public opinion at the time when burr challenged him to refuse to ﬁght under circumstances which by the code of honor authorized challenge was to accept brand of cowardice and of want of gentlemanly feeling which would banish him to moral and social coventry and throw cloud of discredit upon his family so hamilton one of the bravest men ars recte vivendi by george william curtis https of the acutest intellects of his time permitted worthless fellow to murder him yet there is doubt that he stated accurately the general feeling of the social circle in which he lived there was probably not conspicuous member of that society who was of military antecedents who would not have challenged any man who had said of him what hamilton had said of burr hamilton disdained explanation or recantation and the result was accepted tragical but in certain sense inevitable yet that result aroused public sentiment to the atrocity of this barbarous survival of the ordeal of private battle that one of the most justly renowned of public men of unsurpassed ability should be shot to death like mad dog because he had expressed the general feeling about an unprincipled schemer was an exasperating public misfortune but that he should have been murdered in deference to practice which was approved in the best society yet which placed every other valuable life at the mercy of any wily vagabond was public peril from that day to this there has been duel which could be said to have commanded public sympathy or approval from the bright june morning eighty years ago when hamilton fell at weehawken to the june of this year when two foolish men shot at each other in virginia there has been steady and complete change of public opinion and the performance of this year was received with almost universal contempt and with indignant censure of dilatory police the most celebrated duel in this country since that of hamilton and burr was the encounter between commodores decatur and barron in 1820 near washington in which decatur like hamilton was mortally wounded and likewise lived but few hours the quarrel was one of professional burr of political jealo usy but the only conceivable advantage of the hamilton duel lay in its arousing the public mind to the barbarity of duelling the only gain from the decatur duel was that it conﬁrmed this conviction in both instances there was an unspeakable shock to the country and inﬁnite domestic anguish nothing else was achieved neither general manners nor morals were improved nor was the fame of either combatant heightened nor public conﬁdence in the men or admiration of their public services increased in both cases it was calamity alleviated solely by the resolution which it awakened that such calamities should not occur again such resolution indeed could not at once prevail and eighteen years after decatur was killed jonathan cilley of maine was killed in duel at washington by william graves of kentucky this event occurred years ago but the outcry with which it was received even at that time of the newspaper moralists lapsing into rhyme he deplored the cruel custom which led excellent men to the fatal ﬁeld where cilleys meet their graves and the practical disappearance of graves from public life showed how deep and strong was the public condemnation and how radically the general view of the duel was changed even in the burning height of the political and sectional animosity of 1856 when brooks had assaulted charles sumner the challenge of brooks by some of sumner friends met with little public sympathy during the excitement the easy chair met the late count gurowski who was constant and devoted friend of sumner but an man with all the hereditary social prejudices of the old world the count was furious that such dastardly blow had not been avenged has he friends he exclaimed is there honor left in your country and if he would burst with indignant impatience he shook both his ﬁsts in the air and thundered out good god will not somebody challenge anybody that time is passed the elderly club dude may lament the decay of the good old code of honor word of which he has very ludicrous major pendennis when he pulled off his wig and took out his false teeth and removed the padded calves of his legs used to hope that the world was not sinking into shams in its old age quarrelling editors may win morning notoriety by stealing to the ﬁeld

the category of minor manners and morals which are supposed to be the especial care of the easy chair but there are frequent texts upon which the preacher might dilate and push discourse upon the subject even to the ﬁfteenthly indeed in this hot time of an opening election campaign the stress of the contest is so severe that the ﬁrst condition of good newspaper is sometimes frightfully maltreated the ﬁrst duty of newspaper is to tell the news to tell it fairly honestly and accurately which are here only differing aspects of the same adverb cooking the news is the worst use to which cooking and news can be put the old divine spoke truly if with exceeding care in saying it has been sometimes observed that men will lie so it has been sometimes suspected that newspapers will cook the news courteous interviewer called upon gentleman to obtain his opinions let us say upon the smelt ﬁshery after the usual civilities upon such occasions the interviewer remarked with conscious pride the paper that i represent and you sir not agree upon the great smelt question but it is newspaper it prints the facts it does not pervert them its own purpose and it ﬁnds its account in it you may be sure that whatever you may say will be reproduced exactly you say it this is the news department meanwhile the editorial department will make such comment s upon the news it chooses this was fair and the interviewer kept his word the opinions might be editorially ridiculed from the other smelt point of view and they probably were so but the reader of the paper could judge between the opinion and the comment now an interview is more news than much else that is printed in paper and it is more pardonable to misrepresent other facts than to distort the opinions of the victim of an interview yet it has been possible at times to read in the newspapers of the same day accounts of the same proceedings us say this is election political convention the banner informs us that the spirit was unmistakable and the opinion most decided in favor of jones true the convention voted by nine hundred to four smith but there is doubt that jones is the name written on the popular heart the standar d on the other hand proclaims that the popular heart is engraved all over with the inspiring name of smith and that it is impossible to ﬁnd any trace of feeling jones except possibly in the case of one delegate who is probably an idiot or lunatic this is gravely served up news and the papers pay it they even hire men to write this and pay them it how ude and carême would have disdained this kind of cooke ry it is questionable whether hanging is not better use to put man to than cooking news sir henry wotton deﬁned an ambassador an honest man sent to lie abroad the commonwealth this kind of purveyor however does not lie his country but party or person it is done with purpose the purpose of inﬂuencing other action it is intended to swell the paean jones or smith and to procure results under false pretences procuring goods under false pretences is crime but everybody is supposed to read the newspapers at his own risk has the reader yet to learn that newspapers are very human paper instance takes position upon the jones or smith question it decides upon all the information it can obtain and by its own deliberate judgment that jones is the coming man or it has been observed that men will sometimes lie it has illicit reasons the success of smith having thus taken its course it cooks all the news upon the smith and jones controversy in order that by encouraging the jonesites or the smithians according to the color that it wears it may promote the success of the side upon which its opinion has been staked it is ludicrous and desperate game but it is certainly not the honest collection and diffusion of news it is losing game also because whatever the sympathies of the reader he does not care to be foolishly deceived about the situation if he is told day after day that smith is immensely ahead and has clear ﬁeld he is terribly shaken by the shock of learning at the ﬁnal moment that he has been cheated from the beginning and that poor smith is

able editor plan of securing and retaining large audience the plan would be that described by the urbane reporter the plan of his own paper it is nothing else than in the news column and the peremptory punishment of all criminals who cook the news and write up the situation not it is but the paper wishes it to be this is more than an affair of the private wishe s or preferences of the paper to cook the news is public wrong and violation of the moral contract which the newspaper makes with the public to supply the news and to use every reasonable effort to obtain it not to manufacture it either in the ofﬁce or by correspondence july 1880 ii if new york paper recently said the journalist is superseding the orator it is full time the work upon journals and journalism which has been lately issued in london the new york writer holds that in our political contests the campaign speech is not intended or adapted to persuade or convert opponents but merely to stimulate and encourage friends the party meetings on each side he thinks are composed of partisans and the more extravagant the assertion and the more unsparing the denunciation of the enemy the more rapturous the enthusiasm of the audience in fact his theory of campaign speeches is that they are merely the addresses of generals to their armies on the eve of battle which are not arguments since argument is not needed but mere urgent appeals to party feeling thirty centuries look down from yonder pyramid is the napoleonic tone of the campaign speech an election is an appeal to the ﬁnal tribunal of the popular judgment the apparent object of election oratory is to affect the popular decision but this the journalist asserts is not done by the orator the reason just stated but by the journal the newspaper addresses the voter not with rhetorical periods and vapid declamation but with facts and ﬁgures and arguments which the voter can verify and ponder at his leisure and not under the excitement or the tedium of spoken harangue the newspaper also unless it be mere party organ is candid to the other side and states the situation fairly moreover the exigencies of daily issue and of great space to ﬁll produce fulness and variety of information and of argument which are really the source of most of the speeches so that the orator repeats to his audience an imperfect abstract of complete and ample plea and the orator it is asserted would often serve his cause inﬁnitely better by reading carefully written newspaper article than by pouring out his loose and illogical declamation but the argument the newspaper can be pushed still further since phonographic reporting has become universal and the speaker is conscious that his very words will be spread the next morning before hundreds of thousands of readers it is of those readers and not of the thousand hearers before him of whom he thinks and whom his address is really prepared formerly single charge was all that was needed the fusillade of whole political campaign the speech that was originally carefully prepared was known practically only to the audience that heard it it grew better and brighter with the attrition of repeated delivery and was fresh and new to every new audience but now when delivered to an audience it is spoken to the whole country it is often in type before it is uttered so that the orator is in fact repeating the article of morning the result is good so far it compels him to precision of statement but it inevitably suggests the question whether the newspaper is not correct in its assertion that the great object of the oration is accomplished not by the orator but by the writer but this after all is like asking wheth er chromo copy of great picture does not supersede painting and prove it to be an antiquated or obsolete art oratory is an art and its peculiar charm and power can not be superseded by any other art great orations are now prepared with care and may be printed word word but the reading can not produce the impression of the hearing we can all read the words that webster spoke on bunker hill at the laying of the corner of the monument ﬁfty years after the battle but those who saw him standing there in his majestic prime and speaking to that vast throng heard and saw and felt something that we can not know the ordinary stump speech which imperfectly echoes leading article can well be spared but the speech of an orator still remains work of art the words of which may be accurately lithographed while the spirit and glow and inspiration of utterance which made it work of art can not be ars recte vivendi by george william curtis https general statement of the critic however remains true and the effective work of political campaign is certainly done by the newspaper the newspaper is of two kinds which shows exclusively the virtue and advant age of the party it favors and that which aims to be judicial and impartial the tendency of the ﬁrst kind is obvious enough but that of the last is not less positive if less obvious the tendency of the independent newspaper is to indifference the very ardor often intemperate and indiscreet with which side is advocated prejudices such paper against the cause itself because the hot orator exclaims that the success of the adversary would ruin the country the independen t mentor gayly suggests that the country is not so easily ruined and that such an argument is reason voting against the orator the position that in party contest it is six on one side and half dozen on the other is too much akin to the doctrine that naught is everything and everything is naught to be very persuasive with men who are really in earnest such position in public affairs inevitably and often very unjustly to them produces an impression of want of hearty convictio n which paralyzes inﬂuence effectually the evident prejudice and partiality of the party advocate thorough independence is perfe ctly compatible with the strongest conviction that the public welfare will be best promoted by the success of this or that party such independence criticises its own party and partisans but it would not have wavered in the support of the revolution because gates and conway were intriguers and charles lee an adventurer and it would have sustain ed sir robert walpole although he would not repeal

that his honor nothing entertains him more than to see how little argument goes to the discussion of any question and how immediate is the recourse to blackguardism the other day he said recently i

from ridicule and ludicrous publicity however conscious of rectitude man may be it is exceedingly disagreeable him to see the and pavements covered with posters proclaiming that he is liar and fool if he recoils the enemy laughs in triumph if he is indifferent there is fresh whirlwind public man wrote recently to friend that he had seen an attack upon his conduct in great journal and had asked his lawyer to take the necessary legal steps to bring the offender to justice his friend replied that he had seen the attack but that it had more effect upon him than the smells from newtown creek they were very disgusting but that was all this is the inevitable result of blackguardism the newspaper reader he sees that one man supports one measure because his wife uncle is interested in it and anoth er man another measure to gratify his grudge against rival gradually learns from his daily morning mentor that there is such thing honor decency or public spirit in public affairs he chuckles with the club cynic although very different reason and forgets the contents of one column he begins upon the next if man covers his milk toast his breakfast his lunch dinner and supper with coating of cayenne pepper the pepper becomes things in general became to mr consequence this kind of fury in personal denunciation is not force young writers suppose it is feebleness wit satire brilliant sarcasm are indeed legitimate weapons it was these which sydney smith wielded in the early edinbur gh review but calling names and echoing the commonplaces of affected contempt that is too weak even timon to chuckle over except evidence of mental vacuity the real object in honest controversy is to defeat your opponent and leave him friend but the newtown creek method is fatal to such result of course that method often apparently wins but it always fails when directed against resolute and earnest purpose the great causes persist through seeming defeat to victory but to oppose them with sneers and blackguardism is to affect to dam niagara with piece of paper the crafty old lawyer advised the younger to reserve his abuse until he felt that he had case judge grover remarked that it was when the case was lost that the profanity began september 1882 iv there is delicate question in newspaper ethics which is sometimes widely discussed namely whether journalism may be regarded distinct profession which has moral standard of its own the question arises when an editorial writer transfers his services from one journal to another of different political opinions is man justiﬁed in arguing strenuously free trade and protection are political questions and measures of public policy merely points of law upon which an editor is an advocate to be retained indifferently and with equal morality upon either side this question may be illuminated by another would john bright be man of equal renown character and weight of inﬂuence if being an adherent of peace principles he had remained in an administration whose policy was war this question will be thought to beg the whole question but does it must it not be assumed that man of adequate ability the proper discussion of political questions must have positive political convictions and can man who has such convictions honorably devote himself to discrediting them and to defeating the policy which they demand under the plea that he has professionally accepted retainer or salary to so would his arguments have any moral weight if they were known to be those of man who was not himself convinced by them and is not the concealment of the fact indispensable to the value of his services ars recte vivendi by george william curtis https continue this interrogation is not the parallel sought to be established between the editorial writer and the lawyer vitiated by the fact that it is universally understood that lawyer service is perfunctory and ofﬁcial that he takes one side rather than another because he is paid it and because that is the condition of his profession and that that condition springs from the nature of legal procedure society not choosing to take life or to inﬂict punishment of any kind until the whole case has been stated according to certain stipulated forms this reason the advocate who defends criminal is not supposed necessarily to believe him to be innocent but such reason existing in the case of the editor is it not an equally universal understanding that an editor does honestly and personally hold the view that he presents and defends instance the times in new york is republican and journal if it should suddenly appear some morning democratic and protectionist paper would not the general conclusion be that it had changed hands but if it should be announced that it was in the same hands and had changed its views because of pecuniary arrangement could the times continue to have the same standing and inﬂuence which it has now distinction may be attempted between the owner of paper and the editor but the public are they not practically the same it is not in fact the owner or the editor it is the paper which is known to the public if the public considers at all the probable relation of the owner and editor it necessarily assumes their harmony because it does not suppose that an owner would employ an editor who is injuring the property and if the paper ﬂourishes under the editor it is because the owner yields his private opinion to the editor if they happen to differ so that there is discord on the other hand if the paper ﬂags and fails and the owner to rescue his property employs another editor who holds other views and changes the tone of the paper the result is the same so far the public is concerned the proﬁt of the paper may increase but its power and inﬂuence surely decline in the illustration that we have supposed the proprietorship of the times might decide that democratic and protection paper would have larger sale and greatly increase the proﬁt but could the change be made without terrible blow to the character and inﬂuence of the paper now why is not an editor in the same position he has certain standing and he holds certain views like the paper the paper changes its tone price he does the same thing the paper loses character and inﬂuence why does not he journalism is not profession in the sense claimed it does not demand certain course of study which is ﬁnally tested by an examination and certiﬁed by degree it is pursuit rather than profession of course special knowledge in particular branches of informati on is of the highest value and indeed essential to satisfactory editorial writing to all other public exposition there are also certain details of the collection of news the organization of correspondence and the make up of the paper the successful management of which depends upon an energetic executive faculty which is desirable in every pursuit it is sometimes said that an editor like the late delane of the london times should not write himself but select the topics and procure the writing upon them by others and so long man is merely an anonymous writer paper so long he writes to sustain the views of the paper his actual opinions being unknown to the reader not affect the power of the paper such man indee d may write at the same time upon both sides of the same question different papers but if he have any convictions or opinions upon the subject he is with one hand consciously injuring what he believes to be the truth and man can not that without serious harm to himself if he have convictions his inﬂuence will vanish the moment that the fact is known such strictures not apply to papers which expressly renounce convictions and blow hot or cold the chances of probable proﬁt and the apparent tenor of public opinion at the moment invite such papers properly speaking have legitimate inﬂuence whatever they produc certain effect by mere publicity and reiteration and ridicule and distortion and suppression of facts and appeals to prejudice there is legitimate and an illegitimate power of the press lion and skunk both inspire terror but paper which represents conviction s and promotes public policy in accordance with them necessarily implies sincerity in its editorial writing the public assumes that among papers of all opinions the writer attaches himself to one with which he agrees the nature of the pursuit is such that he can not make himself free lance without running the risk of being thought an adventurer soldier without patriotism citizen without convictions if the best american press did not represent real convictions but only the clever ingenuity of paid advocates it would be worthless an exponent of public opinion and could not be the beneﬁcent power that it is october 1882 ars recte vivendi by george william curtis https one public man in recent angry alterc ation with another taunted him with elaborately preparing his invective and some notoriously vituperative speeches are known to have been written out and printed before they were spoken such cold venom is undoubtedly effective in reading the hot outbreak of the moment and it may be even more effective in the delivery since is useful to the orator to the actor but if man be guilty of gross offence who upon digniﬁed scene violates the and respect the company which are not only becoming but so much assumed that whoever violates the requirement is felt to insult his associates and the public why we not consider whether every scene is not too digniﬁed mature and intelligent men to attempt to rival in blackguardism the traditional ﬁshwives of billingsgate if an orator or newspaper conducts discussion without dischar ging the ﬁercest and foulest epithets at the opponent it is often declared to be tame and feeble and indifferent but to whom and to what does vituperation appeal when an advocate upon the platform shouts until he is very hot and very red that the supporter of protection is thief robber pampered pet of an atrociously diabolical system he inﬂames passion and prejudice indeed to the highest fury and he produces state of mind which is inaccessible to reason but he does not show in any degree whatever either that protection is inexpedient or how it is unjust in the same way to assail an opponent who favors revision of the tariff and incidental protection rascally scoundrel who is trying to ruin american if he could have any purpose of injuring himself materially and absurd the tirade merely injures the cause which the blackguard intends to help but the man who carried on discussion in this style is described by other professors of the same art manly and virile and hitting from the shoulder and he comes perhaps to think himself doughty champion of the right the weapon that demolishes an antagonist and an argument is not rhetoric but truth this accumulation of bad names and ingeni ous combination of scurrility is merely rhetoric it serves the rhetorical purpose but it does not convince it does not show the hearer or reader that one course is more expedient than another nor give him any reason whatever any opinion upon the subject virility vigor masculinity of mind and essential force in debate are revealed in quite another way if an american were asked to mention the most powerful speech ever made in the debates of congress he would probably mention webster reply to hayne it contained the great statement of nationality and the argument the national interpretation of the constitution and it was spoken in the course of famous controversy let any man read it and ask himself whether it would have gained in power in effect in weight dignity or character by personal invective and elaborate vituperation of any kind and any degree whatever the truth is that the fury which is supposed to imply force is the conclusive proof of weakness the familiar advice if you have evidence abuse the plaintif f attorney contains by implication the whole philosophy of what is called the manliness and force of the blackguard he has reason therefore he sneers he has argument therefore he swears he will get the laugh upon his adversary if he can getting that those who laugh at the clown may also despise him of wit humor satire sarcasm we are not speaking the ordinary blackguardism of the political platform and press does not belong to that category caricature however easily may there are certain pictures in american caricature which are wit made visible they are the satire of instructive truth indeed they tell to the eye the indisputable truth words can not easily tell it to the ear in this way caricature is one of the most powerful agents in public discussion but like speech or writing it may be merely blackguard the incisive wit the rich humor the withering satire of speech gain all their point and ef fect from the truth they have power when they are seen to be false so it is with caricature nobody can enjoy it more than its subject when it is merely humorous nobody perceive so surely its pungent touch of truth nobody disregard more completely its mere malice and falsehood true wit and humor whether in controversial letters or art whether in the newspaper article or the cartoon we now call it often reveal to the subject in himself what otherwise he might not have suspected it is very conceivable that an actor seeing really clever burlesque of himself may become awar of tendencies or peculiarities or faults which otherwise he would not have known and quietly address himself to their correction this sanitary service of humor in every form well that of the honest wrath which shakes many noble sentence of sinewy english mighty is shaken by her own broadside is something wholly apart from the billingsgate and blackguardism which are treated if they ars recte vivendi by george william curtis https forces publicity itself the easy chair has often said has certain power and to call man rascal to hundred thousand persons at once produces an undeniable effect but we must not mistake it what it is not being false it is not an effect which endures nor does it vex the equal mind it is the fact that the public often seems to demand that kind of titillation to enjoy fury instead of force and ridicule instead of reason which suggests the inquiry whether if and wise discipline are desirable every faculty of the mind and body the tongue and hand alone should be allowed to riot in wanton excess if even the legitimate superlative must be handled like dynamite with extreme caution blackguardism of every degree is nuisance to be summarily discountenanced and abated by those who know the difference between grandeur and bigness between mercutio and tony lumpkin between fair and foul september 1888 vi the easy chair has been asked whether there is any code of newspaper manne rs it has doubt that there is but it is the universal code of courtesy and not one restricted to newspapers good manners in civilized society are the same everywhere and in all relations newspaper is not mystery it is the work of several men and women and their manners in doing the work are subject to the same principles that govern their manners in society or in any other human relation if man is gentleman he does not cease to be one because he enters newspaper ofﬁce and it would seem to be equally true that if his work on the paper does not prove to be that of gentleman it could not have been gentleman who did the work gentleman we will suppose does not blackguard his neighbors nor talk incessantly about himself and his achievements nor behave elsewhere he would be ashamed to behave in his club or in his own family if gentleman does not these things of course gentleman does not them in newspaper and does it not seem to follow if such things are done in newspaper and are traced to hand supposed to be that of gentleman that there has been some mistake about the hand good manners are essentially disposition which moulds conduct they can be feigned indeed gilt counterfeits gold and plate silver but the clearest glass is not diamond man may smile and smile and be villain scoundrels are sometimes described of gentlemanly manners and lothario was not personally boor but he was not gentleman and he merely affected good manners gentleman indeed may sometimes lose his temper or his but one who habitually does it and swears and rails vociferously can be called properly by that name here again it is easy to apply the canon to newspaper when newspaper habitually takes an insulting tone and deliberately falsiﬁes whether by assertion of an untruth or by distortion and perversion of the truth it is not the work of gentleman and if the writer be responsible the tone of the paper the manners of that newspaper are not good manners but there is uniformity in newspaper manners there is none elsewhere therefore it can not be said that newspapers whole are either or unmannerly you can not say that men body are courteous or uncouth some newspapers are unmistakably vulgar like some people they are not so of themselves however they are made vulgar by vulgar people there are very able newspapers which have very bad manners and some which have other distinction than good manners very dull man may be very urbane and so may very dull newspaper on the other hand newspaper which is both brilliant and clever may be sometimes guilty of an injustice deliberate and persistent misrepresentat ion to attain particular which is sometimes called journalistic but the person who is responsible the performance similar conduct would be metaphorically kicked out of club but gentlemen are not kicked out of clubs newspaper gains neither character nor inﬂuence by abandoning good manne rs it may indeed make itself disagreeable and annoying and so silence opposition polecat may effectually close the wood path which you had designed to take it may be feared and in the same way that animal and despised but this effect must not be confounded with newspaper power and inﬂuence it is exceedingly annoying undoubtedly to be placarded all over town liar or donkey hypocrite or but although the effect is most unpleasant very little ability is required to produce it little paper and printing little paste great deal of malice and host of ars recte vivendi by george william curtis https all that are needed and even the pecuniary cost is not large the effect is produced but it does not show ability or force or inﬂuence upon the part of its producer the manners of newspapers such can not be classiﬁed any more than the manners of legislatures or of the professions or trades this however seems to be true that man will not produce an newspaper april
