intense gushing lyrical character of its life how hot he is how fast he lives if his air had more oxygen than ours or his body less clay how slight wound kills him how exquisite his sensations how perfect his nervous system and hence how large his brain why look at the cerebral development of this tiny songster third larger in proportion to the size of its body than that of shakspeare even does it mean nothing you may observe that warbler has much larger brain and much ﬁner cerebral organization throug hout than bird of prey or any of the picus family even does it signify nothing i gaze into

wilds of the adirondack impatient and inquisitive usual few weeks later on the potomac i was greeted by the same hardy little busybo dy does he travel by easy stages from bush to bush and from wood to

discover that the warbler is paying return visit presently i likewise perceive troop of redstarts or warblers or golden and wrens ﬂashing through the or hanging like jewels on the cedar week of two later and my darlings are gone another love is in my heart and other voices ﬁll my ears but so unapparent and mysterious are the coming and going that i look upon each special providence and value them visitants from another sphere the migration of the pigeons ducks and geese is obvious enough we see them stream across the heavens or hear their clang in the night but these minstrels of the ﬁeld and forest add to their other charms shade of mystery and pique the imagination by their invisible and unknown journeyings to be sure we know they follow the opening season north and the retreating summer south but who will point to the parallels that mark the limits of their wandering or take us to their most secret haunts what greater marvel than this simple gift of music what beside birds and the human species sing it is the crowning gift through it the ﬁeld and forest are justiﬁed nature said these rude forms and forces must have spokesman of their own nursing here are ﬂowers and odor let there be music also i suspect the subtile spirit of the meadow took form in the bobolink that the high begot the vesper and that from the imprisoned sense and harmony of the forests sprang the from

have seen blue jay alone saluting and admiring himself in the mirror of little pool of water from low overhanging branch assume so many graceful novel well ridiculous and fantastic attitudes would make taxidermist run mad to attempt to reproduce and the rich medley of notes he poured forth at the same ping warbling cooing whistling chattering revealing rare musical and imitative have been an equally severe test to the composer who should have aspired to report them and the indignant air of outraged privacy he assumed on ﬁnding himself discovered together with his loud angry protest with crown depressed and plumage furled he rapidly ascended to the topmost branch of tall birch the better to proclaim my perﬁdy to the whole world would have excited the interest and applause of the coolest observer so much in general sense but let discriminate my purpose holds to call my favorites by name and point them out to you the tuneful procession passes every stage of the advancing season gives prominence to certain birds to certain ﬂowers the dandelion tells when to look the swallow and i know the thrushes will not linger when the orchis is in bloom in my latitude april is emphat ically the month of the robin in large numbers they scour the ﬁelds and groves you hear their piping in the meadow in the pasture on the hillside walk in the woods and the dry leaves rustle with the whir of their wing s the air is vocal with their cheery call in excess of joy and vivacity they run leap scream chase each other through the air diving and sweeping among the trees with perilous rapidity in that free fascinating and pursuit pursuit which still lingers in many parts of new york in new england the robin is one boon companion when the day is sunny and the ground bare you meet him at all points and hear him at all hours at sunset on the tops of the tall maples with look heavenward and in spirit of utter abandonment he carols his simple strain and sitting thus amid the stark silent trees above the wet cold earth with the chill of winter still in the air there is ﬁtter or sweeter songster in the whole round year it is in keeping with the scene and the occasion how round and genuine the notes are and how eagerly our ears drink them in the ﬁrst utterance and the spell of winter is thoroughly broken and the remembrance of it afar of robin is one of the most native and democratic of our birds he is one of the family and seems much nearer to us than those rare exotic visitants the or grosbeak with their distant ways hardy noisy frolicsome neighborly and domestic in his ways strong of wing and bold in spirit he is the pioneer of the thrush family and well worthy of the ﬁner artists whose coming he heralds and in measure prepares us i could wish robin less native and plebeian in one respect building of his nest its coarse material and rough masonry are creditable neither to his skill workman nor to his taste an artist i am the more forcibly reminded of his deﬁciency in this respect from observing yonder nest which is marvel of ﬁtness and adaptation proper setting this winged gem body of it composed of white substance probably the down of some plant or the wool of some worm and toned down in keeping with the branch on which it sits by minute woven together by threads ﬁne and frail gossamer from robin good looks and musical turn we might reasonably predict domicil of equal ﬁtness and elegance at least i demand of him clean and handsome nest the ird whose harsh jingle compared with robin evening melody is the clatter of pots and kettles beside the tone of ﬂute i love his note and ways better even than those of the or the baltimore oriole yet his nest compared with theirs is hut contrasted with roman villa there is something courtly and poetical in pensile nest next to castle in the air is dwelling suspended to the slender branch of tall tree swayed and rocked forever by the wind why need wings be afraid of falling why build only where boys can climb after pg 516 the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 15 91 may https we must set it down to the account of robin democratic turn he is aristocrat but one of the people and therefore we should expect stability in his workmanship rather than elegance another april bird which makes her appearance sometimes earlier and someti mes later than robin and whose memory i fondly cherish is the ph oe muscicapa nunciola the pioneer of the flycatchers in the inland farming districts i used to notice her on some bright morning about easter proclaiming her arrival with much variety of motion and attitude from the peak of the barn or yet you may have heard only the plaintive homesick note of the bluebird or the faint trill of the sparrow and ph oe be clear vivacious assurance of her veritable bodily presence among us again is welcomed by all ears at agreeable intervals in her lay she describes circle or an ellipse in the air ostensibly prospecting insects but really i suspect an artistic ﬂourish thrown in to make up in some way the deﬁciency of her musical performance if plainness of dress indicates powers of song it usually does then ph oe be ought to be unrivalled in musical ability surely that suit is the superlative of plainness and that form likewise though it might pass the perfect ﬁgure of bird measured by joe gargery standard to fastidious taste would present exceptionable points the seasonable ness of her coming however and her civil neighborly ways shall make up all deﬁciencies in song and plumage and remove any suspicions we may have had that perhaps from some cause or other she was in some slight disfavor with nature after few weeks ph oe be is seldom seen except she darts from her nest beneath some bridge or shelving clif another april comer who arrives shortly after with whom he associates both at this season and in the autumn is the inged woodpecker alias alias flicker alias yarup he is an old favorite of my boyhood and his note to means very much he announces his arrival by long loud call repeated from the dry branch of some tree or stake in the fence thoroughly melodious april sound i think how solomon ﬁnished that beautiful climax on spring and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land and see that description of spring in this farming country to be equally characteristic should culminate in like manner and the call of the comes up from the wood it is loud strong sonorous call and does not seem to imply an answer but rather to subserve some purpose of love or music it is yarup proclamation of peace and will to all on looking at the matter closely i perceive that most birds not denominated songsters have in the spring some note or sound or call that hints of song and answers imperfectly the end of beaut y and art brighter iris comes upon the burnished dove and the fancy of the young man turns lightly to thoughts of his pretty cousin so the same renewing spirit touches the silent singers and they are longer dumb faintly they lisp the ﬁrst syllables of the marvellous tale witness the clear sweet whistle of the titmouse soft nasal piping of the nuthatch amorous vivacious warble of the blueb ird long rich note of the the whistle of the quail drumming of the partridge animation and loquacity of the swallows and the like even the hen has homely contented carol and i credit the owls with desire to ﬁll the night with music all birds are incipient or songsters in the spring i ﬁnd corroborative evidence of this even in the crowing of the cock the ﬂowering of the maple is not so obvious that of the magnolia nevertheless there is actual inﬂorescence neither wilson nor audubon i believe awards any song to that familiar little sparrow the socialis yet who that has observed him sitting by the wayside and repeating with devout attitude that ﬁne sliding chant does not recognize the neglect who has heard the sing not the ornithologist it seems yet he has lisping warble very savory to the ear i have heard him indulge in it even in february even the feels the musical tendency and aspires to its expression with the rest perched upon the topmost branch beside his mate or mates he is quite polygamist and usually has two or three demure little ladies in faded black beside him pg 517 the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 15 91 may https in the early part of the day he seems literally to vomit up his notes apparently with much labor and effort they gurgle and blubber up out of him falling on the ear with peculiar subtile ring of turning water from glass jug and not without certain pleasing cadence neither is the common woodpecker entirely insensible to the wooing of the spring and like the partridge testiﬁes his appreciation of melody after quite primitive fashion passing through the woods on some clear still morning in march while the metallic ring and tension of winter are still in the earth and air the silence is suddenly broken by long resonant hammering upon dry limb or stub it is downy beating reveille to spring in the utter stillness and amid the rigid forms we listen with pleasure and it comes to my ear oftener at this season than at any other i freely exonerate the author of it from the imputation of any gastronomic motives and credit him with genuine musical performance it is to be expected therefore that will respond to the general tendency and contribute his part to the spring chorus his april call is his ﬁnest touch his most musical expression i recall an ancient maple standing sentry to large sugar that year after year afforded protection to brood of in its decayed heart week or two before the nesting seemed actually to have begun three or four of these birds might be seen on almost any bright morning gambolling and courting amid its decayed branches sometimes you would hear only gentle persuasive cooing or quiet conﬁdential chattering that long loud call taken up by ﬁrst one then another they sat about upon the naked limbs sort of wild rollicking laughter intermingled with various cries yelps and squeals if some incident had excited their mirth and ridicule whether this social hilarity and boistero usness is in celebration of the pairing or mating ceremony or whether it is only sort of annual common among holes on resuming their summer quarters is question upon which i reserve my judgment unlike most of his kinsmen the ing prefers the ﬁelds and the borders of the forest to the deeper seclusion of the woods hence contrary to the habit of his tribe obtains most of his subsistence from the ground boring ants and crickets he is not quite satisﬁed with being woodpeck er he courts the society of the robin and the finches abandons the trees the meadow and feeds eagerly upon berries and grain what may be the ﬁnal upshot of this course of living is question worthy the attention of darwin will his taking to the ground and his pedestrian feats result in lengthening his legs his feeding upon berries and grains subdue his tints and soften his voice and his associating with robin put song into his heart indeed what would be more interesting than the history of our birds the last two or three centuries there can be doubt that the presence of man has exerted very marked and friendly inﬂuence upon them since they so multiply in his society the birds of california it is said were mostly silent till after its settlement and i doubt if the indians heard the we hear him where did the bobolink disport himself before there were meadows in the north and in the south was he the same blithe beau then now and the sparrow the lark and the goldﬁnch birds that seem so indigenous to the open ﬁelds and so averse to the woods can not conceive of their existence in vast wilderness and without man did they grow like the ﬂowers when the conditions favorable to their existence were established but to return the bluebird and these universal favorites and ﬁrstlings of the spring come before april and their names are household words may is the month of the swallows and the orioles there are many other distinguished arrivals indeed nine tenths of the birds are here by the last week in may yet the swallows and orioles are the most conspicuous the bright plumage of the latter seems really like an arrival from the tropics i see them ﬂash through the blossoming trees and pg 518 the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 15 91 may https the forenoon hear their incessant warbling and wooing the swallows dive and chatter about the barn or squeak and build beneath the eaves the partridge drums in the fresh unfolding woods the long tender note of the comes up from the meadow and at sunset from every marsh and pond come the ten thousand voices of the hylas may is the transition month and exists to connect april and june the root with the ﬂower with june the cup is full our hearts are satisﬁed there is more to be desired the perfection of the season among other things has brought the perfection of the song and plumage of the birds the master artists are all here and the expectations excited by the robin and the are fully justiﬁed the thrushes have all come and i sit down upon the ﬁrst rock with hands full of the pink azalea to listen with the cuckoo does not arrive till june and often the goldﬁnch the the scarlet tanager delay their coming till then in the meadows the bobolink is in all his glory in the high pastures the sings his breezy vesper and the woods are unfolding to the music of the thrushes the cuckoo is one of the most solitary birds of our forests and is strangely tame and quiet appearing equally untouched by joy or grief fear or anger is he an exile from some other sphere and are his loneliness and indifference the result of hopeless yet resigned soul or has he passed through some terrible calamity or bereavement that has overpowered his sensibilities rendering him dreamy and something remote seems ever weighing upon his mind he deposits his eggs in the nests of other birds having heart work or domestic care his note or call is of one lost or wandering and the farmer says is prophetic of rain amid the general joy and the sweet assurance of things i love to listen to this strange clairvoyant call heard quarter of mile away coming up from the dark bosom of the forest or out from the sombre recesses of the mountain like the voice of muezzin calling to prayer in the oriental twilight it has peculiar fascination he wanders from place to place an invisible thing voice mystery you will probably hear him score of times to seeing him once i rarely discover him in the woods except when on protracted stay but when in june he makes his gastronomic tour of the garden and orchard regaling himself upon canker he is quite noticeable since food of some kind is necessity he seems resolved to burde n himself little possible with the care of obtaining it and so devours these creeping horrors with the utmost matter air at this time he is one of the tamest birds in the orchard and will allow you to approach within few yards of him i have even come within few feet of one without seeming to excite his fear or suspicion he is quite unsophisticated or else royally indif ferent without any exception his plumage is the richest brown i am acquainted with in nature and is unsurpassed in the qualities both of ﬁrmness and ﬁneness notwithsta nding the disparity in size and color he has certai n peculiarities that remind one of the passenger pigeon his eye with its red circle the shape of his head and his motions on alighting and taking ﬂight quickly suggest the resemblance though in grace and speed when on the wing he is far inferior his tail seems disproportionately long like that of the red thrush and his ﬂight among the trees is very still contrasting strongly with the honest clatter of the robin or pigeon have you heard the song of the if you have lived in pastoral country with broad upland pastures you could hardly have missed him wilson i believe calls him the and was evidently unacquainted with his powers of song the two white lateral quills in his tail and his habit of running and skulking few yards in advance of you you walk through the ﬁelds are sufﬁcient to identify him not in meadows or orchards but in high breezy will you look him his song is most noticeable after sundown when other birds are silent which reason he pg 519 the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 15 91 may https been aptly called the vesper the farmer following his team from the ﬁeld at dusk catches his sweetest strain his song is not so brisk and varied that of the sparrow being softer and wilder swee ter and more plaintive add the best parts of the lay of the latter to the sweet vibrating chant of the and you have the evening hymn of the vesper poet of the plain unadorned pastures go to those broad smooth ﬁelds where the cattle and sheep are grazing and sit down in the twilight on one of those warm clean stones and listen to this song on every side near and remote from out the short grass which the herds are cropping the strain rises two or three long silver notes of peace and rest ending in some subdued trills and quavers constitute each separate song often you will catch only one or two of the bars the breeze having blown the minor part away such unambitious quiet unconscious melody it is one of the most characteristic sounds in nature the grass the stones the stubble the furrow the quiet herds and the warm twilight among the hills are all subtilely expressed in this song this is what they are at last capable of the female builds plain nest in the open ﬁeld without so much bush or thistle or tuft of grass to protect it or mark its site you may step upon it or the cattle may tread it into the ground but the danger from this source i presume the bird considers less than that from another skunks and foxes have very impertinent curiosity finchie well knows bank or hedge or rank growth of grass or thistles that might promise protection and cover to mouse or bird these cunning rogues would be apt to explore most thoroughly the partridge is undoubtedly acquainted with the same process of reasoning like the vesper she too nests in open unprotected places avoiding all show of concealment from the tangled and almost impenetrable parts of the forest to the clean open woods where she can command all the approaches and ﬂy with equal ease in any direction one of the most marvellous little songsters whose acquaintance i claim is the flycatcher he seems to have been listened to by unappreciative ears i know one who has made especial mention of him his song is not particularly sweet and soft on the contrary it is little hard and shrill like that of the or oriole but ﬂuency volubility execution and power of imitation he is unsurpassed and in the particular unequalled by any of our northern birds his ordinary note is forcible and emphatic but stated not especially musical he seems to say hiding himself in the low dense under growth and eluding your most vigilant search if playing some part in game but in july or august if you are on good terms with the sylvan deities you may listen to far more rare and artistic performance your ﬁrst impression will be that that cluster of azalea or that clump of conceals three or four different songster s each vying with the others to lead the chorus such medley of notes snatched from half the songsters of the ﬁeld and forest and uttered with the utmost clearness and rapidity i am sure you can not hear short of the haunts of the genuine if not fully and accurately repeated there are at least suggested the notes of the robin wren goldﬁnch and sparrow the pip pip of the last is produced so accurately that i verily believe it would deceive the bird herself the whole uttered in such rapid succession that it seems if the movement that gives the concluding note of one strain must form the ﬁrst note of the next the effect is very rich and to my ear entirely unique the performer is very careful not to reveal himself in the mean time yet there is conscious air about the strain that impresses one with the idea that his presence is understood and his attention courted tone of pride and glee and occasio nally of bantering jocoseness is discernible i believe it is only rarely and when he is sure of his audience that he displays his parts in this manner you are to look him not in tall trees or deep forests but in low dense shrubbery about wet places where there are plenty of gnats and mosquitoes the is another marvellous songster in speaking of whom it is difﬁcult to avoid superlatives he is not so conscious of his powers and so ambitious of effect the flycatcher yet you will not be less astonished and delighted on hearing him he possesses the ﬂuency volubility and copiousness which the wrens are noted and besides these qualities and what is rarely found conjoined with them wild sweet pg 520 the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 15 91 may https cadence that holds you entranced i shall not soon forget that perfect june day when loitering in low ancient hemlock in whose cathedral aisles the coolness and freshness seemed perennial the silence was suddenly broken by strain so rapid and gushing and touched with such wild sylvan plaintiveness that i listened in amazement and so shy and coy was the little minstrel that i came twice to the woods before i was sure to whom i was listening in summer he is one of those birds of the deep northern forests that like the speckled canada warbler and the only the privileged ones hear the distribution of plants in given locality is not more marked and deﬁned than that of the birds show botanist landscape and he will tell you where to look the slipper the columbine or the harebel on the same principles the ornithologist will direct you where to look the hooded warbler the or the chewink in adjoining counties in the same latitude and equally inland but possessing different geological formation and different you will observe quite different class of birds in country of the beech and maple i not ﬁnd the same songsters that i know where thrive the oak chestnut and laurel in going from district of the old red sandstone to where i walk upon the old plutonic rock not ﬁfty miles distant i miss in the woods the veery the the warbler the warbler the warbler the black and yellow warbler and many others and ﬁnd in their stead the the chewink the redstart the the flycatcher the flycatcher the quail and the dove in my neighborhood here in the highlands the distribution is very marked south of the village i invariably ﬁnd one species of birds of it another in only one locality full of azalea and i am always sure of ﬁnding the hooded warbler in dense under growth of and alder i meet the warbler in remote clearing covered with heath and fern with here and there chestnut and an oak i go to hear in july the and returning by stumpy shallow pond i am sure to ﬁnd the only one locality within my range seems to possess attractions all comers here one may study almost the entire ornithology of the state it is rocky piece of ground long ago cleared but now fast relapsing into the wildness and freedom of nature and marked by those features which birds and boys love it is bounded on two sides by the village and highway crossed at various points by and threaded in all directions by paths and along which soldiers laborers and truant schoolboys are passing at all hours of the day it is so far escaping from the axe and the bushwhack to have opened communication with the forest and mountain beyond by straggling lines of cedar laurel and blackberry the ground is mainly occu pied with cedar and chestnut with an under growth in many places of heath and bramble the chief feature however is dense growth in the centre consisting of beech alder hazel with network of smilax and grape little stream the draining of swamp beyond which passes through this accounts many of its features and productions if not its entire existence birds that are not attracted by the heath or the cedar and chestnut are sure to ﬁnd some excuse visiting this miscellaneous growth in the centre most of the common birds literally throng this inclosure and i have met here many of the rarer species such the flycatcher the solitary warbler the inged arbler the warbler the etc the absence of all birds of prey and the great number of ﬂies and insects both the result of proximity to the village are considerations which minstrel passes over lightly hence the popularity of the resort but the crowning glory of all these robins flycatchers and warblers is the thrush more abundant than all other birds except the robin and he greets you from every rock and shrub shy and reserved when he ﬁrst

of the precious charge it seemed if the clear creature had resolved if possible to avoid all observation the the and the veery turdus wilsonii are our peers of song the undoubtedly possesses the greatest range of mere talent the most varied executive ability and neve r fails to surprise and delight one anew at each hearing but being mostly an imitator he never approaches the serene beauty and sublimity of the the word that best expresses my feelings on hearing the is admiration though the ﬁrst emotion is one of surprise and incredulity that so many and such various notes should proceed from one throat is marvel and we regard the performance with feelings akin to those we experience on witne ssing the astounding feats of the athlete or gymnast this notwithstanding many of the notes imitated have all the freshness and sweetness of the original the emotions excited by the songs of these thrushes belong to higher order springing they from our deepest sense of the beauty and harmony of the world the is worthy of all and more than all the praises he has received and considering the number of his appreciative listeners it is not little surprising that his relative and superior the should have received so little notice both the great ornithologists wilson and audubon are lavish in their praises of the former but have little or nothing to say of the song of the latter audubon

the period of song only in the deepest and most remote forests usually in damp and swampy localities on this account the people in the adirondack region call it the swamp angel its being so much of recluse account s the comparative ignorance that prevails in regard to it the cast of its song is so much like that of the that an enthusiastic admirer of the latter bird all admirers are would be quite apt to mistake it the strain of his favorite observing only how unusually well he sings i myself erred in this manner and not till i had shot the bird in the midst of his solemn hard thing to i assure i aware that my had superior i believe so good an observer thoreau has confounded the songs of the two birds he speaks of having heard the in the forests of northern maine where the law of geographical distribution would lead one to look only the hermit the song of this thrush is of unparallel ed sweetness and sublimity there is calmness and solemnity about it that suggests in nature perpetual sabbath and perennial joy how vain seem our hurry and ambition clear and serene strong and melodious falling softly yet ﬂowing far these notes inspire with calm sacred enthusiasm i hear him most in the afternoon but occasionally at nightfall he pours his pure soprano deepening the silence with diviner calm i have known one to sit hours in the upper branches of tall maple in an opening in remote wood and sing till all other birds seemed if pausing to listen attempting to approach him at such times i have called to my aid numerous devices keeping the range of tree skulking close to the

while singing on low stump without his seeming to notice at all i think his song in form and manner is precisely that of the fering from it in being more wild and ethere al well stronger and clearer it is not the execution of the piece so much the tone of the instrument that is superior in the subdued trills and quavers that occur between the main bars you think his tongue must be more resonant

songsters he is truly royal minstrel and considering his liberal distribution throughout our atlantic seaboard perhaps contributes more than any other bird to our sylvan melody one may object that he spends little too much time in tuning his instrument yet his careless and uncertain touches reveal its rare compass and power he is the only songster of my acquaintance excepting the canary that displays different degrees of proﬁciency in the exercise of his musical gifts not long since while walking one sunday in the edge of an orchard adjoining wood i heard one that so obviously and unmistakably surpassed all his rivals that my companion though slow to notice such things remarked it wonderingly and with one accord we threw ourselves upon the grass and drank in the bounteous melody it was not different in quality so much in quantity such ﬂood of it such magniﬁcent copiousness such long trilling deferring accelerating preludes such sudden ecstatic overtures would have intoxicated the dullest ear he was really without compeer master artist twice afterward i was conscious of having heard the same bird the is the handsomest species of this family in grace and elegance of manner he has equal such gentle air and such inimitable ease and composure in his ﬂight and movement he is poet in very word and deed his carriage is music to the eye his performance of the commonest act catching beetle or picking worm from the mud pleases like stroke of wit or eloquence was he prince in the olden time and the regal grace and mien still adhere to him in his transformation what ﬁnely proportioned form how plain yet rich his color bright russet of his back the clear white of his breast with the distinct spots it may be objected to robin that he is noisy and demonstrative he hurries away or rises to branch with an angry note and ﬂirts his wings in suspicion the mavis or red thrush sneaks and skulks like culprit hiding in the densest alders the is coquette and ﬂirt well sort of female paul pry and the chewink shows his inhospitality by espying your movements like japanese the has none of these under traits he regards unsuspiciously or avoids with noble reserve if i am quiet and incurious gracio usly hops toward if to pay his respects or to make my acquaintance pass near his nest under the very branch within few feet of his mate and brood and he opens not his beak he concedes you the right to pass there if it lies in your course but pause an instant raise your hand toward the defenceless household and his anger and indignation are beautiful to behold what noble pride he has late one october after his mates and companions had long since gone south i noticed one several successive days in the dense part of this door wood ﬂitting noiselessly about very grave and silent if doing penance some violation of the code of honor by many gentle indirect approaches i perceived that part of his were undeveloped the sylvan prince could not think of returning to court in this plight so amid the falling leaves and cold rains of autumn was patiently biding his time the soft mellow ﬂute of the veery ﬁlls place in the chorus of the woods that the song of the vesper ﬁlls in the chorus of the ﬁelds it has the nightingale habit of pg 524 the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 15 91 may https in the twilight and possesses i believe all of the nightingale mellowness and serenity walk out toward the forest in the warm twilight of june day and when ﬁfty rods distant you will hear their soft reverberating notes repeated and prolonged with exquisite melodiousness rising from dozen dif ferent throats it is one of the simplest strains to be heard simple the curve in form and mellower than the tenderest tones of the ﬂute from the pure element of harmony and beauty it contains and not from any novel or fantastic modulation of it thus contrasting strongly with such rollicking hilarious songsters the bobolink in whom we are chieﬂy pleased with the tintinnabulation the verbal and labial excellence and the evident conceit and delight of the performer i hardly know whether i am more pleased or annoyed with the perhaps she is little too common and her part in the general chorus little too conspicuous if you are listening the note of another bird she is sure to be prompted to the most loud and protracted singing drowning all other sounds if you sit quietly down to observe favorite or study new comer her curiosity knows bounds and you are scanned and ridiculed from every point of observa tion yet i would not miss her i would only subordinate her little make her less conspicuous she is the parodist of the woods and there is ever mischievous bantering undertone in her lay if she were conscious of mimicking and disconcerting some envied songster ambitious of song practising and rehearsing in private she yet seems the least sincere and genuine of the sylvan minstrels if she had taken up music only to be in the fashion or not to be outdone by the robins and thrushes in other words she seems to sing from some outward motive and not from inward joyousness she is good versiﬁer but not great poet vigorous rapid copious not without ﬁne touches but destitute of any high serene melody her performance like that of thoreau squirrel always implies spectator there is certain air and polish abou t her strain however like that in the vivacious conversation of lady of the world that commands respect her maternal instinct also is very strong and that simple structure of dead twigs and dry grass is the centre of much anxious solicitude not long since while strolling through the woods my attention was attracted to small densely grown swamp hedged in with eglantine brambles and the everlasting smilax from which proceeded loud cries of distress and alarm indicating that some terrible calamity was threatening my minstrel on effecting an entrance which however was not accomplished till i had doffed coat and hat so to diminish the surface exposed to the thorns and brambles and looking around from square yard of terra ﬁrma i found myself the spectator of loathsome yet fascinating scene three or four yards from was the nest beneath which in long festoons rested huge black snake bird two thirds grown was slowly disappearing between his expanded jaws they seemed unconscious of my presence i quietly observed the proceedings by slow degrees he compassed the bird about with his elastic mouth his head ﬂattened his neck writhed and swelled and two or three undulatory movements of his glistening body ﬁnished the work then with marvellous ease he cautiously raised himself up his tongue ﬂaming from his mouth the while curved over the nest and with wavy subtle motions explored the interior i can conceive of nothing more overpoweringly terrible to an unsuspecting family of birds than the sudden appearance above their domicile of the head and neck of this it is enough to petrify the blood in their veins not ﬁnding the object of his search he came streaming down from the nest to lower limb and commenced extending his researches in other directions sliding stealthily through the branches bent on capturing one of the parent birds that legless wingless creature should move with such ease and rapidity where only birds and squirrels are considered at home lifting himself up letting himself down running out on the yielding boughs and traversing with marvellous celerity the whole length and breadth of the thicket was truly surprising one thinks of the great myth of the tempter and the cause of all our woe and wonders if the arch one is not now playing off some of his pranks before him whether we call it snake or devil matters pg 525 the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 15 91 may https i could but admire his terrible beauty however his black shining folds his easy gliding movement head erect eyes glistening tongue playing like subtile ﬂame and the invisible means of his almost winged locomotion the parent birds in the mean while kept up the most agonizing cry times ﬂuttering furiously about their pursuer and actually laying hold of his tail with their beaks and claws on being thus attacked the snake would suddenly double upon himself and follow his own body back thus executing strategic movement that at ﬁrst seemed almost to paralyze his victim and place her within his grasp not quite however before his jaws could close upon the coveted prize the bird would tear herself away and appare ntly faint and sobbing retire to higher branch his reputed powers of fascination availed him little though it is possible that more timid and less combative bird might have been held by the fatal spell presently he came gliding down the slender body of leaning alder his attention was attracted by slight movement of my arm eying an instant with that crouching utter motionless gaze which i believe only snakes and devils can assume he turned quickly feat which necessitated something like crawling over his own body glided off through the branches evidently recognizing in representative of the ancient parties he once so cunningly ruined few moments after he lay carelessly disposed in the top of rank alder trying to look much like crooked branch his supple shining form would admit the old vengeance overtook him i exercised my prerogative and missile in the shape of stone brought him looping and writhing to the ground after i had completed his downfall and quiet had been partially restored member of the bereaved household came out from his and jumping upon decayed branch chirped vigorously doubt in celebration of the victory what the emotions of the parent birds were on seeing their destroyer head so thoroughly bruised and part of their little ones at least spared to them i can only conjecture but i imagined the news spread immediately and that my praises the deliverer were sung in that neighborhood ever after till the middle of july there is general equilibrium the tide stands poised the spirit is unabated but the harvest ripens beneath the long hot days the melody gradually ceases the young are out of the nest and must be cared and the moulting season is at hand after the cricket has commenced to drone his monotonous refrain beneath your window you will not till another season hear the in all his matchless eloquence the bobolink has become careworn and fretful and blurts out snatches of his song between his scolding and upbraiding you approach the vicinity of his nest oscillating between anxiety his brood and solicitude his musical reputation some of the sparrows still sing and occasionally across the hot ﬁelds from tall tree in the edge of the forest comes the rich note of the scarlet tanager this colored bird loves the hottest weather and i hear him more in than at any other time the remainder of the summer is the carnival of the swallows and flycatchers flies and insects to any amount are to be had the catching and the opportunit y is well improved see that sombre pewee on yonder branch true sportsman he who never takes his game at rest but always on the wing you vagrant fly you purblind moth beware how you come within his range observe his attitude you might think him studying the atmosphere or the light he has an air of contemplation and not of watchfulness but step closer observe the curious movement of his head his eye in ﬁne frenzy rolling glancing from heav en to earth from earth to heaven his sight is microscopic and his aim sure quick thought he has seized his victim and is back to his perch there is strife pursuit fell swoop and the matter is ended that little sparrow you will observe is less skilled it is the socialis and he ﬁnds his subsistence properly in various seeds and the larvae of insects though he occasionally has higher aspirations and seeks to emulate the pewee commencing and ending his career flycatcher by an awkward chase after beetle or miller he is hunting around in the grass now i suspect with the desire to indulge this favorite whim there opportunity is afforded him away goes little in the most tortuous course he is capable of and away goes socialis in pursuit the contest is quite pg 526 the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 15 91 may https though i dare say it is serious enough to the moth the chase continues few yards when there is sudden rushing to cover in the grass taking to wing again when the search has become too close and the moth has recovered his wind socialis chirps angrily and is determined not to be beaten keeping with the slightest effort upon the heels of the fugitive he is ever on the point of halting to snap him up but never quite does it so between disappointment and expectation is soon disgusted and returns to pursue his more legitimate means of subsistence in striking contrast to this strife of the sparrow and the moth is the hawk pursuit of the sparrow or the goldﬁnch it is race of surprising speed and agility it is test of wing and wind every muscle is taxed and every nerve strained such cries of terror and consternation on the part of the bird tacking to the right and left and making the most desperate efforts to escape and such silent determination on the part of the hawk pressing the bird so closel y ﬂashing and turning and timing his movements with those of the pursued accurately and inexorably if the two constituted one body excite feeling of deep interest you mount the fence or rush out of your way to see the issue the only salvation the bird is to adopt the tactics of the moth seeking instantly the cover of some tree bush or hedge where its smaller size enables it to move about more rapidly these pirates are aware of this and therefore prefer to take their prey by one fell swoop you may see one of them prowling through an orchard with the yellowbirds hovering about him crying in the most desponding tone yet he seems not to regard them knowing they that in the close branches they are safe if in wall of adamant august is the month of the hawks the is the most noticeable he likes the haze and the calm of these long warm days he is bird of leisure and seems always at his ease how beautiful and majestic are his movements so and easy such an entire absence of haste such magniﬁcent amplitude of circles and spirals such haughty imperial grace and occasionally such daring aërial evolutions with slow leisurely movement rarely vibrating his pinions he mounts and mounts in an ascending spiral till he appears mere speck against the summer sky then if the mood seizes him with wings like bent bow he will cleave the air almost perpendicularly if intent on dashing himself to pieces against the earth but on nearing the ground he suddenly mounts again on broad expanded wing if rebounding upon the air and sails leisurely away it is the sublimest feat of the season one holds his breath till he sees him rise again sometimes squirrel or bird or an unsuspecting fowl is scathed and withered beneath this terrible visitation if inclined to more gradual and less precipitous descent he ﬁxes his eye on some distant point in the earth beneath him and thither bends his course he is still almost meteoric in his speed and boldness you see his path down the heavens straight line if near you hear the rush of his wings his shadow hurtles across the ﬁelds and in an instant you see him quietly perched upon some low tree or decayed stub in swamp or meadow with reminiscences of frogs and mice stirring in his maw when the blows it is study to see three or four of these at the head of the valley far up toward the moun tain balancing and oscillating upon the strong current now quite stationary except slight tremulous motion like the poise of dancer then rising and falling in long undulations and seeming to resign themselves passively to the wind or again sailing high and level far above the mountain peak bluster and haste but stated occasionally terrible earnestness and speed fire at him he sails overhead and unless wounded badly he will not change his course or gait his ﬂight is perfect picture of repose in motion he might sleep dream in that level effortless aimless sail it strikes the eye more surprising than the ﬂight of the pigeon and swallow even in that the effort put forth is so uniform and delicate to escape observation giving to the movement an air of buoyancy and perpetuity the efﬂuence of power rather than the conscious application of it pg 527 the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly

in that aërial spiral and mounts and mounts till his pursuers grow dizzy and return to earth again it is quite original this mode of getting rid of an unworthy opponent rising to heights where the braggart is dazed and bewild ered and loses his reckoning i am not sure but it is worthy of imitation but summer wanes and autumn approa ches the songsters of the are silent at the reaping of the

eternity my student life at hofwyl there ﬂourished in the heart of the swiss republic during some twenty or years commencing about the year 1810 an educational institution in the nature of private college which though it attracted much public attention at the time being noticed with commendation i remember in report made by the count capo to the emperor alexander of russia yet has never i think been appreciated at its full deserts nor generally recognized the admirable institution it was lleled in the character of the spirit which pervaded it and in many of the practical results obtained by any establishment learning that has ever come under my observation i was educated there from the age of sixteen or seventeen to twenty passing into its tranquil scenes from the quiet of home and the hands of private tutor with the sunny hopes and high ideal and scanty experience of youth much that i found there appeared to at the time but natural and in the ordinary course of things which now by the light of life teachings and by comparison with the realities i have found them seems to pg 550 the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 15 91 may https i look back rather in the nature of dream of fancy tinged with the glamour of optimism than like the things one really meets with in the world i say this after making what i think due allowance the tints in which youth is wont to invest its early recollections it was one of several public institutions education founded by the benevolent enterprise of very remarkable man emanuel von f ellenberg was born of patrician family of bern his father had been member of the swiss government and friend of the celebrated pestalozzi friendship which descended to the son his mother was descendant of the stout van tromp the dutch admiral who was victor in more than thirty engagements and whose spirit and courage she is said to have inherited to this noble woman young fellenber g owed ideas of liberty and philanthropy beyond the age in which he lived and the aristocratic class to which he belonged educated at colmar and tübingen the years immediately succeeding his college life were spent in travels which brought him at the age of and just after the death of robespierre to paris where he had an opportunity of studying men in the subsiding tumult of terrible revolution the result appears to have been conviction that the true element of human progress was to be found less in correction of the adult than in training of the youth his mind imbued with the two great ideas of freedom and education he returned to his native bern but taking part there against the french he was banished remaining in germany an exile several years and during that period planning emigration with several friends to the united states this intention he abandoned on being recalled to his native country and there offered important diplomatic and military service in the latter capacity he quelled an insurrection of the peasantry in the oberland but prompted by that sympathy the laboring classes which was strong element in his character he granted these people terms so liberal that his government refused to ratify them whereupon he threw up his commission recurring to his favorite educational projects and serving time on the board of education in bern but it soon became apparent that the ideas of his colleagues and himself differed too widely to permit united action they were thinking of the commonplace routine of school instruction writing arithmetic and the like he looked to education the regenerating agent of the world agent without the aid of which liberty runs into license and the rule of the many he had witnessed it in terror france may become one of the worst forms of despotism he looked beyond mere pedagogical routine or formal learning to the living spirit the harmonious development of every human faculty and af fection intellectual moral spiritual resigning his situation on the bernese board of education fellenber g expende d large fortune in the purchase of the estate of hofwyl about two leagues from bern and the erection there of the building necessary to carry into ef fect his own peculiar views it was favorite idea of his that society can be most effectually inﬂuenced good by training its extremes in social position those on the one hand who are born to wealth and station whence are usually chosen lawgivers statesmen leaders of public opinion and those on the other hand born to heritage of ignorance and neglect and too often trained even from tender age to vice and violence he sought to bring these extremes of european society into harmonious relation with each other raise the one from hereditary dependence and degradation to imbue the other with healthy ideas of true nobility in place of the morbid prejudices of artiﬁcial rank in both these efforts he was eminently successful the latter more so in my judgment than any educator of his age the establishments of hofwyl proper were accordingly two in number quite distinct from each other the vehrli boys they were called from the name of their admirable young teacher vehrli essentially an agricultural school on the principle and the college of which it is my chief object to sketch the plan pg 551 the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 15 91 may https its results to this latter institution in consequence of the numerous and expensive branches taught and the great number of professors employed about one to each four students those only with few exceptions could obtain admission whose parents possessed ample means exceptions being the sons of few of fellenber g swiss friends in moderate circumstances whom when they showed great promise he admitted with little or charge it was by associating these with his own children in their studies that the nucleus of this college was originally formed from their very inception these projects met with discouragement and opposition especially from the patrician class to which fellenber g belonged even in republican switzerland these men held that their rank exonerated them from any occup ation that savored much of utility and it was with feeling almost of dishonor to their order that they saw one of their number stoop it was thus they phrased it to the ignob le task of preceptor it need hardly be said that fellenber g held on his way undisturbed by the idle noise of prejudice like this into the vehrli school were received destitute orphans foundlings and those whose parents were too indigent to provide their education their time was divided nearly equally between the labors of the ﬁeld and the lessons of the school they were trained farmers and teachers besides the ordinary branches they were well grounded in botany and drawing and made great proﬁciency in vocal music vehrli devoted hims elf heart and soul to the instruction of these children he worked with them studied with them wore the same homely dress partook of the same plain fare slept in the same dormitory short spent his life wholly among them after time his pupils were in great request throughout europe both teachers and agricultural superintendents i found one of them when many years since i visited holland intrusted with the care of public seminary supported by the dutch gover nment and his employers highly appre ciated his character and abilities the children remained till they were of age repaying by their labor in the latter years portion of the expenses of their early education ultimately this school became nearly between vehrli children we used to call them and ourselves there was not much communication we met occasionally only but when we did meet there existed the most friendly relations between us i saw but little of the internal arrangements of that establishment and am unable at this distance of time to furnish detailed information regarding it i proceed to give some account of the college of which three years i was student of that little republic it can truly be said that its tranquillity was never disturbed by one dividing prejudice of rank of country or of religion we had among our number usually amounting to one hundred students dukes and princes some of them related to crowned heads and we had the recipients already alluded to of fellenber g bounty but not in word or bearing was there aught to mark difference of artiﬁcial rank we had swiss germans russians prussians dutch french italians english and i know not what other nationalities but not one unkindly sentiment or illiberal prejudice arose among us on account of birthplace we had protestants catholics members of the greek church and members of church at all but never in language or feeling did i perceive any shade of coldness or aversion that had its rise in theological differences fellenber g had succeeded in instilling into our little community his own noble principles of republican dignity cosmopolitan amity and religious toleration one was addressed by his title and to the of english universities it will appear scarcely credible that i lived several weeks student at hofwyl before i accidentally learned who were the princ es and other nobles and who the objects of fellenber g charity it was i think some six weeks or two months after my arrival that i was conversing with with whom i had become well acquainted under his familiar nickname of stösser i remarked to him that before i reached hofwyl i had heard that there were several noblemen there and i asked what had become of them pg 552 the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 15 91 may https why said he smiling they are here still indeed said i which are they he requested to guess i named several of the students who had appeared to to have the greatest consideration among their fellows he shook his head and laughed these are all merchants and commoners try again i did so but with better success and at last he named to my surprise several young men who had seemed to to have but an indifferent share of inﬂuence or respect the rest one who was slightingly treated and avoided rather than sought by his companions he was the nephew of the king of würtember day or two afterwards i chanced to learn that the young man whom i had thus questioned was himself russian prince grandson of the noted suwarof f suwarof he had charge of our ﬂock of goats of which i shall have occasion to speak and he took to the ofﬁce very kindly in like manner it might have puzzled after residence to call to mind whether those with whom i was intimate with my own brother were protestants or catholics or neither and at this distance of time i have forgotten the reason is simple we never debated on theological subjects at all fellenber g read to us occasional lectures on religion but they were practical not doctrinal those essentials which belong to all christian sects thus suiting protestant and catholic alike the catholics it is true had from time to time priest to confess them who doubtless enjoined the regular weekly fast yet we of the protestant persuasion used i believe to eat much ﬁsh and many frogs on fridays they striking feature in our system of instruction was the absence of all punishment except such was under code of laws of our own hereafter to be noticed twice or perhaps three times during the term of my residence one of the pupils on account of repeated inattention or similar venial cause was requested by the professor during the course of the recitation to leave the room but this was quite an event to be talked of week so contrary was it to the regular quiet uncoercing routine of the institution expulsion ever occurred i not myself remember to have received either from fellenber g or from any of his professors one harsh word during the three happy years i spent at hofwyl the mildness with which the students were treated by their instructors reacted upon them in their intercourse with each other duels so common among the students of german universities were an absurdity though we had and took regular lessons in the use of the small sword skill in the management of which was considered an indispensable item in the education of gentleman quarrels such elsewhere terminate in blows were scarcely known among us i recall but two both of which were immediately arrested by the spectators who felt their college dishonored by such an exhibition of evil passion and violence one of these was commenced by youth coming only two weeks before from an english school the other occurred one evening when small party of us had assemb led in private room between ﬁery young prussian count and sturdy unbending swiss the dispute grew warm and was about to proceed to extremities when we who were made scruple to terminate it in our own way we pounced upon the disputants without warning carried them off each to his own room on our shoulders and there with hearty laugh at their folly set them down to cool all this was done so suddenly and so that they themselves could not refrain from joining in the merriment which so whimsical conclusion to their quarrel had elicited i have heard and read much of the pluck and manliness that are supposed to grow out of the english habit of settling school quarrels by boxing after the fashion of in the ring but i not think it would have been very safe experiment one of these pugilistic young gentlemen to offer an insult to hofwyl student even though the manhood of this latter had never been tested by pounding another face with his ﬁst pg 553 the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 15 91 may https and cowardice are often close allies and his anger when roused is most to be dreaded who so bears himself to give one just cause of offence and duels are becoming they ought to be like the ordeal by combat antiquat ed modes of testing the courage or settling the disputes whether of boys or men among the civilized portion of mankind but though little prone to quarrel our indignation i must confess was sometimes readily enough roused when occasion called it forth i remember an instance in which perhaps the conservative portion of my readers may think we carried matters somewhat to an extreme it happened that three ofﬁcers of distinction from the court of würtember g arrived one day on visit to fellenber they desired to see their sovereign nephew the same prince alexander of würtember g to whom i have already alluded being favorite among us he was accordingly sent and the interview took place in an open space in front of fellenber g schloss where four or ﬁve students of whom i was one happened to be at the time not more than eight or ten steps distant the ofﬁcers they approached the prince uncovered and stood during the conversation which ensued with their plumed hats in their hands the young man on the contrary whose silly airs had been chief cause of his unpopularity among us did not remove the little he wore but remained covered without any intimation to his visitors to resume their hats this was too much us look said one of our group if there is that fellow alexander standing with his cap on and letting these ofﬁcers talk to him bareheaded and then raising his voice so to be heard by the parties concerned he said alexander take of f your cap but the cap did not stir we took step or two nearer and another of our party said alexander if you take that cap of f yourself i come and take it of f you this time the admonition had effect the cap was slowly removed and we remained to make sure that it was not resumed until the ofﬁcers bowing low took their leave carrying i fear to their royal master very favorable report touching the courtly manners of hofwyl it was small marvel that an institution of practice so democratically heterodox should awaken the jealousy of european legitimacy and it was probably with feeling s more of sorrow than surprise that fellenber g about the year 1822 received from the austrian authorities formal intimation that austrian subject would thereafter be allowed to enter the college and an order that those who were then studying there should instantly return home than this tyrannical edict of the austrian autocrat b the same who did not blush to declare that he desired to have loyal subjects not learned men in his dominions greater compliment could have been paid to fellenber g or his institutions the course of instruction pursued at hofwyl included the study of the greek latin french and german languages the last of which was the language of our college history geography chemistry mech anics in thorough course embracing the highest branches and music vocal and instrumental ﬁnally riding fencing and gymnastics the recitations stunden that is hours we called them each lasted single hour only were essentially conversational the lessons in drawing however extended to two consecutive hours and included copying from the antique there was and considerable stud attached to the college and the highest class were in the habit of riding out once week with fellenber g many of whose practical given i rode by his side during these pleasant excursions i well remember yet the number of professors was large compared to that of the taught being from ﬁve to thirty though the college seldom contained more than one hundred students the number in each class was small usually from ten to ﬁfteen pg 554 the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 15 91 may https and greek though thoroughly taught did not engross the same proportion of time which in many other colleges is devoted to them not more time was given to each than to ancient and modern history and less than to mathematics this last was special object of study it was taught was history by extempore lectures while the students took notes in and we seldom employed any printed work to aid us in the evening in making out from recollection aided by these notes written statement of the propositions and their solution to be handed next day to the professor this plan impressed on our minds not indeed the exact form of words or the particu lar set of phrases of the books but the essential principles of the science that when in after years amid the business of life details and demonstrations had faded from my memory i have never found difﬁculty in working these out afresh and recalling and rearranging them without aid from books one little incident connected with my mathematical studies still comes back to with pleasant impression my chief college friend was young saussure grandson of the naturalist of that name who the ﬁrst with single exception reached the summit of mont blanc the subject of our lecture was some puzzling proposition in the differential calculus and saussure propounded to the professor knotty difﬁculty in connection with it the professor replied unsatisfactorily my friend still pressed his point and the professor rejoined very learnedly and ingeniously but without really meeting the case whereupon saussure silently assented if quite satisﬁed you were not satisﬁed with that explanation said i to saussure we walked to our rooms of course not was his reply but would you have had before the class shame the good man who takes so much pains with us and is usually so clear we must work it out ourselves this triﬂe may afford glimpse of the relation between professor and student at hofwyl there was antagonism between them the former was regarded not pedagogue from whom to stand aloof because of his position of authority natural enemy to be resisted so far resistance was safe an elder friend whom it was privilege and it was one often enjoyed to converse with out of college hours in familiar way during the hours of recreation the professors frequently joine d in our games nor did i observe that this at all diminished the respect we entertained them or the progress we made under their care emulation was limited among us to that which naturally arises among young men prosecuting the same studies it was not artiﬁcially excited there were prizes there was taking rank in classes there was not even the excitement of public examinations many may think this hazardous experiment i am not sure whether classical proﬁciency did not to certain extent suffer from it i am not sure whether some sluggards did not because of it lag behind yet the genera l proﬁciency in learning was satisfactory and the student when he entered the world missed college excitants but bore with him love and habit of study needing spur and which insured the continuance of education far beyond the term of his college years he had learned to seek knowledge itself the pleasing occupation it brings the power it gives the satisfaction it leaves behind and he required more highly seasoned inducements to continue the search through life yet it was not the peculiar mode of imparting instruction nor yet the variety the extent and the utility of the knowledge acquired that chieﬂy characterized the institution of the swiss patriot it was the noble spirit of freedom the purity of motive the independence of purpose the honesty of conduct the kindness of intercourse the union and forbearance and republic anism pervading alike our hours of study of amusement and of social converse these it was that distinguished hofwyl and these it is that still cause its former pupils to look back on the years spent within its peaceful precincts the best and the happiest of their lives pg 555 the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 15 91 may https such results there mainly contributed remarkable feature in the economy of the institution i have been describing feature so far i know not adopted in any similar institution at least to the extent to which it was carried by us i have said that reward and punishment by the college authorities or by fellenber g their head were virtually excluded from this system considering the heterogeneous materials that were collected together from half the nations of the world some having been nursed and petted in the lap of aristocracy and others probably sent thither because their parents could not manage them at home too the comparatively late age at which students enter such college many of them just from schools where severity was the rule and artiﬁcial reward the stimulant all this i doubt whether the mild uncoercing paternal government of hofwyl would have been success but the peculiarity here referred to coming in aid of our teachers and supplying motives and restraints to ourselves it was in this wise hofwyl was not only an institution education it was also an independent governing community it had its code of laws its council of legislation its court of judges its civil and military ofﬁcers its public treasury it had its annual elections by ballot at which each student had vote privileges equally accessible to all labors and duties in which all took share it proposed and debated and enacted its own laws from time to time modifying them but not often nor radically it acted independently of the professors and of fellenber g himself except that our foster pﬂegevater we used to call him retained veto which however like queen victoria he never exercised never i think were laws framed with more single eye to the public good or more strictly obeyed by those who framed them nor was this an unwilling obedience an constrained by fear or force it was given cheerfully honestly we had ourselves assisted in framing and given our votes in enacting our code of laws we felt them to be our own and such it became point of honor with us to conform to them in spirit in letter i know not whether the idea of this juvenile republic verein we called it originated with fellenber g or with some of the students but whatever its origin i believe it to have been the chief lever that raised the moral and social character of our college to the height it ultimately attained it gave birth to public spirit and to social and civic virtues it nurtured conscious independence that submitted with pleasure to what it knew to be the will of the whole and felt itself bound to submit to nothing else it created young republicans and awakened in them that devotion to the public welfare and that zeal the public good which we seek too often alas in vain in older but not wiser communities when i said that we had rewards at hofwyl i ought to have admitted that the annual election to the ofﬁces of our verein acted indirectly powerful stimulus to industry and good conduct at these elections was to be read on moral thermometer the graduated scale of public opinion the result of each election informed us with certainty who had risen and who had fallen in the estimate of his fellows it was felt that public opinion among us enlightened and incorrupt operated with strict justice in that young commonwea lth to deserve well of the republic was to win its conﬁdence and obtain testimonial of its approbation there not one siniste r motive swayed our votes favoritism nor envy nor any selﬁsh inducement there was not even canvassing favorite candidates there was quiet dispassionate discussion of respective merits but the one question which the elector asked himself or his neighbor was who can ﬁll most efﬁciently such or such an ofﬁce answer to that question furnishing the motive decision i can not call to mind single instance during the three years i passed at hofwyl in whic h even suspicion of an electioneering cabal or other factious proceeding attached to an election among us it can scarcely be said that there were candidates any ofﬁce preferment was indeed highly valued testimonial of public conﬁdence but it was not sought directly or indirectly and was accepted rather imposing duty than conferring privilege the lacedemonian who pg 556 the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 15 91 may https he lost his election one of the three hundred went away rejoicing that there were found in sparta three hundred better men than he is extolled model of ideal virtue yet such virtue was matter of common occurrence and of little remark at hofwyl there were not only one or two but many among us who would have sincerely rejoiced to ﬁnd others more capable than themselves preferred to ofﬁce in their stead all this sounds i dare say utopian and extravagant i write it seems to myself so widely at variance with years experience of public life that i should scruple at this distance of time to record it had i not thirty years ago when my recollections were fresh noted them down minutely and conscientiously it avails nothing to tell that such things can not be at hofwyl they were i describe state of society which i witnessed of which i was myself part partial explanation i may state that to ofﬁce among us was attached patronage and salary the proceeds of our public treasury armenkasse we called it to which each contributed according to his means and inclination went exclusively the relief of the poor we had superintendent of the poor and committee whose duty it was to visit the indigent families in our neighborhood ascertain their wants and their character and afford them relief especially in winter this relief was given in the form sometimes of money sometimes of food clothing or furniture to some we furnished goats selected when in milk from ﬂock we had and which were left with them longer or shorter period our fund was ample and i think judiciously dispensed the laws and regulations of our verein extended to the police and the moral government of our little community the students were divided into six circles kreise and the government of each of these we elected guardian or councillor kreisrath these were our most important ofﬁcers province embracing the social life and moral deportment of each member of the kreis this one might imagine would degenerate into an inquisitorial or intermeddling surveillance but in practice it never did each kreis was band of friends and its chief was the friend most valued and esteemed among them it had its weekly meetings and i remember in all my life pleasanter gatherings than these myself kreisrath towards the close of my student life i bore home with more valued memorial than brief letter of farewell expressive of affection and gratitude signed by each member of the kreis our judiciary consisted of bench of three judges whose sessions were held in our principal hall with all due formality sentinels with swords drawn guarding the doors the punishments within its power to inﬂict were vote of censure ﬁnes deprivation of the right of suffrage declaration of ineligibility to ofﬁce and degradation from ofﬁce this last punishment was not inﬂicted on any student during my residence at hofwyl trials were very rare and i not remember one except some venial offence the offender usually pleaded his own cause but if he preferred it he might procure friend to act his advocate the dread of public censure thus declared by sentence after formal trial was great and inﬂuential among us its power may be judged from the following example two german princes sons of wealthy nobleman the prince of tour and taxis having been furnished by their father with larger allowance of than they could legitimately spend at hofwyl conceived somewhat irregular mode of disposing of part of it they were in the habit of occasionally getting up late at night after all their comrades had retired to rest and proceeding to the neighboring village of buchsee there to spend an hour or two in tavern smoking and drinking lager now we had strict college bounds and prohibition against entering tavern though we knew that fellenber g objected to our contracting the latter habit our practice on sundays may illustrate this that day was strictly kept and devoted to religious exercises until midday when we dined after dinner it was given up to pg 557 pg 558 the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 15 91 may https and our favorite sunday recreation was to form into parties of two or three and sally forth ziegenhainer in hand on excursions many miles into the beautiful and richly cultivated rolling country that surrounded us usually ascending some eminence whence we could command full view of the magniﬁcent bernese alps their summits covered with eternal snow it sometimes happened that on these excursions we were overtaken by storm or perhaps having wandered farther than we intended were tired and hungry in either case we did not scruple to enter some country tavern and procure refreshments there but whenever we did so it was written law but custom sanctioned by all our college visit on our return the professor who had charge of the domestic department of our institution short stout man the picture of but not deﬁcient in decision and energy when occasion demanded was our uniform custom to call upon this gentleman herr lippe and inform him that we had visited such or such tavern and the occasion of our doing so benignant smile and his usual it is very well my sons closed such interviews but the use of strange that in german college forbidden by our rules so also was departure after the usual hour of rest from the college buildings except good reason shown thus max and fritz taxis so the youths were called had become of fenders amenable to justice the irregularity of which they had been guilty the only one of the kind i recollect became known accidentally to one of our number there existed among us not even the name of informer it was considered duty to give notice to the proper authorities of any breach of our laws this was accordingly done in the present instance and the brothers were ofﬁcially notiﬁed that on the following day their case would be brought up and they would be heard in their own defence the elder of the two max held some minor ofﬁce and the sentence would probably have been vote of censure or ﬁne both and forfeiture of the ofﬁce in the case of the elder brother but this was more than they could make up their minds to bear accordingly the night previous to their trial they decamped secretly hired carriage at neighboring village and being well provided with money returned to their parents we afterwards ascertained that fellenber g did not send after them in pursuit or otherwise not even write to their parents but suffered the fugitives to tell their own story in their own way the result was that in few weeks the father came bringing with him the runaways and asking favor that fellenber g would once more make trial of them he very willingly did they were received by us with kindness and allusion was ever made to the cause of their absence they remained several years quiet and members of our verein but neither attained to any ofﬁce of trust again our recreations consisted of public games athletic exercises gymnastics was prized above annual excursion on foot of about six weeks duration one of our most favorite amusements in the way of athletic exercise was throwing the lance lanzenwerfen the weapons used were stout ashen spears from six to seven feet long heavily shod with iron and the target squared log of hard wood ﬁrmly set in the ground about six feet high upper portion or head which it was the chief object to hit separate block attached to the trunk by stout hinges this exercise required great strength well skill dozen or more engaged in it at time divided into two sides of supposed equal force and the points gained by each stroke were reckoned according to its power and accuracy if the head was struck and one point added whenever the spear remained ﬁxed in the wood without touching the ground we attained great skill in this exercise we had twice week and there were many swordsmen in the elder classes who need not have feared any ordinary antagonist of this from neighboring canton on occasion of visit to our teacher had one day tangible and somewhat mortifying proof pg 559 the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 15 91 may https has been said sometimes in ridicule sometimes in condemnation of gymnastic exercises we spent an hour day just before dinner in the gymnasium and my years experience induces to regard these exercises judiciously conducted not only beneﬁcial but indispensable to complete system of education they are to the body what intellectual labors are to the mind they produce vigor an agility an address hardihood presence of mind in danger which i have never seen attained to the same extent under any other circumstances they fortify the health and strengthen the nerves their mental and moral inﬂuence also is great my observation convinces that they equalize the spirits invigorate the intellect and calm the temper i am witness to the

annual excursions which were undertaken in the charming autumn of that bright and beautiful climate by those among our students who like myself were too far from home to return thither during the

sought some shady nook where we could enjoy lunch of bread and wine with grapes or cheese when these luxuries could be procured then we despatched in advance some of our best pedestrians commissariat of the party to order supper preparatory to our arrival how joyfully we sat down to that evening meal how we talked over the events of the day the magniﬁcent scenes we had passed through the little adventures we had met with the small country taverns seldom furnished more than six or eight beds so that more than three fourths of our number usually slept in some barn well furnished with hay or straw how soundly we slept and how merry the awaking there were among us among german students there always are excellent musicians to sing their stirring national airs or gems from the best operas or the like trios quartets after our frugal noonday meal in the shade or perhaps when we had surmounted some and came suddenly we reached the verge of the descent upon some magniﬁcent expanse of valley or champaign scenery stretching out far beneath us it was our habit to call halt music the fresh grass dotted perhaps with alpine roses furnished seats and our vocalists drawing from their knapsacks the slend er cahier containing melodies expressly selected the occasion and arranged in parts we had under the most charming circumstances an impromptu concert i have heard much better music since but never any that i enjoyed more on one of these excursions we passed by napoleon wonderful road the simplon into one of the most beautiful regions of italy the ﬁrst night at baveno was delicious the soft italian air moonlight on the placid lake on the softly rounded hills on the trellised vines so picturesque compared to the formal vineyards of france in such contrast to the giant of granite

prodigious contest it was sometimes the top of live sliced off with knife like the tops of our conical cheeses when they came to the table said the valleys are wooded with ﬁr spruce larch and more to the south with birch at distance from the sea and in favorable situations these trees grow to good forest size even beyond the middle latitudes of labrador in latitude resident told that trees were found eighteen inches in diamete this statement was derided when i told it on board and the witty judge kept the table in roar half an hour with pleasantries about it but at hopedale two and half degrees farther north we learned that sticks of timber ﬁfty feet in length were often brought to the station while one had found its way there which was feet long and ten inches in diameter at the smaller end toward the sea these forests dwindle till on the immediate coast they wholly disappear at caribou island which the reader will remember is south of the strait of belle isle i found in ravine some sadly stunted spruces ﬁrs and larches not more than three feet high shrubs which had wondrously the air of lifelong the tangled tops were mostly ﬂattened and pressed over to one side and altogether they seemed so piteous that one wished to say nobody shall so to you any more poor things excepting these the immediate coast ﬁve or six hundred miles that we skirted it was absolutely treeless up in the bays however trees were found and curiously enough they were larger and more plentiful in high latitudes than farther south this puzzled much at ﬁrst evidently however it was due in part to the nature of the rock at sleupe harbor latitude this was granite c farther on it was sienite then the sienite showed strong pg 565 the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume

an improvement in vegetation this was particularly observable at du loup where there is red sandstone formation extending some miles along the sea and mile or two inland here we seemed suddenly transported to southern climate so soft was the scenery so green the surface the effect was enhanced by the aspect of the sandstone cliff which in alternating horizontal shades of red fronts the sea with vertical height of three hundred feet the whole extent of this formation ruddy and glowing under the sunshine we sailed past that one felt warmed by the sight but little farther back rose the

growing luxuriantly these are all started under cover and are not set out in the garden until toward the end of june and great deal of esquimaux labor must go to their production yet it is doubtful whether the same pains would bring about the same result at the caribou station it is the sea that dooms labrador and the relation of the coast to this does much to determine its fertility or rather its barrenness half way across the ocean in latitude captain linklater found the temperature of the water fahrenheit near the labrador coast in the same latitude the temperature was but two degrees only above the freezing point it is in facts like this that one gets key to the climate not only of labrador but of eastern north america out of the eternal ice of the north the current presses down along the coast chilling land and air wherever it touches where the coast retreats somewhat and is well barricaded with islands the rigor of the climate is mitigated where it lies fully exposed to the arctic current even though much farther south the life is utterly chilled out of it now hopedale lies behind rampart of islands twenty miles deep while the portion of the arctic current which splits off at the head of newfoundland and pushes down through the strait presses close past caribou island this explains the sterility of the latter the arctic current varies much in different years not only in the amount of ice it brings but also in its direction unexpected effects depend upon this variation it will be remembered that in 1863 several ships were wrecked on cape race owing to some unaccountable disturbance of the currents the gulf stream it was found at length ran thirty miles farther north than usual was this unaccountable when captain handy our whaling mentor was penetrating hudson strait in june 1863 he found vast headlands of ﬂoe ice resting against the land and pushing far out to sea bailey said he to his mate there will be many wrecks on cape race this year the prediction was fulﬁlled you see why it should be the ﬂoe ice rose ten feet above the water it therefore extended near one hundred feet beneath at this depth it acted upon the current precisely if it were land pushing the former far to the east the current therefore did not meet and repel the gulf stream at the usual point and the latter was thus at liberty to press on beyond its custo m to the north captain handy not only saw the facts before him but reasoned upon them even when these immense bodies of ice not rest upon the land they produce the same effect at the depth of hundred feet they go below the current into the still water or counter current beneath and thus still resist the surface ﬂow the coast of labrador has fellow sternness and abruptness on the earth huge headlands

rain sleet and hail interposed in consequence of this rain and of the constant melting there remained on the steep hillsides only three inches depth of snow when the storm ceased though in the hollows it was found foot deep in the deeper ravines the snow of winter lasts through the year and was found by us in the middle of august we were however treated to few days which left room wish the best day of labrador summer is the best day of all summers whatsoever herodotus says that ionia was allowed to possess the ﬁnest climate of all the world and in smyrna i believed him there were may days when

exalted and pure and the globules sail through his veins like rich argosies before then an irritable haste and weak lassitude are alike impossible one nerves are made of metal ﬁner than steel and he becomes truly lord in nature it was on such day that we ran some ﬁfty miles through passage resembling river between islands and the main the wind blew warm and vigorous from the land sometimes when it came to us without passing over considerable spaces of water seeming positively hot if it came from an oven yet in such an atmosphere one felt that he could live forever either in an oven or in the case of an iceber g and wish only to live there forever great ﬂeet of schooners was pushing swiftly along this passage on its way to in the north and we ﬂew past one and another while the astonished crews gathered at the side to stare at our speed our schooner seemed the very genius of victory and our wishes to be supreme powers i have never elsewhere experienced so cool and perfect an exhilaration exhilaration that is in the early afternoon dense haze ﬁlled the sky the sun seen through this became globe of glowing ruby and its glade on the sea looked if the water had been strown almost enough to conceal it with crystalline ruby dust or with ﬁne mineral spiculæ of pg 567 the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 15 91 may https bordering upon crimson the peculiarity of this ruddy dust was that it seemed to possess body and while it glowed did not in the smallest degree dazzle if the brilliancy of each ruby particle came from the heart of it rather than from the surface the effect was in truth indescribable and i try to suggest it with more sense of helplessness than i have felt hitherto in preparing these papers it was beautiful beyond expression any expression at least which is at my command such spectacle i suppose one might chance to see anywhere though the chance certainly never occurred to before it could scarcely have escaped through want of attention i could well believe myself child of the sun so deep an appeal to my feeling is made by ef fects of light and color light before all but the atmosphere of labrador has its own secret of beauty and charms the eye with aspects which one may be pardoned believing incomparable in their way the blue of distant hills and mountains when observ ed in clear sunshine is subtile and luminous to degree that surpasses admiration i have seen the camden heights across the waters of penobscot bay when their blue was equally profound these hills beheld over twenty miles or more of sea wonderful thing in the way of color lifting themselve s up there through all the long summer days very marvel of solemn and glorious beauty the ægean sea has charm of atmosphere which is wanting to penobscot bay but the hue of its heights can not compare with that of the camden hills those of labrador however maintain their supremacy above even these all they look like frozen sky or one might fancy that vast heart or core of amethyst was deeply overlaid with colorless crystal and shone through with softened lucent ray such transparency such intense delicacy such reﬁnement of hue sometimes

all but impossible beauty incredible until seen and even when seen scarcely to be credited save by an act of faith we had sailed up deep bay and cast anchor in ﬁne large harbor of the exactest horseshoe shape it was bordered immediately by gentle ridge some three hundred feet high which was densely wooded with spruce ﬁr and larch beyond this ridge to the west rose mountainous hills while to the south where was the head of the harbor it was overlooked immediately by broad noble mountain it had been one of those days when the heavens are covered by uniform ﬁlmy ﬂeece and the light comes if it had been ﬁltered through milk but just before sunset this ﬂeece was rent and river of sunshine streamed across the ridge at the head of the harbor leaving the mountain beyond and the harbor itself with its wooded sides still in shadow and where that shine fell the foliage changed from green to glowing luminous expressed with astonishing force trace not hint of green remaining beyond it the mountain preserved its whited gray nearer on either side the woods stood out in clear green and separated from these by the sharpest line rose this ridge of enchanted forest you will incline to think that one might have seen through this illusion by trying hard enough but never were the colors in more deﬁnite and determined this was but the beginning i had turned away and was debating with myself whether some such color seen on the scotch and english hills had not given the hint those uniform browns which turner in his youth copied from his earlier masters when i looked back the sunshine had ﬂooded the mountain and was bathing it all in the purest bathing it the mountain was solidly converted transformed to that hue the power the simplicity the translucen t shining depth of the color were

on the surface palpable manifest forcing itself upon attention our strength lay out of sight in rich veins which none but eyes familiar with their secret windings could trace thus the french alliance the european interpreted it was the alliance of wealth with poverty of strength with weakness magnanimous recognition of efforts which without that recognition would have been vain what then must have been the persuasive powers the commanding genius of the man who procured that recognition partly also this opinion is owing to the personal character and personal position of franklin franklin was preëminently wise man wise in the speculative science and wise in the practical art of life something of the maturity of age seems to have tempered the liveliest sallies of his youth and much of the vivacity of youth mingles with the sober wisdom of his age thoughtful and at twenty at seventy his ripe experience was warmed by genial glow he entered upon life with the feeling that he had part to perform and the convic tion that his happiness would depend upon his performing it well what that part was to be was his earliest study and social temperament combining with sound judgment quickly taught him that the happiness of the individual is inseparably connected with the happiness of the species thus life became his study condition of happ iness man and nature the means of obtaining it he sought to control his passions he sought to control the lightning that he might strip them of their power to harm sagacious in the study of causes he was still more sagacious in tracing their connection with effects and his speculations often lose somewhat of their grandeur by the simple and unpretending directness with which he adapts them to the common understanding and makes them minister to the common wants of life the ambition which quickened his early exertions met an early reward he was ambitious to write well and he became one of the best writers in our language he was ambitious of knowledge and he laid it up in such stores that men sought his conversation in order to learn from him he was ambitious of pecuniary independence and he accumulated fortune that made him master of his time and actions he was ambitious of inﬂuence and he obtained rare control over the thoughts and the passions of men he was ambitious of fame and he connected his name with the boldest and grandest discovery of his age living thus in harmony with himself he enjoyed the rare privilege of living in equal harmony with the common mind and the advanced mind of his contempor aries he entered into wants and feelings if he had never looked beyond them and thus made himself the counsellor of the people he appreciated the higher wants and nobler aspirations of our nature and thus

search of abuses but he would have drawn such pictures of those near home would have made some laugh and some blush and all unite heartily in doing away with them with nothing of the ascetic he could impose and bear it like erasmus he may not have aspired to become martyr in those long voyages and journeys which in his inﬁrm old age he undertook in his country service there was much of the sublimest spirit of martyrdom his philosophy philosophy of observa tion and pg 577 the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 15 91 may https had taught him caution in the formation of

received the portfolio of foreign affairs domestic interests pressed too hard upon them to allow of their resuming at once the vast plans of the fallen minister unlike that minister vergennes

american questions the most important questions of their correspondence that expression which has been put into so many mouths summing up of the value of victory was applied in substance by vergennes to the battle of bunker hill t wo more victories of this kind and the english will have army left in america and while thus tempted by this proof of american strength his wavering mind was irritated by the apprehension of some sudden outbreak of english arrogance the ambassador wrote that whigs and tories might yet unite in war against france in order to put an end to the troubles in the colonies

agent longer merely to observe and report but to ascertain though without compromising the french government how far the americans were prepared french intervention english suspicions were already awakened already the english minister had informed the french ambassador upon the authority of private letter of general lee to general burgoyne that the americans were sure of french aid it was not without great difﬁculty that the new agent bonvouloir could ﬁnd safe conveyance but by december he was already in philadelphia and though still pretending to be mere traveller soon in full communication with the committee of secret correspondence the appointment of this committee on the 29th of november 1775 is the beginning of the history of our foreign relations then began our

formed the acquaintance of swiss gentleman of the name of dumas man of great learning and liberal sentiments and whose social position gave him access to sure sources of information to him he now addressed himself with the great question of the moment if we throw off our dependence upon great britain will any court enter into alliance with us and aid us the sake of our commerce such then was the of our diplomatic history the end and aim of all our negotiations alliance and aid the sake of our commerce but we should greatly mistake the character of the times if we supposed that this point was reached without many and warm debates when the question was ﬁrst started in congress that body was found to be much divided upon this upon any of the other subjects which it was called upon to discuss with franklin one party held that instead of asking treaties with european powers we should ﬁrst conquer our independence when those powers allured by our commerce would come and ask us the other with john adams that our true policy and mark of respect from new nation to old ones we ought to send ministers to all the great courts of europe in order to obtain the recognition of our independence and form treaties of amity and commerce franklin who had already outlived six treaties of ﬁrm and lasting peace and now saw the seventh swiftly approaching its end might well doubt the efﬁcacy of those acts to which his young and impetuous colleague attached so much importance but in congress the majority was with adams and while there was what gouverneur morris called rage treaties the committee of secret correspondence i have already said was formed in november one of its ﬁrst measures was to appoint agents lee london dumas the hague and early in the following year silas deane

million of livres was placed by vergennes in the hands of beaumarchais who assumed the name of hortalez and arranged with deane the measures transmitting the amount to america in the shape of arms and supplies and now the declaration of independence came to add the question of recognition to the question of aid but recognition was declaration of war and to bring the french government to this decisive pass required the highest diplomatic skill supp orted by dignity and weight of character the colonies had but one man possessed of these qualiﬁcations and that man was franklin the history of

village of passy at easy distance both from the city and the court without endeavoring to increase the public curiosity by an air of mystery or seclusion kept himself sufﬁciently in the background to prevent that curio sity from losing its stimulant by too great familiarity with its object where men of science met the discussion of new theory or the trial of new experiment he was to be seen amongst them with an unpretending air of intelligent interest and wise suggestions never indiscreetly proffered never indiscreetly withheld where humane men met to discuss some question of practical benevolence or philosophers to debate some principle of social organization he was always prepared to take his part with apt and illustrations from the stores of his meditation and experience

to leave events to their natural progress ever active ever vigilant opportunity was suffered to escape him and yet one whose it was desirable to propitiate was disgusted by injudicious importunity

necessities which made it urgent that he never saw him come without pleasure if he had been vain man he would have enjoyed his position too much to make good use of it the cause he came to serve if he

at the age of seventy to enter into the feelings of people so different from those among whom he had always lived and if he had not been stimulated by earnest convictions and governed by high principles he would not have been able to withstand the frequent and insidious attempts that were made to shake his fortitude and undermine his ﬁdelity but in him in washington there was rare

secret aid in arms and money and by partial opening of its ports that it was compelled by the obligations of the family compact to time its own movements in certain measure by those of spain and was not prepared to involve itself in war with england by an open acknowledgment of the independence of the colonies until they had given fuller proof of the earnestness of their intentions and of their ability to bear their part in the contest nor was he long in perceiving that the french government was giving the colonies money which it sorely needed paying its own debts and defraying its own expenses thus that however it might be there were certain limits beyond which it was not in its power to go it was evident therefore to his just and sagacious mind that to accept the actual policy of france the gauge of more open avowal under more favorable circumstances and to recognize the limits which her ﬁnancial embarrassments set to her pecuniary grants was the only course that he could pursue without incurring the danger of defeating his own negotiations by excess of zeal meanwhile there was enough to in strengthening the ground already gained in counteracting the insidious efforts of english emissaries in correcting erroneous impressions in awakening just expectations in keeping up that public interest which had so large part in the formation of public opinion and in so regulating the actio n of that opinion to make it bear with ﬁrm and consistent and not unwelcome press ure upon the action of government and in doing this he had to contend not only with the local difﬁculties of his position but with the difﬁculty of uncertain communications months often intervening between the sending of despatch and the receiving of an answer and affording newsmongers abundant opportunities idle reports and unfounded conjectures and enemies ample scope malicious falsehoods it was happy circumstance the new state that her chief representative was man who knew how to wait with dignity and when to act with energy it was this just appreciation of circumstances that gave him such strong hold upon the mind of vergennes and imparted such weight to all his applications aid sooner had congress begun to receive money from europe than it began to draw bills upon its agents there and often without any certainty that those agents would be in condition to meet them bills were drawn on jay when he was sent to spain and his already difﬁcult position made doubly difﬁcult and humiliating bills were drawn on adams in holland and he was unable to meet them but such was the conﬁdence of the french court in the representations of franklin that he was enabled not only to meet all the drafts which were made upon him directly but to relieve his less fortunate colleagues from the embarrassments in which the precipitation of their own government had involved them and thus passed the ﬁrst twelve months of his residence in france and anxious months more especially during the summer of 1777 when it was known that burgoyne was coming down by lake champlain and howe preparing great expedition to the northward then came the tidings that howe had taken philadelphia say rather said franklin with that air of conviction which carries conviction with it that philadelphia has taken howe men paused they repeated his words and suspended their judgment pg 584 the project gutenberg

wisely when all others desponded it was on the 4th of december that these welcome tidings reached paris and the commissioners lost time in communicating them to the court the second day after the secretary of the king council came to them with ofﬁcial congratulations negotiations were resumed and carried on rapidly nothing but desire to consult the court of madrid being allowed to retard them

brave men to impart their skill and communicate their enterprising genius to the rest of europe humbled herself before him through her doge bowing his venerable head the old man asked pardon in her name not the wrongs that she had committed but the wrongs that she had borne and now up those marble stairs through those tapestried halls came three men of humble birth two of whom had wrought their

but in the name of the inalienable rights of the people happy would it have been the young king who sat in louis seat if he could have understood the full meaning of his act and recognized at the same moment the claims of his own people to participate in that government which derived its strength from their labor and its security from their love nothing could have demonstrated more clearly the

question he had viewed it in the beginning he wrote in his diary in may 1782 it seems to that we have in most instances hurt our credit and importance by sending all over europe begging alliances and

european event in its american bearings after the recognition by france was the armed neutrality of the northern powers court intrigue in russia though sober act in spain which was followed in december 1780 by the addition of holland to the open enemies of england attempts had already been made to form treaty with holland through william lee with such prospect of success to induce congress to send henry laurens to the hague to continue the negotiations laurens was captured by an english cruiser and soon after john adams was directed to take his place at paris adams had failed singularly negotiator ready ear to lee hardly attempting to disguise his jealousy of franklin and enforcing his own opinions in manner equally offensive to the personal feelings of the minister and the traditional usages of the court but at the hague he found ﬁeld better suited to his ardent temperament and backed by the brilliant success of the campaign of 1781 and the votes of the house of commons in favor of reconciliation succeeded in obtaining public recognition in the spring of 1782 and concluding treaty in the autumn all these things were more or less upon the surface and doing more or less openly but under the surface the while and known only to those directly concerned therein were covert attempts on the part of england to open communications with franklin by means of personal friends there had been nothing but the recognition of our independence that england would not have given to prevent the alliance with france and now there was nothing that she was not ready to to prevent it from accomplishing its purpose and it adds wonderfully to our conception of franklin to think of him going about with this knowledge in addition to the knowledge of so much else in his mind this care in addition to so many other cares ever weighing upon his heart little did jealous intriguing lee know of these things petulant waspish izard still less mind less sagacious than franklin might have grown suspicious under the inﬂuences that were employed to awaken his distrust of vergennes and character less ﬁrmly established would have lost its hold upon vergennes amid the constant efforts that were made to shake his conﬁdence in the gratitude and good faith of america but franklin who believed that timely faith was part of wisdom went directly to the french minister with the propositions of the english emissaries and frankly telling him all about them and taking counsel of him to the manner of meeting them not only stripped them of their power to harm him but converted the very measures which his enemies had so insidiously and they deemed so skilfully prepared his ruin into new sources of strength of the proffers of mediation in which ﬁrst spain and then russia and the german emperor were to take so important part they bore fruit it is sufﬁcient to observe in passing how little european statesme n understood the business in which they were so pg 586 the project

degenerated into arrogance an occasion to manifest itself in nobler light he refused to take part in the discussions in any other character than the representative of an independent power meanwhile events were hastening the inevitable termination in europe england stood alone without either open or secret sympathy in june 1779 war with spain had followed the french war of in july 1780 the armed neutrality had deﬁned the position of the northern powers adversely to her maritime pretensions war was declared with holland in december of the same year in america the campaign of 1781 had stripped her of her southern conquests and effaced the impression of her early victories at home her people were daily growing more and more restless under the pressure of taxation and even the country gentlemen who had stood by the ministry so long in the hope of transferring their own burden to the shoulders of their american brethren began to give evident tokens of discontent it was clear that england must consent to peace and yet she still stood bravely up presenting bold front to each new enemy grand spectacle in one light there is always something grand in indomitable courage but sad one in the true light and one from which hundred years hence the philosophic historian will turn with shudder when summing up all these events and asking what all this blood was shed he shows that the only principle at stake on her part was that pernicious claim to control the industry of the world which had she succeeded would have dried up the sources of prosperity in america it is fast drying them up in ireland and in india nor was peace less necessary to her rival the social revolution which the two last reigns had rendered inevitable was moving with gigantic strides towards its bloody consummation the last hope of reforms that should probe deep enough to anticipate revolution had disappeared with turgot the statesmanship of vergennes had remedy social disease it was statesmanship of alliances and treaties and wars traditional and sometimes brilliant but all on the surface leaving the wounded heart untouched the sore spirit unconsoled the ﬁnancial skill of necker could not reach the evil it was mere banking skill and nothing more respectable in its time and place ﬁlling few mouths more with bread but failing to see although told of it long ago by one who never erred

been put to humiliating tests under the last reign by the partition of poland and the peace of kaïnardji and the sense of had not been fully restored by the american war and although one yet dreamed of what seven swift years were to bring forth all minds were agita ted by mysterious consciousness of the approaching tempest in 1782 the overtures of england began to assume more deﬁnite form franklin saw that the time decisive action was at hand and prepared himself it with his wonted calm and deliberate appreciation of circumstances that france was sincere he could not doubt after all the proofs she had given of her sincerity nor could he doubt that she would concur heartily in preparing the way lasting peace he had the instructions of congress to guide him in what america would claim and his own mind was quickly made up to what england must yield four points were indispensable full recognition of independence an immediate withdrawal of her troops just settlement of boundaries of canada being conﬁned at least to the limits of the act of 1774 and the freedom of the ﬁsheries without these there could be treaty but to make the work of peace sure he suggested equally useful to both parties four other concessions the most important of which were the giving up of canada and securing equal privileges in english and irish ports to the ships of both nations the four necessary articles became the real basis of the treaty pg 587 the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 15 91 may https adams john jay and henry laurens were joined with him in the

former disagreements with vergennes and hated franklin so bitterly that he could hardly be prevailed upon to treat him with the civility which his age and position demand ed much less with the consideration which the interest of his country required both jay and adams were under the inﬂuence of that hostility to france which prevailed extensively in the colonies in the mother country hostility which neither of them was at sufﬁcient pains to conceal although neither of them perhaps was fully conscious of it it was this feeling that kept them both aloof from the french minister and made them so accessible to english inﬂuences and it was knowledge of this feeling which three years later suggested to geor ge iii that insinuat ion about adams dislike to french manners which would have been scathing sarcasm if it had not been an inexcusable impertinence the english agents availed themselves skilfully of those sentiments suspicions fostering doubts and not shrinking there is strong reason to suppose from gross exaggeration and deliberate falsehood the discussion of articles like all such discussions was protracted by the efforts of each party to make the best terms and the concealing of real intentions in the hope of extorting greater concessions but england was really prepared to yield all that america was really prepared to claim france in spite of the suspicions of adams and jay was really sincere and on the 30th of november 1782 the preliminary articles were signed franklin position was difﬁcult and delicate he knew the importance of peace he knew that the instructions of congress required perfect openness towards the french minister he believed that the minister deserved both by his past kindness and present good intentions to be treated with perfect openness but both his colleagues were against him what should he refer the difference to congress and meanwhile hold the country in painful and expensive suspense what could he but submit he had done through life to the circumstances which he could not control and give the appearance of unanimity to an act which the good of his country required to be unanimous he signed the preliminaries and submitted to the reproach of personal and public ingratitude he had submitted to the taunts of wedderburn history has justiﬁed his conﬁdence most careful research having failed to bring to light any conﬁrmation of the suspicions of his colleagues and vergennes though nettled the moment understood franklin position too well to lay the act at his door an expression of real opinion much time and

only line i have had from him since his visit ten years ago the doctor goes on with the reading it may be from recollection of your warnings and of your distrust of the french character or possibly it may be from the prejudices of my new england education but i can not entertain pleasantly the thought of her growing up to womanhood under the inﬂuences which are about her here what those inﬂuences are you will not expect to explain in detail i am sure it will be enough to win upon your sympathy to say that they are popish and thoroughly french i feel strong wish therefore i am attached to the

have thought of declining the proposed service even though the poor girl were dressed in homespun and clattered in sabots than he would have closed his ear to the cry of drowning child within that

cure if i wanted to said reuben who thought it needful to speak in terms of bravado about the spinster with whom he kept up series of skirmishing ﬁghts from week to week the truth is the keen eye of the good lady ferreted out great many of his pet plans of mischief and nipped them before they had time to ripen over and over too she warned him against the evil associates whom he would ﬁnd about the village tavern where he strayed from time to time to be witness to some or to receive commendatory glance of recognition from one nat boody the son who had run away two years before and made voyage down the river in sloop laden with apples and onions to york he was head taller than reuben and the latter admired him intensely we never cease admiring those head taller than ourselves reuben absolutely pined in longing wonderment at the way in which nat boody could crack and with couple of hickory sticks could call the roll upon pine table equal to wonderful were the stories this boy could tell to special cronies of his adventures in the city they beat the geography all hollow such an air too this boody had leaning against the by his father door and making cuts at an imaginary span of horses pair of twilled trousers cut like man such jacket with lapels to the pockets which he said the sailors wore on the sloops and called way he had of putting quid in his mouth nat boody chewed it is not strange that reuben feeling little of ugly constraint under the keen eye of the spinster eliza should admire greatly the manner of the who had such familiarity with the world and such large range of action the most of us never get over wonderment at the composure and complacency which spring from wide knowledge of the world and the man who can crack his whip well though only at an imaginary pair of horses is sure to have throng of admirers by this politic lad nat boody the innocent reuben was decoyed into many little bargain which told more the shrewdness of the tavern than that of the parsonage thus he bartered one day new the gift of his aunt mabel of greenwich street knit scotch cap which the tavern traveller assured him could not be matched any money and the parson boy going back with this trophy on his pg 595 the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 15 91 may https looking very consciously at those who give an admiring stare is pounced upon at the very door by the indefatigable spinster what now reuben where in the world did you get that cap bought it grand way but it worn says the aunt ouf whose was it bought it of nat boody says reuben and he says there is another can be had bah says the spinster making dash at the cap which she seizes and straightway rushing souses in kettle of boiling water after which comes off new skirmish followed by the partial defeat of reuben who receives such combing down with sundry killed and wounded he remembers month thereafter the truth is that it was not altogether from admiration of the accomplished nat boody that reuben was prone to linger about the tavern neighborhood the spinste r had so strongly and constantly impressed it upon him that it was low and vulgar and wicked place that the boy growing vastly inquisitive in these years was curious to ﬁnd out what shape the wickedness took and he walked by sometimes at dusk when thoroughly infused with the last teachings of miss eliza it seemed to him that he might possibly catch glimpse of the hoofs of some devil he had seen devils pictured in an illustrated milton capering about the doorway if he had seen them truth compels us to say that he would have felt strong inclinat ion to follow them up at safe distance in order to see what kind of creatures might be wearing them but he was far more apt to see the lounging ﬁgure of the shoemaker from down the street or of postmaster troop coming thither to have an evening chat about calhoun or william wirt and the or possibly it might be he would see the light heels of suke boody the pretty daughter of the who had been pronounced by phil elderkin who knew being year his senior the handsomest girl in the town this might well be suke was just turned of ﬁfteen with pink arms and pink cheeks and blue eyes and great ﬂock of brown hair not very startling in her beauty on ordinary days when she appeared in quilted petticoat and her curls in papers sweeping the but of saturday afternoon in red and white calico with the curls all streaming wonder phil elderkin who was tall of his age thought her handsome so it happened that the inquisitive reuben not ﬁnding any cloven feet in his furtive observations but encountering always either the rosy suke or scamp which was nat pet or the shoemaker or the boody himself could justify and explain his aunt charge of the tavern wickedness only by distributing it over them all and when one sunday miss suke appeared at meeting where she rarely went in hat all aﬂame with ribbons reuben sorely puzzled at the sight says to his aunt eliza why did the sexton put her out put her out says the spinster horriﬁed what you mean reuben is she wicked says he she came from the tavern and she lives at the tavern but you know that preaching is the wicked and that the good had much better stay away than the bad had they said reuben thoughtfully pondering if there did not lie somewhere in this averment the basis some new moral adjustment of his own conduct there are vast many prim preachers both male and female in all times who imagine that certain styles of wickedness or vulgarity are to be approached with propriety only across church if better preaching did not lie nine times out of ten in the touch of hand or whisper in the ear pg 596 the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 15 91 may https reuben did upon the repeated warnings of the spinster against any familiarity with the tavern or tavern people he came in time to reckon the old creaking of boody and the pump in the the pivotal points of all the town wickedness just the was the centre of all the town good ness and since the great world was very wicked he knew from overmuch iteration at home and since communication with that wicked world was kept up mostly by the that stopped every noon at the it seemed to him that relays of wickedness must ﬂow into the tavern and town daily upon that old swaying just relays of goodness might come to the meetin on some old lumbering chaise of neighboring parson who once month perhaps would exchange with the doctor and it conﬁrmed in reuben mind good deal that was taught him about natural depravity when he found himself looking out with very much more eagerness the rumbling coach that kept up daily wicked activity about the tavern than he did parson hobson who snufﬂed in his reading and who drove an old sorrel mare with lopped ears and lank jaws that made passes at himself and phil if they teased her they always did so too he came to regard in virtue of misplaced home instruction the of nat boody and his scamp and the pink arms and pink cheeks and brown ringlets of suke boody so many types of human wickedness and by parity of reasoning he came to look upon the two ﬂat curls on either temple of his aunt eliza and her pragmatic way and upon the yellow ribbons within the of almira tourtelot who sang treble and never went to the tavern the types of goodness what wonder if he swayed more and more toward the broad and easy path that lay around the pump scamp lying there biting at the ﬂies and toward the barroom with its ﬂaming pictures of some past and big tumblers with lemons atop rather than to the strait and narrow path in which his aunt eliza and miss almira would guide him with sharp voices thin faces and decoy of dyspeptic doughnuts phil and he sauntering by one day phil says darst you go in reub phil was under law of prohibition and reuben glancing around the common says yes i go then says phil we call glass of lemonade fellows always order somethin when they go in so phil swelling with his ten years and tall of his age walks to the bar and calls two tumblers of lemonade which old boody stirs with an appetizing rattle of the meantime query or two about the squire and look askance at the parson boy who is trying very hard to wear an air if he too were ten and knew the ropes it good it says phil putting down his money of which he always had good stock prime says reuben with smack of the lips and then suke comes in hunting over the room last week courant and the boys with furtive glances at those pink cheeks and brown ringlets go down the

eagerness of their listening with daylight of next morning came sight of the rambling old towns that lay at the river mouth little more than patches of gray and white strewed over an almost treeless country with some central spire rising above them then came great stretches of open pasture scattered over with huge gray rocks amid which little ﬂocks of sheep were rambling or some herd of young cattle startled by the splashing of the paddles and the great plumes of smoke tossed their tails in the air and galloped away in fright which adèle clapped her hands and broke into laugh that was

my dear i never eat anything with salad oil in it not eat salad oil how absurd i never heard of salad without oil and the lady looks disturbed but my dear i tell you i never take it i prefer simple sugar and vinegar sugar and vinegar why leander i astonished how very bourgeois you must really try to like my salad spoken in coaxing tone my dear i never try to like anything new i am satisﬁed with my old tastes well leander i must say that is very ungracious and disobliging of you why any more than you to annoy by forcing on what i like but you would like it if you would only try people never like olives till they have eaten three or four and then they become passionately fond of them then i think they are very silly to go through all that trouble when there are enough things that they like now leander i think that seems amiable or pleasant at all i think we ought to try to accommodate ourselves to the tastes of our friends then my dear suppose you try to like your salad with sugar and vinegar but it so gauche and unfashionable did you ever hear of salad made with sugar and vinegar on table in good society my mother table i believe was good society and i learned to like it there the truth is hero sensible woman you are too fond of mere fashionable and society notions yes you told that last week and i think it was very unjust very unjust indeed uttered with emphasis more unjust than your telling that i was dictatorial and obstinate well now leander dear you must confess that you are rather obstinate i see the proof you insist on your own ways and opinions so heaven

conversation of this kind may go on hour after hour long the respective parties have breath and strength both becoming secretly more and more set in their way on both sides is the consciousness that they might end it at once by very simple concession she might say w ell dear you shall always have your salad you like and he might say my dear i will try to like your salad if you care much about it

something must be done and where little can be said with all deference to the great moralist we must say that this statement argues very limited knowledge of the resources of talk possessed by two very cultivated and very persons fairly pitted against each other in practical questions the logic may indeed be ridiculous but such people our hero and leander ﬁnd cases under the sun where something is to be done yet where little can be said and these wretched wranglings this interminable labyrinth of petty disputes waste and crumble away that high ideal of truth and tenderness which the real deep sympathies and actual worth of their characters entitled them to form their married life is not what they expected at times they are startled by the reﬂection that they nave somehow grown

animal without reason or cultivation can be in her way quite formidable an antagon ist the most clever of her sex leander can sometimes vanquish his hero in fair ﬁght by the weapons of good logic because she is woman capable of appreciating reason and able to feel the force of the considerations he adduces and when he does vanquish and carry her captive by his bow and spear he feels that he has gained victory over ignoble antagonis t and he becomes hero in his own eyes though woman of much will still she is woman of much reason and if he has many vexations with her pertinacity he is

it convenient in regulating our affairs to have one ﬁnal appeal and one deciding voice the position in which the bible and the marriage service place the husband in the family amounts to more he is the head of the family in all that relates to its material interests its legal relations its honor and standing in society and true woman who respects herself would any more hesitate to promise to

oath two young men every way on footing of equality and friendship may be one of them and the other it would be alike absurd the one to take airs about not obeying man every way his equal and the other to assume airs of lordly dictation out of the sphere of his military duties the mooting of the question of marital authority between two christian people of the nineteenth century is less absurd while the husband has certain power conﬁded to him the support and maintenance of the family and the preservation of those relations which involve its good name and before the world he has claim to an authoritative exertion of will in reference to the little personal tastes and habits of the interior he has divine right to require that everything shall be arranged to please him at the expense of his wife preferences and feelings any more than if he were not the head of the household in thousand indifferent matters which not touch the credit and respectability of the family he is just much bound sometimes to give up his own will and way the comfort of his wife she is in certain other matters to submit to his decisions in large number of cases the husband and wife stand equal human beings before god and the indulgence of unchecked and inconsiderate on either side is sin it is my serious belief that writings such we have been considering harm both to men and women by insensibly inspirin g in the one an idea of licensed prerogative of selﬁshness and and in the other an irrational and indiscreet servility is it any beneﬁt to man to ﬁnd in the wife of his bosom the ﬂatterer of his egotism the acquiescent victim of his little selﬁsh exactions to be nursed and petted and cajoled in all his faults and and to see everybody falling prostrate before his will in the domestic circle is this the true way to make him manly and man it is my belief that many good wives have been accessory to making their husbands very bad christians however then the little questions of difference in life are to be disposed of between two individuals it is in the worst possible taste and policy to undertake to settle them by mere authority all romance all poetry all beauty are over

northwestern portion of what is now the suburbs of the great city around us in this little obscure home the two lived entirely alone they had neighbors of course but none of them could tell how they contrived to subsist the mother did work except herself and her child she had but small garden in front of the house the embellishment of which was her particular care and she was surrounded with books in the reading of which she spent all her leisure time having little intercourse with her neighbors the gossips that exist everywhere in society if curious about her affairs could discover nothing to how she lived so comfortably without any visible means when the daughter sabrina grew up to sixteen her beauty the character she developed and her general conduct were the topic of quite much rural conversation and remark had been the mystery that hung around the mother gradually drawn out into the neighboring society her great personal attractions added to her shrewdness and good sense made her so much admired to collect around her train of suitors who seemed to consider her being fatherless of more consequence to them than it was to herself but there was in her temperament an undercurrent of ambition so strong to cause her to receive their advances toward tender acquaintance with freezing coldness while at the same time it rendered her positively unhappy she felt superior to her condition and she longed to rise above it her mind had attained to premature development while feeding almost exclusively on its own thoughts she had never been fond of books though there were many around her her sole occupations had been the school the needle and assisting her mother in the management of their ﬂower this last she had decided taste and they had concealed the character of the old house they occupied by covering it with luxuriance of ﬂoral wealth so tastefully arranged and so profuse and gorgeous that travellers on the dusty highway on which it stood would stop to admire the remarkable blending of the climbing rose the honeysuckle and the grape thus ﬁlled with indeﬁnite longings she grew up to womanhood without any proper direction from her mother she had

she had been cruelly deceived even ruined but she more than others was able to account this unexpected abandonment the truth eventually came out however the father of her lover had heard the common

the fact must be that in other lands the sex is not more degraded than it was centuries ago but that it has never been permitted to rise to its true level once put down it has always been kept down the contrast between the condition of women in foreign countries and their condition here is too striking to be overlooked we have our hardships our trials our privations but what are they to those of our european sisters if we get low wages they are in most cases sufﬁcient to enable us to maintain respectable position and decent appearance if the inﬂuence of caste is felt among us if by some it is considered ungenteel to work this prejudice is not of american growth but was transferred to our shores from the very people with whom woman is degraded to the level of the brutes the ﬁrst settler s

necessity of dressing like man the law itself forbids such change of dress and when it was proposed some years ago to so alter our costume to make it half male and half female not working purposes but mere personal convenience the public sentiment of the nation ridiculed and frowned it down the other sex has been educated to regard us with respect and deferenc too sincere to permit these foreign degradations to overtake us while the spirit of independence infused by the nature of our government the unrestricted intercourse of all classes with each other and that robust training of thought which it is impossible that any american woman should fail to receive will forever place us above the shocking contingencies to which the poor laborious englishwoman is exposed if in common with her we are compelled to work our labor will keep us respectable though it fail to make us rich these are some of the compensations which fall to the lot of the american woman there are many others many

railroads that traverse our country and passenger and conductor will vie with each other in paying us not only respect but attention the former instinctively rises from his seat that we may be

successive stages will be matter the antiquary alone corresponding with these verbal milestones one may notice successive stages of public sentiment to the class thus variously designated it was usually considered that the slaves were vast and almost hopeless mass of imbruted humanity it was generally feared that the contrabands would prove race of helpless paupers whose support would

is doubt that these last developments were in some degree surprise to abolitionists well to prophets they compelled the admission either that slavery was less demoralizing than had been supposed or else that this particular type of human nature was less easy to demoralize it is but few years since advocates indignantly rejected the assertion that the english peasantry were more degraded than the

instincts of courtesy and the profoundest religious emotions there was none of that hard stolid besotted dulness which seems to reduce the english peasant below the level of the brutes he tends and what is surprising above all in the freedman condition is not that it shows recuperative power but that it has such wonderful suddenness in the recoil it is not growth but spring it reverses the nihil

looks gradual process and beholds sudden illumination this abates little of one wrath at slavery perhaps though the residuum is quite sufﬁcient but it inﬁnitely enhances one hopes the race set free it

them from their low estate one must expect to ﬁnd something unexampled in the result this is true even where liberty has come merely thing to be passively received but in many cases the personal share

their own strength but four millions of black men just freed and yet unprovided with any of these tools fate of the nation may hinge on single error in legislating them now there are but two systems possible in dealing with an emancipated people all minor projects are modiﬁcations of these two there is the theory of preparation under some form and there is the theory of fair play preparation is apprenticeship prescription bargains of the freedman made him not by him fair play is to remove all obstructions including the previous monopoly of the soil recognize the freedman right to all social and political guaranties and then to let him alone there is undoubtedly room an honest division of opinion on this fundamental matter among persons equally sincere even among equally persons there may be room difference although it will hardly be denied that those who favor the theory of preparation are in general those who take rather low view of the capacities of the emancipated race the policy pursued in louisiana instance was undoubtedly based at the outset whatever other reasons have since been adduced on the theory that the freedmen would labor only under comp ulsion i have seen an elaborate argument from leading ofﬁcer in that department resting the whole theory on precisely this assumption the negro born and reared in ignorance could not years be taught to properly understand and respect the obligations of contract his ideas of freedom were merged in the fact that he was to be fed and clothed and supported in idleness whatever excuses may since have been devised the system this was its original postulate to suppose it true would be to reject the vast bulk of evidence already accumulated all demonstrating the freedmen willingness to work yet if the assumption be false any system founded on it must be regarded by the freedmen an insult and must fail unless greatly modiﬁed in organizing emancipation one great principle must be kept steadily in mind all men will better endure the total withholding of all their rights than system which concedes half and keeps back the other half this has been admirably elucidated by tocqueville in his ancien régime in showing that the very prosperity of the reign of louis xvi prepared the way its overthrow the french found their position the more insupportable the better it became it often happens that people which has

that you are in some danger from these soldiers whom you meet every day with their guns in the picket paths ofﬁcial colored and grew indignant you mean to say sir that your men are forming conspiracy to murder by means returned the courteous captain i trust you will ﬁnd my soldiers too well disciplined any such impropriety but you may not have noticed that the regiment has at present exceedingly

how very painful i understand you i understand you interrupted the excited divine putting spurs to his horse it was remarkable coincidence that we never heard another complaint from that plantation it was this sensitiveness that brought to so sudden close the attempted apprenticeship of the british west indies cochin the wisest recent critic fully recognizes this connection of events either the regulations were incomplete or the masters failed in their observance or such failures were not repressed so that the slaves were in many places maltreated and mutinous in proportion the moment of freedom approached some broke loose prematurely from their duties others aspired prematurely to their rights patience long delayed is easier than patience whose end is approaching it is at the last moment that one grows weary of waiting the best preparation freedom is freedom it is of inﬁnite importance that we should avail ourselves of the iance of the freedmen while its ﬁrst vigor lasts and guard against sacriﬁcing those generous aspirations which are the basis of all our hope it is not now doubted except perhaps in louisiana that the ﬁrst eager desire of the emancipated slave is to own land and support his own household i reme mber that one of the ablest sergeants in the first south carolina volunteers when some of us tried to convince him that the colored people attached too much importance to the mere ownership of land utterly refused all acquiescence in the criticism we shall still be slaves he said in an impassioned way until man can raise him own bale ob pg 626 the project

royal island who had mostly worked themselves had made more decided progress and were more ﬁtted entire than those who had remained laborers on the plantations owned by philbrick and his associates upon helena island yet it would be impossible to try the system of more judiciously than it was tried under those circumstances and if even that was found on the whole to retard the development of in the freedmen what must it be where this is part of great system of coercion and where the mass of the employers are still slaveholders at heart it is fact of the greatest importance that king cotton turns out to be thorough king and adapts himself very readily to changed events the great southern staple can be raised by small cultivators easily corn or potatoes and difﬁculty begins only when sugar and rice are to be produced yet it will not be long before these also will come within reach of the freedmen if they continue their present tendency towards operations in the colored regiments of south carolina there are organizations owning plantations and grocery or two they even meditate steamboat few of these associations doubt will go to pieces through fraud or inexperience indeed i knew of one which was nearly broken asunder by the president takin g fancy to send in his resignation other member knew the meaning of that hard word and they were disposed to think it declaration of hostilities from the presiding ofﬁcer but even if such associations all fail the present the training which they give will be failure and when we consider that there are already individuals among the freedmen who have by proﬁtable ventures laid up twenty or thirty thousand dollars within three years it seems extravagant ambition company to aim at the sea islands of south carolina and geor gia where from the very beginning under the limited authority of general saxton the most favorable results of emancipation have been attained are now to be the scene of larger experiment still under the same wise care the objections urged by general butler with his usual acuteness against some details of the project of general sherman must not blind us to its real impor tance its implied exclusions can easily be modiﬁed but the rights which it vests in the freedmen are substantial fact which when once established it will require revolution to overthrow the locality ﬁxed the experiment is singularly favorable there is region of the country where staple crop can be grown so proﬁtably by small landholders there is agricultural region so defensible in military aspect so difﬁcult is the navigation of the muddy which endlessly intersect these islands narrow are the connecting causeways completely is every plantation surrounded and subdivided by hedges ditches and earthworks long since made agricultural purposes and now most available defence nothing this side of the famous military region of la vendée which this district much resembles can be more easily held by peasant proprietors the mere accidents of the war have often led to the experiment of leaving small bodies of colored settlers in such favorable localities to support and defend themselves this was successfully done instance on barnwell island tract two or three miles square which lies between port royal island and the main in the direction of pocotaligo and is the site of the rhett plantation described in russell letters this region was entirely beyond our picket lines and was separated from them by navigable stream while from the rebel lines it was divided only by narrow creek that would have been fordable at low water but the depth of mud beneath and around it on this island colony of hundred or thereabouts dwelt in peace with resident white man and only an occasional visit from their superin tendent there were some twenty settlers who did picket duty every night by system of their own and many months there was alarm whatever people raising their cotton and supporting themselves this went on until by fatal error of judgment the men were all conscripted into the army this was soon discovered by the rebels who presently began to make raids upon the island so that ultimately the whole population had to be withdrawn pg 627 pg 628 the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 15 91 may https such settlements indeﬁnitely and we have the system adopted by general sherman it is system which like every other practicable method must depend on military authority at last and which the army should therefore be directly responsible the main argument intrusting the care of the freedmen to bureau of the war department is that it must come to be controlled by that department at any rate and that it is best to have the responsibility rest where the power lies on conquered territory there can be but one authority and conceiv able ingenuity can construct any other system if authority is apparently divided then either the military commander does not understand his business or he is hampered by impracticable orders and should ask to be relieved this is what has paralyzed the action of every military governor title which implies perfectly anomalous function certain to lead to trouble almost all the great good effected by general saxton has been achieved in spite of that function not by means of it and it was not until he was placed in military command of the post of beaufort that he was able even in that limited region to establish any satisfactory authority all else that he did was by suf ferance and often he could not even obtain suf ferance while the war lasts martial law must last after martial law ceases civil institutions whatever they may then be must resume control it is therefore essential that all the rights of the freedmen should be put upon sure basis during the contest but whatever method be adopted the real control must inevitably rest with the war department it can not be transferred to civilians nor is there reason to suppose it desirable the freedmen that it should whatever be the disorder resulting from military command it has the advantage of being more deﬁnite and intelligible than civil mismanagement there is always some one who can be held responsible and the offender is far more easily brought to account on this point i speak from personal experience in south carolina i have seen outrages persistently practised among the freedmen by civilians which military ofﬁcer could have been cashiere d in month i have oftener been appealed to redress against civilians than against ofﬁcers or soldiers i have been compelled to post sentinels to keep superintendents away from their own plantations to prevent disturbance i have been member of military commission which sentenced to the pillory an eminent teacher who had been convicted of the unlawful sale of whiskey this in community into which the majority of the civilians had come with professedly benevolent intent the truth is that abuses acts of oppression towards the freedmen not proceed from mere antecedent prejudice in the army or anywhere else they proceed from the temptations of power and from that impatience which one is apt to restrain among his equals and to indulge among his inferiors the irritability of an abolitionist may lead him to outrages great those which spring from the selﬁshness of mere soldier it is becoming almost proverbial in colored regiments that radical men make the best and the worst ofﬁcers the best because of their higher motives and more elevated standard the worst because they are often ungoverned insubordinate impatient and will sometimes venture on acts under the fervor of their zeal such mere soldier would not venture to commit yet in an army such aberrations like all others yield to discipline but on solitary plantation the temptations and immunities of the recur and i have seen men yield to these who had safely passed the ordeal of persecution and mobs at home it was thus perhaps that general sherman and his advisers felt justiﬁed in adopting the theory of absolute separation on the sea islands that the compani onship of southern white men would be an evil and that of northern men by means an unmixed good yet it seems altogether likely that the system is so far wrong and will be modiﬁed separation is better than preparation and is good antidote to it it is better to assume the freedmen too than too feeble to exclude white men than to give them the monopoly of power neverthel ess the principle of exclusion is wrong though it is happily wrong not fundamental to the system and hence easily corrected if the people of any village desire to introduce white teacher the prohibition would become an obvious outrage which hardly any administration would risk the

the clothing that is to be worn in the suburb must be obtained in exchange the yet if newspaper correspondents tell truth the temporary commander of that post has taken it on himself to forbid white men from trading in mitchellville or black men at hilton head how then is business to be transacted are the inhabitants of the town to be allowed to come to the of the fortiﬁcations hand out yard of ribbon and receive two eggs in return if the entire exchanges are to be intrusted to few privileged favorites black or white then another source of fraud is added to those which lately in connection with the recruiting bounties have been brought to bear upon the freedmen of that department and if the truth be told under the same auspices from which this order proceeds be this it may it seems pity that these poor people who are just learning what competition means and will walk ﬁve miles farther to shop where dry goods are retailed little cheaper should be checked and hampered in their little commerce by an attempt to abolish all the laws of political economy in their favor if the freedmen were race like the indians wasting away by unseen laws through the mere contact of the white man the case would be very different or if they were timid and dependent race needing to be thrust roughly from the nest like young birds and made the difference would be greater still but it is not so the

bargain it is observed that mere blood is not sufﬁcient to secure victory it is claimed that this principle of separation was adopted after consultation with the leading colored men of savannah and that the only dissenter was the rev james lynch northern colored man but it also turns out that lynch was the only man among them who had ever seen the experiment tried of the mingling of the races in condition of liberty he is man of marked energy and ability and has been two years one of the most useful missionaries in the neighborhood of port royal some weight is doubt to be attached to the opinions of those who had known white men only masters but we should not wholly ignore the judgment of the only delegate who had met them on equal terms in restoring men from the trance of slavery the instincts of the patient though doubtless an important fact are not the only point to be considered it may be true hippocrates said that the remedy will succeed better than the best if the patient likes it best but it is not safe to forget that those who have never known their brother except in the light of oppressors may have some crude notions on political economy which milder experience might change at any rate the more exclusive features of general sherman project may be changed by stroke of the pen and so far it tends to secure the freedmen in permanent possession of the sea islands it is almost an unmingled good the truth is that in these changing days none of these speciﬁc systems are very important separation is interesting chieﬂy because it is the last project reported preparation because it was the last but one what is needed is not so much system the settled resolution to daily justice let any military commander merely determine to treat the emancipated black population precisely he would treat white population under the same circumstances encourage industry schools banks and all the rest but not interfere with any of them too much he will have general saxton method and his succe ss the question what to with the soil is far more embarrassing than what to with the freedmen and happily the soil also can be let alone and the freedmen will take

everybody is perfectly prepared and that the objections were merely traditional who has ever heard of so much petition to restore any of the unjust distinctions which have thus been successively

reduced the dogma of total depravity to the simple proposition that men by nature not love god supremely and their neighbor themselves he stoutly resisted the attempt to overawe belief either his own

sees evil in its own ranks and good in those of its adversaries he denounced the faults of the orthodox heartily those of the unitarians standing in the forefront of calvinism he did not hesitate to say it is my deliberate opinion that the false philosophy which has been employed the exposition of the calvinistic system has done more to obstruct the march of christianity and to paralyze the saving power of the gospel and to raise up and organize around the church the unnumb ered multitude to behold and wonder and despise and perish than all other causes beside who of us are to suffer the

ofﬁcer military gifts are apt to be speciﬁ c and specialist seldom gains reputation in the end by being raised to those elevated posts which require combination of faculties if the object of general gillmore origina l appointment was to silence fort sumter and to throw shell into charleston he was undoubtedly the man who could the job if the aim was to take charleston with small military force or even large one the wisdom of the choice was less clear if the intent was to govern an important departmen t without reference to further conquests regulate trade organize industry free the slaves educate the freedmen the selection was still more doubtful this sphere of action which had seemed so important to mitchell and to hunter was foreign to gillmore whole habits and temperament and he never could galvanize himself into caring it his strong point after all was in dealing with metal rather than with men white or black and since the disaster at olustee he can hardly be charged with any squeamish unwillingness to throw upon others the chief respon sibility of any seeming failures of his own it is perhaps fortunate that in this book he is able to keep chieﬂy upon the ground where he is strongest yet after all the work is historical well scientiﬁc and there is in it such mingling of great questions of philanthropy with mere questions of grooving and black soldiers jostle so inextricably with black guns that the common reader and the mere student of human nature will ﬁnd an interest in the book well that intelligent lady of our acquaintance who having heard of the

and to that trick of bursting which is their gravest weakne ss but this the heavy ordnance of parrott would be magniﬁcent success and when we consider that six pounders and seventeen pounders were burst during the siege of charl eston recorded in this volume ﬁve pounders are said to have been burst in single week on morris island at later period and that admiral porter reports six similar instances during the ﬁrst attack on fort fisher was certainly worth while in the pg 636 the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 15 91 may https of this work with his usual liberality to devote long series of admirable plates prepared under the direction of captain mordecai to the details of these dangerous fractures it is generally admitted that the smaller parrott guns including the thirty pounders approach very near perfection the large calibres have precisely the same merits respects range accuracy and simplicity of construction and manipulation this their work against fort sumter shows but the deﬁciency of endurance belongs to the large guns alone since the smaller after an immense amount of service have shown sort of weakness yet if the principle be correct on which the latter are strengthened there seems reason why the same degree of endurance may not yet be secured the larger it is simply mechanical problem whose solution can not be far of the guns have burst both longitudinally and laterally and in quite variety of position and service general turner suggestion that an important secondary cause of bursting is the presence of sand within the bore among the of the sea islands seems justiﬁed by the fact that in the naval service the accidents have been far less frequent thing in all respects fortunate by the way such explosions on board ship involve far greater sacriﬁce of life than on land another secondary cause is the premature explosion of shell within the bore defect which should be also remediable indeed the parrott shell were at ﬁrst notoriously defective often bursting too soon or not at all and thus losing much of their usefulness though this defect has now been in great degree remedied the discussion of the whole subject in this book seems reasonable and unprejudiced and letter from the maker of the guns at the end gives with equal candor his side of the question general gillmore narrative of his military operations is exceedingly interesting and generally clear and simple the descent upon morris island from folly island was undoubtedly one of the most skilful achievements of the war under the superintendence of brigadier vogdes pieces of artillery with two hundred rounds of ammunition each gun and provided with suitable parapets splinter shelters and magazines were placed in position by night within speaking distance of the enemy pickets and within view of their observatories and yet all this immense piece of work was done with such profound secrecy that when the ﬁrst shot from these batteries fell among the enemy it astounded them if it had come from the planet jupiter at the time this brilliant success was merged in the greater prospective brilliancy of the expected results now that the results have failed to follow we can perhaps more justice to the remarkable skill displayed in the preliminary movements so far this report is concerned general gillmore shows disposition to injustice to other ofﬁcers in reprinting the daily correspondence with admiral dahlgren it might have been better to omit or explain some hasty expressions of censure where young naval lieutenant is charged on page 333 with defeating an important measure by acting without orders though the fact was that the ofﬁcer was not under general gillmore orders at all and simply followed the instructions of his immediate commander but in dealing with ofﬁce rs of higher rank he is more discreet and his implied criticisms on admiral dahlgren are not so severe might have been expected they are not nearly so sharp those which were constantly heard during the siege from the ofﬁcers of the navy and the admira l telegraphic note on page 327 my chief pilot informs gale is coming on and i am coming into the creek was the source of very unpardonable levity on board some of the in the few passages relating to the colored troops in the main report the author shows evident pains in the statement with rather unsatisfactory results the style suggests rather the adroitness of the politician than the frankness of the soldier this is the case instance in his narrative of the unsuccessful assault upon fort wagner where he uses language which would convey the impression to nine readers out of ten that it was somehow reproach to the massachusetts that it was thrown into disorder and that this disorder checked the progress of the rest of course this was so ecause it pg 637 the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 15 91 may https the charge it is not usual to say in preparing very brief narrative of some railway collision that the leading car was thrown into state of great disorder which reacted unfavorably upon and delayed the progress of those which followed yet it is hardly less absurd to say it of the leading battalion in night attack on fortress almost impregnable the leading car takes the brunt of the shock precisely because it is in that position and so does the leading regiment how well the massachusetts bore the test is recognized by its being apparently included in the ﬁnal admission that the behavior of the troops under the circumstances was unexceptionable but fractional share in line and half of rather chilly praise is hardly an equivalent three lines of implied individual censure had brigadier strong lived to tell the story of that night it would have been stated less diplomatically than by major gillmore the report of major brooks on the working qualities of the colored troops is far more discriminating and more valuable are the appended statements of captain walker and lieutenant farrand major brooks chief of engineering sent circulars to six different ofﬁcers who had superintended fatigue parties in the trenches covering inquiries on ﬁve points relating to efﬁciency and courage the report may be found at page 259 of the book constituting appendix xix misprinted xiv to the journal of major brooks the statement is probably fair the facts in the compiler possession could make it yet it is seriously vitiated by the scantiness of those facts in answer to one question example we are told that all agree that the colored troops recruited from free states are superior to those recruited from slave states but only two regiments of the latter class appear to have come under major brooks observation at all one of these was perfectly raw regiment which had never had day drill when it was placed in the trenches but which was kept constantly at work there although an order had been issued forbidding white recruits from being so employed the other was regiment composed chieﬂy of south carolina conscripts enlisted in utter disregard of pledges previously given and of course unwilling soldiers it was absurd to institute comparison between these troops and regiment so well trained and ofﬁcered the massachusetts longer experience has shown that there is great choice between the northern and southern negro militar y material and the preferences of an ofﬁcer will usually depend upon which he has been accustomed to command many certainly are ﬁrm in the conviction that the freed slave makes the best soldier in other points the report carries with it some of the needful corrections at least careful reader instance major broo ks general summary is that the black is more timorous than the white but is in corresponding degree more docile and obedient hence more completely under the control of his commander and much more inﬂuenced by his example but when we read on the previous page that the white soldiers were allowed to take their arms into the trenches and that the black soldiers were not it makes the whole comparison nearly worthless it is notorious that the presence or absence of manhood in the bravest soldier often seems to be determined by the mere fact that he has gun in his hand and had the object been to annihilate all vestige of military pride in the colored troops it could not have been better planned than by this and other distinctions maintained during large part of the siege of charleston that while smarting under the double deprivation both of soldier duty and of soldier pay they should have so behaved to merit report so favorable that of major brooks is one of the greatest triumphs they have yet achieved this volume contains the record of what they did the story of what they underwent is yet to be told even of his two famous orders general gillmore judiciously makes mention here thus mingled in this superb work are the points of strength and weakness it remains only to add that the typographical and artistic execution is an honor to our literature and adds to the laurels previously won in the same department by the publisher where all else is so admirable it seems pity to have to lament the absence of an index the division of the work among several different authors makes this defect peculiarly inconvenient pg 638 the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 15 91 may https todleben history of the defence of sebastopol review by william h oward r ussell new york van nostrand it does not yet appear whether our great civil war will leave behind it materials debate acrimonious that which has gathered round the affair in the crimea if general butler and admiral porter live and thrive there seems fair chance that it may in that case it will be interesting to read how general todleben in parallel case substitutes the russian bear the monkey in the fable pats each combatant on the shoulder and presents each with shell while extracting himself the oyster russell review is rather paraphrase and condensation original work of the russian general being too costly even the english market the task of the english editor is done with his usual spirit and with all the more zest from an evident enjoyment of ﬁnding kinglake in the wrong between his sympathies briton and his sympathies literary man there is sometimes struggle but we americans can more justice to russell than in those days of national innocence when we knew not mackay and gallenga and sala and it must be admitted that the tone of the present book is manly and impartial kinglake description of the battle of the alma will always remain one of the masterpieces of literature in its way but it is noticeable that todleben entirely ignores some of the historian most dramatic effects and also knocks away much of his underpinning by demolishing the reputation of general kiriakof f his favorite russian witness kinglake says that eupatoria was occupied by small body of english troops and tells good story about it todlebe n declares that the allies occupied it with more than three thousand men and eight kinglake represents lord raglan forcing the french ofﬁcers with great difﬁculty to disembark the troops at spot of his own selection todleben gives to canrobert and martinprey the whole credit of the ﬁnal choice and of all the arrangements and so on on the side of the russians the most interesting points brought out by todleben are their fearful disadvantage regarded the armament of the infantry these being decimated by the riﬂes of the allies long before the russians were near enough to use their bores and the popular enthusiasm inspired by the war in russia the czar was aided by the spontaneous contributions of his people great supplies were forwarded by private individuals of all that an army could need from all parts of the empire persons sent lint bandages by post to the army these are phrases which bring us back to the daily experience of our own vaster struggle respects the allies todleben uniformly credits the french army with more of every military quality than the english save personal courage alone from the commanding general to the lowest private every technical detail of duty seems to have been better done by the french at the height of the siege it became war of sorties on the part of the russians and todleben says apropos of those sorties it is indispensable to make the remark here that the french guarded their trenches with much more vigilance and defended them with incomparably more tenacity than the english it frequently happened that our volunteers approached the english trenches without being perceived and without even ﬁring single shot and found the soldiers of the guard sitting in the trench in the most perfect security far from their ﬁrelocks which were stacked in piles with the french matters were quite different they were always on the qui vive so that it rarely happened we were able to get near them without having been remarked and without having to receive beforehand sharp ﬁre of musketry this however russell remarks was when the english army was at its lowest condition of neglect but that simply transfers the indictment to another count and it is interesting to observe that russell claim the english army and todleben claim the russian army come at last to about the same point namely that the individual soldier is in each case tough and resolute to the last degree but this is only the beginning of the merits of the french array which to individual courage superadds all that organization can attain pg 639 the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 15 91 may https to the poor turks they are dismissed with much the same epitaph which might long since have been written our colored troops if some of our department commanders had been suffered to have their way to the turks the allies despised them and the english used them beasts of burden in short they lost three hundred men day till they almost perished out and the remains of their army were sent away in view of the grander issues of our own pending contest with its vaster scale of munitions and of men one can not always feel the due interest in successive pages about battles like little inkermann where the total of russian killed and wounded comprised ofﬁcers and two hundred and men but it is not numbers which make contest memorable even the mere contemplation of the crimean war had an appreciable inﬂuence on the military training of the american people and the clear narratives of todleben written in his usual elaborate engineering way in which every word is used like gabion form good sequel to that unconscious instruction vanity fair novel without hero by william m akepeace t hackera with illustrations by the author new york harper brothers 3 vols 12mo in the novels of thackeray essay is so much mixed up with narrative and comm ent with characterization that they can hardly be thoroughly appreciated in poor editions the temptation to skip is almost irresistible when wisdom can be purchased only at the expense of eyesight we are therefore glad to welcome the commencement of new edition of his writings over whose pages the reader can linger at his pleasure and quietly enjoy subtilties of humor and observation which in previous perusals he overlooked the present volumes published by the harpers are among the most tasteful and comely products of the cambridge university press printed in large type on tinted paper elegantly bound in green cloth and with of the author autograph on the cover every copy has the appearance of being presentation copy english edition of vanity fair is equal to this american one in respect either to convenience of form or beauty of mechanical execution the illustrations are numerous well engraved and embody the writer own conceptions of his scenes and characters and are often deliciously humorous vanity fair though it does not include the whole extent of thackeray genius is the most vigorous exhibition of its leading characteristics in freshness of feeling elasticity of movement and unity of aim it is favorably distinguished from its successors which too often give the impression of being composed of successive accumul ations of incidents and persons that drift into the story on principle of artistic selection and combination the style while it has the raciness of individual peculiarity and the careless ease of familiar gossip is clear pure and ﬂexible if its sentences had been subjected to repeated revision and every pebble which obstructed its lucid and limpid ﬂow had been laboriously removed the characterization is almost perfect of its kind becky sharp the marquis of steyne sir pitt crawley and the whole crawley family amelia the osbornes major dobbin not to mention others are well known to most cultivated people their most intimat acquaintances in the vanity fair of the actual world it has always seemed to us that osborne the father of geor ge representation of the most hateful phase of english character is one of the most vividly true and of all the delineations in the book and more of typical personage than even becky or the marquis of steyne thackeray theory of characterization proceeds generally on the assumption that the acts of men and wom en are directed not by principle but by instincts selﬁsh or amiable toleration human weakness is possible only by lowering the standard of human capacity and obligation that the preliminary condition of an accurate knowledge of human character is distrust of ideals and repudiation of patterns this view is narrow and by means covers all the facts of history and human life but what relative truth it has is splendidly illustrated in vanity fair there is not person in the book who excites the reader respect and not one who fails to excite his interest the morbid quickness of the author perceptions of the selﬁsh element even in his few amiable characters is constant source of surprise the novel not only has hero but pg 640 the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 15 91 may https the of heroism yet the fascination of the book is indisputable and it is due to variety of causes besides its mere exhibition of the worldly side of life among these the perfect intellectual honesty of the writer the sad or satirical sincerity with which he gives in his evidence against human nature is the most prominent with all his lightness of manner he is essen tially witness under oath and testiﬁes only to what he is conﬁdent he knows perhaps this quality rare not only in but in all writing would not compensate the limitation of his perceptions and the repulsiveness of much that he perceives were it not the peculiar charm of his representation it is here that the individuality of the man appears and it presents combination of sentiments and powers more original perhaps than the matter of his works take from vanity fair that special element of interest which comes from thackeray own nature and it would lose the greater portion of its fascination it is not so much what is done the way in which it is done that surprises and delights and the manner is always inimitable even when the matter is common seaside and fireside fairies translated from the german of geor ge blum and louis wahl by wistar philadelphia ashmead evans these pretty fairy stories peep at us out of through pleasant clear translation and they remind us how easily the supernatural and loves to dwell in airborn castles the beautiful instinct of reverence common to is readily taken advantage of by writers the young but where in england we ﬁnd in stories some who discovers the treachery of her governess and teaches her own children or rotund uncle who tips the boys providentially it seems in germany the protectors of children possess nearer abode than the land of fairy and their presence is rare that of the indian vanishers perhaps even among american children the tales which approximate more nearly to their exper ience hold the strongest attractive powe r
