methodical new england life we still recognize some magic in summer most persons reluctantly resign themselves to being decently happy in june at least they accept june they compliment its weather they complained of the earlier months cold and so spent them in the city and they will complain of the later months hot and so refrigerate themselves on some barren god offers us yearly necklace of twelve pearls most men choose the fairest label it june and cast the rest away it is time to chant hymn of more liberal gratitude there are days in the whole round year more delicious than those which often come to us in the latter half of april on these days one goes forth in the morning and an italian warmth broods over all the hills taking visible shape in glistening mist of silvered azure with which mingles the smoke from many bonﬁres the sun trembles in his own soft rays till one understands the old english tradition that he dances on easter swimming in sea of glory the tops of the hills look nearer than their bases and their glistening watercourses seem close to the eye is their liberated murmur to the ear all across this broad interval the teams are ploughing the grass in the meadow seems all to have grown green since yesterday the blackbirds jangle in the oak the robin is perched upon the elm the on the hazel and the bluebird on the there rises hawk and sails slowly the stateliest of airy things ﬂoating dream of long and languid summer but yet though there is warmth enough sense of luxury there is coolness enough exertion tropics can offer such burst of joy indeed zone much warmer than our northern states can offer genuine spring there can be none where there is winter and the monotone of the seasons is broken only by wearisome rains vegetation and birds being distributed over the year there is burst of verdure nor of song but with us the buds are swelling the birds are arriving they are building their nests almost simultaneously and in all the southern year there is such rapture of beauty and of melody here marks every morning from the last of april onward but days even earlier than these in april have charm days that seem raw and rainy when the sky is dull and bequest of lingers chasing the squirrel from the tree and the children from the meadows there is fascination in walking through these bare early woods is such pause of preparation winter work is so cleanly and thoroughly done everything is taken down and put away throughout the leafy arcades the branches show remnant of last year save few twisted leaves of oak and beech few empty of the tardy and few gnawed nutshells dropped coquettishly by the squirrels into the crevices of the bark all else is bare but prophetic buds everywhere the whole splendor of the coming summer concentrated in those hard little knobs on every bough and clinging here and there among them brown papery chrysalis from which shall yet wave the superb wings of the luna moth an occasional shower patters on the dry leaves but it does not silence the robin on the outskirts of the wood indeed he sings louder than ever though the and the bluebird are silent then comes the sweetness of the nights in latter april there is yet to open suddenly cistus to drop its petals but the knows the hour and the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 07 42 april 1861 magazine of literature

the meadows mingled soon with hoarser toads who take to the water at this season to deposit their spawn the soon join them but one listens in vain bullfrogs or katydids or grasshoppers or whippoorwills or crickets we must wait them until the delicious june the earliest familiar token of the coming season is the expansion of the stiff catkins of the alder into soft drooping tresses these are so sensitive that if you pluck them at almost any time during the winter day bright sunshine will make them open in glass of water and thus they eagerly yield to every moment of april warmth the blossom of the birch is more delicate that of the willow more showy but the alders come ﬁrst they cluster and dance everywhere upon the bare boughs above the watercourses the blackness of the buds is softened into rich brown and yellow and this graceful creature thus comes waving into the spring it is pleasant to remember that the norse eddas fabled the ﬁrst woman to have been named embla because she was created from an alder the ﬁrst of the spring is like land after sea the two which throughout the northern atlantic states divide this interest are the epigaea repens laurel or and the hepatica triloba liverleaf liverwort or blue anemone of these two the latter is perhaps more immediately exciting on ﬁrst discovery because it does not like the epigaea exhibit its buds all winter but opens its blue eyes almost soon it emer ges from the ground without the rich and delicious odor of its compeer it has an inexpressibly fresh and earthy scent that seems to bring all the promise of the blessed season with it indeed that clod of fresh turf with the inhalation of which lord bacon delighted to begin the day must undoubtedly have been full of the roots of our little hepatica its healthy sweetness belongs to the opening year like chaucer poetry and one thinks that anything more potent and voluptuous would be less enchanting one turns to the then comes richer fascination the senses to pick the is like following in the footsteps of some spendthrift army whic h has scattered the contents of its among beds of scented moss the ﬁngers sink in the soft moist verdure and make at each instant some superb discovery unawares again and again straying carelessly they clutch some new treasure and indeed all is linked together in bright necklaces by secret threads beneath the surface and where you grasp at one you hold many the hands go wandering over the moss over the keys of piano and bring forth fragrance melody the lovely creatures twine and nestle and lay their glowing faces to the very earth beneath withered leaves and what seemed mere barrenness becomes fresh and fragrant beauty so great is the charm of the pursuit that the epigaea is really the one which our have hearty passion every village child knows its best haunts and watches it eagerly in the spring boys wreathe their hats with it girls twine it in their hair and the are ﬁlled with its beauty in collecting these early ﬂowers one ﬁnds or fancies singular natural afﬁnities i ﬂatter myself with being able always to ﬁnd hepatica if there is any within reach i was brought up with it cockatoo he know berry well but other persons who were brought up with and remember searching it with their almost can ﬁnd that better the most remarkable instance of these natural afﬁnities was in the case of and his

had bent down in ecstasy at last over its darlings and left visible kisses there but even this success was not enough and one day he came with something yet choicer it was anemone thalictraides and if you will believe it each one of the three white ﬂowers was double not merely with that multiplicity of petals in the disk which is common with this species but technical ly and horticulturally double like the almond or cherry most exquisitely delicate little petals seeming like he had three specimens one to the autocrat of botany who said it was almost or quite unexampled and another to the man in the fable says of the chameleon i have it yet and can produce it now comes the marvel the next winter went to new york year and wrote to spring drew near with solemn charge to visit his favorite haunt and ﬁnd another specimen armed with this letter of introduction i sought the spot and tramped through and through its leafy corridors beautiful i found to be sure trembling on their fragile stems deserving all their pretty names easter and homeopathic pulsatilla anemones i found also rising taller and straighter and ﬁrmer in stem with the whorl of leaves little higher up on the stalk than one fancies it ought to be if there were supposed danger that the ﬂowers would lose their balanc and if the leaves must be all ready to catch them these i found but the special wonder was not there then i wrote to that he must evidently come himself and search or that perhaps sir thomas browne avers that smoke doth follow the fairest so his little treasures had followed him towards new york judge of my surprise when on opening his next letter out dropped from those folds of metropolitan paper veritable double anemone he had just been out to hoboken or some such place to spend an afternoon and of course his pets were there to meet him and from that day to this i have never heard of the thing happening to any one else is never allowed to pass in this community without profuse lamentati ons over the tardiness of our spring compared with that of england and the poets yet it is very common to exaggerate this difference even so good an observer wilson flagg is betrayed into saying that the epigaea and hepatica seldom make their appearance until after the middle of april in massachusetts and that it is not unusual the whole month of april to pass away without producing more than two or three species of but i have formerly found the hepatica in bloom at mount auburn three successive years on the of march and last spring it was actually found farther inland where the season is later on the seventeenth the is usually early though the more gradual expansion of the buds renders it less easy to give dates and there are nearly twenty species whic h i have noted ﬁve or six years together found before and which may therefore be properly assigned to april the list includes bloodroot cowslip houstonia saxifrage dandelion chickweed cinquefoil strawberry bellwort violet ﬁve species of violet proper and two of anemone these are all common ﬂowers and easily observed and the catalogue might be increased by rare ones the white corydalis the smaller yellow violet rotundifolia and the claytonia or but in england the crocus and the snow being probably an indigenous ﬂower since neither is mentioned by chaucer open before the ﬁrst of march indeed the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 07 42 april 1861 magazine of literature art and politics by various https was formerly known by the yet more fanciful name of fair maid of february chaucer daisy comes equally early and march brings daffodils narcissi violets daisies jonquils hyacinths and this is altogether in advance of our season so far the ﬂowers give evidence we have plucked snowdrops in february but on the other hand it would appear that though larger number of birds winter in england than in massachusetts yet the return of those which migrate is actually earlier among us from journals kept during sixty years in england and an abstract of which is printed in hone book it appears that only two birds of passage revisit england before the ﬁfteenth of april and only thirteen more before the ﬁrst of may while with us the sparrow and the bluebird appear about the ﬁrst of march and quite number more by the middle of april this is peculiarity of the english spring which i have never seen explained or even mentioned after the epigaea and the hepatica have opened there is slight pause among the ﬂowers two forming distinct prologue their annual drama the brilliant hazel in october brings up its separate epilogue the truth is nature attitudinizes little liking to make neat ﬁnish with everything and then to begin again with éclat flowers seem spontaneous things enough but there is evidently secret marshalling among them that all may be brought out with due effect the say that so long any snow is left on the ground more snow may be expected it must all vanish simultaneously at last every seeker of has observed how accurately they seem to move in platoons with little straggling each species seems to burst upon us with united impulse you may search them day after day in vain but the day when you ﬁnd one specimen the spell is broken and you ﬁnd twenty by the end of april all the margins of the great poem of the woods are illuminated with these exquisite vignettes most of the early ﬂowers either come before the full unfolding of their leaves or else have inconspicuous ones yet nature always provides her bouquets the due proportion of green the verdant and graceful sprays of the wild raspberry are unfolded very early long before its time of ﬂowering over the meadows spread the regular of the equisetum horsetail or and the rich coarse vegetation of

walton bids the angler with his worm there is this merit at least among the coarser crew of imported ﬂowers that they bring their own proper names with them and we know precisely whom we have to deal with in speaking of our own native ﬂowers we must either be careless and inaccurate or else resort sometimes to the latin in spite of the indignation of friends there is something yet to be said on this point in england where the old household and monkish names adhere they are sufﬁcient popular and poetic purposes and the familiar use of scientiﬁc names seems an affectation but here where many native ﬂowers have popular names at all and others are called confessedly by wrong ones it really costs less trouble to use latin names the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 07 42

nomenclature become tolerable at last and we forget the man in the more attractive ﬂower are those who pick the houstonia to be supposed thereby to indorse the texan president or are the deluded

botanist there is peculiar ﬁtness in the association the linaea at least would not smell so sweet by any other name in other cases the english name is mere modiﬁcation of the latin one and our ideal associations have really scientiﬁc basis with violet lily laurel gentian vervain indeed our enthusiasm vernacular names is like that indian names we enumerate only the graceful ones and ignore the rest it would be pity to latinize not or yarrow or or or columbine or to be sure this last has an annoying way of shutting up its azure orbs the moment you gather it and you reach home with bare stiff blade which deserves better name than sisyrinchium anceps but in what respect is cucumber preferable to medeola or seal to convallaria or ripe to umbilicaria or lousewort to pedicularis in other cases

be latin and incorrect at the same time it does seem waste of time to say chrysanthemum leucanthemum instead of whiteweed though if the long scientiﬁc name were an incantation to banish the intruder our farmers would gladly consent to adopt it but the great advantage of reasonable use of the botanical name is that it does not deceive us our primrose is not the english primrose any more than it

its wizar d black length across the underbrush into the earth and out again wrenching up great stones in its blind aimless struggle what piece of chaos is this yet come here again two months hence and

livelong day out of the strong cometh forth sweetness to the end of april and often later one still ﬁnds remains of snowbanks in sheltered woods especially those consisting of evergreen trees and this snow like that upon high mountains has become hardened by the repeated thawing and freezing of the surface till it is more impenetrable than ice but the snow that actually falls during april is usually only what vermonters call sugar in the night and just whitening the surface an hour or two and taking its name not so much from its looks from the fact that it denotes the proper weather sugaring namely cold nights and warm days our saccharine associations however remain so obstinately tropical that it seems almost impossible the imagination to locate sugar in new england trees though it is known that not the maple only but the birch and the walnut even af ford it in appreciable quantities along our maritime rivers the people associate april not with sugaring but with shadding the

certainty the egg or tadpole of frog from that of toad and it is strange that these hopping creatures which seem so unlike should coincide so nearly in their juvenile career while the tritons and salamanders which border so closely on each other in their maturer state sometimes to be hardly distinguishable yet choose different methods and different elements laying their eggs the eggs of our

others still more singular he had known those who could not bear the presenc of cat and recollected the story often told of person hiding one in chest when one of these sensitive individuals came into

lightened her last days we should pour out our hearts in thankful acknowledgment from the life and the death of this our dear sister we should learn lesson of patience with our in their inborn

gentler means the soul which had been left by nature to wander into the path of error and of suffering might be reclaimed and restored to its true aim and so led on by divine grace to its eternal

of the necessaries of life this high standard is of course an evil to those whose social ambition drives them to rivalry which they are not prepared but special pity is due to hardships by pride and

developed itself has taken us by surprise we knew that when the people truly realized their sovereignty they would claim not only the utilitarian but the artistic and muniﬁcent attributes of their throne and that all the splendors and decorations all the provisions leisure taste and recreation which kings and courts have made would be found to be mere preludes and rehearsals to the grander arrangements and achievements of the vastly richer and more legitimate sovereign the people when he understood his own right and duty dynasties and thrones have been predictions of the royalty of the people so old courts and old capitals with all their pomp and circumstance their parks and gardens galleries and statues are but dim preﬁgurings of the glories of architecture the grandeur of the grounds the splendor and richness of the museums and conservatories with which the peopl will ﬁnally crown their own and decorate their own majesty but we did not expect to see this sure prophecy turning itself into history in our day we thought the people were too busy with the spade and the quill to care any other sceptres at present but it is now plain that they have been dreaming princely

popular one but to engraft the energy foresight and liberality of concentrated powers upon democratic ideas and keep all that has adorned and improved the past while abandoning what has impaired and

author and achiever of the central park when completed will prove we are conﬁdent the most splendid satisfactory and popular park in the world two grand assumptions have controlled the design from the inception first that the park would be the only park deserving the name town of twice or thrice the present population of new york that this town would be built compactly around it and in this respect of centrality it would differ from any extant metropolitan park of magnitude and that it would be town of greater wealth and more luxurious demands than any now existing second that while in harmony with the luxury of the rich the park should and would be used more than any existing park by people of moderate wealth and by poor people and that its use by these people must be made safe convenient agreeable that they must be expected to have pride and pleasure in using it rightly in cherishing and protecting it against all causes of injury and dilapidation and that this is to be provided and encouraged want of appreciation of the ﬁrst assumption is the cause of all sincere criticism against the transverse roads some engineers originally pronounced them impracticable of construction but all their grounds of apprehension have been removed by the construction of two of them especially by the completion of the tunnel under vista rock and below the foundation of the reservoir embankment and wall they were planned the future they are being built solidly massively permanently the future less thoroughly and expensively constructed they would need to be rebuilt in the future at enormously increased cost and with great interruption to the use of the park and the grounds in their vicinity losing the advantage of age would need to be remodelled and remade an engineer visiting the park the ﬁrst time and hearing the criticism to which we refer applied to the walls and bridges of the transverse roads observed people in this country are so unaccustomed to see genuine substantial work they not know what it means when they meet with it we think he did not the people justice the transverse roads passing through the park will not be seen from it and although they will not be when deep in the shadow of the overhanging bridges and groves without very grand beauty this will be the beauty of utility and of permanence not of imaginative grace the various bridges and archways of the park proper while equally thorough in their mode of construction and consequently expensive are in all cases embellished each with special decorations in form and color these decorations have the same quality of substantiality and thorough good workmanship note the clean under of the leaves of which there are more than ﬁfty different forms in the decorations of the terrace arch and their consequent sharp and expressive shadows admitting the need of these structures and the economy of method of construction which would render them permanent the additional cost of their permanent decoration in this way could not have been rationally grudged regard the distant future has likewise controlled the planting and the commissioners in so far they have resisted the clamor of the day that the park must be immediately shaded have done wisely every horticulturist knows that this immediate shade would be purchased at an expense of dwarfed diseased and deformed trees with stinted shade in the future man has planted large and small trees together without regretting the former within twenty years the same consideration answers an objection which has been made that the trees are too much arranged in masses of color imagine growth of twenty years with the proper thinnings the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 07 42 april 1861 magazine of

else regard to the convenience comfort and safety of those who can not afford to visit the park in carriages has led to an unusual exten t and variety of character in the walks and also to peculiar arrangement by which they are carried in many instances beneath and across the line of the thus access can be had by pedestrians to all parts of the park at times when the roads are thronged with vehicles without any delays or dangers in crossing the roads and without the humiliation to sensitiv democrats of being spattered or dusted or looked down upon from luxurious equipages the great irregularity of the surface offers facilities this purpose walks being carried through the heads of valleys which are crossed by the upon arches of masonry now with regard to these archways if purposes of convenience were to be served by them the park would not we may admit be beautiﬁed by them but we assume that the population of new york is to be doubled that when it is so if not sooner the walks and drives of the park will often be densely throng ed and the comfort of the people when that shall be the case we consider that these archways will be absolutely necessary assuming further then that they are to be built and if ever built now it would involve an entirely of the park to introduce them in the future was necessary to pay some attention to make them agreeable and unmonotonous objects or the general impression of ease freedom and variety would be interfered with very materially it is not to make the park architectural is commonly supposed that various and somewhat expensive design is introduced on the contrary it is the intention to plant closely in the vicinity of all the arches so that they may be unnoticed in the general effect and be seen only just at the time they are being used when of course they must come under notice the charge is made that the features of the natural landscape have been disregarded in the plan to which we answer that on the ground of the lower park there was originally landscape in the artistic sense there were hills and hillocks and rocks and swampy valleys it would have been easy to ﬂood the swamps into ponds to clothe the hillocks with grass and the hills with foliage and leave the rocks each unscathed in its picturesqueness and this would have been great improvement yet there would be landscape there would be an unassociated succession of objects nice bits of scenery appropriate to or to an artist but scenery such an artist arranges his broad canvas composition prospect it would have afforded good place

substantially underlaid are now ﬁnished eighteen archways are planned beside those of the transverse roads equal 1 to 46 acres when the planting is two of the archways will be visible from the same point to their supply there were hard limitations on each side within half mile of each other there were to be lines of stone and brick houses cutting off any great lateral distance suppose one to have entered the park at the south end and to have moved far enough within it to dispossess his mind of the sentiments of the streets he will have threaded his way between hillocks and rocks one after another differing in magnitude but never opening landscape having breadth or distance he ascends hill and looks northward the most distant object is the hard straight horizontal line of the stone wall of the reservoir ﬂanked on one side by the peak of vista rock it is little over mile distant standing clear out against the horizon appears much less than that hide it with foliage well the houses right and left and the limitation of distance is mile in front and quarter of mile upon each side low hills or ridges of rock in great degree cut off the intermediate ground from view cross these and the same unassociated succession of objects might be visited but one of them would have engaged the visitor attention and attracted him onward from distance the plan has evidently been to make selection of the natural features to form the leading ideas of the new scenery to magnify the most important quality of each of these and to remove or tone down all the irregularities of the ground between them and by all means to make the limit of vision undeﬁned and obscure thus in the central portion of the lower park the low grounds have been generally ﬁlled and the high grounds reduced but the two largest areas of low ground have been excavated the excavation being carried laterally into the hills far was possible without extravagant removal of rock and the earth obtained transferred to higher ground connecting hillocks with hills excavations have also been made about the base of all the more remarkable ledges and peaks of rock while additional material has been conveyed to their sides and summits to increase their size and dignity this general rule of the plan was calculated to give in the ﬁrst place breadth and in the second emphasis to any general prospe ct of the park want of unity or rather if we may use the word of assemblage belonged to the ground and it must have been one of the ﬁrst problems to establish some one conspicuous salient idea which should take the lead in the composition and about which all minor features should seem naturally to group accessories the straight evidently artiﬁcial and hence distinctive and notable mall with its terminating terrace was the resolution of this problem it will be when the trees are fully grown feature of the requisite importance will serve the further purpose of opening the view toward and it were framing and keeping attention directed upon vista rock which from the southern end of the mall is the most distant object that can be brought into view the same purpose evidently it was thought desirable to insist far possible upon pause at the point where to the visitor proceeding northward the whole and glen before vista rock ﬁrst came under view and where an effect of distance in that direction was yet attainable this is provided by the terrace with its several stairs and stages and temptations to linger and rest the introduction of the lake to the northward of the terrace also obliges diversion from the direct line of proceeding the visitor attention is henceforth directed laterally or held by local objects until at length by circuitous route he reaches the project gutenberg ebook of the

the remarkable good order and absence of accidents which have characterized it see 64 of annual report some particulars of cost see pp 61 62 of same report in all european parks there is more or less land the only use of which is to give greater length to the roads which pass around it being out of sight and in american phrase unimproved there is not an acre of land in central park which if not wanted park purposes would not sell at least much the land surrounding the park and beyond its limits is to say at least the legal annual interest of which is this would be the ratio of the annual waste of property in the case of any land not put to use but in elaborating the plan care has been taken that part of the park should be without its special advantages attractions or valuable uses and that these should far possible be made immediately available to the public the comprehensiveness of purpose and the variety of detail of the plan far exceed those of any other park in the world and

women and children at regular hours during the day some weekly and some at irregular but certain frequent chances of their business astor when in town rarely misses his daily ride nor bancr oft mayor

increases when we meet those who depend on the park on the butcher and the omnibus and the thousands who are again drawn by whatever impulse and suggestion of the hour we often ask what would they have done where would they have been to what sort of recreation would they have turned if to any had there been park of one sort the answer is supplied by the keeper of certain saloon who came to the park he said to see his old sunday customers the enjoyment of the ice had made them forget their grog six or seven years ago an opposition brought down the prices and quadrupled the accommodations of

bantering and offering ﬁght joking coarsely profane noisy demonstrative in any and every way to the end of attracting attention to themselves and proclaiming that they were on spree and highly excited they could not keep it up they became awkward ill at ease and at length silent standing looking about them in stupid wonder evidently they could not understand what it meant people drinking smoking in public on sunday and yet not excited not trying to make it spree it was not comprehensible we ascertained that one of the boat bars had disposed of an enormous stock of lemonade ginger and before three till this was all gone not half dozen glasses of intoxicat ing drinks we saw quarrelling drunkenness and nothing like the fearful disorder which had been described few such exceptions we have

skulking to or from their work not many even of the inhabitants of manufacturing town know the vast machinery of system by which the bodies of workmen are governed that goes on unceasingly from year

sometimes to withdraw little from the dust and smoke of the battle which with us at least announces the spread of this potentate power and to try to disentangle the real questions at issue in the struggle from the eternal complications produced by politicians and popular issues looking at the policy and tenden cy of the reign of king cotton hitherto developed and indicated by its most conﬁdential advisers and apostles and by the lapse of time in the slave states to what end does it necessarily tend to what results must it logically lead what is coarsely but expressively described

vision of other angry combatants since the world began it is easy to say in days like these that men seem at once to lose their judgment and reason when they approach this question look hardly an arm length before them become mere tools of their own passions and all this is true and in conceding it all more is conceded than that the men of the present day are also mortal how many voters in the last election before they went to the polls had seriously thought out themselves the real issue of the contest apart from party names and platforms and popular cries and passionate appeals to the conscience and the purse in all parties some doubtless were impelled by fanaticism were guided by instinct by the voice of their leaders by party catchwords and material interests how many by real reﬂection and the exercise of reason was it every ﬁfth man or every tenth was it every ﬁftieth let every one judge himself the history of the reigning dynasty its policy and tendency are still open questions the discussion of which though perhaps become tedious is not exhausted and if conducted in fair spirit will at least harm what then is all this thirty years turmoil of which the world is growing sick about are we indeed only ﬁghting the at the north seem trying to persuade us the control by the interests of free labor or of of certain remaining national territories into which probably slavery never could be made to enter rather is there not some deep innate principle strong motive of aggrandizement or preservation real enceladus the cause of this furious volcano of destructive

limit save the value of the motive principle he who now pretends to discuss this question should approach it neither whig democrat nor republican but should look at it by the light of political

suppress education or destroy intelligence strikes at the very essence of the government and constitutes treason which law can meet and which punishment is adequate education then universally diffused the elements of god is the of our body politic the intelligence of the people is the one great fact of our civiliz ation and our prosperity is the beating heart of our age and of our land it is education alone which makes equality possible without anarchy and liberty without license it is makes the fundamental principles of our declaration of independence living realities in new england

we quickly retrace our steps we fall and are lost the tutelary goddess of american liberty should be the pure marble image of the professor yankee mistress education is the fundamental support of our system it was education which made us free progressive and conservative and it is education alone which can keep us so with this fact clearly established the next inquiry should be to the bearing and policy of the cotton dynasty touching this question of general intelligence it is mere truism to say that the is the cause of the present philosophical and economical phase of the african question throughout the south whether justly or not it is considered well settled that cotton can be proﬁtably raised only by forced system of labor this theory has been denied by some writers and in experience is certainly subject to some marked exceptions but undoubtedly it is the creed of the cotton dynasty and must here therefore be taken true with this theory the southern states are under direct inducement in the nature of bribe to the amount of the annual proﬁt on their to see many perfections and few imperfections possible in the system of african slavery and to follow it out unﬂinchingly into all its logical necessities thus under the direct inﬂuence of the cotton dynasty the whole southern tone on this subject has under gone change slavery is longer deplored necessary evil but it is maintained in all respects substantial good one of the logical necessities of thorough is in at least the of the people extreme ignorance whatever theoretica lly may be desirable in this respect among the master class ignorance in its worst form of everything except the use of the tools the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 07 42 april 1861 magazine of literature art and politics by various https their work is to be done the necessary condition of the slaves but it is said that slaves are property without voice or inﬂuence in the government and that the ignorance of the black is obstacle to the intelligence of the white this possibly may be true but government founded on ignorance the essential condition of one portion of its people is not likely long to regard education its vital source and essence still the assertion that the rule of education does not apply to slaves must be allowed we must deal with facts we ﬁnd them and undoubtedly the slave has rights which the master is bound to respect and in speaking of the policy of the cotton dynasty the servile population must be regarded it is ignoring the question of what it might be it must be taken into consideration only terrible inert mass of domesticated barbarism and there left the question here is solely with the policy and tendency of the cotton dynasty affecting the master and the servile class is in that consideration to be summarily disposed of so much labor owned by so much capital footnote in truth the institution of slavery an agency is an expensive luxury dangerous and artiﬁcial state and even in point of view an error the cost of negro in the united states is about and the interest on the capital invested in and the wear and tear of this human chattel

chinese emigrants not receive so much even of this cotton trade of great britain by mann india labor is 80 per cent cheaper than in the united states the dynasty of cotton is based on the monopoly of the in the cotton states of the union its whole policy is directed to the two ends of making the most of and retaining that monopoly and economically it reduces everything to subserviency to the question of supply cotton is king the result necessarily is that the cotton states have turned all their energies to that one branch of industry all other branches they abandon or allow to languish they have commerce of their own few manufactories fewer arts and in their abandonment of self in their devotion to their king they not even raise their own hay or corn dig their own coal or fell their own timber and at present louisiana is abandoning the sugar one of the few remainin g exports of the south to share more largely in the monopoly of cotton thus the community necessarily loses its fair proportions it ceases to be it exercises one faculty alone until all the others wither and become impotent very lack of use this intense and devotion to one pursuit and that pursuit to which the existence of servile class is declared essential must in republ ic more than in any other government produce certain marked and economical effects on the master whole in country conducted on system of servile labor in one conducted on free the master must be divided into the two great orders of the rich and poor who have and those who have not that the whole policy of the cotton dynasty tends necessarily to making broader the chasm between these orders is most apparent it makes the rich richer and the poor poorer according to the creed of the dynasty capital should own labor and the labor thus owned can alone successfully produce cotton he who has must be continually increasing his store while he who has not can neither raise the one staple recognized by the cotton dynasty nor turn his labor his only property to other branches the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 07 42 april 1861 magazine of literature art and politics by various https such have in the universal abandonment of the community to cotton been allowed to languish and die the economical tendency of the cotton dynasty is therefore to divide the master yet more distinctly into the two great opposing orders of society on the one hand we see the capitalist owning the labor of thousand slaves and on the other the laboring white unable under the destru ctive inﬂuence of proﬁtable monopol y to make any use of that labor which is his only property what inﬂuence then has the cotton dynasty on that portion of the master who are without capital its tendency has certain ly necessarily been to make their labor of little value but they are still citizens of republic free to come and go and in the eye of the law equal with the highest them in times of emer gency the government must rest their education and intelligence are its only sure foundations but having made this class the vast majority of the master what are the policy and tendency of the cotton dynasty touching them the story is almost too old to bear even the shortest repetition philosophically it is logical necessity of the cotton dynasty that it should be opposed to universal intelligence economically it renders universal intelligence an impossibility that slavery is in itself positive good to society is fundamental doctrine of the cotton dynasty and proposition not necessary to be combated here but unfortunately universal intelligence renders free discussion necessity and experience tells us that the suppression of free discussion is necessary to the existence of slavery we are but living history over again the same causes have often existed before and they have drawn after them the necessary effects other peoples at other times well our southern brethren at present have felt that the suppression of general discussion was necessary to the preservation of prized and peculiar institution spain italy germany france the netherlands england and scotland have all at different times experienced the forced suppression of some one branch of political or religious thought their histories have recorded the effect of that suppression and the rule to be deduc ed therefrom is simply this if the people among whom such suppression is attempted are ignorant and are kept so part of system the attempt may be successful though in its results working destruction to the community however they are intelligent and the syste m incautiously admits into itself any plan of education the attempt at suppression will be abandoned the result either of policy or violence in this respect then on philosophical grounds the cotton dynasty is not likely to favor the education of the masses again it is undoubtedly the interest of the man who has not that all possible branches of industry should be open to his labor rendering that labor of greater value but the whole tendency of the cotton monopoly is to blight all branches of industry in the cotton states save only that one general intelligence might lead the poor white to suspect this fact of an interest of his own antagonistic to the policy of the cotton king and therefore general intelligence is not part of that monarch policy this the philosophers of the cotton dynasty fairly avow and class high among those dangers against which it behooves them to be on their guard they theorize thus the great mass of our poor white popu lation begin to understand that they have rights and that they too are entitled to some of the sympathy which falls upon the suffering they are fast learning that there is an almost inﬁnite world of industry opening before them by which they can elevate themselves and their familie s from wretchedness and ignorance to competence and intelligence it is this great upheaving of our masses which we have to fear so far our institutions are concerned b the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 07 42 april 1861 magazine of literature art and politics by various https footnote b bow review january quoted in olmsted back country p 451 further the policy of the cotton king however honestly in theory it may wish to encourage it renders general education and consequent intelligence an impossibility system of universal education is made laboring population and can be sustained only among laboring population but if that population consist of slaves universal education can not exist the reason is simple the children of all must be educated otherwise the scholars will not support the schools it is an absolute necessity of society that in agricultural districts cultivated by the free population should be too sparsely scattered to support system of schools even on starvation wages the cheapest class of teachers finally though it is subject not necessary now to discuss the effect of the cotton monopoly and dynasty in depressing the majority of the whites into species of labor competition in the same branch of industry the blacks because the only branch open to all can hardly have inﬂuence on that portion of the commun ity but should in its results rather illustrate old falstaf f remark there is thing often heard of and it is known to many in our land by the name of pitch this pitch ancient writers report doth deﬁle so doth the company thou keepest such reason tells us should be the effect on the intelligence and education of the free masses of the south of the policy and dynasty of king cotton that experience in this case veriﬁes the conclusions of reason who can doubt who has ever set foot in thorough slave state in kansas or in any free state by the poor whites of the south who can doubt it that has ever even talked on the subject with an intelligent and southern gentleman who that knows them will deny that the poor whites of the south make the worst population in the country who ever heard southern gentleman speak of them save in congress or on the hustings otherwise than with aversion and contempt c footnote c except when used by the accomplished statistician there is nothing more fallacious than the ﬁgures of the census the author of this article is disciple neither of buckle nor bow they have not been used at all but few of the census ﬁgures are nevertheless instructive showing the difference between the free and the servile states in respect to popular education according to the census of 1850 the white population of the slave states amounted to souls and the colored population free and slave brought the total population up to an aggregate of of which the whole number of pupils was new york with population of souls numbered pupils or more than all the slave states the eight cotton states from south carolina to arkansas with population of whites and grand total of human beings contained pupils the state of massachusetts with total population of numbered or pupils more than all the cotton states in popular governments the great sources of general intelligence are newspapers and periodicals in estimating these metropolitan new york should not be considered but of these the whole number in 1850 issued annually in all the slave states was and the number in the not peculiarly enlightened state of pennsylvania was or more than in all the slave states in the eight cotton states the whole number was and in the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 07 42 april 1861 magazine of literature art and politics by various https state of massachusetts or more and in the single state of ohio or more than in all the above eight states here then we come at once to the foundation of policy and the cause of this struggle whether it will or it is the inevitable tendency of the cotton dynasty to be opposed to general intelligence it is opposed to that then without which republic can not hope to exist it is opposed to and denies the whole results of two thousand years of experience the social system of which the government of is the creature is founded on the principle of generally diffused intelligence of the people but if now cotton be king is so boldly asserted then an inﬂuence has obtained control of the government of which the whole policy is in direct antagonism with the very elementary ideas of that government history tells us that eight bags of cotton imported into england in 1784 were seized by the ouse ofﬁcers at liverpool on the ground that so much cotton could not have been produced in these states in 1860 the was estimated at bales thus king cotton was born with this government and has strengthened with its strength and almost the creature of destiny sent to work the failure of our experi ment people it has led almost of the republic to completely ignore if not to reject the one principle absolutely essential to that republic continued existence what two thousand years ago was said of rome applies to us those abuses and corruptions which in time destroy government are sown along with the very seeds of it and both grow up together and rust eats away iron and worms devour wood and both are sort of plagues born and bred with the substance they destroy so with every form and scheme of government that man can invent some vice or corruption creeps in with the very institution which grows up along with and at last destroys it wonder then that the conﬂict is irrepressible and hot two instinctive principles of have met in deadly conﬂict the south with the eager loyalty of the cavalier rallies to the standard of king cotton while the north with the earnest devotion of the puritan struggles hard in defence of the fundamental principles of its liberties and the ark of its salvation thus over nearly half of the national domain and among large minority of the citizens of the republic the dynasty of cotton has worked diver gence from original principle wherever the sway of king cotton extends the people have the present lost sight of the most essential of our national attributes they are seeking to found great and prosperous republic on the cultivation of single staple product and not on intelligence universally diffused consequently they have founded their house upon the sand among them cotton and not knowledge is power when thus reduced to its logical necessities down it were to the hard pan experience of two thousand years convincingly proves that their experiment democracy must fail it is then question of vital importance to the whole people can this diver gence be terminated is there any result any agency which can destroy this dynasty and restore us people to the ﬁrm foundations upon which our experiment was begun can the present agitation effect this result if it could the country might joyfully bid long farewell to the canker of peace and hail the blossom of war with heart of ﬁre but the sad answer that it can not whether resulting in the successor democrat or republican seems almost too evident discussion the present conﬂict is good so far it goes but it touches only the surface of things it is well to drive the cotton dynasty from the control of the national government but the aims of the republican party can reach farther even if it meet with complete success in that but even that much is doubtful the danger at this point is one ever recurrin those northern politicians who in pursuit of the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 07 42 april

bowed to receive any burden the men who in the present conﬂict will see nought but the result of the maudlin sentimentality of fanatics and the empty cries of ambitious demagogues not mistaken in their calculations while cotton is king it now is nothing but time or its own insanity can permanently shake its hold on the national policy in moments of ﬁerce convulsion at present the north like restive steed may contest its supremacy let the south however bend not break before the storm and history is indeed nurse tale if the ﬁnal victory does not rest with the party of unity and discipline while the monopoly of cotton exists with the south and it is cultivated exclusively by native african labor the national government will surely tend in spite of all momentarily disturbing inﬂuences towards unite d south the needle to the pole but even if the government were permanently wrested from its control would the evil be remedied surely not the disease which is sapping the foundations of our liberty is not eradicated because its workings are forced inward what remedy is that which leaves false and pernicious policy in avowed war with the whole spirit of our civilization and in open hostility to our whole experiment full working almost religious creed with near of our people remedy this would be but quack medicine at the best the cure must be more thorough one the remedy we must look only one which can meet the exigencies of the be one which will restore to the south the attributes of democracy it must cause our southern brethren of their own free will to reverse their steps return from their diver gence it must teach them purer christianity truer philosophy sounder economy it must lead them to new paths of industry it must gently persuade them that true national prosperity is not the result of total abandonment of the community to the culture of one staple it must make them so that longer they shall have to import their corn from the northwest their lumber and hay from maine their manufactures from massachusetts their minerals from pennsylvania and to employ the shippin g of the world finally it must make it impossible one overgrown interest to plunge the whole community unresistingly into frantic rebellion or needless war they must learn that state is so far may be perfect in itself to be perfect in itself must be intelligent and free when these lessons are taught to the south then will their diver gence cease and they will enter upon new path of enjoyment prosperity and permanence the world at present pays them an annual bribe of some to learn none of these lessons their material interest teaches them to bow down to the shrine of king cotton here then lies the remedy with the disease the prosperity of the country in general and of the south in particular demands that the reign of king cotton should cease his dynasty should be destroyed this result can be obtained but in one way and that seemingly ruinous the present monopoly in their great staple commodity enjoyed by the south must be destroyed and forever this result every patriot and of the south should ever long and yet by every southern statesman and philosopher it is regarded the one irremediable evil possible to their country what miserable economy what feeble foresight what principle of political economy is better established than that monopoly is curse to both producer and consumer to the ﬁrst it pays premium on fraud sloth and negligence and to the second it supplies the worst possible article in the wors t possible way at the highest possible price in agriculture in manufactures in the professions and in the arts it is the greatest bar to improvement with which any branch of industry can be cursed the south is now showing to the world an example of

of labor love of cotton the very intelligence of the community the of their polity is disregarded and forgotten hence it is that the marble and freestone quarries of new england alone are far more important sources of revenue than all the subterranean deposits of the servile states thus the monopoly which is the apparent source of their wealth is in reality their greatest curse it blinds them to the fact that with nations with individuals healthy competition is the one essential to all true economy and real excellence monopolists are always blind always practise false economy adam smith tells us that it is not more than ﬁfty years ago that some of the counties in the neighborhood of london petitioned the parliament against the extension of the turnpike roads into the remoter counties those remoter counties they pretended from the cheapness of labor would be able to sell their grass and corn cheaper in the lond on market than themselves and would thereby reduce their rents and ruin their cultivation the great economist signiﬁcantly adds their rents however have risen and their cultivatio n has been improved since that time finally would the cultivation of cereals in the northwest be improved if made monopoly would its inhabitants be richer would their econo my be better certainly not yet they undersell the world and in spite of competition are far richer far more contented and prosperous than their in the south in the full enjoyment of their boasted dynasty of cotton here said wellington on the eton football ground we won the battle of waterloo not in angry

through the agency of england and in accordance with those laws under continuance of the present proﬁt on that staple the dynasty of king cotton is doomed monopoly which is now the basis of his power will be monopoly more if saved at all from the blight of this monopoly the south will be saved not in new york or boston but in liverpool by the thinkers of america but by the merchants of england the real danger of the cotton dynasty lies not in the hostility of the north but in the exigencies of the market abroad they struggle not against the varying fortunes of political warfare but against the irreversible decrees of fate it is the old story of the rutulian hero and now in the very crisis and agony of the battle while the cotton king is summoning all his resources and straining every nerve to cope successfully with its more apparent but less formidable adversary in the noisy struggle temporary power if it would listen moment to the voice of reason and observe the still working of the laws of our being it too might see cause to abandon the contest with the angry lament that not by its opponent was it vanquished but by the hostility of jupiter and the gods the operation of the laws of trade touching this monopoly is beautifully simple already the indications are sufﬁcient to tell us that under the sure but silent working of those laws the very proﬁts of the southern planter foreshadow the destruction of his monopoly his dynasty rests upon the theory that his negro is the only practical agency the production of his staple but the supply of african labor is limited and the increased proﬁt on cotton renders the cost of the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 07 42 april 1861 magazine of literature art and politics by various https heavier in its turn

under the increased consumption of the cotton consumed at liverpool is the product of climes other than our own hundreds of miles of railroad in india are opening to the market vast regions to share

that country has risen from poun ds in 1830 to pounds in 1840 and ﬁnally to pounds in 1857 or nearly twenty per cent of the whole amount imported and more than of the whole amount imported from

enterprise of travellers seems about to make known her secrets under the persuasive arguments of trade and to make her cotton and not her children her staple export in the future in the last fact is to be seen poetic justice africa outraged scorned trodden is perhaps to drag down forever the great enslaver of her of fspring thus the monopoly of king cotton hangs upon thread its proﬁts must fall or it must cease to exist if subject to disturbing inﬂuence such war which would force the world to look elsewhere its supply and thus unnaturally force production elsewhere the growth of this competition will probably be slow another war of 1812 or any civil convulsions would force england to look to other sources of supply and thus forcing production would probably be the of the monopoly apart from all disturbing inﬂuences arising from the rashness of his own lieges or other causes the reign of king cotton at present prices may be expected to continue some ten years longer so long then this disturbing inﬂuence may be looked in american politics and then we may hope the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 07 42 april 1861 magazine of literature art and

the course of years competition gradually increases the effect of this competitio n on the south will probably be most beneﬁcial the change from monopoly to competition distributed over many years will come with sudden and destructive shock but will take place imperceptibly the fall of the dynasty will be gradual and with the dynasty must fall its policy its fruits must be eradicated by time under the healing inﬂuence of time the south still young and energetic ceasing to think of one thing alone will quickly turn its attention to many education will be more sought the policy which resisted it and made its diffusion impossible ceases to exist with the growth of other branches of industry labor will become respectable and proﬁtable and laborers will ﬂock to the country and new purer and more prosperous future will open upon the entire republic perhaps also it may in time be discovered that even is most proﬁtable when most intelligent and best rewarded the present mode of growing cotton is the most wasteful and extravagant and one not bearing competition thus even the african may reap beneﬁt from the result and in his increased and intelligence may be found the real prosperity of the master and thus the peaceful laws of trade may the work which agitation has attempted in vain sweet concord may come from this dark chaos and the world receive another proof that material interest well understood is not in conﬂict but in beautiful unison with general morality intelligence and the precepts of christianity under these inﬂuences too the very supply of cotton will probably be immensely increased its cultivation like the cultivation of their staple products by the english counties mentioned by smith will not languish but ﬂourish under the inﬂuence of healthy views though simply the apparently legitimate result of principle and experience are by means unsuppor ted by authority they are the same results arrived at from the reﬂections of the most unprejudiced of observers shrewd northern gentleman who has more recently and thoroughly than any other writer travelled through the southern states in the ﬁnal summary of his observations thus covers all the positions here taken my conclusion says olmsted is this there is physical obstacle in the way of our country supplying ten bales of cotton where it now does one all that is necessary this purpose is to direct to the region an adequate number of laborers either black or white or both amalgamation association on equality violent disruption of present relations is necessary it is necessary that there should be more objects of industry more varied enterprises more general intelligence among the people especially that they should become or should desire to become richer more comfortable than they are it is not pleasant to turn from this and view the reverse of the picture but unless our southern brethren in obedience to some great law of trade or morals return from their diver gence still being republic in form the south close her ears to the great truth that education is democracy ﬁrst law of the dynasty of king cotton unshaken by present indications should continue indeﬁnitely and still the south should bow itself down now before its throne requires gift of prophecy to read her future you sow so shall you reap and communities like individuals who sow the wind must in the fulness of time look to reap the whirlwind the constitution of our federal union guaranties to each member composing it republican form of government but constitution can guaranty that universal intelligence of the people without which soon or late republican government must become not only form but mockery under the cotton dynasty the south has undoubtedly lost sight of this great principle and unless she return and bind the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 07 42 april 1861 magazine of literature art and politics by various https to it her fate is ﬁxed under the present monopolizing sway of king cotton or late in the union or out of the union government must cease to be republican and relapse into anarchy unless previously abandoning the experiment of democracy in despair she take refuge in government of force the northern states the educational communities have apparently little to fear while they cling closely to the principles inherent in their nature with the servile states or away from them the experiment of constitutional republic can apparently be carried on with success through an indeﬁnite lapse of time but though with the assistance of an original impetus and custom they may temporarily drag along their stumbling brethren of the south the catastrophe is but deferred not avoided out of the union the more extreme southern in which king cotton has already ﬁrmly established his if we may judge by passing events ripe the result the more northern have yet reprieve of fate having not yet wholly forgotten the lessons of their origin the result however be it delayed one year or one hundred years can hardly admit of doubt the emer gency which is to try their system may not arise many years but passing events warn us that it maybe upon them now the most philosophical of modern french historians in describing the latter days of the roman empire tells us that the higher classes of nation can communicate virtue and wisdom to the government if they themselves are virtuous and wise but they can never give it strength strength always comes from below it always proceeds from the masses the cotton dynasty pretends not only to maintain government where the masses are slaves but republican government where the vast majority of the higher classes are ignorant on the intelligence of the mass of the whites the south must rely its republican permanence on their arms it must rely its force and here again the words of sismondi written of falling rome seem already applicable to the south thus all that class of free cultivators who more than any other class feel the love of country who could defend the soil and who ought to furnish the best soldiers disappeared almost entirely the number of small farmers diminished to such degree that rich man man of noble family had often to travel more than ten leagues before falling in with an equal or neighbor the destruction of the republican form of government is then almost the necessary catastrophe but what will follow that catastrophe it is not so easy to foretell the republic thus underm ined will fall but what shall supply its place the tendency of decaying republics is to anarchy and men take refuge from the terrors of anarchy in despotism the south least of all can indulge in anarchy it would at once tend to servile insurrection they can not long be torn by civil war the same reason the fear of the african must force them into some government and the stronger the better the social divisions of the south into the rich and educated whites the poor and ignorant whites and the servile class would seem naturally to point to an aristocratic or form of government but in their transition state difﬁculties are to be met in all directions and the social distinctions of constitutional monarchy seem hardly consistent with the licentious independence and rude equality of southern society the reign of king cotton however conducted under the present policy must inevitably tend to increase and aggravate all the present social tendencies of the southern system all the afﬁnities already strongly developed it makes deeper the chasm dividing the rich and the poor it increases vastly the ranks of the uneducated and ﬁnally while most unnaturally forcing the increase of the already threatening african infusion it also tends to make the servile condition more unendurable and its burdens heavier the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 07 42 april 1861 magazine of literature art and politics by various https modern southern politician is the least of all our classes of american statesmen in the existence of nation generation should be considered but year in the life of man and century but generation of citizens soon or late in the lives of this generation or of their descendants in the union or out of the union the servile members of this confederacy must under the results of the prolonged dynasty of cotton make their election either to purchase their security like cuba by dependence on the strong arm of external force or they must meet national exigencies pass through revolutions and destroy and reconstruct governments making every movement on the surface of seething heaving volcano all movements of the present looking only to the forms of government of the master must be carried on before the face of the slave and the question of class will ever be complicated by that of caste what the result of the tendencies of the cotton dynasty will be it is therefore impossible to more than dream but is it fair to presume that the immense servile population should thus see upturnings and revolutions dynasties rising and falling before their eyes and ever remain quiet and contented nothing said jefferson is more surely written in the book of fate than that this people must be free fit freedom at present they are not and under the existing policy of the cotton dynasty never can be whether under any circumstances they could become so is not here subject of discussion but surely the day will come when the white caste will wish the experiment had been tried the argument of the cotton king against the alleviation of the condition of the african is that his nature does not admit of his enjoyment of true freedom consistently with the security of the community and therefore he must have none but certainly his school has been of the worst would not perhaps the reﬂections applied to the case of the french peasants of century ago apply also to them it is not under oppression that we learn how to use freedom the ordinary sophism by which misrule is defended is when truly stilted this the people must continue in slavery because slavery has generated in them all the vices of slaves because they are ignorant they must remain under power which has made and which keeps them ignorant because they have been made ferocious by misgovernment they must be misgoverned forever if the system under which they live were so mild and liberal that under its operation they had become humane and enlightened it would be safe to venture on change but this system has destroyed morality and prevented the development of the intellect it has turned men who might under different training have formed virtuous and happy community into savage and stupid wild beasts therefore it ought to last forever perhaps the counsellors of king cotton think that in this case it will but all history teaches us another lesson if there be one spark of love freedom in the nature of the african it be love common to him with the man or the beast the caucasian or the chimpanzee love of freedom affording means of improvement or an opportunity sloth policy of king cotton will cause it to work its way out it is impossible to say how long it will be in so doing or what weight the broad back of the african will ﬁrst be made to bear but if the spirit exist some day it must out this lesson is taught us by the whole recorded history of the world moses leading the children of israel up out of egypt at the gates of rome jacquerie in france cade and wat tyler in england sahib and the sepoys in india oussaint and the haytiens ﬁnally the insurrection of nat turner in this country with those in guiana jamaica and lucia such examples running through all history point the same moral this last result

slave insures him tolerable treatment but numbers increase this value must diminish southern statesm en now assert that in thirty years there will be twelve million slaves in the south and then with increased numbers why should not the philosophy of the sugar prevail and it become part of the economy of the cotton creed that it is cheaper to work slaves to death and purchase fresh ones than to preserve their usefulness by moderate employment then the value of the slave will longer protect him and then the end will be nigh is this thirty or ﬁfty years off perhaps not century hence will the policy of king cotton work its legitimate results and the volcano at length come to its head and defy all compression in one of the stories of the arabian nights we are told of an afrite conﬁn ed by king solomon in brazen vessel and the sultana tells us that during the ﬁrst century of his conﬁnement he said in his heart i will enrich whosoever will liberate but one liberated him in the second century he said whosoever will liberate i will open to him the treasures of the earth but one liberated him and four centuries more passed and he said whosoever shall liberate i will fulﬁl him three

statesmen look to it well that the breakin g of the seal which conﬁnes our afrite be not deferred till long bondage has turned his heart like the heart of the spirit in the fable into gall and

year with her best love trunk full of her own clothes made herself and only little worn to be altered and retrimmed and refurbished so that although worth at ﬁrst perhaps even more than two hundred dollars they came by their unﬁtness and to be worth to us only quarters of that sum and laura and i reckoned that we lost exactly ﬁfty dollars year by aunt allen queerness so much our gratitude laura

however i ought not to talk on this subject i am the merest civilian and my ﬁrst conversation in charleston on secession was with an estimable friend born but drawing breath of southern air ever since he attained the age of manhood after the ﬁrst salutation he sat down his hands on his knees gazing on the ﬂoor and shaking his head soberly if not sadly you have found us in pretty ﬁx pretty ﬁx but what are you going to are you really going out you are not politician and will tell the honest facts yes we are going out is doubt of it i have not been seceder have even been called one of the disaf fected but i am obliged to admit that secession is the will of the community perhaps you at the north believe that we are honest in our professions and actions we are so the carolinians really mean to go out of the union and mean to come back they say that they are out and they believe it and now what are you going to with us what is the feeling at the north the union must and shall be preserved at all hazards that famous declaration expresses the present northern popular sentiment when i left people were growing martial they were joining military companies they wanted to ﬁght they were angry the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 07 42 april 1861 magazine of literature art and politics by various https so i supposed that agrees with what i hear by letter well i am very sorry it our people here will not retreat they will accept war ﬁrst if you preserve the union it must be by conquest i suppose you can it if you try hard enough the north is great deal stronger than the south it can desolate it it but i hope it wo be done i wish you would speak good word us when you go back you can destroy us i suppose but you think it would be inhuman you think it would be impolitic you think it would result in sufﬁcient good to counterbalance the evident and certain evil why people reason in this way they say that even if we allow the ﬁnal independence of the seceding states we must make it clear that there is such thing the right of secession but only that of revolution or rebellion we must ﬁx price going out of the union which shall be so high that henceforward state will ever be willing to pay it we must kill once all the doctrine of peaceable secession which is nothing else than national disintegration and ruin morton of indiana declares in substance that england never spent blood and money to wiser purpose than when she laid down ﬁfty thousand lives and one hundred millions of pounds to prevent her thirteen disaf fected colonies from having their own way english colony since has been willing to face the tremendous issue thus offered it just so it is the interest it is the sole safety of the federal government to try to hold in the cotton states by force and if they go out to oblige them to pay an enormous price the privilege revolution is troublesome luxury and ought to be made expensive that is the way people talk at the north and at washington they reason thus you see because they believe that this is not league but nation and our people believe that the states are independent and have right to recede from the confederation without asking its leave with few exceptions all agree on that it is honest common public opinion the south carolinians sincerely think that they are exercising right and you may depend that they will not be reasoned nor frightened out of it and if the north tries coercion there will be war i say this deﬁantly but sadly and merely because i want you to know the truth war is abhorrent to my feelings war with our own brethren and then we are so poorly prepared it such was the substance of several conversations the reader may rely i think on the justness of my friend opinions founded they are on his honesty of intellect his moderation and his opportunities studying his all told the same story but generally with more passion sometimes with deﬁance deﬁance toward the government i mean and not toward personally the better classes of charleston are eminently courteous south carolina had seceded forever defying all the hazards she would accept nothing but independence or destruction she did not desire any supposable compromise she had altogether done with the union yet her desire was not war it was simply and solely escape she would forget all her wrongs and insults she would seek revenge the injurious past provided she were allowed to depart without conﬂict nearly every man with whom i talked began the conversation by asking if the north meant coercion and closed it by deprecating hostilities and afﬁrming the universal wish peaceable secession in case of compulsion however the state would accept the gage of battle her sister communities of the south would side with her the moment they saw her blood ﬂow northern commerce would be devoured by privateers of all nations under the southern ﬂag northern manu factures would perish lack of southern raw material and southern consumers northern banks the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 07 42 april 1861 magazine of literature art and politics by various https and northern ﬁnances go into universal insolvency the southern ports would be opened forcibly by england and france who must have cotton the south would ﬂourish in the struggle and the north decay but why you venture on this doubtful future i asked of one gentleman what is south carolina grievance the bills yes constitute grievance and yet not much of one some of us men of the school i not complain of the union because of those bills they say that it is the law itself which is unconstitutional that the rendition of runaways is state affair in which the federal government has concern that massachusetts and other states were quite right in nullifying an illegal and aggressive statute besides south carolina has lost very few slaves is it the territorial question which forces you to quit us not in its practical issues the south needs more territory has not negroes to colonize it the doctrine of more slave states is an insult to us but hardly an injury the ﬂow of population has settled that matter you have won all the territories not even excepting new mexico where slavery exists nominally but is sure to die out under the hostile inﬂuences of unpropitious soil and climate the territorial question has become mere abstraction we longer talk of it then your great grievance is the election of lincoln yes and the grievance is all the greater because he was elected according to all the forms of law yes if he had been got into the presidency by trickery by manifest cheating your grievance would have been less complete yes is lincoln considered here to be bad or dangerous man not personally i understand that he is man of excellent private character and i have nothing to say against him ruler inasmuch he has never been tried lincoln is simply sign to us that we are in danger and must provide our own safety you secede then solely because you think his election proves that the mass of the northern people is adverse to you and your interests yes so wigfall of texas hit the nail on the head when he said substantially that the south can not be at peace with the north until the latter concedes that slavery is right the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 07 42 april 1861 magazine of literature art and politics by various https well admit it that is precisely it i desire the reader to note the loyal frankness the unshrinking honesty of these avowals so characteristic of the south carolina morale whenever the native of that state does an act or holds an opinion it is his nature to confess it and avow the motives thereof without quibbling or hesitation it is persuaded community strikingly like its negat ive pole on the slavery question massachusetts all those charlestonians whom i talked with i found hearted in their secession and patient of my an advocate of the union although often astonished i suspect that any creature capable of drawing conclusion from two premises should think so dif ferently from themselves but have you looked at the platform of the republicans i proceeded it is not adverse to slavery in the states it only objects to its entrance into the territories it is not an abolition platform we trust in the platform we believe that it is an incomplete expression of the party creed it suppresses more than it utters the spirit which keeps the republicans together is enmity to slavery and that spirit will never be satisﬁed until the system is extinct finally gradually and quietly and safely is possible i suppose that the secret and generally unconscious animus of the party is one which will abolitionize it after long while when will it begin to act in an abolition sense you think i ca say perhaps hundred years from now perhaps two hundred there was general laugh from the persons who formed the group what time you ﬁx i inquired two years but this secession of ours there would have been bills before congress within two years looking to the abolition of slavery in the the district of columbia etc that would be only the point of the wedge which would soon assume the dimensions of an attack on slavery in the states look how aggressive the party has been in the question of the territories the questions are different when congress makes local laws utah it does not follow that it will likewise south carolina you might well infer that because vessel sails from liverpool to new york in ten days therefore it will sail overland to louis in ﬁve more incredulous laughter answered again the south has labored under two delusions ﬁrst that the republicans are abolitionists second that the north can be frightened back of these rendering them fatally effective lies that other delusion the imagined right of peaceable secession founded on belief in the full and unresigned sovereignty of the states let tell story illustrative of the depth to which this belief has penetrated years ago friend of mine talking to charleston boy about patriotism asked him what is the name of your country the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 07 42 april 1861 magazine of literature art and politics by various https south carolina responded the promptly and proudly what northern boy what massachusetts boy even would not have replied the united states of america south carolina i am inclined to think has long been disunionist community or nearly so deceived by the idea that the confederation is bar rather than help to her prosperity and waiting only good chance to quit it up to the election of lincoln all timid souls were against secession now they are it because they think it less dangerous than submission instance when i asked one gentleman what the south expected to gain by going out he replied first safety our slaves have heard of lincoln he is black man or black republican or black something he is to become ruler of this country on the fourth of march he is friend of theirs and will free them we must establish our independence in order to make them believe that they are beyond his help we have had to hang some of them in alabama we expect to be obliged to hang others perhaps many this was not the only statement of the sort which i heard in charleston other persons assured of the perfect ﬁdelity of the negroes and declared that they would even ﬁght against northern invaders if needful skepticism in regard to this last comfor table belief is however not wanting if it comes to war you have one great advantage over us said to military gentleman lately in the service of the united states your is and will constitute the rank and ﬁle of your armies our is not indeed there is some reason to fear that if it take up arms at all it will be on the wrong side my impression is that prevalent though not universal fear existed lest the negroes should rise in partial insurrections on or about the fourth of march northern man who had lived several years in the of south carolina had married there and had lately travelled through considerable portion of the south informed that many of the villages were lately forming home guards measure of defence against the slave population the home guard is frequently cavalry corps and is always composed of men who have passed the usual term of military service it is deemed necessary to reserve the youth of the country to meet the northern masses the federal mercenaries on the ﬁeld of possible battle by letters from montgomery alabama i learn that unusual precautions have been common during the last winter many persons locking up their negroes over night in the quarters and most sleeping with arms at hand ready nocturnal conﬂict whoever considers the necessarily horrible nature of servile insurrection will ﬁnd in it some palliation southern violence toward suspected incendiaries and southern precipitation in matters of secession however strongly he may still maintain that should not usurp the place of justice nor revolution the place of regular government if you live in powder you positively must feel inhospitably inclined towards man who presents himself with cigar in his mouth even if he shows you that it is but tireless stump it still makes you uneasy and if you catch sight of multitude of smokers distant yet but apparently intent on approaching you will be very apt to rush toward them deprecate their advance forbid it or possibly threaten armed resistance even at the risk of being considered aggressive are all the south carolinians disunionists it seemed so when i was there in january 1861 and yet it did not seem so when i was there in 1855 and at that time you could ﬁnd men in charleston who held that the right of secession was but the right of revolution of rebellion the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 07 42 april 1861 magazine of literature art and politics by various https enough if successful but inductive to hanging if unfortunate now those same men nearly all argue the right of peaceab le secession declaring that the state has right to go out at will and that the federal governm ent has right to coerce or punish it these turncoats are the sympathetic who are carried away by rush of popular enthusiasm and the fearful or peaceable who dread or dislike violence let us see how timid unionist can be converted into an advocate of the right of secess ion let us suppose boat with three men on board which is hailed by with threat of ﬁring if she does not come to two of these men believe that the er is performing legal duty and desire to obey him but the third reckless domineering fellow seizes the helm lets the sail ﬁll and attempts to run by meantime declaring at the top of his voice that the cutter has business to stop his progress the others dare not resist him and can not persuade him now then what position will they take to the right of the to ﬁre ten to one they will join their comrade whom they lately opposed they will cry out that the pursuer was wrong in ordering them to stop and ought not to punish them disobedience in short they will be converted by the instinct of into advocates of the right of peaceable secession i understand indeed i know that there are few opponents of disunion remaining in south carolina but although they are wealthy people and of good position it is pretty certain that they have not an atom of political inﬂuence secession peaceable it is what is most particularly desired at charleston and i believe throughout the cotton states certainly when i was there the the party of the mercury was not in the ascendant unless in the sense of having been hoist with its own petard when it cried out immediate hostilities not only governor pickens and his council but nearly all the inﬂuential citizen s were opposed to bloodshed they demanded independence and fort sumter but desired and hoped to get both by argument they believed or tried to believe that at last the administration would hearken to reason and grant to south carolina what it seemed to them could not be denied her with justice the of the mercury urging precipitation even at the expense of defeat the sake of uniting the south was listened to without enthusiasm except by the young and thoughtless we

excessively unpopular because of his peaceful inclinations and that he would soon be forced to give the signal battle once or twice i was seriously invited to stay few days longer in order to witness

the work which they had undertaken was weightier and the reward of it more distant if not more doubtful than they had suppose the political prophets had been forced like the millerites to ask an extension their predictions the anticipated ﬂeet of had not arrived from europe and the expected twelve millions of foreign gold had not reﬁlled the collapsed banks the daily expenses were estimated at twenty thousand dollars the treasury was in rapid progress of depletion and yet results it is not wonderful that under these circumstances the most enthusiastic secessionists were not gay and that

vols london 1859 anthr opologie der naturvölker von dr waiz 2 bänder leipzig some writers have the remarkable faculty of making the subject which they may happen to treat forever more distasteful and wearisome to their readers whether the cause be in the style or the point of view or the method of treatment or in all together they seem able to force the student away in disgust from the whole ﬁeld on which they labor with vows never again to cross it such an author it seems to us is latham in his treatment of ethnology happy the man who has any such philos ophic interest in human races that he can ever care to hear again of the subject after perusing latham various volumes on descriptive ethnology we wonder that the whole english reading public has not consigned the science to the shelf of encyclopedias of useful knowledge or of of fact or any other equally philosophic and connected works after the treatment which this modern master of ethnology has given to the the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 07 42 april 1861 magazine of literature art and politics by various https disconnected masses of facts are heaped together in these works such incredible dulness is shown in presenting them such careful avoidance of any generaliz ation or of any interesting particular such bald and conceited style and such cockneyish and opinionated view of human history our soul wearies even to think of latham disdains any link of philosophy or any classiﬁcation among his ten thousand facts being fault of the german school whatever that may be of ethnology it seems to him soundly british to disbelieve all the best conclusions of modern scholarship and to urge his own fanciful or shallow theories he treats all human superstitions and mythologies if he were standing in the strand and judging them by the ideas of modern london his is cockney view of antiquity he can not imagine that barbarous and infant people groping in the mysteries of the moral universe might entertain some earnest and poetic views which were not precisely in the line of thought of the londoners of the nineteenth century and yet which might be worth investigating to his mind there is grand march of humanity slow but certain towards higher ideals through the various lines of race rather innumerable ripples on the surface of history which come and pass away without connection and without purpose the reader wades slowly through his books and leaves them with feeling of intense disgust such vast gathering of facts merely to produce this melancholy confusion of details you feel that his eminence in the science must be from the circumstance that one else is dull enough and patient enough to gather such museum of facts in regard to human beings the mind is utterly confused to divisions of human races and is ready to conclude that there must be almost many varieties of man there are tribes or dialects and that ethnology has not yet reached the position of science the reader must pardon the bitterness of our feelings but we are just smarting from prolonged perusal of all latham works especially the two volumes whose title is given above and that we may have sympathy if only in faint degree from our frien ds we quote few passages taken at random though we can not possibly thus convey an adequate conception of the inﬁnite dulness of the work the following is his elegant

attractive and comprehensible character we assure the reader that these extracts are but feeble exponents of the peculiar power of latham works power of unmitigated dulness what his views are on the great questions of the origin of races the migrations the crossings of varieties and the mortal can remember who has penetrated the labyrinth of his researches an author of very different kind is professor waiz whose work on anthropology has just reached this country writer philosophic latham is disconnected pleasing and natural in style the other is affected simply open to the true and good in all customs or superstitions of barbarous peoples the englishman is contemptuous of everything not modern and european waiz seems to us the most careful and truly scientiﬁc author in the ﬁeld of ethnology whom we have had since prichard and with the wider scope which belongs to the intellectual german the bane of this science every one knows has been its theorizing and its want of careful inductive reasoning from facts the classiﬁcations in it have been endless varying almost with the fancies of each new student while every prominent follower of it has had some pet hypothesis to which he desired to suit his facts whether the priori theory were of modern miraculous origin or of gradual development of unity or of diversity of parentage of permanent and absolute divisions of races or of community of blood it has equally forced the author to twist his facts perhaps the basest of all uses to which theory has been put in this science was in known american work where facts and fancies in ethnology were industriously woven together to form another withe about the limbs of the wretched african slave waiz has reasoned slowly and carefull y from facts considering in his view all possible hypotheses instance the of darwin has formed his own conclusion on scientiﬁc data or has wisely avowed that conclusion is possible the classiﬁcation to which he is forced is that which all profound investigators are approaching of language interpr eted by history he is compelled to believe that physiological evidences of race can be considered at all equal to the evidences from language at the same time he is ready to admit that even this classiﬁcation is imperfect from the nature of the case it must be the source of the confusion lies in the very unity of mankind he rejects in toto professor agassiz inconsistent with facts the put by gliddon and nott meets with searching and careful investigation with the conclusion that nothing in facts yet ascertained proves any want of

on that topic the whole work is mainly directed towards naturvölker or peoples in state of nature and therefore can not be recommended translation general on the science of ethnology book which is now

and circulation of books and it is striking indication of the new order of things in lombardy that the publishers at milan of the monthly journal il politecnico should at once have established an american agency in new york and that in successive numbers of their periodical during the present year they should have furnished lists of some of the principal american publications which they are prepared to obtain italian readers it will be fortunate circumstance the people of both countries should ready means be established the interchange of their contemporaneous works in literature and science the politecnico is not altogether new journal seven volumes of it bad been published and had acquired it high reputation and considerable circulation when political events put stop to its issue the austrian system of government after 1849 repressed alt free expression of thought in lombardy and encouragement was afforded the publication of any work not under the control of the administration with the beginning of the present year the politecnico was reëstablished mainly through the inﬂuence and under the direction of carlo cattaneo who had been the chief promoter of the preceding original series the numbers of the new series give evidence of talent and independence in its conductors and contributors and contain articles of intrinsic value beside that which they possess indications of the present intellectual condition and tendencies of italy the journal is wholly devoted to serious studies its object being the cultivatio n of the moral and physical sciences with the arts depending on them and their practical application to promote the national prosperity that it will carry out its design with ability is guarantied by the character of cattaneo carlo cattaneo is man of unquestioned power of intellect of strong character and resolute energy already distinguished not only political economist but forcible reasoner in applied politics he took leading part in the struggle of 1848 in milan and inspired by towards charles albert and the piedm ontese was one of the promoters of the disastrous lombard policy which defeated the hopes of the opponents of austria at that day though an italian liberal and unquestionably honest in his patriotic intentions he was virtually an ally of radetzky when the austrians retook milan he was compelled to ﬂy and took refuge in lugano where he compiled three large volumes on the affairs of italy from the accession of pius ix to the fall of venice in which he exhibited his political views endeavoring to the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 07 42 april 1861 magazine of literature art and politics by various https the misfortunes of lombardy were due to the ambitious and false policy of the unhappy charles albert his distrust of the piedmontese has not diminished with the recent changes in the affairs of italy and although lombardy is now united to piedmont and the hope of freedom seems to lie in hearty and generous union of men of all parties in support of the new government cattaneo when in march last he was elected member of the national parliament refused to take his seat that he might not be obliged to swear allegiance to the king and the constitution his political desire seems to be to see italy not brought under one rule but composed of union of states each preserving its special autonomy he is federalist and does not share in the unitarian view which prevails with almost all the other prominent italian statesmen and which at this moment appears to be the only system that can create strong united independent italy it was to him perhaps more than to any other single man that the difﬁculties which lately arose in the settling of the mode of annexation of sicily and naples to the sardinian kingdom were due and the small party in parliament which recently refused to join in the vote of conﬁdence in the ministry of cavour was led by ferrari the disciple of the milanese doctor but however impracticable cattaneo may be and however mistaken and extravagant his political views he is man of such vigor of mind that journal conducted by him becomes from the fact of his connection with it one of the important organs of italian thought we trust that the politecnico will ﬁnd subscribers among those in our country who desire to keep up their knowledge of italian

that of keats whom we may also fairly reckon in our list though he remained harmless having never taken degree on the whole the proportion of doctors who have positively succeeded in our literature is large one and we have now another very marked and beautiful case in holmes since arbuthnot the profession has produced such wit since goldsmith author so the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic monthly volume 07 42 april 1861 magazine of literature art and politics by various https years ago it would have been only holmes intimate friends that would have considered the remarkable success he has achieved not only possible but probable they knew that if the ﬁtting opportunity should only come he would soon show how much stuff he had in him stuff too than the world had supposed f not merely to show off the iris of brilliant reputation but to block out into the foundations of an enduring fame it seems an odd thing to say that holmes had suffered by having given proof of too much wit but it is undoubtedly true people in general have great respect those who scare them or make them cry but are apt to weigh lightly one who amuses them they like to be tickled but they would hardly take the advice of their tickler on any question they thought serious we have our doubts whether the majority of those who make up what is called the world are fond of wit it rather puts them out nature did fuseli they look on its crinkling play men at lightning and while they grant it is very ﬁne are teased with an uncomfortable wonder to where it is going to strike next they would rather on the whole it were farthe r off they like jokes the ﬁne old sort such the clown offers them in the circus warranted never to spoil if only kept dry enough your fresh wit demands little thought perhaps or at least kind of negative wit in the recipient it is an active meddlesome forever putting things in unexpected and somewhat startling relations to each other and such new relations are unwelcome to the ordinary mind poor relations to nouveau riche who wants to be all the time painfully conceiving of the antipodes walking like ﬂies on the ceiling yet wit is related to some of the profoundest qualities of the intellect it is the reasoning faculty acting per saltum the sense of analogy brought to focus it is generalization in ﬂash logic by the electric telegraph the sense of likeness in unlikeness that lies at the root of all discoveries it is the prose imagination at fourth proof all this is reason why the world should like it however and we fancy that the question ridentem dicer verum quid vetat was plaintively put in the primitive tongue by one of the world gray fathers to another without producing the slighte st conviction of course there must be some reason this suspicion of wit there is most of the world prejudices there is kind of that is commonly the sign of light and shallow nature it becomes habitual persiﬂage incapable of taking deliberate and serious view of anything or of conceivin g the solemnities that environ life this has made men distrustful of all laughers and they are apt to confound in one sweeping condemnation with this that humor whose base is seriousness and which is generally the rebound of the mind from contemplation they not see that the same qualities that make shakspeare the greatest of tragic poets make him also the deepest of humorists holmes was already an author of more than quarter of century standing and was looked on by most people an amusing writer merely he protested playfully and pointedly against this once or twice but he could not help being witty whether he would or his audience laughed and took the protest part of the joke he felt that he was worth great deal more than he was vulgarly rated at and perhaps chafed little but his opportunity had not come with the ﬁrst number of the atla ntic it came at last and wonderfully he proﬁted by it the public were ﬁrst delighted and then astonished so much

magazine of literature art and politics by various https his neck by this time we are of opinion that these are new kind of rocket that go without sticks and stay up against all laws of gravity we expected great deal from holmes we thought he had in him the makings of the best magazinist in the country but we honestly confess we were astonished we remembered the proverb is the pace that kills and could scarce believe that such gait could be kept up through twelvemonth such wind and bottom were unprecedented but this was eclipse himself and he came in fresh may morning ready at month end another year run and it was not merely the perennial vivacity the fun shading down to seriousness and the seriousness up to fun in perpe tual and charming vicissitude was the man of culture of scientiﬁc training the man who had thought well felt and who had ﬁxed purposes and sacred convictions the is too triﬂing this was stout ship under press of canvas and however the phosphorescent of wit and fancy crowding up under her bows or gliding away in subdued ﬂashes of sentiment in her wake may draw the eye yet she has an errand of duty she carries precious freight she steers by the stars and all her seemingly wanton zigzags bring her nearer to port when children have made up their minds to like some friend of the family they commonly besiege him story the same dema nd is made by the public of authors and accordingly it was made of holmes the odds were heavy against him but here again he triumphed like good bostonian he took his heroine the puritan pallas athene of the american athens and made her so lovely that everybody was looking about schoolmistress to despair after generally the best work in imaginative literature is done before forty but holmes should seem not to have found out what mariposa grant nature had made him till after ﬁfty there is need of our analyzing elsi venner all our readers know it well we but we can not help saying that holmes has struck new vein of romance the story is really romance and the character of the heroine has in it an element of mystery yet the materials are gathered from life and that weird borderland between science and speculation where psychology and physiology exercise mixed jurisdiction and which rims new england it does all other lands the character of elsie is exceptional but not purely ideal like cristabel and lamia in doctor kittredge and his hired man and in the principal of the apol linean institoot holmes has shown his ability to draw those typical characters that represent the higher and lower grades of average human nature and in calling his work romance he quietly justiﬁes himself mingling other elements in the composition of elsie and her cousin apart from the merit of the book story it is full of wit and of sound thought sometimes hiding behind mask of humor admirably conceived are the two clergymen gradually changing sides almost without knowing it and having that persuasion of consistency which men always feel because they must always bring their creed into some sort of agreement with their dispositions there is something melancholy in the fact that the moment holmes showed that he felt deep interest in the great questions which concern this world and the next and proved not only that he believed in something but thought his belief worth standing up the cry of inﬁdel should have been raised against him by people who believe in nothing but an authorized version of truth they themselves being the censors our own part we not like the the project gutenberg ebook of the atlantic
