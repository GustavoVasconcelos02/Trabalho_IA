chief points of differentiation between man and man from the banter which kins all the world to the envenomed sneer that sunders it laughter runs the whole gamut of human emotions it is always sincere even in its own despite subterfuge when subterfuge underlies it is more easily unmasked man may smile and smile and be villain but villainy by the seeing eye can be infallibly detected beneath the smile counterfeit laugh may be uttered counterfeit coin is uttered but it does not ring true its baseness reveals itself to more senses than one now more than sixty years the recognized organ of british laughter has been the london punch the contemporary mood of john bull towards brother jonathan has always voiced itself through the grinning lips of this chartered jester it can not be said that even before the outbreak of the civil war punch had shown itself friendly to america or americans why should it the british mob dislike d us and ﬂouted us punch the mouthpiece of the mob followed suit in the original prospectus of that journal issued in 1845 it was expressly announced that the paper was to be devoted in part to yankee yarns to the naturalization of those alien jonathans whose adherence to the truth has forced them to emigrate from their native land it would appear from this new daniel come to judgment that ananias and autolycus were models of punctilious honesty and meticulous truthfulness compared with the average american writing from boston to sir edward head in 1854 geor ge ticknor said i am much struck with what you say about the ignorance that prevails in england concerning this country and its institutions and the mischief likely to spring from it from punch up to your leading statesmen things are constantly said and done out of sheer misapprehension or ignorance that have some time been breeding here and are likely to breed more up to and even immediately after the war punch sympathies professedly leaned towards the north though it took occasion to lecture both sides from the standpoint of disinterested and superior friend who saw that neither side was absolu tely and unconditionally right when the news of the secession of south carolina reached england in january 1861 john tenniel contributed cartoon to the jester pages entitled divorce vinculo with the explanatory subtitle carolina asserts her rights to her nigger carolina was represented vulgar virago holding tails in her right hand and shaking her clenched left ﬁst in the face of serenely deﬁant youth clad in spangled shirt to whom little brat of nigger appealed with

scof f at people in the case of him that hastily cut of f his nose to spite his face later punch applauded that portion of abraham lincoln ﬁrst inaugural which dealt with the question of secession the comminuted st ates who can say where secession will stop that is question which is raised by l incoln in part of his inaugural address directed to enforce upon fools and madmen the necessity of acquiescence by minorities in the decision of majorities the president tells the frantic portion of his fellow countrymen that there is alternative continuing the government but acquiescence on one side or the other if minority in such case will secede rather than acquiesce they make precedent which in turn will ruin and divide them minority of their own will secede from them whenever majority refuses to be controlled by such minority instance why may not any portion of new confederacy year or two hence arbitrarily secede again precisely portions of the present union now claim to secede from it all who cherish disunion sentiments are now being educated to the exact temper of doing this the force of this simple reasoning will be seen by the lunatics to whom it is addressed during their lucid intervals if they have any it may even be hoped that some of them may recover the use of their reﬂecting faculties so far to be enabled to follow out president l incoln s argument and their own folly into ultimate consequences and conclusions then they will see what is likely to be the end of secession it is not quite true that there is end to secession and the end of secession will be the secessionists an end of everything seceders will go on seceding and subseceding until at last every citizen will secede from every other citizen and each individual will be sovereign state

american billiard match is amusing enough when read in the light of the great winning hazards that were to be made by abe within less than sixty days considerable excitement it runs has been caused in sporting circles by this long protracted match which owing to the style of play adopted by the parties appears to make but very little progress toward ﬁnish the largeness of the stakes depending on the contest might be supposed to make the players careful in their strokes but few expected that the game would last so long it has done and one now dare prophesy when it will be ﬁnished it having been resolved to play the cannon game some anxiety at ﬁrst was not unreasonably felt among the backers of jeff davis the crack player the south but the knowing ones who knew their man made attempt to hedge notwithstanding what was said about his being out of play and in the cannon game especially somewhat overmatched it is needless to remark here that the ﬁrst strokes which he made quite justiﬁed their conﬁdence and indeed throughout the game he has done nothing yet to shake it so that if he have but fair amount of luck his backers feel assured that he wo easily be beaten and an extra ﬂuke or two might make him win the match old abe lincoln the champion player of the north his backers we believe are conﬁdent ever that he is the best man although at times his play has not appeared to prove it there is doubt that he has more strength at his command but strength is of small use without knowing how to use it abe lincoln may have skill but he has not yet shown much of it and certainly he more than once has shown himself outgeneralled his backers say he purposely is playing slow game just to draw out his opponent and see what he can in ninety days they say he is cocksure of victory but

odds are offered that the game will be drawn one abe attempt to pot the niggers some put down foul stroke but whether foul or not it added little to his score upon the whole we think his play has not been much admired although his backers have been vehement in superlatively praising it there is more sympathy the south being the weaker fact which jeff supporters indignantly deny and which certainly the north has not done much yet toward proving without ourselves inclining one way or the other we may express neutral hope that the best player may win and we certainly shall echo the desire of all who watch the game if we add that the sooner it is now played out the better the boasted neutrality was put to rather severe test when in less than ninety days the victory of which abe backers were
