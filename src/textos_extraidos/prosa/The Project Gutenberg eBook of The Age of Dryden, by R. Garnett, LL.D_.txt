https the accession of charles ii king facto which in the political history of england marks restoration in her literary history marks revolution not that the transition from one mode of writing and thinking to another was instantaneous or enjoined by legislative or academical decree it had long been slowly progressing and its unequivocal triumph would probably have come to pass sooner but the obstructio n to the intellectual life of the nation occasioned by twenty years of civil commotion the magnitude of this impediment appears from the fact that all the writings of even so great scholar and poet milton produced during this interval were of polemical nature when at last society found sufﬁcient stability to allow its members to write fame emolument or the extension of knowledge it quickly became manifest how wide gulf yawned between the men of that day and the men of twenty years ago the new inﬂuence indeed had long been at work comparison example of the last of the old dramatists massinger and shirley with their predecessors evinces how much even in their day the stage was losing in poetry in imagination and in the charm of musical metre how rapidly its personages were degenerating from vital individualities into conventional types how much on the other hand always excepting shakespear s pieces from the comparison it was gaining in logic and construction an examination of other forms of literature would reveal similar clarifying process steady discourag ement of the quaint affectation which was the bane of elizabethan literature combined unfortunately with increasing sterility of fancy and growing insensibility to the noble harmonies of which english prose is capable an elizabethan poet indeed samuel daniel had in some of his works almost anticipated the style of the eighteenth century in general however writers during the period of the civil war seem to our apprehension more or less encrusted with the mellow patina of antiquity conspicuously absent from nearly everyone who wrote under charles ii hence the accession of this monarch in whose person the new taste might be said to be enthroned is justly regarded the commencement of the new charles s personal inﬂuence on letters was not insigniﬁcant the king says contemp orary burnet had little or literature but true and good sense and had got right notion of style he was in france at time when they were much set on reforming their language it soon appeared that he had true taste so this helped to raise the value of these men tillotson and others when the king approved the style their discourses generally ran in which was clear plain and burnet therefore had doubt that correct principles of taste had been established in england in charles s time and partly by the king s dictum equivalent to the condemnation of all preceding english literature barbarous such was also the opinion of one of the masters of english style in the succeeding century david hume charles ii was not man who could under any circum stances have sympathized greatly with the poetry of spenser or the prose of raleigh or hooker the native bent of his mind was moreover strengthened by contingencies among which burnet justly gives foremost place to his residence in france it must be added that this inﬂuence coincided with movement which if the time disadvantageous to english literat ure was nevertheless essential if it was to cease to be merely insular until the time of charles this literature in so far it owed anything to external patterns of modern date had been chieﬂy dependent upon italy this migh t have long continued but the decay of italian letters consequent upon the triumph of foreign oppression and spiritual despotism throughout the peninsula france stepped into the vacant place and developed literature qualiﬁed to impress other nations less by its defects than by its virtues by its want of elevation well by its sprightliness and lucidity ere long french ideas of style had pervaded europe and approximation to french modes was the inevitable qualiﬁcation the great mission of human enlightenment which was to devolve upon britain in the succeeding century up to this time the literature of england had resembled that of spain original and racy of the soil grander and more noble than the less digniﬁed literature whose statutes it was to keep and whos laws it was to observe season but on this pg 2 pg 3 the project gutenberg ebook of the age of dryden by garnett https account comparatively out of touch with the common needs of men had british writers continued to indite the prose of hooker and milton their ideas would have found entrance into the continent and grievous was the declension from the poetry and music of these great writers to the sermo pedestris of their successors this was more than counterbalanced by the acquisition of lucidity logic and cogency the loss was but temporary the gain was everlasting the nineteenth century has found it possible to restore much of the solemn pomp and musical and pictorial charm of elizabethan english without parting with the clearness and coherence which are indispensable literature that would deeply affect the world in becoming moment french english literature ﬁrst became y that the new inﬂuence did not elsewhere penetrate too far and that when all of good that the foreigner could proffer had been assimilated speech and style regained their nationality they did not howe ver thus revert to their old channel the restoration says matthew arnold with justice marks the real moment of birth of our modern english this prose indeed has since been vastly enriched by recurrence to antique models but gains from this source have always been felt to partake of the nature of importation the vital point of restoration practice is accepted by all who not deliberately aim at the composition of poems in prose it is says arnold by its organism opposed to length and involvement and enabling us to be clear plain and short english style after the restoration breaks with the style of the times preceding it ﬁnds the true law of prose and becomes modern becomes in spite of superﬁcial dif ferences the style of our own day this age of metamorphosis therefore is one of the most important in the history of english literature and if the men of the restoration could have beheld themselves in their relation not only to their predecessors but also to their successors their complacency would not have been unjustiﬁable their inability to apprehend their true relation to either was failing by means peculiar to them but it has exposed them to double measure of the ridicule of posterity who roar with laughter over pepys s dictum that midsummer night s dream seems but mean thing after sir samuel tuke s adventur es of five hours and are hardly more merciful to dryd en s conversion of paradise lost into an opera it must be owned that the conception of poetry something awful spiritual and divine became time extinct shelley s defence of poetry could such work have existed would have seemed even more absurd to that age than pepys s critical deliverances to ours the excuse is that the particular work assigned to the period was incompatible with very high standard of poetry this work we have seen was the regeneration of english prose by the elimination of those elements which unﬁtted it clear precise reasoning and practical business and the making english tongue in which bunyan and cobbett might be classics equally with bacon and sir thomas browne such an achievement implies prosaic age if the latter part of the seventeenth century could have produced miltons these would have continued to write milton did it was therefore fortunate the language in the long run that supreme genius should have the time died out and have been replaced by vigorous terrestrial unideal genius that having oracle required tripod time doubt the contrast must have seemed very dismal to any who yet retained perception of the richness and glory of the elizabethan epoch but we if we compare not to say the letters of cromwell but those of charles with the despatches of wellington can not but be sensible of an enormous advance not merely in the effectiveness of speech but in its dignity and simplicity and of great enrichment of the language by the newly acquired power to deal with common things this the men of the restoration are to be thanked and it must be added that their work could not have been done if they had not thoroughly believed in it and that this belief necessitated except in such superior minds dryden s contempt their predecessors and genuine preference of their sorry foreign models to shakespeare the revolution which they effected in matters of taste may be compared to the contemporary revolution in politics the restoration government was sad decline from the enthusiastic visions of milton and vane or even from the wise and sturdy sway of cromwell nevertheless the english nation accepted and maintained it the best arrangement which the circumstances of the time admitted so the new style in literature was universally accepted because the old style was time effete because tasks had pg 4 pg 5 pg 6 the project gutenberg ebook of the age of dryden by garnett https imposed and needs had arisen to which it was unable to respond because in short prosaic age craved prosaic literature we look therefore on the restoration period anything but an ideal epoch but at the same time most momentous one one to which we are indebted much of our present command over the resources of our language and to which britain owes very much of her present power over the world acquaintance with its leading representatives also proves that if less picturesqu ﬁgures than their predecessors they were not inferior in mental power and although the age is justly regarded in the main an age of prose yet poets respond most readily to the inﬂuences of their time and are usually in the van of intellectual revolutions so the leading ﬁgure in the literary history even of this epoch of prose is doubtless the most prosaic of all our great poets but inferior to none in intellectual force and one whose poverty and pliability made him the mirror of the less worthy tendencies of his time on the one hand while his higher aspirations and the force of his genius rendered him less the representative of its better qualities on the other with dryden therefore we commence our survey chapter john dr yden poet john dryden was born august 9 1631 at aldwinkle all saints between thrapston and oundle in northamptonshire he was the grandson of sir erasmus dryden baronet of canons ashby in the same county and his father possessed small landed property which he transmitted to the poet dryden maintained connection with his native county all his life but it was never close of the rest of the world outside london and cambridge he only occasionally saw anything few of our great writers have been so thoroughly identiﬁed with the metropolis of which he became an inhabitant at an early age by his entry at westminster school the precise date of which is unknown locke and south were among his schoolfellows he must have distinguished himself having been elected to cambridge in befor leaving westminster he had made his ﬁrst appearance an author by the publication of copy of verses on the death from smallpox of his schoolfellow lord hastings an unintentional reductio ad absur dum of the reigning fashion of extravagant conceits in the style of marino and gongora this composition otherwise worthless foreshadows in manner the whole of dryden s career he was not one of the writers who themselves form the taste by which they are ultimately judged but rather one of those who achieve fame by doing best what all desire to be done the representatives of their age not its reformers little is known of his career at cambridge except that he was on one occasion discommoned and gated some irregularity that he took his degree in 1654 and though obtaining fellowship continued to reside until about 1657 when he removed to london with what precise plans or expectations is uncertain 1 the general knowledge displayed in his critical writings he scarcely ever says johnson appears to want but when he mentions books justiﬁes the conclusion that his time had been employed in study how greatly his mind had matured was attested by his verses on the death of cromwe ll 1658 which if disﬁgured by some conceits exhibit more sustained elevation than any contemporary except milton or marvell could have attained they were rivalled by his congratulatory verses on the restoration 1660 which naturally exposed him to the reproach of inconsistency but johnson remarks if he changed he changed with the there can indeed be doubt that the establishment of settled government was approved by the good sense well by the loyalty of the country and although circumstances were to make dryden the most formidable of political controversialists pg 7 pg 8 the project gutenberg ebook of the age of dryden by garnett https paper his temperament was not that of polemic and save when he had committed himself too far to retreat he was always ready to acquiesce in what commended itself to the general sentiment of his countrymen the restoration was also joyful event to men of letters if other reason than that it the stage which while yet the periodical press was not afforded the best market and the readiest opportunity literary talent dryden is said to have had play ready soon after the restoration and it is difﬁcult to understand except from certain inertness in his constitution ever most readily responsive to the spur of necessity why he should have so long delayed his appearance dramatist the determining motive may ultimately have been his marriage not apparently very fortunate one to lady elizabeth howard eldest daughter of the earl of berkshire in december 1663 in that year he produced his ﬁrst play the wild gallant and from that time we ﬁnd him many years sedulously at work to earn money by description of literary activity notoriously uncongenial to him only one of his numerous plays he tells us was written to please himself the long list includes the indian emper or 1665 in which instead of reforming the weak blank verse of his day which would have been most important service he fell in with the prevalent fashion of rhymed tragedy tyrannic love 1669 and the conquest of granada 1672 in which he carries rhymed bombast far it would go but at the same time displays surprising energy and vigour aurengzebe 1675 also rhyming play but great improvement all love 1678 and don sebastian 1690 examples of purer taste and the spanish friar 1683 and amphitryon 1690 his best comedies these pieces the chief landm arks of his dramatic career will be subsequently considered returning to the incidents of dryden s life we ﬁnd little to chronicle several years except the births of three children his elevation to the laureateship in 1670 and various literary controversies of interest at this day except they served to call forth the admirable critical prefaces by which he did more english prose style than his poetry was at that time effecting english verse it is remarkable how late his genius ﬂowered and how long he was in discovering his proper path he might never have found it at all but the accidental coincidence of the political controversies of his time with his ofﬁcial position poet laureate this seemed to impose on dryden the duty of coming to the assistance of the court and his recognition of the obligation produced 1681 absalom and achitophel which at once gave him the distinctio n of the greatest satirist our literature had yet produced the most consummate artist in the heroic couplet and the most cogent reasoner in rhyme the medal occasioned by medal struck by the city in honour of the failure of the indictment of shaftesbury was suggested the subject of poem by charles ii the fact has been doubted and does not rest upon very strong external authority but is conﬁrmed by letter from dryden to the treasurer hyde now in the british museum shown by internal evidence to have been written after the publication of absalom and achitophel and consequently after the striking of the medal on occasion of shaftesbury s acquittal in this after speaking of his expense in the education of his children complaining of the irregular receipt of his pension and remarking that even quarter in advance is but the jesuits powder to my disease the ﬁt will return fortnight hence he adds i am going to write somewhat by his majesty s command and can not stir into the country my health and studies till i secure my family from this can hardly have been anything but the medal 2 the appeal after some delay brought dryden an addition to his pension and sinecure ofﬁce in the customs this was the most active period of dryden s life poet personal altercation occasioned by an attack on the medal by thomas shadwell produced macflecknoe the bitterest of his satires and in the same year of 1682 appeared the second part of absalom and achitophel chieﬂy by nahum tate but containing upwards of two hundred lines from dryden s own pen dealing with his literary antagonists in style of sovereign mastery almost simultaneously appeared religio laici serious argument in verse on the credibility of the christian religion and the merits of the anglican form of doctrine and church dryden s mastery over metrical ratiocination made the subject pg 9 pg 10 pg 11 the project gutenberg ebook of the age of dryden by garnett https but the church of england had hardly done rejoicing in her champion when she was scandalized by his exodus to the church of rome it is not likely that he was altogether insincere but it can hardly be doubted that the death of monarch of taste and parts who valued him his genius and the accession of successor who valued men only their theology and gently hinted the fact by docking his salary of hundred pounds had more to with his resolution than he quite acknowledged to himself the position of the protestant laureate of popish sovereign called upon to bid protestants rejoice over the birth of popish prince of wales generally in that age believed to have been smuggled into the palace in would assuredly have presented difﬁculties even to those who found none in extolling geor ge s patronage of the arts dryden was too deeply committed to expect anything from the other side the apology his conversion was given to the world in his hind and panther 1687 poem displaying even augmented power of reasoning in rhyme and which might have ranked with his best but the absurdity of the machinery soon afterwards the unsoundness of the foundation on which he had built his fortunes was demonstrated by the revolution which deprived him of the laureateship and swept away all ofﬁcial sources of income but his change of religion he might have taken the oaths to the new government without censure but he had broken down the bridges behind him and seemed moment to have left himself alternative between want and infamy third nevertheless remained hard labour the booksellers to his great honour dryden grappled with the situation with all the sturdy tenacity of his lymphatic temperament and in the same spirit which scott afterwards displayed under similar circumstances he may probably have reformed his system of living which can hardly have been other than extravagant certain it is that if he could not keep entirely out of debt he at least kept out of disgrace and that the years which followed his apparent ruin if not the most brilliant part of his life were the most honourable and honoured it should be added that he appears to have been largely assisted by the generosity of friends especially dorset the work which dryden now found to which he possessed extraordinary qualiﬁcations and which there was genuine demand in the age was that of translation from the latin classics the derivative character of latin literature was not then recognized and roman authors received the veneration due of right only to the greatest of the greeks one doubted that they gave unsurpassable models of style in their respective branches and not many among dryden s contemporaries questioned that he had given deﬁnite and durable form to english poetry in 1667 few days before the publication of paradise lost pepys had overheard men saying that there would never be such another english poet cowley and dryden now stood in cowley s place it seemed then highly desirable thing to bring these two classics together and dryden was perfectly competent to whatever was expected of him he would hardly have succeeded so well with the greek writers even had his knowledge of the language been more extensive but he was well qualiﬁed to reproduce the more distinctive qualities of roman poetry its dignity sometimes rising into majesty its manly sense its vehemence pregnancy and terseness by 1693 he had rendered all persius much of juvenal the remainder was supplied by his sons considerable portions of ovid the ﬁrst book of homer and something from theocritus horace and lucretius in this year he commenced more ambitious work complete version of virgil of the merits of these works we shall speak hereafter it is sufﬁcient to observe here that they long time prescribed the laws of metrical translation in english it is pleasant to notice how many of them were executed at the country seats of friends where the old man dischar ged from the strife of faction and the noise and glare of theatres relieved his intellectual toil by the simple amusements of country life virgil was published in 1697 and remained in the judgment of the age at the head of all english translations until pope s homer came to dethrone it it was immediately succeeded by greater work still his fables from chaucer and boccaccio though the representative of the literary taste of his time dryden was by means the representative of its prejudices he saw much more in chaucer than his contemporaries were capable of seeing and rightly judging that the antiquated style of the old poet who however appeared to him much more uncouth than he really was would effectually keep him out of readers hands he determined to pg 12 pg 13 the project gutenberg ebook of the age of dryden by garnett https and adapt some of his stories to which narrative poems founded on boccaccio were afterwards added the undertaking precisely suited the genius of dryden which lay more in expressing and adorning what he found ready to hand than in original invention and his fables published in 1699 are deservedly placed at the head of his works it is of course impossible that they should exhibit the same intellectual strength his argumentative and satirical poems but this is more than compensated by their superior attractiveness the additional scope offered the display of art and their comparative freedom from everything that can repel the same volume contained his greate st lyrical effort the universally known alexander s feast he received forty pounds it the virgil is said to have brought him twelve hundred the fables he got only three hundred from private letter of about this date it appears that there was some idea of his receiving assistance from the government which he seems not unwilling to accept provided that it proves to require sacriﬁce of principle it is not likely that he would have been allowed to die in want and indeed early in 1700 dramatic perform ance was got up his beneﬁt he died shortly afterwards may 1st 1700 in narrow pecuniary circumstances but in the enjoyment of more unquestioned literary supremacy among his contemporaries than any englishman had held before him the cause of his death was the mortiﬁcation of toe inﬂamed by gout he was buried in westminster abbey the funeral the splendour of which farquhar vouches in contemporary letter is said to have been accompanied by tumultuary scenes but the absence of any reference to these in malevolent contemporary libel ascribed to thomas brown is sufﬁcient evidence that they did not occur there are few english writers of eminence whom it is so difﬁcult to realize satisfactorily to the mind s eye dryden personal enough in one respect his writings are singularly impersonal in another he never paints and seldom reveals himself and the aid which letters or reminiscences might have afforded is almost entirely wanting one noted his conversation his enemies attacks and his friends panegyrics are equally devoid of those traits of character which might have invested shadowy outline with life and substance the nearest approach to portrait is congreve s which leaves most of the character in the shade and even this is somewhat suspicious congreve was dryden s debtor noble praise and the vindication of dryden s repute had been imposed upon him by the poet himself the qualities however which he commends are such seem entirely reconcilable with the lymphatic temperament which partly on his own autho rity my conversation he says is slow and dull my humour saturnine and reserved we have seen reason to attribute to dryden we are told of his humanity and compassion of his readiness to forgive injuries of friendship that exceeded his professions of his difﬁdence in general society and horror of intrusiveness of his patience in accepting corrections of his own errors of which he must be allowed to have given remarkable instance in his submission to jeremy collier all these traits give the impression of one who though by means pedantic was only wit when he had the pen in his hand and entirely correspond with his apparent aversion to intellectual labour except under the pressure of want or the stimulus of court favour when at length he did warm to his work we know from himself that thoughts crowded so rapidly upon him that his only difﬁculty was to decide what to reject such man may well have appeared negative character to his contemporaries and the events of his life were not of nature to force his virtues or his failings into notice we can only say that there is proof of his having been bad husband that there is clear evidence of his having been good father and that although he took the wrong side in the political and religious controversies of his day this is reason why he may not according to his light have been good citizen his references to illustrious predecessors like shakespeare and milton and promising young men like congreve indicate real generosity of character the moral defects of his writings coarse licentiousness unmeasured invective and equally unmeasured adulation belong to the age rather than to the man on the whole we may say that he was one whom we should probably have esteemed if we could have known him but in whom apart from his writings we should not have discovered the ﬁrst literary ﬁgure of his generation pg 14 pg 15 pg 16 the project gutenberg ebook of the age of dryden by garnett https s early poems the heroic stanzas on the death of cromwell the astraea redux on the restoration the panegyric of clarendon and the verses on the coronation are greatly marred modern readers by extravagant conceits but are sobri ety itself compared to the exploits of contemporary poets especially the pindaric in more important particular dryden scott remarks has observed singular and happy delicacy the topic of the civil war is but slightly dwelt on and although cromwell is extolled his eulogist abstains from any reﬂections against those through whom he cut his way to greatness isolated couplets in the other poems occasionally display that perfection of condensed and pointed expression which dryden habitually attain ed in his later poems spain to your gift alone her indies owes what the powerful takes not he bestows and france that did an exile s presence fear may justly apprehend you still too near redux these early attempts however were completely thrown into the shade by the annus mirabilis poem on the memorable events of 1666 written at charlton near malmesbury the seat of lord berkeley where dryden and his family had resorted in 1665 to escape the plague and published in february the author was then ﬁve and judged in the light of his subsequent celebrity had yet achieved surprisingly little either in quantity or quality youth is generally the most afﬂuent season of poetical activity and those poets whose claim to inspiration is the most milton wordsworth irradiated their early writings with ﬂashes of genius which their maturer skill hardly enabled them to eclipse this can not be said of dryden who of our great poets unless pope be an exception probably owed least to inspiration and most to pains and practice even pope at this age had produced the rape of the lock the temple of fame eloisa to abelar d and his translation of the iliad enough to have given him high place among english poets the annus mirabilis was the ﬁrst production of dryden that could have insured him remembrance with posterity and even this is sadly disﬁgured with conceits after all the poet ﬁnds only two marvels of his wonderful year worthy of dutch war which had been going on two years and which produced much greater wonder in the year ensuing when the dutch sailed up to gravesend and burned the english ﬂeet and the great fire of london the treatment of the former is very tedious and dragging there are many striking lines but more conceits like the following descr iptive of the english attack upon the dutch east indiamen amidst whole heaps of spices lights ball and now their odours armed against them ﬂy some preciously by shattered porcelain fall and some by aromatic splinters the second part treating of the fire of london is inﬁnitely better dryden exhibits one of the most certain marks of good writer he rises with his subject yet there is lack of absurdities the deity extinguishes the conﬂagration precisely in the manner in which dryden would have put out his own candle an hollow crystal pyramid he takes in ﬁrmamental waters dipt above of it broad extinguisher he makes and hoods the ﬂames that to their quarry nothing in dryden is more amazing than his inequality this stanza is succeeded by the following the vanquished ﬁres withdraw from every place or full with feeding sink into sleep each household genius shows again his face

to reﬂect that the celestial sentence would have been equally applicable to every cathedral in the country perhaps the following stanzas compose the passage of most sustained excellence in them in the apostrophe to the royal society in an earlier part of the poem dryden appears truly the vates sacer and his poetry becomes prophecy methinks already from this chymic ﬂame i see city of more precious

encouragement and the necessity of providing his family had bound him to what was then the most conspicuous and lucrative form of authorship in one point of view he committed great error in addicting himself to the drama he was pg 19 pg 20 the project gutenberg ebook of the age of dryden by garnett https naturally qualiﬁed to excel in it and could only obtain even temporary success by condescending to the prevalent faults of the contemporary stage its bombas t and its indecency the latter transgression was eventually so handsomely confessed by himself that but little need be said of it bombast is natural to two classes of writers the ardent and the phlegmatic and those whose emotions require the most working up are frequently the worst offenders such was dryden s case and his natural proclivity was much enhanced by his adoption of the new fashion of writing in rhyme beloved at court but affording every temptation and every facility straining after effect in the place of nature saintsbury justly reminds us that dryden was not forsaking the blank verse of shakespeare and fletcher the secret of which had long been lost nevertheless although we shall see when we come to his critical writings he pleaded very ingeniously rhyme in 1665 his adoption of it was condemned by his maturer judgment and practice it was however fortunate in the long run his rhyming plays of which we shall speak in another place would not have been great successes in any metre while practice in their composition and the necessity of expressing the multitude of diverse sentiments required by bustling scenes and crowds of characters gradually gave him that command of the heroic couplet which bestows such strength and brilliancy on his later writings his fourteen years of dramatic practice saintsbury justly says acted ﬁltering reservoir his poetical powers so that the stream which when it ran into them was the turbid and current of annus mirabilis ﬂowed out impetuous strong but clear and without base admixture in the splendid verse of absalom and achitophel 3 this great poem published in november 1681 at the height of the contest over the exclusion bill and its consequences remains to this day the ﬁnest example of political satire in english literature the theme was skilfully selected james ii had not yet convinced the most sceptical of the justice and wisdom of the exclusion bill and its advocates laboured under the serious disadvantage of having strong claima nt the succession if they prevailed in setting the duke of york aside james s the prince of orange would not it is safe to say ever have been accepted by the nation king if james s folly and tyranny had not years afterwards given him the opportunity of presenting himself in the character of deliverer and failing him there was one but the popular but unfortunately illegitimate monmouth the character of absalom seemed exactly made this handsome and foolish prince the resemblance of his royal father to david except in matters akin to the affair of bathsheba was not quite so obvious dryden might almost have been suspected of satirizing his master when he wrote when nature prompted and law denied promiscuous use of concubine and bride then israel s monarch after heaven s own heart his vigorous warmth did variously impart to wives and slaves and wide his command scattered his maker s image through the land of all the numerous progeny was none so beautiful so brave the management of absalom was difﬁcult matter with all his transgressions the rebel monmouth was still beloved by his

have seen become roman catholic and most reasonably desired to justify this step to the world the court also expected his pen to be drawn in their service and hence the double purpose which runs through the poem of vindicating his personal change of conviction and of justifying the political measures to which james had had recourse establishing the supremacy of his church all this was perfectly natural the extraordinary thing is that so great master of ridicule should have been blind to the ludicrous character of the machinery which he devised to carry out his purpose the comparison of the true church to the hind and of the corrupt church to the beautiful but spotted panther might have been employed with proprie ty an ornament or illustration of the poem but the endeavour to make it the groundwork of the entire piece is pregnant with absurdity animals may very well be introduced actors in ﬁction upon condition that they behave like animals and their faculti es may even be expanded to suit the author s purpose so long their exercise is conﬁned to visible and concrete things but the notion of pair of quadrupeds discussing the sacraments tradition and the infallibility of the pope is only ﬁt burlesque and constitutes indeed running burlesque upon the poem dryden probably took up the idea without sufﬁcient consideration and when he had made some progress in his work he may well have been too enamoured with the beautiful but preposterous exordium to surrender it to common sense perverse and fantastic is the plan of his poem none of his works

royal babe we gaze the manly lines of majestic face give awful joy the raptures of the byzantine courtiers over the imperial infant protus were nothing to this dryden did not want eloquence or dignity to celebrate the hero if he could have found him it was his and our misfortune that when the hero did at last come to the throne the poet had disqualiﬁed himself from extolling him the landing in torbay and the triumphal march to london the victory at the boyne and the defence of londonderry were transactions worthy of epical treatment any history records but the only man in england who could have treated them epically deemed them rather matter elegy and to have indulged in elegy he must have ﬂed to france public events and political and religious controversy were longer him stripped of his means and position he betook himself to translation and playwriting the readiest means of repairing his shattered fortunes and it was not until the mellow sunset of his life that he turned to the compositions which of all he ever wrote have given the most delight and the least offence his fables these published at the beginning of 1700 include ﬁve adaptations from chaucer and three stories told after boccaccio well alexander s feast and few other pieces it would not be too much to say that this book achieved two things either of which would have immortalized poet it ﬁxed the standard of narrative poetry except of the metrical romance or ballad class and also that of heroic versiﬁcation the latter indeed was thought time to have been transcended by pope but modern ears have tired of

seventeenth and eighteenth centuries is the infrequency of the casual visitations of the muse they seem to have hardly ever experienced an unsought lyrical inspiration or to have sung merely singing s

lyrical spirit seem to have been deliberately composed insertion in his plays and the same is the case with almost the whole of what he would have called his occasional poetry his two chief odes

vary his dryden s translations alone would give him conspicuous place in english litera ture the most important his complete version of virgil has been improved upon in many ways and yet after all it remains true that pitt is quoted and dryden had he never translated virgil his renderings or imitations of juvenal horace and other s would sufﬁce to entitle him to inconsiderable rank among those who have enriched their native literature from foreign stores his principle of translation was correct and accords with that of the greatest of english critic coleridge assured wordsworth that there were only two legitimate systems of metrical translation strict literality or compensation carried to its fullest extent dryden most probably had not sufﬁcient latin to be literal but in any case his genius would have disdained such trammels not to mention the more prosaic but not less potent consideration that what is written bread must usually be written in fact which weighed with dryden when he discontinued rhyme in his tragedies thus thrown back on the system of compensation he has richly repaid his authors the beauties of which he has bereaved them by the beauties which he has which he maintains were actually latent in has expressed many of their thoughts with even enhanced energy he has in fact made them write very much they would have written if they had been english poets of the seventeenth century and his work is less translation than transfusion they necessarily appear much metamorphosed from the originals but the fault is less that of dryden than of his age could he have attempted the same task in our day with equal resources of genius and on the same principles of workmanship he would have succeeded much better he would have enjoyed more comprehension of the spirit of his originals than was possible in the seventeenth century the scholarship of that age had not viviﬁed the information which it had amassed the idealized but still vital conceptions of the renaissance had given place to inanimate conventionality the people of greece and rome appeared to the moderns like people in books and such warm affectionate contact between the souls of the present and the past afterwards inspired shelley s versions from homer and euripides was in that age impossible so great and versatile were dryden s powers that after all that has been said his performances lyric poet dramatist and critic remain to be spoken of and his rank in each has to be recognized that of the foremost writer of his country in his own day these will be treated in their appropriate places the present is perhaps the most appropriate few words on his position poet it is most difﬁcult to determine whether he and his successor pope should be placed at the bottom of the ﬁrst class or at the head of the second class of great english poets if the very highest gifts of creative imagination unstudied music unconscious inspiration lofty ideal the power to interpret nature are essential conditions of rank in the ﬁrst class then assuredly dryden and pope must be contented with the second if not positively excluded by the very nature of the deﬁciency in the very highest qualities can be compensated by consummate excellence in all the intellect will supply the place of inspiration and art that of they stand so high above the avera ge of the second rank that it seems injurious not to place them in the ﬁrst the principle of exclusion logically carried out might involve the elevation above them of other writers whom we instinctively feel to be their inferiors too absolute an insistence on the other hand upon the claims of intellectual power and perfect execution qualiﬁc ations supreme poetical rank must result in preferring pope to dryden inferior to his successor in both these respects dryden may still justly be preferred to him on the ground of his more ample endowment with that divine insanity without which plato truly says one can be poet but this consideratio n can not be invoked in his favour against pope pg 37 pg 38 pg 39 the project gutenberg ebook of the age of dryden by garnett https admitting his inferiority to poets of the very ﬁrst order and it may

two are essentia lly of the same genus the differences between them are rather characteristic of their eras than of themselves and while hugo s imagination would have pined in the seventeenth century dryden s intellect and dryden s modesty would have been highly serviceable to hugo in the nineteenth another poet whose talent and career offer many analogies to dryden s is one whom dryden himself

in heroic versiﬁcation of which he has left an unsurpassed model waller was smooth but dryden taught to join the varying verse the full majestic line the march and ener gy his changes nevertheless were not always improvements he is too uniform though not absolutely uniform in conﬁning the sense to the couplet and in adding dignity to chaucer s verse he has lost something of its sweetness leigh hunt well observes though dryden s versiﬁcation is noble beautiful and so complete of its kind that to an ear uninstructed in the metre of the old poet all comparison between the two in this respect seems out of the question and even ludicrous yet the measure in which dryden wrote not only originated but attained to considerable degree of its beauty in chaucer and the old poet s immeasurable superiority in sentiment and imagination not only to dryden but to all up to very late period who have written in the same form of verse left him in possession of beauties even in versiﬁcation which it remains some future poet to amalgamate with dryden s in manner worthy of both and so carry england s noble heroic rhyme to its pitch of it need not be said that pope s magniﬁcent eulogy solely

poetry and prose was john oldham not much is known of his life the son of nonconformist minister he nevertheless obtained university education but after leaving college was glad to accept the position of usher in archbishop whitgift s free school at croydon coming to town he ﬁlled the post of tutor in various families and by his satir es upon the jesuits 1681 gained the acquaintance of dryden and other men of letters and the patronage of the earl of kingston who seemed likely to provide him but at whose seat in nottinghamshire he died of the smallpox december oldham s poems consist partly of odes formal and elaborate compositions and partly of the satires which in his age in some measure supplied the place of the modern journal and review secret and unconscious harmony pervades all branches of the contem porary art of every epoch and in the stately and somewhat stilted lyrics of oldham and his compeers we discern the counterpart of the elaborate frontispieces with temples and triumphal arches chariots and cornucopias tritons and nereids which the engravers of the age preﬁxed to its literature the engraving is hardly art and the verse is hardly poetry we are nevertheless conscious of vigour and substance which command respect the work is compact and solid at any rate and displays much of the force of the giants if little of the inspiration of the gods oldham would fain be extravagant in praise of wine but there is not the least trace of genuine bacchic frenzy in his laboured dithyramb the epicedion on his friend mouvent is serious composition indeed two mortal stanzas with nevertheless sufﬁcient good things to justify the praise bestowed on it by pope the ode to ben jonson is remarkable expressing the feelings of the men of the restoration towards the poet

he has nothing of the salt and savour of rochester s more serious poetry and is at best an elegant versiﬁer who in his only considerable original poem the essay on translated verse thinks justly reasons clearly and expresses himself with considerable spirit when the subject requires the most original feature of his literary character is his preference in rhyming age blank verse which he

personal he was elected hull to richard cromwell s parliament and continued to sit the remainder of his life he was the last member of parliament who received salary from his constituents to whose interests he in return attended so diligently that upwards of three hundred letters from him upon their concerns and general politics are extant in the hull archives marvell could scarcely be called republican he had been devoted to the protectorate and would probably have been easily reconciled to the restoration if the government had been ably and honestly conducted in wrath at the general maladministration he betook himself to satires which circulated in manuscript at ﬁrst he attacked clarendon but eventually concluded that the only reme dy would be the ﬁnal expulsion of the house of stuart in 1672 and 1673 he appeared in print prose controversialist with the rehearsal transpr osed witty attack on work by parker bishop of oxford wherein in the author s own words the mischiefs and inconveniences of toleration were represented and all pretences pleaded in behalf of liberty of conscience fully he silenced his opponent and escaped being himself silenced through the interp osition of charles whose native good sense and easiness of temper inclined him to toleration and who promoted the freedom of nonconformists means of obtaining liberty the church of rome marvell however was not to be reconciled and in 1677 put forth an anonymous pamphlet to prove what was but too true that design had long been on foot to establish absolute monarchy and subvert the protestant religion his

relapses into mere personalities this may be attributed in great measur to the circumstances under which these compositions appeared they could only be circulated clandestinely and the writer may be

we confess how marvell s position the satirist of his from the puritan and republican point of view was ﬁlled upon the cavalier side by samuel butler who if general reputation and excellence in his own walk of verse are to be allowed criterions may claim to be the third poet of the age after milton and dryden it is true that butler though endowed with abundance of fancy was strictly speak ing poet that he is entirely destitute of the dignity and tenderness which marvell can display with congenial theme and that he possesses nothing of dryden s power of exalting unpromising subjects into poetry but he inﬁnitely surpasses marvell when they meet on the common ground of satire and though he can not be said to surpass dryden their methods are so different that proper comparison can be drawn when writing in dryden s manner butler is respectable but he has the ﬁeld of burlesque epic entirely to himself supremacy in low style of composition is surer passport to fame than moderate merit in high one with all the defects of restoration literature it had faculty producing masterpieces and it must be admitted that butler s hudibras stands decidedly at the head of its class paradise lost or absalom and achitophel or pilgrim s progress or pepys s diary at the head of theirs samuel butler was born near worcester in his father small farmer procured him good education at the worcester grammar school his ﬁrst employment was that of clerk to country justice named jefferys he afterwards entered the household of elizabeth countess of kent at wrest in bedfordshire and subsequently acted clerk to various justices of the peace one of whom sir samuel luke of cople hoo near bedfo rd served the original of hudibras it is curious to reﬂect that john bunyan was at the same time going through his spiritual conﬂicts in the same county he seems to have also travelled in france and holland he published nothing until 1659 when an anonymous tract in favour of the restoration of the monarchy entitled mola asinaria appeared from his pen the service was recompensed by the appointment of secretary to the earl of carbury lord president of wales who made him steward of ludlow castle where comus had been performed nearly thirty years befor he resigned this charge upon contracting what seemed wealthy marriage but the lady s money was lost and notwithstanding the great literary success hudibras the remainder of the author s life was spent in poverty the ﬁrst part of hudibras stated in the title to have been written during the civil war and if so at least ﬁfteen years old was published in its success was instantaneous though neither the puritans nor pepys could quite see the joke the merit of the performance however was fully apparent to better and more inﬂuential judge the king who encouraged the author by giving numer ous copies away though history does not say at whose expense but this was all he gave and the poet who had rendered such essential service to the royalist cause by his writi ngs was completely neglected by the court if he had been john milton it is indeed said that he was in receipt of pension of at his death but this seems contradicted by the letter already quoted of dryden to the lord high treasurer within two years after butler s death where he says tis enough one age to have neglected cowley and starved butler

bequeathed his posthumous papers to longueville by whom they were carefully preserved and large portion eventually came to be published in they will be treated of in another place not much is known of butler s personal character and habits he must evidently have been man of extensive reading and versed in sever al languages and literatures it seems natural to attribute the neglect of so popular an author to some inﬁrmity in his own temper but the little testimony we have makes the other way wood describes him boon and witty companion and aubrey says severe and sound judgment good fellow it must be remembered that he was at the restoration and had spent almost all his life in the country we shall also ﬁnd reason to believe that he was neither enough of churchman nor enough of loyalist to be entirely agreeable to his own party the defect in hudibras pointed out by johnson the want of logical sequence in the action undoubtedly exists but is almost inherent in the conception of such performance more serious drawback the disproportion between the hero s deeds and his words probably arises from the poem having been written at different periods of the author s life when he began to write his invention was lively and vigorous but it naturally ﬂagged after middle age although his wit remained unimpaired in the ﬁrst and part of the second canto disquisition and adventure are so evenly blended that each supports the other in the latter part of the poem the burden falls almost entirely upon the former hence the picturesque and cleverly varied incident of the with the varied characters it brings upon the scene will always be the favourite passage of the poem unless an exception be made the portraits of hudibras and ralpho there is however considerable inconsistency in the character of hudibras he is represented fool yet half the good things of the book are from sheer necessity put into his mouth we are to suppose him coward yet he takes and deals cuffs and bangs in the spirit of pugilist and his attack upon the seven champions of one of them an amazon is so far from cowardice that it more resembles temerity the more odious traits of his character hardly seem properly to belong to it and in fact butler probably commenced his poem without too curiously considering how he was to conduct it or rather where it was to conduct him and scribbled away in the spirit of his own one sense and one rhyme is quite sufﬁcient at one time pg 56 pg 57 the project gutenberg ebook of the age of dryden by garnett https to the humour ever springing up under his pen to

designedly obliterated and the humour exaggerated into farce to suit the author s polemic purpose his design is to kill presbyterianism and independency by ridicule and he is consequently compel led to shut his eyes to everything in them except their occasional tendency to baseness and their perpetual liability to cant this is the constant nemesis of the satirist but butler is even more of caricaturist than the situation called the endurance of his poem to our own times however is sufﬁcient proof that although caricature it was not libel and amid the enthusiastic reaction of the restoration it may well have passed fair portrait the machinery is closely modelled upon don quixote presbyterianism is incarnated in the doughty justice of the peace sir hudibras independency and new light sectarianism in general in his squire ralpho and the two sally forth in quest of adventure quite in the style of don quixote and sancho except that the don s great aim is to deliver damsels and hudibras s to imprison them though the scene appears to be laid in the west of england there is reason to doubt the tradition that the prototype of hudibras s satire was butler s master the bedfordshire magistrate sir samuel luke who is evidently alluded to where rhyme to mameluke is left blank to be supplied by the reader s ingenuity if is more than probable this worthy justice was given to suppressing butler would need more material his burlesque and the ﬁrst part of the poem at all events may well have been written while he was in sir samuel s employment it seems from internal evidence to have been composed before cromwell had ejected the long parliam ent and its general atmosphere almost precludes the idea of its having been written after the execution of charles the second part has many allusions to later events the description of hudibras mind and body is so vivid and precise to present internal evidence of having been drawn from living model while ralpho is in

heroica l epistles between the parties which not help it on and by digression on the downfall of the rump chieﬂy remarkable allusions to politics of later date one of the most noticeable phenomena in butler is that after all this cavalier poet is little of cavalier and this assailant of puritanism little of churchman his loyalty is but hatred of anarchy and his religion but hatred of cant the genuineness of both these feelings is attested by the detached thoughts found among his papers otherwise it might fairly have been doubted whether his motive espousing the royalist cause had been any other than the inﬁnitely greater scope which puritanism and republicanism offered to the shafts of satirist the follies of the cavalier party proved that things may be absurd without being ridiculous those of their opponents demonstrated that ridicule may justly attach to things not intrinsically absurd it is clear notwithstanding from butler s prose remains that he was constitutiona lly hostile to liberty in politics and to the inward light in religion and that he obeyed his own sincere conviction in attacking them but it is equally clear that his preference monarchy was solely utilitarian and that his preferences in religion were determined simply by taste the ground of his acquiescence in the church of england is thus frankly stated by himself in one of his detached thoughts men ought to in religion they in war when man of honour is overpowered and must of necessity surrender himself up prisoner such are always wont to endeavour to it to some person of command and quality and not to mere scoundrel so since all men are obliged to be of some church it is more honourable if there were nothing else in it to be of that which has some reputation than such one is contemptible and justly despised by all the best of this is not the language of very fervent churchman and butler s royalism is like his religion pis aller nowhere does his aversion puritanism kindle into enthusiasm its contrary any more than his humour ever rises into poetry in his verse he is satirist pg 63 pg 64 the project gutenberg ebook of the age of dryden by garnett https his prose sceptic and his satire and his scepticism are alike rooted in low opinion of human nature and disbelief that things can ever be much better than they are he is strong spirit but of the earth earthy at the same time he is not one of the satirists who make their readers cynics on the contrary his hearty geniality puts the reader into good humour with mankind and suggests that if there is not much to admire there is also but little to condemn it is unnecessary to dilate on his peculiar merits which are of universal notoriety few have enriched the langua ge with so many familiar quotations few have so much fancy along

compositions of butler s which had remained unpublished during his life and had come into the possession of his friend longueville were edited by thyer librarian of the chetham library at manchester the most important his characters in the manner of theophrastu s and detached thoughts in prose will be noticed along with the prose essayists of the metrical compositions the most elabora is the elephant in the moon satire on the appetite marvels displayed by some of the members of the then infant royal society which exists in two recensions one in hudibrastic the other in heroic verse the other pieces are also the most part satirical with strong afﬁnity to hudibras except where they parody the style of some poet of the day they are always clever sometimes very humorous and pointed and with marvell s satires form transition from the unpolished quaintness of donne to the weight and splendour of dryden butler in one instance appears downright plagiarist in another he would seem were

decline of the drama has attracted more attention partly from the violent contrast of two schools which had hardly one principle or one method in common partly because our own age had but imperfectly realized the exceeding wealth in song of the elizabethan and jacobean periods until arthur bullen showed what unsuspected treasures of poetry were hidden in old music books whatever else an elizabethan or jacobean lyric may be it is almost certain to be melodious the average restoration lyric is correct enough in scansion but the melody is conventional poor and thin here and there and especially in dryden we are surprised by ﬁne exception but rule the restoration song is deﬁcient alike in the simple spontaneity which inspired such pieces come live with and be my love and in the more intricate harmonies of its predecessors it was though blight had suddenly fallen upon the nation and men s ears had become incapable of distinguishing between sweetness and smoothness so indeed they had respected the music of verse but how little technical music whether vocal or instrumental was neglected even in private circles we may learn from pepys s diary and it is remarkable proof how little this music and the music of poetry have to with each other that this age of degeneracy in the one produced the greatest of all english masters purcell in the other while the still more hopelessly unmelodious age of the ﬁrst geor ges was the age of handel poetry makes melody not melody poetry and the only explanation is that the age preceding that of the restoration was poetical and the restoration age was prosaic it could not well have been otherwise if all critics agree the special literary mission of the restoration period was to prune the luxuriance of english prose and by introducing conciseness perspicuity and logical order to render it ﬁt instrument narrative reasoning and the despatch of business such lyric the age possessed is almost entirely comprehended in dryden marvell of whom we must nevertheless speak belongs in spirit to former age the songs in dryden s plays to be mentioned shortly prove that he was by means destitute of spontaneous lyrical feeling but he doubt succeeded best when having ﬁrst penetrated himself with theme sufﬁciently stirring to generate the enthusiastic mood which ﬁnds its natural expression in song he sat down to frame ﬁtting accompaniment by the aid of all the resources of metrical art the principal examples of this lyrical magniﬁcence which he has given us are the elegy on anne killigrew and the two odes on cecilia s day of the ﬁrst of these two latter johnson says that it is lost in the splendour of the second and such is the fact but had dryden produced other lyric he would still have ranked ﬁne lyrical poet of the second ode better known alexander s feast it is needless to say anything all readers of poetry have it by heart and all recognize its claim to rank among the greatest odes in the greatest perhaps until wordsworth and shelley wrote and little if at all behind even them johnson indeed prefers the memorial ode on anne killigrew and if all the stanzas equalled the ﬁrst he would be right but this is impossible he himself remarks an imperial crown can not be one continued the inevitable falling off nevertheless would have been less apparent if dryden had shown more judgment in the selection of his topics or at least more tact in handling them the morals of the age were indeed bad enough he well knew who had helped to make them so but such frank treatment of disagreea ble theme jars exceedingly with an ode devoted to the celebration of chastity and virtue notwithstanding this ﬂaw the entire ode deserves saintsbury s eulogy piece of concerted music in verse it has not superior the

which on his own showing he had little natural qualiﬁcation and in which he had little ambition to excel only one of his numerous plays he tells us was written to please himself but he wanted reputation money and court favour and these inducements directed him to the most popular and lucrative department of the muses province here elsewhere his progress was slow his ﬁrst play the wild gallant 1663 has come down to us in an amended version in its original form it is pronounced by pepys poor thing i ever saw in my dryden might long have remained an unsuccessful dramatist but the invention of rhyming traged y which though in itself an objectionable form suited his talent to perfection the management of the heroic couplet was and always continued the strongest of all his strong points and his genius rhetoric was stimulated to the utmost by the facilities afforded by this sonorous form of metre hence the indian emper or 1665 was great success and determined the main course of dryden s dramatic activity some years it necessarily brought him nearer to the french drama and gave french character to the drama of the day not really in harmony with the taste of the english public and from which dryden ultimately freed himself the opinion of the day was prepared to go in the direction of classicism far jonson but not far corneille the french traveller sorbière having in 1663 censured the irregularity of the english stage was answered by sprat who asserts the superiority of his countrymen and points out the fundamental difference in the taste of the two nations the french he says the most part take only one or two great men and chieﬂy insist upon some one remarkable accident of their story to this end they admit more persons than will serve to adorn that and they manage all in rhyme with long speeches almost in the way of dialogues in making high ideas of honou r and in speaking noble things the english on their side make their chief plot to consist in greater variety of actions and besides the main design add many little contrivances by this means their scenes are shorter their stage fuller many more persons of different humours are introduced and in carrying on of this they generally only conﬁne themselves to blank sprat then proceeds to point out the advantages of the english method and it is evident that neither he nor the public imagined themselves to be on the eve of such serious modiﬁcations of the national drama actually took modiﬁcations to be chieﬂy attributed to the taste of the court and the more easily effected from the paucity of theatres the inferiority of the restoration drama to the elizabethan is one of the commonplaces of criticism perhaps even one of its platitudes and can not be admitted without some 6 pg 76 pg 77 the project gutenberg ebook of the age of dryden by garnett https yet the broad general statement of fact it is undeniable and the fact is proof that the elements which preserve play literature posterity are not those which ﬁt it the contemporary stage in every play of serious purpose there is or should be an earthly part and spiritual dramatic craftsmanship and poetical inspiration in the former particular the restoration dramatists compare not unfavourably with their predecessors always excepting shakesp eare they fail not dramatists but poets the whole elizabethan drama is steeped in an atmosphere of poetry to say nothing of its chief representatives take up such satires the return from parnassus or such merely occasional pieces the academical play on timon which preceded shakespeare s and you will not doubt that you are reading the work of poet read through on the other hand the best plays of the representative dramatists of the restoration and you will generally ﬁnd the poetical element concentrated in few brilliant passages in the elizabethan age it is evident men lived at such height of heroic and romantic sentiment that the purveyors of public entertainment could not but be poets in the restoration on the other hand men habitually lived breathed and wrote prose and when the dramatist would be poet he had to set himself to the task to convince ourselves that the distinction between poetry and prose is not artiﬁcial carlyle seemed to think but essential we have only to consider the widely different inﬂuence of elizabethan and restoration drama upon the after world both excepting the works of shakespeare are virtually dead acted drama but in losing the stage the restoration drama has lost everything while the elizabethan is yet living and working force it powerfully in the splendid revival of english poetry at the end of last century it is at this moment an inspirer and nurse of young genius it is inconceivable that the restoration drama whole should inspire anyone or that it should count anything factor in future developments of literature one is perennial plant which may die down to the root in ungenial seasons but will assuredly put forth new ﬂowers the other is fossil curious and in some measure beautiful but devoid of vital force and this the merely intellectual merits of both being so considerable reason can be given but that one is on the whole poetical and therefore living the other on the whole prosaic and therefore inert hence we may prophesy of the success of the endeavour of ibsen and other men of distinguished talent to produce dramas conceived in an entirely realistic spirit and entirely devoted to the problems of modern society such competitions will be valuable pièces justiﬁcatives the intellectual history of the ninete enth century but they will be extinct literary forces long ere the end of the twentieth this nevertheless is to be said the restoration dramatists that their art is not an imitation of an extinct form of the drama but is at least something new really expressive of the sentiments of their generation the imitation of shakespeare could only have produced gross unreality which must have degenerated still further into mere inanity the playwrights did what the contemporary painters should have done they fell back in measure upon realism when high imagination was longer possible if they had gone further in this direction their works would have possessed more intrinsic merit and have claimed more important place in the history of culture their tragedies would not so often have been rendered unnatural by the employment of rhyme and their comedies would have exhibited the manners and the morals of the english nation and not merely of the playgoing part of it it can not be believed that the comedy of that age affords anything like so faithful picture of the seventeenth century fielding s novels of the eighteenth the realistic tendency was chieﬂy conspicuous in the closer approach to the language of common life and in the more logical character even of appeals to emotion the extravagant transports of heroes and heroines only betray that true imagination had grown cold but the manly nervous sense and the almost forensic reasoning so often found in their company show that new stratum had really been touched another consideration should not be overlooked in the comparison between the elizabethan and the restoration drama that the debasement of the latter is exaggerated from the seeming abruptness of the metamorphosis under gone by the former passing from the stage of shakespeare to the stage of dryden we appear to have suddenly pg 78 pg 79 pg 80 the project gutenberg ebook of the age of dryden by garnett https new world the representatives of the drama seem instantaneously transformed by some circean potion into beings of lower type we not immediately remember that the gradual development which would have interpreted the apparent prodigy was rudely interrupted by the civil war and the commonwealth if the interval between shirley and dryden had been continuously occupied by popular dramatists we should have observed the change slowly coming on and have watched the older form shading off into the newer by gradations not more violent than those by which the latter subsequently passed into the drama of the eighteenth century it is the poets of charles s time seem the authors of revolution of which they were merely the instruments the younger portion of their audiences on whose suffrages they had mainly to rely had scarcely so much seen play the spells of authority and tradition were broken or at least so grievously impaired to be unable to withstand the seduction of french example honest samuel pepys would not have so easily pronounced the midsummer night s dream mean thing if the romantic drama had not been absolutely extinct him and taking broad view of the revolution in popular taste we must admit that however deplorable in itself it had some good sides it tended to bring england more into harmony with the general current of european taste and thought and repressed the tendency of our noble literature to fanciful and eccentric insularity in the long run moreover it was serviceable to the english drama by providing substitute however inferior the old vein now unproductive the want of such resou rce killed the drama of spain spanish dramatis ts until the nineteenth century were unable to accommodate themselves to any dramatic form but the national one every phase of which had been completely exempliﬁed before the end of the seventeenth century in consequence the spanish theatre of the eighteenth century did not produce single tolerable piece until near the terminat ion of the epoch playwright arose who was capable of proﬁting by french example another extenuation of the departure of the restoration dramatists from the better traditions of the english stage is the strength well the suddenness of the new inﬂuence to which they were subjected it came from the court and the court dispensed the playwright s daily bread there is sufﬁcient evidence that even shakespeare was by means indifferent to the good opinion of elizabeth and james but neither of these sovereigns was sufﬁciently the drama s patron to be the drama s legislator it was otherwise with charles man of wit taste and polish inaccessible to the deeper emotions of humanity and without grain of poetry in his composition such man must have found the elizabethan drama intolerable he doubt honestly agreed with his laureate who coolly says at his return he found nation lost much in barbarism in rebellion and the excellency of his nature forgave the one so the excellency of his manners reformed the other the desire of imita ting so great pattern ﬁrst awakened the dull and heavy spirits of the english from their natural with every allowance adulation there can be doubt that dryden in considerable measure believed himself reformer charles had his paladins in the ﬁeld of letters the favour says dryden elsewhere which heroic plays have lately found upon our theatres has been wholly derived to them from the countenance and approbation they have received at we may well feel thankful that the experiment of gallicizing the native genius of england should have been tried so fairly and have broken down so utterly under such patronage charles s and in such hands dryden we have not quite seen the last of it but where corneille and molière failed goncourt and zola are not likely to succeed this may at least be said dryden that the romantic drama was time in state of suspended animation and that the only question was what successor should ﬁll its place short time two foreign schools seemed contending the prize dryden s own allegiance in his ﬁrst piece the wild gallant was given to the spanish drama form exceedingly attractive from its brisk action sudden vicissitudes and dexterous development of intrigue but the spanis h drama can not be naturalized in england two reasons one creditable to english genius the other the reverse play of intrigue is necessarily play of incident and allows little room the development of character but englishmen are humoursome and enjoy the discrimination of character to the nicest pg 81 pg 82 the project gutenberg ebook of the age of dryden by garnett https if we judged the two nations solely by their dramas we should say that all spaniards were exactly alike and two englishmen the other reaso n is that englishmen not particularly excel in the contrivance of incident and that few even of our best dramatists could rival the ingenuity of spanish playwrig hts the drama soon disappeared and its place in serious dramatic literature was taken by genre most intimately associated with the name of dryden its most brilliant practitioner and upon whose desertion it crumbled into dust dryden himself has told us in few words what he understands by an heroic play and the deﬁnition exempts him from much of the criticism to which he might otherwise have been held liable an heroic play ought to be an imitation in little of an heroic in other words it must have an epical element well dramatic the experi ment was worth making it proved that neither branch of the poetic art gained anything by invading the other s territory compared with the art of shakespeare or of sophocles the art of dryden in this department seems tawdry caricature all the higher qualities of the dramatist are absent being in fact inconsistent with the demands of epic poetry while epic dignity is equally sacriﬁced to the exigencies of drama without constant hurry and bustle such pieces would be intolerable they require dryden tacitly admits by the quotation from ariosto which he adduces expressive of his guiding principle constant succession of adventures such incessant agitation leaves place the development of character the actors come on the stage ready labelled or if like nourmahal in aurengzebe they disclose new trait the sudden novelty produces the effect of complete metamorphosis the pieces could only be regarded splendid shows were not the failings of the dramatist so frequently redeemed by the poet it so chanced that the coryphæus of this unnatural style was the most splendid poetical declaimer unless byron be excepted that england ever produced and his pieces resound with tirades not merely brilliant in diction and sonorous in versiﬁcation but now ﬁery with mettlesome spirit now weighty with manly sense and these qualities were aided by the otherwise objectionable form selected by the poet his plays far superior works of art contain few such eloquent passages his rhyming tragedies rhyme helped him on riderless runaway horse is spurred by the thunder of his own hoofs even where his thought is poor its poverty is veiled by the brilliancy of the brilliancy which he could hardly have attained by the use of any other form and if the employment of rhyme seems it is unnatural the form at least harmonizes with the substance and they produce between them an illusive effect of species of art which may possibly be legitimate the ordinary rules evidently not apply we must also remember how this subornation of the judgment not imperceptible or ineffective in the closet was aided on the stage by the most potent appeals to the senses tyrannic love dryden s ﬁrst considerable attempt in heroic tragedy is very remarkable proof of to what extraordinary absurdities vigorous intellect may be liable and also how these may be digniﬁed by energy of expression the rants of maximin says johnson have long been the sport of criticism but so spirited and sonorous is the diction that inconsistent seems the alliance of admiration with derision such actually is the mingled feeling which they excite in the quiet of the closet on the stage they must have passed off much better by the aid of scenery costume and emphatic declamation and success on the boards it must be remembered was invariably dryden s ﬁrst object the same consideration which explains though it does not excuse his indecency palliates his bombast he wrote to live and could not afford to produce unactable dramas much more interesting performance than tyrannic love is his conquest of granada it is touchstone of heroic tragedy crucial test of what it can and what it can not it renounces all pretence to nature reason and probability on the other hand it delights with crowd of striking sentiments and images and enchains the attention with perpetual bustle and variety it is to one of shakespeare s plays bit of shining glass is to plant of which every ﬁbre is the creation of natural law yet the glass is not displeasing object neither is the play the worst offence of the conquest of granada after all is not its bombast but its bathos it is true that both spring from the same root that want of genuine creative pg 83 pg 84 pg 85 the project gutenberg ebook of the age of dryden by garnett https which in attempting the great only achieves the big which small oversight easily converts into the laughable but apart from this failing which dryden shares with most epic poets of the second rank it is difﬁcult to acquit him of singular insensibility to the ridiculous this is evinced among other things by the entire conception of one of his most serious and elaborate works the hind and the panther and it requires all the gravity and obvious conviction of his preface to the conquest of granada to convince us that he did not occasionally mean to burlesque his own principles the rapid changes of fortune the constant fallings into and out of love the odd predicaments in which heroes and heroines continually ﬁnd themselves frequently produce the effect of the broadest effect much assisted by the extraordinary rants of the principal speakers when l yndaraxa desires the personage who has ﬁrst stabbed her and then himself to die us both i have not leisure now or almahide threatens to send her ghost to fetch back almanzor s scarf if she and her ghost were dif ferent beings or almanzor s astounding menace to his mother s spirit i ll squeeze thee like bladder there and make thee groan thyself away in air so unequal is dryden s genius that the second of these monstrosities occurs in close proximity to the exquisite verses what precious drops are those which silently each other s track pursue bright young diamonds in their infant dew and the burlesque threat to the ghost is immediately succeeded by the noble couplet i am the ghost of her who gave thee birth the airy shadow of her mouldering the beauties which are thickly sown throughout the conquest of granada owe perhaps something of their effect poetry to the utter want of nature in the characters and of reason in the conduct of the play in drama aiming at the delineation of real men and women they would frequently have appeared absurdly inappropriate but when it is once understood that the personages are the puppets and mouthpieces of the author the question of dramatic propriety becomes irrelevant yet the conquest of granada is something more than heap of glittering morsels of sentiment and wit it possesses unity of feeling which serves cement these scattered jewels the kind of generous and noble spirit animating it to employ saintsbury s just description maintains the reader at level above the pitch of ordinary life when he opens the book he rises he closes it he descends he may laugh but his amusement is unmingled with contempt and ever and anon he comes upon the genuine heroic unsuspected of sham unspoiled by bombast the soul of chivalry inspires the lines quoted with just applause by both scott and saintsbury

almahide with scorn rewards my care yet than to change tis nobler to despair my love s my soul and that from fate is free tis that unchanged and deathless part of aurengzebe 1675 saintsbury considers in some respects very noble we should rather have called it an indifferent play with some noble passag es more pg 86 pg 87 the project gutenberg ebook of the age of dryden by garnett https eloquence than dramatic propriety the characters though by means subtle or even natural are better discriminated than in the conquest of granada there is much less rant and bustle yet quite enou gh to make one

so much by mere haste and carelessness by the trick of the heroic metre which in dialogue almost enforces balanced antithesis nearly all aurengzebe is composed in this brilliant where the ball of ﬁne sentiment tossed from one character to another comes back in retort to be returned in repartee of dramatic art shakespeare or the greeks understood it there is not trace the pivot of the action is the property ﬁtter fairy tale than tragedy possessed by indamora of compelling every one who sees her to fall in love with her neither pity nor terror can be excited on such terms if aristotle s criterion be sound aurengzebe is tragedy at all if however we are conte nt to regard it medley of ﬁne things model of spirited declamation and sonorous versiﬁcation it claims high praise great must have been the intellectual strength which could thus thunder and dazzle through ﬁve acts of unabated energy and the sentiments considered merely such lose nothing of their effect from being placed in the mouths of puppets and misplaced even there take instance the most famous passage in the play one of the ﬁnest in all dryden when i consider life tis all cheat yet fooled with hope men favour the deceit trust

exceptionally its entire perversion of the truth of history the generous and ﬁlial part here ascribed to the unnatural and aurengzebe was really performed by his unfortuna brother dara to have crowned dara however would have involved an equal violation of historical truth to have killed him violation of what the dramatists of dryden s day considered more important poetical justice marriage la mode 1673 the ﬁrst fair example of dryden s comedy is more satisfactory exhibition of his power dramatist if piece adding little to his fame poet saintsbury justly remarks that scott s general undervaluing of dryden s comic pieces is very evident in his prefatory notice saintsbury himself though warmly appreciative of dryden s only original excursion into the realms of the higher comedy might we think have said even more in its favour the situation of the spouses fancying themselves tired of each other while their affection only needs the ﬁllip of jealousy is comic in high degree and the brisk intricacy of the action with only four actors to sustain it manifests great ingenuity and deftness in dramatic construction the serious section of the play is certainly much less meritorious than the comic to which it is mere appendage written in most slovenly blank verse it entirely wants the ﬁre and energy of dryden s heroic plays its fault is rather sterility than extravagance with some exceptions it appears tame and bald but these exceptions are very ﬁne the scene between leonidas and palmyra act sc 1 is like morsel of theocritus allying the charm of pastoral innocence to the wit and point of an accomplished it is remarkable how surely at this period of his career dryden rises when he resorts to rhyme but even the careless blank verse of this play in general merely foil to the comic part sometimes sparkles with strokes worthy of great poet pol he is prince and you are meanly born leon love either ﬁnds equality or makes this glory after i have seen the canopy of state spread wide above in the abyss of heaven the court of stars the blushing morning and the rising sun what greater can i see thought borrowed from menander continuing our survey of dryden s plays rather according to subject than to chronological order we arrive at the of the spanish friar 1681 one of the most esteemed of his lighter pieces but whose praise we must agree with saintsbury has outstripped its desert the comic portion is certainly very drastic but it is not comedy of high order it exhibits distinct declension from marriage la mode where the quartette of mitschuldiger are well individualized personages the sinners in the spanish friar are of the most ordinary stage rake stage coquette stage miser and stage friar dominick is indeed exceedingly amusing but is more farcical than truly comic he is painted in broad staring colours without delicacy of gradation with the same brush the author s morats and almanzors only dipped into different paint like so many of dryden s personages he is better adapted the stage than the closet every word and gesture would tell in the hands of good actor and in dryden s time the stage was richer in performers than it ever was before and probably than it has ever been since dryden himself it must be recorded attached high value to his piece and dryden was an excellent critic of himself well of others the merit on which he lays chief stress however is the ingenious blending of the tragic and comic action the tragic part says churton collins helps out the comic and the comic relieves naturally and appropriately the tragic in this work from an artistic point of view has achieved perhaps its highest this howeve r is the achievement of playwright in one passage alone we ﬁnd the poet it is the highly imaginative series of descriptions of the distant noises from the moorish camp boding pg 90 pg 91 the project gutenberg ebook of the age of dryden by garnett https to the beleaguered city of the panic in the city itself and of the uncertain battle from the moorish camp an hour and more there has been heard distant humming noise like bees disturbed and arming in their never was known night of such distraction noise so confused and dreadful jostling crowds that run and know not whither torches gliding like meteors by each other in the from the moors camp the noise grows louder still rattling of armour trumpets drums and atabals and sometimes peals of shouts that rend the heavens like victory then groans again and howlings like those of vanquished men but every echo goes fainter of f and dies in distant the next play of dryden s which it is necessary to notice here might have ranked among his masterpieces if it had been entirely or even principally his own it is sufﬁci ent praise him to have followed plautus and molière with unequal steps and while borrowing he could not help the substance of his piece from them to have enriched their groundwork with original conceptions of his own the plot of amphitryon may be considered common property better subject the comic theatre can not be conceived than the equivocations occasioned by jupiter s assumption of amphitryon s appearance doubled and it were parodied over again by the comic poet s happy thought of introducing mercury in the disguise of amphitryon s valet it is surprising that the theme should not have attracted the best poets of the athenian middle comedy so far we know however it was only treated by single author and he not one of the highest reputation archippus how far plautus translated archippus must remain question but considering that the greek play attained especial reputation while the latin is one of the best we have it is only fair to give plautus credit having introduced good deal of his own his comedy has unfortunately reached us in mutilated condition wanting probably not less than three hundred verses in the fourth act but enough remain s to show how the action was conducted molière the greatest of comic poets could not fail to improve upon his model the substance of the piece admitted of material alteration but molière has greatly enriched and embellished by the happy idea of the prologue between mercury and night which however he is much indebted to lucian he is to plautus the even more by the amusing scene between sosia and cleanthis his play unlike most of his other performances is written in lyrical metre and the language is model of elegance harmony and polish dryden writing in prose or negligent blank verse could not rival molière in this respect but while losing nothing of the vis comica of either of his predecessors he has heightened the humour of the piece by still further elaboration of the hints given by molière he was himself well acquainted with lucian from whom he has borrowed several additional strokes and he has doubled the entertainment of the situation between sosia and cleanthis by the creation of phædra whose intrigue with mercury makes the comedy of errors absolutely complete we have now to consider the two plays of dryden s on which his fame dramatist principally rests and which if in some respects less interesting than his other dramatic writings less intensely characteristic of the man and his age are that very reason better equipped competition place among the dramas of all time all love 1678 is dryden tells us the only play he wrote entirely to please his own taste and composed professedly in imitation of the divine he did not in his unfortunate alteration of troilus and cressida select piece of shakespeare s which not understanding he rashly thought himself able to improve but in spirit of pg 92 pg 93 the project gutenberg ebook of the age of dryden by garnett https reverence set himself to copy one which he held in high esteem it should be remembered to the honour of dryden s critical judgment that the two plays of shakespeare s most warmly commended by him antony and cleopatra and richar d the second were generally underrated even by shakespeare s most devoted worshippers until coleridge taught us better in all love he found subject suitable to his genius and in our opinion achieved very decidedly his best play it is indeed almost good play on the french model can be inferior to its prototypes only from the lack of brilliant declamation scarcely practicab le without rhyme but more than compensating this inferiority by the greater freedom and ﬂexibility of its blank verse its defects are mainly those of its species and would be less apparent if it did not so directly court comparison with one of the greatest examples of shakespeare s art it would have been impossible greater genius than dryden to have done justice to his theme within the conﬁnes prescribed by the classical drama the demeanour of antony during the period of his downfall recorded by history is below the dignity of tragedy some weakness may be forgiven in hero but the heroism of the real antony is swallowed up in weakness we can but pity and pity is largely leavened with contempt there is but one remedy to create cleopatra so wondrous and fascinating fairly to counterbalance the empire which antony throws away her sake shakespeare s art is equal to the occasion his cleopatra is dæmonic and at the same time so intensely feminine that the purest and meekest of her sex may see much of themselves in her she is at once an epitome and an encyclopædia and the reader can hardly despise antony being the slave of spell which he feels so strongly himself dryden s cleopatra wants this character of universality which indeed none but shakespeare could have given and shakespeare himself could not have given if in bondage to the unities she is ﬁne passionate sensuous woman kind of mary stuart interesting but not to the point at which it could be felt that the world were well lost her the inferiority of cleopatra reacts grievously upon antony shakespeare s cleopatra is so grand that her lover is exalted by the admiration which in spite of her perﬁdies she manifestly feels him the beloved of such woman must be heroic an impression skilfully assisted by the effect antony produces upon the prudent and politic augustus dryden s cleopatra can bestow such patent of distinction by so much the chief personages are inferior to their exemplars by so much also is the puny starved action of dryden s tragedy restricted to one day and seven characters inferior to the opulence of shakespeare s ranging over the roman world crowded with personages and gathering up every trait from plutarch that could contribute picturesqueness to its prodigality of incident and sentiment nor is dryden entirely succe ssful in the conduct of his plot the introduction of octavia is happy idea but she appears at too late period of antony s history the implication that his return to her could have availed him in so desperate an extremity is more contrary to historical truth and common reason than any of the anachronisms which dryden derides elizabethan poets the intrigue by which dolabella is made to excite antony s jealousy is more worthy of comedy than of heroic tragedy besides being inconsistent with the manly character of its promoter ventidius this gallant veteran is indeed ﬁne creation too ﬁne he sometimes seems to eclipse antony and cleopatra both and assumes more prominence in the action than shakespeare would have allowed him alexas is the hasty and much marr ed outline of character which might have been hardly less impressive had dryden been at the pains to work out the conception adumbrated in the ﬁrst act when all these imperfections are admitted and they should not be passed over in silence after scott s parallel of dryden s performance with shakespeare s it remains true that all love is very ﬁne play energetic passionate and steeped in that atmosp here of nobility which half redeems the literary defects of the conquest of granada the poetry is frequently very ﬁne in

muley moloch and benducar are wholly stagey nothing then remains but dorax and his capabilities are chieﬂy evinced in one great scene even this is in some respects inartiﬁcially conducted the spectator is insufﬁciently prepared it the special ground of dorax s resentment comes upon us surprise and his repentance is too hasty and sudden similar defect may be alleged against the whole of the tragic action the centre of interest is gradually shifted not intentionally but from the author s omission to foreshadow the events to come after the fashion of masterpiece he must have studied the œdipus tyrannus at ﬁrst all our interest is enlisted sebastian s life and it is with sort of puzzlement that we feel ourselves at last listening to story of incest muley moloch and benducar have disappeared and their place is occupied by new character alvarez in every respect therefore regarded work of art don sebastian fails to sustain comparison with all love and there is countervailing superiority in the diction whose general nobility and spirit occasionally swell into bombast the worst fault remains to be told dorax s ludicrous escape from death by reason of being poisoned by two enemies at once if either the emperor or the mufti would have let him alone he would never have lived to be reconciled to sebastian but the ﬁery drug of the one is neutralized by the icy bane of the other and vice versâ dryden thinks it sufﬁcient excuse that similar incident is vouched by ausonius but really there is nothing so farcical in the rehearsal on the whole we can not but consider don sebastian very imperfect play redeemed from mediocrity by the general vigour and anima tion of the diction and the loftiness of soul which seldom forsakes dryden except when he wilfully panders to the popular taste but little space can here be devoted to dryden s other plays some are not worth criticism the mock astrologer largely borrowed from french and spanish sources contains some of his best lyrics many parts of cleomenes are very noble but it is somewhat heavy whole king arthur musical and spectacular drama is an excellent specimen of its class dryden s portion of œdipus written in conjunction with lee shows how ﬁnely he like his model lucan could deal with the supernatural this is by means the case with his state of innocence and fall of man which is nevertheless one of his pieces most worthy of perusal it measures the prodigious fall from the age of cromwell to the age of charles while dryden yet displays such ﬁne poetical gifts to command respect amid all the absurdities of his unintentional burlesque of milton dryden undeniably took up the profession of playwright without an effectual call he became dramatist clever men in our day become journalists discerning in the stage the shortest literary cut to fame and fortune he can hardly be said to have possessed any strictly dramatic gift in any exception al degree but he had enough of all to make tolerable ﬁgure on the stage and was besides great poet and an admirable critic his poetry redeems the defects of his serious plays if we except such mere pièce circonstance amboyna the best of them have very bad faults but even the worst are impressed with the stamp of genius it is only in comedy that his failure is sometimes pg 98 pg 99 the project gutenberg ebook of the age of dryden by

constrained him to write plays if plays had not happened to be in fashion he was not born dramatic poet he had to be made one and he became one mainly in virtue of his eminent critical endowment his prefaces are most interesting study they exhibit the steady advance of slow strong sure mind from rudimentary conceptions to just views of the requi sites of dramatic poetry could well be attained in an age encumbered with venerable fallacies dryden s manly sense homely sagacity and piercing shrewdness break through many trammels when in the preface to all love he vindicates his breach of the conven tions of the french stage in that to troilus and cressida he compares shakespeare with fletc her and pronounces decidedly in favour of the former preference far from universal in his day the prefac to the spanish friar is the most remarkable of any and shows how much he had learned and unlearned we shall nevertheless ﬁnd his special glory in his character the most truly representative dramatist of his time otway might have been an elizabethan dryden never could if we seek the dramati c author to whom he is on the whole nearest of kin we may perhaps ﬁnd him in byron byron had more genuine dramatic vocation than dryden had but like dryden produced memorable works by force and ﬂexibility of genius from the theatrical point of view dryden s plays are greatly superior to byron s if the latter s rank higher literature the main cause is the existence of more favourable conditions dryden s worst faults would have been impossible in the nineteenth century and his treatment of the supernatural his frequent visitations of speculation and the lofty tone of his heroic passages prove that he could have drawn manfred cain or myrrha if he had lived like byron in renovated age chapter drama tic poets and pla ywrights after dryden the metrical dramatists of the restoration of other epochs may be accurately divided into two classes the poets and the playwrights was to be expected in

direst want by the generosity of the duchess of portsmouth this great play well the orphan he is said to have received hundred pounds the atheist second part of the soldier s fortune 1684 was probably unproductive and in april 1685 otway died on tower hill undoubtedly in distress although of the two accounts of his death that which ascribes it to fever caught in pursuing an assassin is better authenticated than the more usual one which represents him choked by loaf which he was devouring in state of ravenous hunger such story never theless could not have obtained credit if his circumstances had not been known to have been desperate it is not likely that he had much conduct or economy in his affairs or was endowed in any degree with the severer virtues the tone of his letters to barry however and the constancy of his seven years affection her seem to indicate natural reﬁnement of feeling and if there is truth in the dictum he best can paint them who can feel them

speaking otway s reputation rests entirely on his two great performances the orphan and venice preserved his other plays deserve special notice although don carlos which is said to have many years attracted larger audiences than either of his masterpieces might have been good play if it had not been written in rhyme the action is highly dramatic and the characters though artless are not ineffective but the pathos in which the poet excelled is continually disturbed by the bombastic couplets ever trembling on the brink of the ridiculous the remorse of philip after the murder of his wife and son is grotesque an instance of the forcible feeble could easily be found and is melancholy instance indeed of the declension of the english drama when contrasted with the demeanour of othello in similar circumstances otway however was yet to show that his faults were rather his age s than his own the fashion of rhyme must have had much to with the bombast of don carlos in the orphan his next effort in serious tragedy there is hardly any rant even when the situation might have seemed to have excused the exaggerated expression of emotion the central incident of this admirable deception of maiden beloved by two brothers through the personation of the favoured one by his now to be held to exclude it from the stage the objection would probably prove to be imaginary the play was performed late 1819 when less an actress than miss neill represented monimia and the diction is in general of quite exemplary propriety play of the period its principal defect work of art is that the pathos springs almost solely from the situation and that the personages have hardly any hold upon our sympathies except sufferers from an unhappy fatality so powerful is the situation

cold brilliant glitter wit gaiety heartlessness and proﬂigacy are the common notes of them all save that congreve has tragic power and well farquhar real feeling how far they painted or intended to

those of nation that devour ed pilgrim s progress brought up children and domestics by the whole duty of man and deposed king who meddled with the church were they even the manners of the gay world to some extent this is true but there is evidence enough that even fashionable men thought of something else than seducing their neighbours wives and daughters that the slips even of fashionable women were by means inordinately frequent or mere matters of course and that the standard of personal honour was much higher than would appear from the comedies we may be assisted to comprehend the real state of the matter by observing the condition of the french literature of ﬁction at this very moment anyone who should form his opinion of french people entirely from their novels could come to other conclusion than that they were entirely given up to the pursuit of illicit love and deemed nothing else worthy of the attention of rational creature yet we know that matter of fact the french nation does think of very different things that ridiculously small corner of actual life is conventionally made to stand the whole of it that the novels which profess to depict manners while accurate in their delineation of certain characters and certain phases would entirely mislead those whose notions should be solely derived from them it would be nearer the truth though still erroneous to take the reverse view and maintain that works composed the sake of amusement are more likely to usher the reader into an ideal world than to weary him with familiar scenes and incidents so far this is the case the english society of the seventeenth century must be acquitted at the expense of the dramatists who incur the obloquy of missing both the two great ends of comedy they neither delineate nor correct it possibly the unsatisfactory position which writers of so much wit and sense thus came to occupy may be partly accounted by the inﬂuence of ben jonson we have seen dryden almost hesitating to avow his preference shakespeare to jonson we shall see that butler has hesitation in asserting the superiority of jonson to shakespeare an obvious thing nor could it well be otherwise in so essentially prosaic an age this implies the triumph of the comedy of types over the comedy of nature jonson like mena nder impersonates particular characteristics or situations in life shakespeare paints human nature large it really is we have seen how the exhibition of these humours forms the staple of the comedy of shadwell the handling of congreve and his associates who had the example of molière before them is far superior but the principle is at bottom the same characteristic is incarnated in personage and often indicated by his very name instead of the names bestowed by fancy or borrowed from romance the benedicts rosalinds imogens mirandas we have witwoulds maskwells millamants and gibbets each character being thus more or less conventional the tout ensemble is necessarily conventional too and to this extent the world of these dramatists may be fairly regarded ideal while it is not true that they had any deﬁnite purpose of creating such world or that it was so dissimilar to actual society to interfere with the appreciation of the audience their works may be compared to the novels of geor ge meredith who would have been great comic writer if he had lived in the days of congreve one would call meredith s novels unnatural yet his works will convey but little notion of the english society of the nineteenth century to posterity who will only need to turn to george eliot and anthony trollope to realize it bygone age was ever realized before wycherley has been characterized by professor ward the timon of his stage and the description is excellent if not understo od of one animated by moral indignation at its immorality but of one impelled by temperament to insist upon and exaggerate its most disagreeable features the two most important of his plays the country wife and the plain dealer are rather than comedies especially the latter of which professor ward justly observes working within the limits of his own horizon with nothing perceptible to him but vicious world hateful on account of the palpable grossness of its outward pretences wycherley must be allowed to have worked with vigour and effect and to have produced what is indisputably one of the most powerful dramas of its its unpardonable sin is to be to great extent an adaptation of molière s misanthr ope and to pervert and brutalize whatever is most admirable in that pg 131 pg 132 pg 133 the project gutenberg ebook of the age of dryden by garnett https love in wood and the gentleman dancing master are comparatively slight performances but there is great humour in the representation in the latter of the disguised lover helped out of all his scrapes by the credulity of the young lady s father and his own rival whose business it is to detect him the delineation of the father merchant returned from long residence in spain enamoured of spanish manners and quoting the language at every second sentence is one of those which justify aubrey s remark that the dramatists of his age would be soon forgotten because their ephemeral humours would have ceased to be intelligible the character if still possible in wycherley s time ceased to be so very soon afterwards it must however have been popular if it gave or helped to give the nickname of don diego to the spaniards which survives to this day in dago the familiar appellation of south americans in the united states one characteristic of all wycherley s comedies should be mentioned their length which conﬁrms the impression that he composed with slowness when says hazlitt he got hold of good thing or sometimes even of bad one he was determined to make the most of it and might have said with dogberry had i the tediousness of king i could ﬁnd it in my heart to bestow it all upon your if wycherley is the satirist of restoration comedy congreve is its wit but at the same time he betrays vein of much deeper feeling than wycherley and notwithstanding the contrary opinion of hazlitt his characters appear to us more easily appreciated and more readily remembered his insight into women in particular is so considerable that it is real loss that he never attempted to paint noble one who would indeed have looked strangely amid the crowd of his heartless or frivolous or absurd people but whom he might have rendered true dramatic success both the double dealer and the way of the world border upon tragedy and suggest how much ﬁner things congreve might have written had the taste of his time allowed of tragedy in prose or if by treating ordinary domestic life in serious spirit even though in verse he could have taken the step that was afterwards taken by lillo he evidently felt conscious of innate tragic power and essayed heroic tragedy in the mourning bride where hampered by the conventionalities he dared not transgress he broke down with romantic plot romantic characters and stilted blank verse all things most repugnant to his genius johnson s praise of passage in this play the most poetical paragraph in the whole mass of english poetry and which is actually ﬁne enough to survive such extravagant laudation is well known it will be instructive to set it side by side with still ﬁner passage in modern tragedy examples of the classic and romantic schools of composition it is the strength and weakness of congreve that his thoughts are such would naturally have occurred to any one in the situation of his personages and that his sole part is to afford them digniﬁed expression while beddoes thoughts are the thoughts of poet and such might well appear fantastic and overstrained to an average audience

the occasional ﬂashes and strokes felicitous they are the unﬂagging verve energy and gaiety his plays are not of the kind that keep the audience in roar from ﬁrst to last but they never cease to stimulate the spirits the ﬁre does not always blaze but it never burns low there is not dull scene or tiresome or useless character the general tone of good breeding if it does not purify the pervading atmosphere of proﬂigacy at any rate prevents it from becoming offensive in verbal impropriety and double entendr congreve is even worse than wycherley but his plays are far from giving the same impression of thoroughly obnoxious state of society it is true that the pursuit of women seems the sole business of the men and the pursuit of men the business of half the women but the universal passion is so pleasantly variegated with extraneous humours and oddities that it is far from producing the monotony of modern french novel thus there is an amourette between brisk and lady froth in

comedy and stands some steps nigher to oblivion yet he is their equal in vis comica and their superior in stage workmanship he is writer at all says hazlitt to mere authorship but he makes up it by prodigious fund of comic invention and ludicrous description bordering upon caricature he has none of congreve s graceful reﬁnement and little of wycherley s serious manner and studious insight into the springs of character but his exhibition of it in dramatic contrast and situations where the different parties play upon one another s failings and into one another s hands keeping up the jest like game of battledore and shuttlecock and urging it to the utmost verge of breathless extravagance in the mere eagerness of the fray is beyond that of any other of our in hazlitt s opinion vanbrugh did not bestow much pains upon the construction of his pieces and their excellent dramatic effect is mainly to be attributed to his promptness in seizing upon the hints powerful situations which continually arose he went along he has nothing of the passion which pg 139 pg 140 the project gutenberg ebook of the age of dryden by garnett https raises congreve so near to the conﬁnes of tragedy nor has he the airy gaiety of farquhar but his animal spirits are abundant and unforced and his humour has true flemish exuberance his characters are always lively and well discriminated but the only type he can be said to have created is the model fop lord foppington in the relapse and even he is partly borrowed from etheredge s sir fopling flutter he is nevertheless most perfect portrait and gives real literary distinction to what would otherwise have been mere comedy of intrigue the powerful though disagreeable character of sir john brute lends force to the provoked wife and the unﬁnished journey to london is grounded on an idea which might have been very fruitful the country senator who has gone into parliament speculation but who upon taking up his residence in london ﬁnds that he loses more by the extravagance of his wife than he can gain by the prostitution of his vote vanbrugh s other plays are mere comedies of intrigu written without moral or immoral purpose the

promising scheme is said to be in danger of going souse into the water like the eddystone lighthouse or when an alarm is given by shouting thieves thieves murder popery another peculiarity of all these dramatists but especially farquhar is the constant use in serious passages of broken blank verse which continually seems upon the point of becoming regular syllabled iambic but never maintains this elevation any considerable space the extremely powerful scene between the two fainalls in congreve s love love example which borders closely upon tragedy is all but regular blank verse which if perfectly ﬁnished would be much better than the verse of the mourning bride it is difﬁcult to determine whether this was intentional or accidental possibly the exigencies of the performers had something to with it it is by means unlikely that prose well verse was then declaimed with more attention to rhythm than is now the custom in estimating the merits of these dramas it must never be forgotten point in their favour that they were written the stage and that success in the closet was quite secondary consideration with the authors on the other hand that they had the advantage of being produced when the histrionic art of england was probably at its zenith this notice of the later restoration comedy may be completed by the mention of three ladies who cultivated it with success during the latter part of the seventeenth century how much of this success in the case of one of them was due to merit and how much to indecency is difﬁcult though not in every sense of the term nice or delicate question despite the offensiveness of her writing s aphra behn whose maiden name was john son is personally sympathetic ﬁgure she was born in 1640 and girl went out with her family to surinam then an english possession she there made the acquaintance of the indian chief oroonoko and his bride imoinda afterwards celebrated in the novel by her upon which southern founded his popular play returning to england she married dutch merchant of the name of behn and after his death was sent spy to antwerp young dutchman to whom she was engaged died she was wrecked and nearly drowned upon her return to england and probably from necessity the english government appears to have refused to recompense or even to reimburse her turned novelist and playwright her novels will be noticed in another place her eighteen plays have with few exceptions sufﬁcient merit to entitle her to respectable place among the dramatists of her age and sufﬁcient indelicacy to be unreadable in this it may

three of them the busy body the wonder and bold stroke wife remained long upon the list of acting plays and might be represented even now chapter vii criticism the age of the restoration possessed many men qualiﬁed to shine in criticism but their acumen is in general only indicated by casual remarks and setting aside the metrical prolusions of roscommon and shefﬁeld nearly all the serious criticism it has bequeathed to us proceeds from the pen of dryde other of our poets except cole ridge and wordsworth has given us anything so critically valuable but dryden s principal service is one which they could not render even if their style had equalled this would be too much to say even of wordsworth could not have exerted the same wide and salutary inﬂuence dryden is entitled to be considered the great reformer of english prose the writer in whom the sound principles of the restoration were above all others impersonated and who above all others led the way to that clear sane and balanced method of writing which it was the especial mission of restoration literature to introduce we need only compare his style with milton s to be sensible of the enormous progress in the direction of perspicuity and general utility milton is far more eloquent writer but his style is totally unﬁt the close reasoning and accurate investigation which the pressure of politics and the developmen t of science and philosophy were soon to require and the rest of the prosaists of the time are with few exceptions either too pedantic or too commonplace dryden is lucid easy familiar yet he can be august and splendid on occasion and if he does not emulate milton s dithyrambic the dignity of english prose loses nothing in his hands take the opening of his dialogue on dramatic poesy it was that memorable day in the ﬁrst summer of the late war when our navy engaged the dutch day wherein the two most mighty and best appointed ﬂeets which any age had ever seen disputed the command of the greater half of the globe the commerce of nations and the riches of the universe while these vast ﬂoating bodie s on either side moved against each other in parallel lines and our countrymen under the happy conduct of his royal highness went breaking by little and little into the line of the enemies the noise of the cannon from both navies reached our ears about the city so that all men being alarmed with it and in dreadful suspense of the event which they knew was then deciding every one went following the sound his fancy led him and leaving the town almost empty some took towards the park some across the river others down it all seeking the noise in the depth of silence amongst the rest it was the fortune of eugenius crites lisideius and neander to be in company together three of them persons whom their wit and quality have made known to all the town and whom i have chose to hide under these borrowed names that they may not suffer by so ill relation i am going to make of their discourse taking then barge which servant of lisideius had provided them they made haste to shoot the bridge and left behind them that great fall of waters which hindered them from hearing what they desired after which having disengaged themselves from many vessels which rode at anchor in pg 148 pg 149 pg 150 the project gutenberg ebook of the age of dryden by garnett https thames and almost blocked up the passage towards greenwich they ordered the watermen to let fall their oars more gently and then every one favouring his own curiosity with strict silence it was not long ere they perceived the air to break about them like the noise of distant thunder or of swallows in chimney 8 those little undulations of sound though almost vanishing before they reached them yet still seeming to retain somewhat of their ﬁrst horror which they had betwixt the ﬂeets after they had attentively listened till such time the sound by little and little went from them eugenius lifting up his head and taking notice of it was the ﬁrst who congratulated to the rest that happy omen of our nation s victory adding that we had but this to desire in conﬁrmation of it that we might hear more of that noise which was now leaving the english this ﬁne induction can hardly have formed part of the original essay which dryden tells us was written in the country in 1665 since the naval battle which was fought on june 3rd 1665 is described having taken place in the ﬁrst summer of the late one extraordinary passage must have been left uncorrected by oversight at least we can not well suppose that dryden would have printed blank verse is acknowledged to be too low poem after the appearance of paradise lost which was published on the day after the conclusion of the peace of breda not then known in england the essay has two objects not very compatible to defend the english stage against the french and to advocate the use of rhyme in tragedy which necessarily gives the piece french air and makes it appear imitative when it is in truth original dryden points out with considerable force the restrictions which french dramatists of the classical school impose upon themselves by servile adherence to the unities of time and place and in known passage which does honour to his taste sets shakespeare above ben jonson his criticism of troilus and cressida in his essay on the grounds of criticism in tragedy 1679 is instructive illustrating by force of contrast that enlar ged view of shakespeare which we are indebted to goethe and coleridge he justly censures troilus and cressida play it does not occur to him that shakespeare may have intended satire all his essays which consist principally of prefaces and dedications to his own works are worth reading none more so than his defence of virgil in the dedication to his translation of his poems and the remarks on horace and juvenal in his essay on satir everywhere we must admire his sanity penetration and massive common sense his chief defects are conventional prejudice negligence when he ascribes the invention of blank verse to shakespeare and the parade of learning it may be said of his criticisms truly of his poems or plays that his merits are his own his faults those of his age another critic of the stage only deserves notice in this capacity from his connection with dryden thomas rymer will be mentioned again meritorious antiquary critic he is remarkable having by his tragedies of the last age 1673 drawn some judicious remarks from dryden and having analyzed othello pattern of bad play he has consequently been unanimously hooted by his countrymen it passes belief that pope should have praised him to spence though spence afﬁrms it it was his misfortune to be an englishman in france at the time his views would have been thought very correct in fact he criticises shakespeare much in the style of voltaire he is votary of decorum and dignity and would more than voltaire have let mouse into tragedy he discusses with imperturbable gravity who and who may kill one another with decency and decides in poetry woman is to kill man except her quality gives her the advantage above him poetical decency will not suffer death to be dealt to each other by such persons whom the laws of duel allow not to enter the lists together and r ymer would have been content to have dwelt in such decencies ever jeremy collier nonjuring clergyman attained fame not the advocate of decencies but of decency his short view of the immorality and profaneness of the english stage 1698 occasioned great sensation and was efﬁcacious in abating the evils against which it was directed although it is probable that addison s mild rebuke pg 151 pg 152 pg 153 the project gutenberg ebook of the age of dryden by garnett https better example accomplished even more the adversary of men of wit and genius collier has become obnoxious to their representatives and has been unfairly reviled sour fanatic in fact he is very moderate admits that the stage may be valuable medium of instruction and only denounces its abuse scott and macaulay have done him justice and gosse gives an excellent analysis of his work in his biography of congreve his wit is unquestionable his zeal but his argument is not everywhere equall y cogent on the chapter of profaneness he is fantastic and straitlaced and so tender of dignities that he will not allow even the god apis to be disrespectfully mentioned on that of immorality he is unanswerable and unless the incriminated dramatists were prepared to say evil be thou my good they could but own pudet haec opprobria nobis et dici potuisse et non potuisse congreve and vanbrugh attempted to reply but to little purpose dryden kissed the rod collier s volume is said to have been conceived disposed transcribed and printed in he had previously achieved notoriety jacobite pamphleteer and in his old age became the ofﬁcial head of the decaying sect of the nonjurors although richard bentley belongs mainly to the eighteenth century his dissertation upon the epistles of phalaris 1699 falls within the seventeenth and an account of the literary criticism of this age would be incomplete without some mention of the one critical work it produced there is need to tell again the story of the controversy so admirably narrated by macaulay and jebb but it may be observed here that it marks an in criticism the ﬁrst example of the testimony of antiquity being irretrievably overthrown by internal evidence it was not the ﬁrst time that the genuineness of attested ancient writings had been disputed valla had waged war upon the forged donation of constantine but his case was so very clear that he had not been answered but far possible ignored phalaris had found defenders and this controversy was perhaps the ﬁrst in which tradition and authority were fairly vanquished in pitched battle bentley s extraordinary powers of mind were almost equally evinced in his boyle lectur es also production of the seventeenth century which will be noticed in their place f t n t s an instance of the observation of nature unusual with dryden chimneys of the size required are unusual with us chapter viii philosophy from the criticism of books we pass by violent transition to the criticism of science the latter half of the seventeenth century is distinguished period in the history of english philosophy in it the most distinctively national of all systems which have obtained currency in this country was fully formulated it is remarkable that while both empirical and transcendental views in philosophy found supporters the champions of the latter comprised several illustrious names and that of the former only one while nevertheles s empiricism obtained complete triumph has ever been recorded in the history of opinion the principal reason doubt is the pg 154 8 pg 155 the project gutenberg ebook of the age of dryden by garnett https locke 1704 attractiveness to the solid homely understanding of the englishman of conclusions based on experience and common sense 9 but partly also to the fact that the illustrious man by whom the empirical philosophy was mainly upheld carried his speculations into practical life and became foremost among the defenders of civil and religious liberty if locke like his forerunner hobbes had employed his acuteness in defence of absolute power he would like hobbes have been caressed by the court but his doctrines would have been slighted by the nation john locke was born at wrington in the north of somerset august 29 1632 the same year that gave birth to spinoza his father an attorney was man of indepe ndent character and strong principle which he proved by accep ting commission in parliamentary regiment locke was elected to foundation scholarship at westm inster in 1647 and to studentship at christ church in he became in june 1658 was appointed greek lecturer in 1660 and held other college ofﬁces he wrote about this time two treatises yet unpublished one upon the roman commonwealth the other on the right of the civil magistrate to regulate indifferent matters touching the exercise of religion which under the inﬂuence of the hopes which moderate men entertained of the restoration government he was at the time inclined to allow having determined to study medicine he obtained in 1666 dispensation to enable him to hold his studentship and in the same year the decisive bias was given to his life by his acquainta nce with shaftesbury of whose family he became virtually member in the follow ing year shaftesbury was yet neither the shaftesbury of the cabal nor the shaftesbury of the popish plot and there was reason why locke should hesitate in attaching himself to statesman who whatever his astuteness and versatility possessed by far the most enlightened and comprehensive mind of any public man of his day the main bond which united the two was their agreement on the principle of toleration which chillingworth had been denounced and roger williams persecuted and which scarcely any one would then have subscribed an abstract proposition though cromwell had gone long way towards reducing it to practice inﬂuenced probably by shaftesbury locke drew up in 1667 an essay on toleration the ﬁrst draft of his subsequent celebrated work and which has itself been retrieved from oblivion by fox bourne conside ring the circumstances of the times it can excite neither surprise nor censure that he should have argued in favour of denying the privileges of toleration to those who denied them to others to roman catholics two years later he drew up at shaftesbury s instance constitution the colony of carolina in which shaftesbury was largely interested his medical skill was exerted in relieving shaftesbury from the effects of serious complaint and he acquitted himself successfully in yet more delicate undertaking the choosing wife his son he also attended profe ssionally at the birth of shaftesbury s grandson the future author of characteristics these services were ﬁtly recompensed by secretaryships both at the great seal and at the board of trade but there is not the slightest proof of his having participated in any of his patron s plots while it is not too much to say that the steady regard entertained shaftesbury by man like locke affords the strongest of all presumption s that this enigmatical personage was after all patriot during three and half stormy years locke was in france the beneﬁt of his health making observations on the culture of the vine and olive and noting under the external splendour of louis s reign symptoms of that distress among the industrial classes which was to issue in the revolution returning he found his patron just liberated from the tower and their intimate relations continued until shaftesbury s ﬂight to holland in november 1682 followed by his death in the succeeding january locke was thus mark the suspicions and animosities of the triumphant court party his usual place of residence was now oxford where he still enjoyed his christ church studentship and curious letters are extant from dean prideaux avowing practices akin to espionage but admitting that john locke is so close man and his servant such phœnix of discretion that nothing can be made out locke wisely withdrew to holland about the autumn of 1683 and in november 1684 was arbitrarily ejected from his studentship by royal mandate he employed his exile in forming friendships with limborch le clerc and other distinguished men in compo sing his famous letter on toleration published pg 156 pg 157 pg 158 the project gutenberg ebook of the age of dryden by garnett https in 1689 and in active communication with william and mary when the deliverer s expedition was ﬁnally determined upon he came to england with mary in 1689 and received the most ﬂattering offers of important diplomatic posts which he declined on account of the weakness of his health he accepted however small appointment but his principal public services were rendered referee on the various important questions submitted to him by government and man of letters having nearly reached the age of sixty without publishing anything of importance he produced within ten years the series of unadorned tracts which have made him alike in the regions of philosophy and of politics the most conspicuous representative of masculine unimaginative english common sense the letter on toleration already mentioned had appeared anonymously in holland in in 1690 the essay on the human understanding was published and also the two treatises on government the ﬁrst reply to filmer the advocate of divine right composed in professor fowler s opinion between 1680 and 1685 the second written during the last years of locke s residence in holland the letter on toleration the authorship of which was not acknowledged during locke s lifetime was followed by three defences against assailants two of which appeared respectively in 1690 and 1692 the third was posthumous the essay on the human understanding adopted from the ﬁrst at trinity college dublin but ineffectually proscribed in the writer s own university called forth criticisms from norris of bemerton to which locke replied in two essays allowed to remain unpublished during his life he said i love not controversy he could not however avoid controversy with john edwards and bishop stillingﬂeet on his reasonableness of christianity 1695 after writing ﬁve pamphlets locke ultimately remained in possession of the ﬁeld the drift of opinion being entirely in his favour though few of the ofﬁcial ministers of religion ventured to come forward openly in his defence the treatise on education 1693 written at the request of william molyneux excited comparatively little controversy another very important class of the productions of his afﬂuent maturity were those on trade and ﬁnance by which he rendered the utmost service to the state by his considerations on the value of money 1691 and other tracts he contributed largely to the reform of the currency the condition of which had become intolerable but was in great danger of being corrected by remedies worse than the disease several other publications contributed to disseminate enlightened views on trade manufactures and the interest of money he could not always be right it is both painful and ludicrous to ﬁnd so wise and good man obliged ex ofﬁcio commissioner of trade to ﬁnd reasons discouraging the woollen manufacture in ireland which swift seems to ridicule in describing the laputan philosophers who had devised means to remove the wool from sheep s back and hoped shortly to propagate the breed of naked sheep over the kingdom this nevertheless is but slight inconsistency with the general tenor of locke s views on economical subjects which less than his political and religious convictions tended irresistibly towards unrestricted freedom in 1700 he was released from public life and spent his few remain ing years undisturbed by controversy in the socie ty of the amiable family of sir francis masham of high laver essex of whose house he had long been an inmate lady masham singularly enough was the daughter of ralph cudworth the great english champion of the ideal school of philosophy and therefore far removed possible from locke in opinion he died on october 28 locke s intellectual character must be considered along with his writings of his moral character it may justly be said that english writer of equal eminence stands so high butler and berkeley may have been equally faultless and the latter doubt possessed more of the spell of personal fascination but neither was like locke exposed to the storms of corrupt and factious age neither was called upon to encounter such perils and make such sacriﬁces neither had the same opportunity of exercising fortitude in adversity and moderation in success whether public patriot or private frien d locke appears spirit without spot and his resolute temper his intellectual ardour and his brilliant achievements effectually preserve him from the insipidity which so frequently mars the moral physiognomies of good men his countenance indeed is not illumined by pg 159 pg 160 the project gutenberg ebook of the age of dryden by garnett https spirituality of channing but the robuster virtues stand forth in even bolder relief and his apparent exemption from the minor failings which beset even newton is the more remarkable he wanted neither enemies nor biographers locke s great work philosopher is the essay on the human understanding the best chart of the human mind says hallam one of the great representative books of the world in locke in his predecessor hobbes were united two endowments rarely combined the sturdy prosaic common sense of the man of the world and the dexterity and subtlety of the practised logician in his utter antipathy to everything in the slightest degree illumined or he would have thought distorted by the glamour of imagination or fancy locke was the true representative of his age and subsequent change of mental attitude the world sweeps on into new and more genial climates of thought can deprive his work of its representative historical importance nor is this all locke s treatise was almost the ﬁrst investigatio n of the mind which took note of facts and was not purely metaphysical it was also the ﬁrst in which this study took leading place the science which we now call psychology or the study of mind says fowler had hitherto amongst modern writers been almost exclusively subordinated to other branches of speculation locke was the ﬁrst of modern writers to attempt at once an independent and complete treatment of the phenomena of the human mind of their mutual relations of their causes and limits this task he undertakes not in the dogmatic spirit of his predecessors but in the critical spirit which he may be said almost to have inaugurated and the effect of his candour on his ﬁrst readers must have been enhanced by the fact not always favourable to his precision that far he can he throws aside the technical terminology of the schools and employs the language current in the better kinds of ordinary literature and the society of his in fact was said of socrates he brought philosophy down from heaven to earth and this service and the great inﬂuence which his work produced upon the future development of philosophy are perhaps stronger claims to permanent distinction than the merits of theory which can never be overlooked but can never again command the almost universal assent which it received in its own day the application of physiology to psychological research implicitly at all events advocated by locke has produced results of which neither he nor his opponents dreamed the central point of his philosophy is the denial of innate ideas the mind is to him tabula rasa sheet of blank paper and all the ideas which have been thought inherent in it are the result of experience in sense we now know this to be true but we also know this experience not to be the experience of the individual but of the race or rather say of sentient existence ages inconceivably remote it follows that although locke may be abstractedly right in denying the possibility of the acquisition of ideas except through experience yet practically everyone comes into the world with host of ideas derived from his ancestors connate if not innate and that so far from the human mind resembling sheet of blank paper it is more like palimpsest inscribed and reinscribed ad inﬁnitum it also follows that the discrepancies of mankind respecting points of morality not locke thought disprove the existence of an ideal rule of right everyone must necessarily be born with inherited instincts by which such rule is more or less deﬂected or obscured in fact locke and his adversaries were both partly right and partly party in denying intuition the other in deﬁning it neither had found or at that period could have found the real key to the difﬁculty but it is to the immortal honour of locke that all real advance in psychology has been effected by working in his spirit of observation and induction rather than by the priori method of his opponents the third and fourth books of the essay on words and on knowledge contain but little controversial matter and are chieﬂy devoted to illustrating the imperfection of human faculties especially language the necessity clear and deﬁnite conceptions and the countless impediments in the way of truth three others among locke s writings are regarded classical on the reasonableness of christianity and on education and his letters on toleration the reasonableness of christianity 1695 is from one point of view an endeavour to render christianity reasonable by eliminating its corruptions from another an attempt to establish it on the basis of fulﬁlled prophecy and miracle in both respects it was admirably adapted to the pg 161 pg 162 pg 163 the project gutenberg ebook of the age of dryden by garnett https sentiment of locke s own day and although warmly attacked by stillingﬂeet exerted great inﬂuence upon the theology of the eighteenth century in our time the point of view has shifted so far to expose locke to the full weight of martineau s terse criticism the afﬁdavit has become the its historical importance however can never be impaired any more than that of the admirable letters on toleration which seem commonplace because they are now esteemed irrefragable it was otherwise in his own time and long afterwards their principal literary defects are that they are too polemical and too long of all locke s works some thoughts concerning education is perhaps the most universally approved and it is in truth golden treatise the very incarnation of good sense and right feeling and more useful in its own time than it can be now that the errors which locke especially assailed have become contrary instead of congenial to the general spirit of the age the prevailing tone the conﬁdence in human nature rightly treated the abhorrence of the merely arbitrary and despotic render the work an epoch in the history of culture and compared with the coarse maxims of defoe or even the whole duty of man s exclusive reliance upon authority show how greatly locke was beyond his contempo raries in enlightenment and the genuin spirit of humanity the insight and penetration into children s characters are surprising in man who had children of his own or much direct concern with the educatio n of the children of others they prove that locke must have been most careful and accurate observer if there is fault in the treatise it is that the range of view is not always sufﬁciently wide and that the author s precepts are too exclusively propoun ded with reference to the individual and too little with view to the general advantage of society the disuse of latin composition example would have done little personal harm to the majority of the individual boys of whom locke is thinking but in his day at all events would have lowered the standard of culture throughout europe in general however locke s remarks are characterized by the soundest common sense and there is perhaps other production of the age so thoroughly in harmony with its pervading spirit in sharp contrast to locke and his school stand the small knot of cambridge platonists and their henry more culverwell cumberland glanvil and

against puritan disparagement of sweetness and light he had difﬁculty in conforming to the restoration and accepting living from archbishop sheldon but his life was mainly spent in his study in the production of vast folios where the ingots of philosophy lay stored while locke s current coin passed nimbly from hand to hand the contrast between the men and the systems is complete at every point and it is assuredly one of the strangest ironies of fate that cudworth s daughter should have become the good angel of locke s old age cudworth is doubt by much the more attractive ﬁgure to imaginative minds but it must be conceded an indisputable truth that his way of thinking could not possibly have produced nearly so much good have so profoundly leavened men s ideas on legislation and education or have so contributed to build up the national character sound common sense this admitted cudworth may be heartily praised sublime and reﬁned thinker epithets inappropriate to locke his

of two very dissimilar books the vanity of dogmatizing 1660 and saducismus triumphatus 1681 published after his death with additions by more horneck and others the former book though containing evidence of original power of thought is remarkable an evidence of the inﬂuence of bacon in overthrowing the authority of aristo tle its idolatry of descartes its many curious anticipations not originating with glanvil of modern discoveries above all its testimony of the ardent scientiﬁc curiosity then fermenting in england and about to issue in the establishment of the royal society

filmer cavalier written about the end of the civil war but published at period which brings it within the scope of this volume filmer though not man of conspicuous mental power was able to discern that the right of the nation to resist the arbitrary encroachments of charles could not well be disputed so long it continued to be held that mankind is naturally endowed and born with freedom from all subjection and at liberty to choose what form of government it please and that the power which any one man hath over others was at ﬁrst bestowed according to the discretion of pg 166 pg 167 9 pg

royal authority over the children of other patriarchs filmer does not explain and it seems obvious on his own showing that either this latter autho rity does not exist in which case there must be many monarchies families or that it exists in virtue of mutual contract among individual families so that royal authority derives from the people after all illogical however filmer might be his views were too agreeable to the court and to the supporters of absolute power not to ﬁnd much encouragement and men of powers found it necessary to take the ﬁeld against them seldom indeed has writer of such slender abilities made so much stir or unintentionally laid the cause of liberty and reason under such deep obligations measure of his own qualiﬁcations it is sufﬁcient to state that he seriously takes samuel s dissuasion of the israelites from setting up monarchy on the ground of the oppressions to which they would subject themselve s luminous exposition of the rights of the sovereign and the

their polemic and the obligation under which it has placed posterity must of necessity be ill appreciated by an age which ﬁnds it difﬁcult to believe that filmer could ever be thought to require an answer the propositions that the ﬁrst man was invested by heaven with monarchical privileges and that these privileges had in some manner devolved on king charles seem to us so palpably absurd that locke himself appears chargeable with folly having spent his time in refuting them the steady intellectual upheaval which has been going on ever since the revival of letters has lifted us into region where the conceptions of divine right and can not live and we are inclined to attribute to the improvement of our understandings what really proceeds from the alteration of our environment ideas baseless filmer s are now daily advanced and daily combated by opponents whose services will one day be requited by the neglect that has overtaken locke had locke been wit he might indeed have immortalized himself and his antagonist together but although he can and does make the latter ridiculous he can not make him amusing there is more vitality in the second of his two tracts on government this in part deals with speculative questions regarding the origin of civil society yet unsettled and therefore not yet commonplace locke deduces the mutual relations and obligations of rulers and ruled from contract which he supposes to have been entered into in the infancy of society the theory was highly salutary the age abolishing all superstitious notions of divine right and providing sufﬁcient justiﬁcation popular resistance to evil rulers it must be owned however that it lacked the only safe basis of theory the historical the constitutions of uncivilized man were little known in locke s day and the better known they have become the less afﬁnity they have seemed to present to the parliament which his imagination transported back from westminster to shinar his essay nevertheless represents necessary phase in the development of opinion and exerted the most beneﬁcial inﬂuence in generating the enlightened political sentiment of the eighteenth century it is amusing to remark that in spite of the israelites locke stoutly refuses his imaginary society the right to contract itself out of its freedom by establishing an absolute monarchy the only form of governme nt which according to his opponents could be legitimate in any sense algernon sidney s discourse on government has attracted less attention than locke s mainly because it claims more so elaborate and ambitious work was not required to crush filmer who had in fact been crushed by locke some years before the appearance of sidney s belated refutation it is nevertheless more interesting work than

in the west of england elected member wiltshire he sided with the more extreme party and was one of the king s judges he became member of the council of state and at the beginning of 1651 was sent to ireland second in authority to ireton whom he assisted in completing the subjugation of the country and subsequently ﬁlled the same position under fleetwood bitterly opposed to cromwell s protectorate he resigned his civil appointment but contrived to retain his military position until 1655 when coming over to england he was arrested and imprisoned in beaumaris castle when at length he was admitted to an audience of cromwell what asked the protector can you desire more than you have that which we fought replied ludlow that the nation might be governed by its own consent which recall augereau s

occasionally molested by plots against his life or liberty until his death in the revolution of 1688 had brought him back to england an instant but the public feeling against regicides was still too strong and returning to his refuge at vevay he carved over his door omne solum forti patria quia ludlow was not one of the greatest or wisest characters of his time but is one of the most estimable in

men who had been sharers with him in the usurped authority were exceedingly troubled whilst all other parties rejoiced at it each of them hoping that this alteration would prove advantageous to their affairs the commonwealthsmen were so charitable to believe that the soldiery being delivered from their servitude to the general to which they were willing to attribute their former complia nce would

opportunity of advancing their minion who had been long endeavouring to unite all the corrupt interests of the nation to his party but neither the sense of their duty nor the care of their own safety nor the just apprehensions of being overcome by their irreconcilable enemy could prevail with the army to return to their proper station so that having tasted of sovereignty under the shadow of their late master they resolved against the restitution of the parliament and in order to this it was agreed to proclaim richard cromwell eldest son of oliver protector of the commonwealth in hopes that he who by following his pleasures had rendered himself unﬁt public business would not fail to place the administration of the government in the hands of those who were most powerful in the army accordingly the proclamation was published in westminster at and at the old exchange with few expressions of joy had ever been observed on the like occasion this being done the council issued out orders to the ofﬁcers of civil justice to act by virtue of their old commissions till new ones could be sent to them and that nothing might be omitted to fortify the new government various means were

hall that the light they gave seemed like the rays of the sun by all which he was represented to be now in state of glory this folly and profusion so far provoked the people that they threw dirt in the night on his escutcheon that was placed over the great gate of somerset house i purposely omit the rest of the pageantry the great number of persons that attended on the body the procession to westminster the vast expense in mourning the state and magniﬁcence of the monument erected him with many other things that i care not to remember william lilly the astrologer to be discussed more fully among the writers of personal memoirs claims few words here the author of an account of charles whose justice and liveliness would have met more general recognition but the author s character and if it had not been mingled with the apparently serious exposition of idle prophecies respecting the white king so long he keeps clear of the occult lilly is shrewd and discriminating well highly entertaining writer his enumeration of individual traits in charles s character is correct and instructive and free from any misleadin g bias he was in fact whose main purpose was to stand well with the powers that were and whose sketch of charles would have worn another aspect if he had written after the restoration but this frame of mind at all events exempts him from political passion nor does his complacency carry him to the length of misrepresentation much less calumny he is destitute of the literary power which would have enabled him to fuse single traits into an harmonious character but he has supplied others with very valuable material towards such an undertaking one merit the book certainly possesses in an eminent measure it is one of the most readable in the language the following passage indicates the author s real insight into charles s attractive but inﬁrm character and adversary he is his remarkable agreem ent with clarendon of whose work he had knowledge he had much of in all that he did and most difﬁcult thing it was to hold him close to his own promise or word he was apt to recede unless something therein appeared compliable either unto his own will proﬁt or judgment so that some foreign princes bestowed on him the character of most false prince and one that never kept his word unless his own advantage had his judgment been sound his conception was quick and nimble he had been most accomplished gentleman and though in most dangerous results and extraordinary serious consultations and very material either state or commonwealth he would himself give the most solid advice and sound reasons why such or such thing should be so or not so yet was he most easily withdrawn from his own most wholesome and sound advice or resolutions and with much facility drawn on inclined to embrace far more unsafe and nothing so wholesome counsel he would argue logically and frame his arguments artiﬁcially yet never almost had the happiness to conclude or drive on design in his own sense but was ever bafﬂed with meaner capacities he feared nothing in this world or disdained any thing more than the convention of parliament the very name was bugbear unto him he was ever refractory against the summoning of parliament and willingly would embrace an opportunity to break it off this his averseness being well known to some grave members they contrived at last by wit and the necessity of the times that his hands were fast tied up in granting triennial sitting or perpetuity it were unto this present parliament thing he often blamed himself subscribing unto and often those who importuned him bulstrode whitelocke has few pretensions to rank man of letters but his memorials are far too valuable source of historical information to be omitted from survey of the literature of the period the author barrister and templar was elected to pg 188 pg 189 the project gutenberg ebook of the age of dryden by garnett https long parliament in 1641 and appointed chairman of the committee drawing up the charges against straf ford he held various ofﬁces under the parliament and was employed in negotiations with charles of whose execution he disapproved he was subsequently member of the council of state and one of the commissioners of the great seal in 1653 he was sent on an embassy to sweden which he has described in valuable work during the confused period between the death of cromwel l and the restoration he was successively commissioner of the great seal and member of the council of state he had some difﬁculty in obtaining pardon at the restoration but ultimately charles ii admitted him to his presence and received him graciously with speech which whitelocke s biographer thinks extraordinary but which appears very sensible mr whitelocke go into the country don t trouble yourself any more about state affairs and take care of your wife and your sixteen whitelocke proﬁted by the royal admonition and died at good old age his memorials extend from 1625 to 1659 and are valuable body of materi al being most of the time diurnal record of all occurrences of importance they are the student of history s indispensable companion the period but aim at more exalted position in literature than that of matter fact register another diarist of similar description to whitelocke but not like him busy actor in the scenes which he describes is narcissus luttrell scion of the known family of luttrell of dunster somersetshire luttrell who was man of literary and antiquarian tastes and the collec tor of the luttrell ballads now in the british museum kept diary from 1675 to 1714 which attracted little attention until macaulay s frequent references to the induced the university of oxford to publish it in leaving diarists out of account the most important writer of historical mem oirs after ludlow is sir william temple whose memoirs treat of his own political career from 1672 to temple the son of an irish judge entered the diplomatic service after the restoration under the auspices of arlington and soon found himself minister at brussels while occupying that post it was his good fortune to perform one of the most creditable diplomatic achievements on record the negotiation of the triple alliance between england holland and sweden which checked the conquests of louis and but the venality and faithlessness of charles would have long secured peace to europe when temple s work was undone he retired into private life but the failure of charles s disgraceful policy brought him again into diplo macy and his memoirs down to 1679 are occupied with foreign affairs in 1677 he had rendered his country one of the greatest services that any man ever did by bringing about in conjunction with danby the marriage of william of orange with the princess mary and in 1679 he found himself to his discomfort and if wise serpent he was timid ged with the mission of reconciling king and people who from the discovery of charles s baseness in accep ting pension from france seemed on the verge of entire estrangement temple attempted to attain this end by the creation of council of thirty advisers perpetual check upon the king s actions the scheme might have succeeded if thirty disinterested politicians had been forthcoming but the entire kingdom could barely have furnished the number requisite the redemption of sodom temple s memoirs give lively picture of the mortiﬁcations he underwent he gradually dwindled into cipher but the modern reader will prefer to study the story in macaulay s famous essay which if exaggerated in his expression of scorn temple s irresolution is not unfair statement of fact at length he escaped to his books and gardens and spent the rest of his life in the enjoyment of character consummate statesmanship which he took care never to bring to the test wisdom and virtue he certainly did possess but both with him were too much of the order his claims to rank restorer of english prose are better founded though these too have been exaggerated johnson s assertion that temple was the ﬁrst writer who attended to cadence in english prose merely evinces how completely the power of appreciating the grand harmonies of the elizabethan period had died out in the eighteenth century he must notwithstanding be allowed an honourable place among those who have rendered english prose lucid symmetrical and adapted business and macaulay has justly pointed out that the pg 190 pg 191 pg 192 the project gutenberg ebook of the age of dryden by garnett https length of his sentences is mainly matter of punctuation the elegance of the writer and the egotistic caution of the man are excellently represented by the concluding passage of his memoirs upon the survey of all these circumstances conjunctions and dispositions both at home and abroad i concluded in cold blood that i could be of further use or service to the king my master and my country whose true interests i always thought were the same and would be both in danger when they came to be divided and that reason had ever endeavoured the uniting them and had compassed it if the passions of some few men had not lain fatally in the way so to raise difﬁculties that i saw plainly were never to be surmounted therefore upon the whole i took that ﬁrm resolution in the end of the year 1680 and the interval between the westminster and oxford parliaments never to charge myself more with any public employments but retiring wholly to private life in that posture take my fortune with my country whatever it should prove which man can judge in the variety of accidents that attend human affairs and the chances of every day to which the greatest lives well actions are subject so i shall not trouble myself so much to conjecture fata viam inveniant besides all these public circumstances i considered myself in my own humour temper and dispositions which man may disguise to others though very hardly but can not to himself i had learned by living long in courts and public affairs that i was ﬁt to live longer in either i found the arts of court were contrary to the frankness and openness of my nature and the constraints of public business too great the liberty of my humour and my life the common and proper ends of both are the advancement of men s fortunes and that i never minded having much i needed and which is more i desired the talent of gaining riches i ever despised observing it to belong to the most despisable men in other kinds and i had the occasions of it so often in my way if i would have made use of them that i grew to disdain them man does meat that he has always before him therefore i never could go to service nothing but wages nor endure to be fettered in business when i thought it was to purpose i knew very well the arts of court are to talk the presen t language to serve the present turn and to follow the present humour of the prince whatever it is of all these i found myself so incapable that i could not talk language i did not mean nor serve turn i did not like nor follow any man s humour wholly against my own besides i have had in twenty years experience enough of the uncertainty of princes the caprices of fortune the corruption of ministers the violence of factions the unsteadi ness of counsels the inﬁdelity of friends nor i think the rest of my life enough to make any new experiments the ease of my own life if i know myself it will be inﬁnitely more in the retired than it has been in the busy scene good man can with any satisfaction take part in the divisions of his country that knows and considers i what they have cost athens rome constantinople florence germany france and england nor can the wisest man foresee how ours will end or what they are like to cost the rest of christendom well ourselves i never had but two aims in public affairs one to see the king great he may be by the hearts of his people without which i know not how he can be great by the constitutions of this kingdom the other in case our factions must last yet to see revenue established the constant maintaining ﬂeet of ﬁfty men of war at sea or in harbour and the seamen in constant pay which would be at least our safety from abroad and make the crown still considered in any foreign alliances whether the king and his parliaments should agree or not in undertaking any great or national war and such an establishment i was in hopes the last parliament at westminster pg 193 the project gutenberg ebook of the age of dryden by garnett https have agreed in with the king by adding so much of new fund to three hundred thousand pounds year out of the present customs but these have both failed and i am content to have failed with them and so i take leave of all those airy visions which have so long busied my head about mending the world and at the same time of all those shining toys or follies that employ the thoughts of busy men and shall turn mine wholly to mend myself and far consists with private condition still pursuing that old and excellent counsel of pythagoras that we are with all the cares and endeavours of our lives to avoid diseases in the body perturbations in the mind luxury in diet factions in the house and seditions in the chapter xi aut obiography and biography two private diarists whose autobiographic records remained unknown to their contemporaries have justly obtained classic rank by the publication of their records in the nineteenth century one of these samuel pepys stands incontestably at the head of the world s literature in his own department john evelyn possessing neither the humour the naïveté the shrewdness or the uncompromisi ng frankness of his rival and friend occupies much lower place an autobiographer though more highly endowed scholar and man of letters born in 1620 of prosperous county family whos fortune had been made by the manufacture of gunpowder he found himself an idle young templar at the outbreak of the civil war three days service in the royal army sufﬁced him and in 1643 he obtained the king s permission to travel this does not seem very heroic conduct but the family estate lying at wotton near dorking was probably in the actual occupation of the parliamentarians he remained abroad until 1647 and his notes on art and antiquity are among the most valuable portions of his diary study and gardening were his chief occupations under the commonwealth varied with some cautious intriguing on behalf of the exiled king under the restoration he was in great favour and although taking part in politics ﬁlled several honourable public ofﬁces sincere churchman he was greatly alarmed by james s illegalities and acquiesced in the revolution necessary evil in 1695 he was appointed treasurer to greenwich hospital he died in the general view of his character is that expressed by leslie stephen who describes him the typical instance of the accomplished and gentleman of the the chief dissentient from this favourable estimate is person of weight quincey who in conversation with woodhouse violently attacks evelyn s diary three years after its publication weak nothing little book much praised by weak people and abuses the author shallow empty cowardly vain assuming coxcomb mere literary fribble fop and smatterer affecting natural history and polite there is just this much of truth in this splenetic onslaught that evelyn was an amateur in authorship and that his high character and inﬂuential friendships doubt contributed much to the esteem with which the works published in his lifetime were regarded in his day the diary stands on different footing it appealed to remote and impartial public and the appeal has been justiﬁed by edition after edition evelyn s claims to literary distinction rest principally upon his diary and his sylva which will be noticed in another place the chief literary merits of the diary are its unassuming simplicity and perfect perspicuity of style and phrase inﬁnitely less pg 194 pg 195 pg 196 the project gutenberg ebook of the age of dryden by garnett https than pepys s it has the advantage of covering much more extensive period and faithfully reﬂecting the feelings of loyal pious sensible englishman at various important crises of public affairs unlik pepys whose estimates of men and things are very ﬂuctuating evelyn is consistent and we may feel sure that any modiﬁcation of sentiment that may be observed in him faithfully represents the inevitable inﬂuence of circumstances upon man of independent judgment his personal loyalty to the house of stuart is manifestly cooled though not chilled by the scandals of charles s reign but it is not until church and king come into open conﬂict in the reign of jame s ii that evelyn gives any countenance to violent change of government which it is clear he would most willingly have avoided the extreme caution and moderation of his language lend weight to his disapprobation and indicate more forcibly than any vigour of declamation how completely james had alienated his true friends evelyn s position was that of one who could neither lift hand against the government or stretch one out to defend it his unaffected style almost rises into poetry he succinctly enumerates the omens which heralded the downfall of james october the king s birthday guns from the tower usual the sun eclipsed at its rising this day signal the victory of william the conqueror against harold near battel in sussex the wind which had been hitherto west was east all this day wonderful expectation of the dutch ﬂeet public prayers ordered to be read in the churches against the interest of the early part of the diary is of different kind it is occupied with the author s continental travels and shows what was thought best worth seeing in that age with many curious incidental traits of manners and examples of the hardships and perils with which wayfarers were then beset always we have to lament that the traveller was in that day so much of mere sightseer and took so little pains to acquaint himself with the moral intellectual or industr ial life of the nations he visited this was the universal failing of the age and of all preceding ages not until the eighteenth century we meet with really philosophical traveller evelyn however is not insensible to humanity when it is thrust upon his attention and his study of painting in his youth and the taste arboriculture which produ ced his sylva qualify him beyond most of his contemporaries the description of the aspects of nature the feeling nature and the feeling humanity are well combined in the following passage we went then to visit the galleys being about in number the capitaine of the galley royal gave us most courteous entertainment in his cabin the slaves in the interim playing both loud and soft music very rarely then he showed how he commanded their motions with nod and his whistle making them row out the spectacle was to new and strange to see so many hundreds of miserably naked persons their heads being shaven close and having only high red bonnets pair of coarse canvass drawers their whole backs and legs naked doubly chained about their middle and legs in couples and made fast to their seats and all commanded in trice by an imperious and cruel seaman one turk amongst the rest he much favoured who waited on him in his cabin but with other dress than the rest and chain locked about his leg but not coupled this galley was richly carved and gilded and most of the rest were very beautiful after bestowing something on the slaves the capitaine sent band of them to give us music at dinner where we lodged i was amazed to contemplate how these miserable caitif fs lie in their galley crowded together yet there was hardly one but had some occupation by which leisure and calms permitted they got some little money insomuch some of them have after many years cruel servitude been able to purchase their liberty the and at their oar is miserable spectacle and the noise of their chains with the roaring of the beaten waters has something of strange and fearful in it to one unaccustomed to it they are ruled and chastised by pg 197 pg 198 the project gutenberg ebook of the age of dryden by garnett https on their backs and soles of their feet on the least disorder and without the least humanity yet are they cheerful and full of knavery evelyn s diary however with all its desert sinks into insigniﬁcance beside the diary of samuel pepys but the same remark applies to almost every diary in the world pepys s diary has been frequently compared with boswell s life of johnson and with justice in so far the charm of each arises from the inimitable naïveté of the author s revelations boswell had much greater character than his own to draw but pepys had to be his own johnson it is giving him excessive praise to say that he makes himself interesting johnson and boswell together there can not be stronger proof of the inﬁnite interest and importance of humanity that when we once get to depict himself he really is the most trivial details become matters of serious concern we sympathize with pepys we sympathize with ulysses and are the time much more anxious about the liquidation of his tailor s bill or the adjustment of his misunderstandings with his wife than what the swede intends or what the the only drawback is that the pepys in whom we are so deeply interested is after all not altogether the true pepys not the distinguished civil servant or the intelligent promoter of science not the man he appeared to his friends and contemporaries but an incarnation of whatever was petty or ludicrous or in man of inconsiderable ofﬁcial and intellectual distinction very worthy industrious and curious person says evelyn universally beloved hospitable generous learned in many things skilled in music very great cherisher of learned men of whom he had the all these traits are abundantly conﬁrmed by passages in the diary and yet so inﬁnitely more vivid is the delineation of the writer s foibles that one attempting to draw his character from the diary would hardly have noticed them pepys s life is chieﬂy remarkable the extraordinary good fortune which raised him from an humble and precarious position to one in which he was enabled to render great service to his country the son of london tailor whose family came from brampton in huntingdonshire he had the good fortun to be distantly related to sir edward montagu afterwards earl of sandwich one of the chief agents in the restoration to whose patronage he owed everything sizar and scholar at cambridge he married somewhat early and imprudently accompanied his patron when he went admiral to the sound in 1658 and upon his return appears to have ﬁlled an inferior clerkship in the exchequer the restoration brought him into the admiralty and long after his history is one of rapid rise and increasing wealth mainly acquired by means which would now be thought most reprehensible in civil servant but which the lax ofﬁcial morality of his day absolved or but faintly condemned in 1669 the weakness of his eyes compelled him to discontinue his diary and to solicit leave of absence from ofﬁcial duty on tour in france and holland shortly after his return he lost his wife whose leaning to the roman catholic religion gave colour to charge against himself of being concealed romanist the object of which was to invalidate his election to parliament aldborough these proceedings failed but in 1679 he was imprisoned short time on an accusation of being concerned in the popish plot and notwithstanding the absurdity of the charge found it advisable to withdraw while from the admiralty he was reinstated in 1684 having in the interim made voyage to tangier on public business under james who understood naval affairs and knew the worth of pepys he attained to great inﬂuence and the navy to this day is deeply indebted to him the improvements he introduced into its administration he lost his employments at the revolution and retired to life of scholarly leisure dying in in 1684 he had become president of the royal society of which he had been one of the earliest members and long after his retire ment the members continued to meet at his house pepys bequeathed his library to magdalen college cambridge where it is preserved in exactly the same condition he left it the immortal diary was among the books but attracted notice until about it was shortly afterwards deciphered by the rev smith and published in 1825 by lord braybrooke who omitted much of the most racy and characteristic part below the dignity of history these omissions were principally supplied in the edition of the rev mynors bright 1875 and henry wheatley is now pg 199 pg 200 pg 201 the project gutenberg ebook of the age of dryden by garnett https an edition absolutely complete with the exception of some few passages positively unprintable work of the kind in the world s literature can moment be compared to pepys s diary but many circumstances must combine ere the existence of such book is possible it is characteristic of pepys to be at once very extraordinary and very ordinary person in one point of view he is the most perfect representative imaginable of the bourgeois type of humanity worthy sensible indispensable and at the same time dull prosaic and yet this solid citizen has dash of the gil blas in him too and his little rogueries and servilities appear the more amusing by contrast with the really estimable and respectable background of his character these qualities combined make perfect hero of autobiography his ordinary qualities awaken eeling so characteristic specimen of average humanity and his deviations from the straight path communicate the piquancy of comedy sometimes the exuberance of farce extraordinary he is too assuredly one ever recorded his thoughts and actions with such absolute sincerity or if anyone ever did his thoughts and actions were not worthy of record those of pepys somehow always seem worthy of being perpetuated however trivial they may sometimes be they are saved by the writer s admirable manner and the contagious earnestness of his conviction that they are in truth of deep concern the reader moreover is continually exercised by the problem whether his author is really aware of the display he is making of himself if he is he is miracle of courag if not his obtuseness is equally extraordinary the diary besides is less admirable delineation of the macrocosm than of the microcosm it paints the ofﬁcial and private circles in which the author moved the course of public affairs the humours of social life with less truth and frankness than it reveals the author himself it is by far the most valuable document extant the unders tanding of the times better than all the histories and all the comedies it seems an uneq ualled piece of irony that the supreme piece of workmanship in its way and the most lucid mirror of its age should be the performance of an ordinary citizen who had not the least idea that he was doing anything remarkable who expected celebrity if he expected it at all from his ofﬁcial tasks and scientiﬁc recreations who shrouded his work in shorthand lest the world should proﬁt by it and who would have been dismayed beyond measure if he had foreseen that it would be published after his death many chan ces have conspired its preservat ion it is wonderful that the writer should not have destroyed it beyond expectation that he should have bequeathed it to magdalen college fortunate to say the least that it should have been so well preserved there and have attracted attention at last we shall never be able to determine whether we have more reason to be thankful that it was carried on so long and so fortunately preserved or to lament that it was not continued throughout the periods of the popish plot and the rye house plot of monmouth s rising and of the revolution the diary extends from january 1st 1660 to may 31st 1669 when pepys writes and thus ends all that i doubt i shall

the thickets till they had lost themselves and i could not ﬁnd the way into any of the walks in the wood which indeed are very pleasant if i could have found them at last got out of the wood again and i by leaping down the little bank coming out of the wood did sprain my right foot which brought great present pain but presently with walking it went away the present and so the women and hewer and i walked upon the downs where ﬂock of sheep was and the most pleasant and innocent sight that ever i saw in my life we found shepherd and his little boy reading far from any houses or sight of people the bible to him so i made the boy read to which he did with the forced tone that children usually read that was mighty pretty and then i did give him something and went to the father and talked with him and i ﬁnd he had been servant in my cousin pepys s house and told what was become of their old servants he did content himself mightil y in my liking his boy s reading and did bless god him the most like one of the old patriarchs that ever i saw in my life and it brought those thoughts of the old age of the world in my mind two or three days after we took notice of his woollen knit stockings of two colours mixed and of his shoes shod with iron both at the toe and heels and with great nails in the soles of his feet which was mighty pretty and taking notice of them why says the poor man the downs you see are full of stones and we are fain to shoe ourselves thus and these says he will make the stones ﬂy till they ring before i did give the poor man something which he was mighty thankful and i tried to cast stones with his horn crook he values his dog mightily that would turn sheep any way which he would have him when he goes to fold them told there was about eighteen score sheep in his ﬂock and that he hath four shillings week the year round keeping of them and turner in the common ﬁelds here did gather one of the prettiest nosegays that ever i saw in my life so to our coach and through minnes s wood and looked upon evelyn s house and so over the common and through epsom town to our inn in the way stopping poor woman with her and in one of my gilt tumblers did drink our bellyfuls of milk better than any cream and so to our inn and there had dish of cream but it was sour and so had pleasure in it and so paid our reckoning and took coach it being about seven at night and passed and saw the people walking with their wives and children to take pg 208 pg 209 the project gutenberg ebook of the age of dryden by garnett https air and we set out home the sun by and by going down and we in the cool of the evening all the way with much pleasure home talking and pleasing ourselves with the pleasure of this day s work turner mightily pleased with my resolution which i tell her is never to keep house but to keep coach and with my wife on the saturday to go sometimes day to this place and then quit to another place and there is more variety and little charge and trouble there is in house anon it grew dark and we had the pleasure to see several worms which was mighty pretty but my foot begins more and more to pain which turner by keeping her warm hand upon it did much ease but so that when we come home which was just at eleven at night i was not able to walk from the lane s end to my house without being helped so to bed and there had laid to my feet but in great pain all night pepys s correspondence forms useful adjunct to his diary some of the letters addressed to him are very entertaining especially that from sir samuel morland on his matrimonial misadventures his own letters are usually couched in formal style contrasting strongly with the careless ease of the diary numerous letters and other documents from pepys s pen on admiralty affairs are extant in various reposito ries and should be collected and published he is also the author of an anonymous work on the deposition of alphonso vi of portugal entitled the portugal history or relation of the troubles that happened in the court of portugal in the years 1667 and 1668 published in 1677 which deserves more notice than it has received it is curious history of palace revolution which must have been written to order by the help of ofﬁcial documents and is the more remarkable from the close family connection of the portuguese and english courts which latter must have approved if it did not instigate the publication much space has here been given to pepys and not unreasonably his will be to all ages the classical model of the diary and model to which not only one ever will attain but to which one will endeavour to attain such transparent candour and artless naïveté will hardly in any future age of the world be found united to his parts and knowledge he is supreme in his

has pleased providence to continue us reresbys in the same name and place to save the labour of turning over great many obscure papers and to preserve memorials of some things of use well of curiosity this seems like the prelude to family history the really important part of the book however is not the introductory sketch of reresby s ancestors but diary with very wide gaps devoted in the main to setting forth the writer s relations with the court and his neighbours to the latter he is the grand seigneur towards the former his attitude is not unlike that of pepys he aims to provide well himself possible without dipping too deeply into corruption or absolutely selling himself to promote the designs of arbitrary power he attaches himself to danby whose leading maxim was to build upon the support of the country gentry successively follows him and halifax with some misgivings and though devoted servant of james his enumeration of that monarch s tyrannical acts is so honest that if every document of the age had perished except his diary enough might be deduced from this to justify the revolution at this time he was governor of york where he was surprised and imprisoned and death

autobiographic form the most important was that of william lilly the astrologer whose character of charles has been already noticed if most think an astrologer must be either fool or knave there can be doubt under which class to range this entertaining author born 1601 at diseworth in leicestershire town of great rudeness he was indebted his grammar education to his father s decayed estate which made the farm not worth following and his transfer to london to his total unﬁtness all agricultural work he walked up to london by the side of the carrier s waggon got place in london general servant where i saw and ate good white bread contrary to our diet in leicestershire but on the other hand sometimes helped to carry eighteen tubs of water from the thames in one within few years he made his fortune by marrying his master s widow and devoted himself the rest of his life to mathematical and astrological pursuits he died in good circumstances in 1681 and was honourably interred at the expense of elias ashmole to whom his autobiography is addressed his numerous astrological writings not concern us here his memoirs are less valuable than entertaining the glimpses they afford into bygone mann ers and contemporary feeling on public affairs and particularly the lively portrayal of the singular characters with whom lilly was professionally brought into connection prototypes of the spiritualistic mediums of later day and not unfairly represented by william hodges whose angels were raphael gabriel and uriel his life answered not in holiness and sanctity to what it should having to deal with those holy the following description of welsh conjuror is characteristic example of lilly s graphic touch it happened on one sunday 1632 myself and justice of peace s clerk were before service discoursing of many things he chanced to say that such person was great scholar nay so learned that he could make an almanack which to then was strange one speech begot another till at last he said he could bring acquainted with one evans in alley who had formerly lived in staffordshire that was an excellent wise man and studied the black art the same week after we went to see evans when we come to his house he having been drunk the night before was upon his bed if it be lawful to call that bed whereon he then lay he roused up himself and after some compliments he was content to instruct in astrology i attended his best opportunities seven or eight weeks in which time i could set ﬁgure perfectly books he had not any except haly judiciis astrorum and origanus s ephemerides so that often i entered his house i thought i was in the wilderness now something of the man he was by birth welshman master of arts and in sacred orders he had formerly had cure of souls in staffordshire but now was come to try his fortunes at london being in manner enforced to ﬂy some offences very scandalous committed by him in these parts where he had lately lived he gave judgment upon things lost the only shame of astrology he was the most saturnine person my eyes ever beheld either before i practised or since of middle stature broad forehead thick shoulders full lips black curling stiff hair to give him his right he had the most piercing judgment naturally upon ﬁgure of theft and many other questions that i ever met withal yet money he would willingly give contrary judgments was much addicted to debauchery and then very abusive and quarrelsome seldom without black eye or one mischief or other this is the same evans who made so many antimonial cups upon the sale whereof he principally subsisted he understood latin very well the greek tongue not at all he had some arts above and beyond astrology he was well versed in the nature of spirits and had many times used the

barrenness in biography is remarkable apart from the lives by hutchinson and izaak walton to be noticed presently and few brief accounts of celebrated men preﬁxed to their writings almost the only example is the cluster of valuab le and entertaining family histories which we are indebted to roger north 4 and one of these is an autobiography roger north brother of francis lord guilf ord chief justice of the common pleas and jeffreys s predecessor in the great seal was barrister and man of sound though hardly shining parts who owed his extensive practice at the bar to the inﬂuence of his relative it fell off under the malevolent discouragement of jeffreys and at the revolution roger unable to take the oaths to the new government retired to his country estate in norfolk where he spent vigorous old age in gardening building vindicating the memory of his brothers writing his own biography and cheerfully communicating to all without fee or reward his great knowledge of the law behaviour but unprofessional two of the norths were men of unusual ability the lord keeper and sir dudley the eminent turkey merchant who returned from prosperous career at constantinople to pack juries his enemies alleged in the storms of the exclu sion bill agitation and to signalize himself an authority on questions of trade and ﬁnance the norths jovial race full of sap and substance were staunch cavaliers and roger s biographies of his brothers grew out of vindication of the lord keeper against the attacks of bishop white kennett his apologetic examen not published until after his death though important the history of the time can hardly rank literature the biographies and autobiography on the other hand are very good literature though jessopp is hardly warranted in styling them english classics they are neithe r planned with classic symmetry nor executed with classic elegance but are charming from their artless loquacity and the atmosphere of fraternal affection in which they are steeped well most entertaining from their wealth of anecdote and their portraits partial but not intentionally unfair of remarkable men two elements in these books are sharply contrasted the political and the anecdotic the former affords melancholy but useful representation of the factious unreason of political parties in that age especiall y roger s and of the prejudices which kept englishmen apart until they learned toleration from locke and hoadly it is to roger s credit that although he had done his best to put it into james s power to overthrow the church and trample on the laws he recoiled when the crisis came page or two after expre ssing his opinion that good citizens never resist arbitrary power he is found inconsistently though very rightly lauding his brother dudley refusing under the strongest pressure from james to mortgage his vote in parliament and the whole tenor of his memoirs shows that although his principles would not allow him to acquiesce openly in the revolution he was at the bottom of his heart by means sorry it his antipathy to jeffreys who had enacted towards his brother the part which laud had formerly performed towards abbot may have had something to with this attitude his portraits of eminent lawyers such hale saunders and maynard though sometimes disﬁgured by party feeling have signal value the anecdotic part of the memoirs on the other hand is delightful reading being full of fun shrewd observation and interesting glimpses of the manners of the times somet imes well worth noting example this testimony to the popularity of the church of england in wales in charles s time i remember the doctor roger s brother john master of trinity college cambridge told us that when he came to his parish he found the humour of the people very different from what on like occasions was often found in england instead of grumbling at and affronting new came down amongst them too often known in english villages the parishioners came about him and hugged him calling him their pastor and telling him they were his there are two especial repositories of anecdotes in north s volumes that of stories of circuits and eminent lawyers in his memoir of the lord keeper and his own autobiography and the turkish and levantine sketches in the life of his brother dudley the latter gives most curious picture of the relations of mussulmans and christians in the days when this was the fashion in which unbelievers were noticed by sultans the great ofﬁcers about the grand signor with whom he dudley north had

gower and accordingly the merchant was told of it and at the time appointed an ofﬁcer conducted him into the seraglio and carried him about till he came to little garden and there two other men took him by the two arms and led him to place where he saw the grand signor sitting against large window open in chamber not very high from the ground the men that were his conductors holding each an arm put their hands upon his neck and bowed him down till his forehead touched the ground and this was done more than once and is the very same forced obeisance of ambassadors at their audie nces after this he stood bolt upright long the grand signor thought ﬁt to look at him and then upon sign given he was taken away and set free again by himself to reﬂect on this his romantic this extraordinary gower appears to have been the perfect ideal of an orientalized john bull having his brother assures us an uncommon disposition to truth it is surprising to ﬁnd him actively concern ed in the subornation of perjury in turkish courts but this roger considers demonstration of the strength of his mind one must have strong power of thought to abstract the prejudices of our domestic education and plant ourselves in way of negotiating in heathen remote another biography of the time unknown to the age which produced it but standard work and general favourite since its republication early in the nineteenth century is the life of colonel hutchinson by his widow lucy hutchinson third daughter of sir allen apsley governor of the tower was born in 1620 and in 1638 married colonel john hutchinson of good nottinghamshire family who after having taken an active part on the parliamentary side during the civil war acted one of the king s judges and retired into priva life rather than accept employme nt under cromwell he escaped prosecution at the restoration but afterwards upon suspicion of engaging in plots was imprisoned in deal castle where he died from the unwholesomeness of his quarters his widow wrote his life between 1664 and 1670 but it was not published until it is naturally an unqualiﬁed panegyric upon her husband redeemed from insipidity by the conjuga l affection and devotion which inspire it and the elegant simplicity of the style in panegyrizing her husband hutchinson unwittingly extols herself she has doubt that he was among the wisest well the best men of his time and her simple conviction is so touching that the reader is almost persuaded to think so too one of the most ed he certainly was but his independence verged upon impracticability the strictly historical value of the work is small except regards incidents of the civil war in nottinghamshire hutchinson was highly accomplished woman and made metrical translation of lucretius which is extant in in the british museum the time of her death is not known the most important ecclesiastical biography by contemporary writer is the life of archbishop williams by bishop hacket 1670 the muniﬁcent restorer of lichﬁeld cathedral which although ﬁrst published in 1693 was completed in 1657 and will be more ﬁtly noticed under the period this though more intrinsically valuable is much less known than series of little religious biographies which owe their fame partly to the superior attractiveness of the characters depicted partly to their more manageable compass and partly to the charm of tender and pious spirit rather than of style singularly enough the author owes still larger measure of fame to another book composed in similar spirit but on subject at ﬁrst sight were it not the

established in fleet street near the corner of chancery lane in 1643 having secured competency by trade and probably ﬁnding that his churchmanship and royalism exposed him to annoyance in london he gave up business and withdrew into the country living wood says mostly in the families of the eminent clergymen of england unquiet habitations in those times one would imagine he had during his residence in london greatly ingratiated himself with the digniﬁed clergy and distinguished himself the biographer of one of the most eminent among them though this seems to have been mere accident sir henry wotton having requested him to collect materia ls life of donne which he intended to have written himself wotton dying without having performed his purpose his mantle fell upon walton whose memoir preﬁxed to an edition of donne s sermons published in 1640 obtained so much success that he was requested to write the life of wotton himself this was completed in 1644 and appeared in 1651 along with the reliquiae wottonianae collection edited by walton the lives of hooker and herbert the former commission from archbishop sheldon were written shortly after the restoration under the roof of morley bishop of winchester the life of bishop sanderson was written late meanwhile the complete angler or contemplative man s recreation the book on which walton s fame after all principally rests

the style of marvell walton who had married sister of bishop ken died in the house of his prebendary hawkins of winchester in his will which he had himself drawn up short time previously shows the undiminished vigour of his faculties and the endurance of his connection with his native county his character may be read in every page of his writings and is such to prove that with him angling was indeed the recreation of contemplative man the maxim noscitur sociis is entirely in walton s favour his ecclesiastical heroes are the ﬂower of the church of england of his day his treatment is in general very satisfactory entirely sympathetic the ﬁrst qualiﬁcation of biography and much less marred by prejudice and party spirit than was to have been expected from the agitated character of the times the simple unaffected style almost verges upon garrulity though not scholar walton seems to have possessed sufﬁcient acquaint ance with theology to avoid misrepresentation of eminent divines while the chief value of his work consists in its portrayal of almost ideal charity meekness and learning and in the curious anecdotes embedded in it such pope clement s high appreciation of hooker james s inﬂuence upon the composition of sarpi s history of the council of trent charles s translation of sanderson unfortunately lost and his infatuated regret expressed to the same divine having consented to the abolition of episcopacy in scotland walton into whose composition mirth entered but not humour records this with the same gravity with which he chronicles charles s injunction to the merry monarch to be above all things diligent in the study of richard hooker some light may possibly be thrown upon the vexed question of the interpolation of the last three books of the ecclesiastical polity by the statement of hoole contemporary schoolmaster when exhorting his scholars to good penmanship that many of hooker s sermons had been destroyed after his death from the

1677 robert south from the biographers of divines to the divines themselves we observe that with the signal exception of pilgrim s progress nearly all the writers in this department whose productions have established claim to rank among english classics belong to the company of the this is not in itself surprising preaching stimulates eloquence and the homilist enjoys much greater freedom of range and fuller exemption from restraint than the write r upon strictly technical or professional subjects it does however at ﬁrst sight seem remarkable that an age so generally decried immorality the restoration should with the decade immediately preceding have been the golden age of the english pulpit in fact we have implied when treating of the drama the apparent licence of the age did not really extend much beyond gay and fashionable circles which could not greatly affect the pulpit except to its advantage by furnishing it with impressive topics even in these circles immorality was far from necessarily implying irreligion and the sober citizens who crowded churches and and the universities whose routine afforded so many opportunities the delivery of discourses from the pulpit were much heretofore in the rudimentary condition of the press an organ of public information and education and when the meeting was hardly an institution yet the spoken word possessed power of which the newspaper has since gone far to deprive it in times of public disquiet such the days of the exclusion bill or those which preceded the revolution churches and chapels were crowded with people seeking guidance popular sermons went through edition after edition and popular divines were almost tribunes of the people theological considerations moulded political opinio n to degree now hardly conceivable the storm of pamphlets on both sides called forth by the resipiscence or tergiversation of leading divine like sherlock shows what import ance attached to his conduct upon either view of it the age moreover was in the stage of literary development most favourable pulpit eloquence huge glacier takes longer to melt than small one the quaint and involved periods of the elizabethan pulpit stood out longer than ordinary prose against the disintegrating inﬂuence of seventeenth century taste and while the new movement was triumphant in most branches of literature it in general only affected the style of the sermon so far to chasten and mellow it leaving it still that sonorous dignity and that ﬂavour of the antique with which stately and impressive eloquence can rarely dispense the two greatest preachers barrow and south stand just upon this culminating point of excellence uniting the majesty of the old style to the ease and clearness of the new tillotson going step further and bringing the pulpit down to the level of ordinary educated society performed indeed most useful work but inevitably prepared the way the sensible but unimpressive preaching of the next century isaac barrow master of trinity college was the son of respectable tradesman linendraper to charles his royalist and arminian opinions kept him back under the commonwealth but after the restoration he was acknowledged the ﬁrst mathematician of his country except he was the ﬁrst to allow another isaac whose surname was newton newton who had been barrow s pupil revised his lectures on optics 1669 an work but composed in latin were his scarcely less celebrated lectures on geometry his reputation an english classic rests upon two great theological works his treatise on the pope s supremacy edited after his death by tillotson and his exposition of the creed and upon his sermons which not seem to have been extremely popular in his own day though gaining the suffrage of such dissimilar men locke and charles who called barrow an unfair preacher because he exhausted every topic and left room anything to be said by anyone who came after it may be reasonably conjectured that when barrow preached befor charles he did not indulge in the inordinate expansiveness it was not prolixity that sometimes drove away his congregation it is to the king s honour that his bestowal of the mastership of trinity upon barrow was entirely his own act robert south on the whole perhaps the greatest preacher of his age was born in 1633 and educated at westminster and christ pg 222 pg 223 the project

presbyterians and the church of england in the days of their power wood seems however to have had some private grievance against him and if south was really at the same time so pliant and so able it seems strange that he should have attained higher preferment than stalls at christ church and westminster quarrelsome he certainly was and he entered into most acrimonious controversy with sherlock which it required royal proclamation to compose he died in unlike south s the character of john tillotson is matter controversy with the possible exception of archbishop herring 11 he was the most amiable man that ever ﬁlled the see of canterbury and was pronounced by the discerning and experienced william iii the best friend he had ever had and the best man he had ever known to the meekness of the pastor tillotson added the qualities of the statesman and happy was it the church of england that such man could be found to ﬁll the primacy at such time master of oratory he is greatly inferior in eloquence to both barrow and south but historically is more important than either addison was inﬂuenced by him and his discourses long gave the tone to the english pulpit affording the almost universally accepted model throughout the greater part of the eighteenth century of these three great preachers south is certainly the greatest respects eloquence and energy of diction almost every sentence is striking and at the same time in perfect good taste by so much however he surpasses his rivals in purely literary qualities does he fall below them in others even more essential to the preacher his judgment is often greatly at fault he commits himself to plainly untenable propositions and enforces them with the conﬁdence of one displaying truths after few experienc es of this kind the reader begins to look upon him rhetorician and to prefer the more cautious but still vivid and vigorous ratiocination of barrow or the sweet reasonabl eness of tillotson inferior to barrow he to

unction and seeks rather to menace and upbraid than to allure men into the religious life at the present day it would be pronounced grievously deﬁcient in fervour servile in its political teachings and too exclusive in its appeals to prudential and motives but its adaptation to positive and prosaic age was sufﬁciently evinced by circulation enormous the period the authorship is involved in

ingenuity and who probably owed less to study and training than any other of the great authors of the modern world was born at elstow village in the neighb ourhood of bedford in november he is usually described tinker but he was not an itinerant brazier would be more correct appellation the trade was his father s who was also very small freeholder bunyan probably received some instruction at bedford grammar school and his narrative of his boyhood shows that he must have had considerable knowledge of the bible which impressed his imaginative temper more than he knew at the time according to his own account he was wild and profane in his youth but nothing very deﬁnite can be extracted from these and it would rather appear that it was only short time that he could even be described careless in 1644 partly perhaps from grief at the death of his mother and dissatisfaction with his father s speedy he enlisted into the army doubtless the parliamentary force though he strangely or pruden tly leaves the point uncertain about the end of 1648 he married and through the inﬂuence of his wife whose name he does not tell us and by the aid of two religious books which she brought him among her scanty possessions he accomplished what he afterwards came to consider merely outward reformation the attempt to subjugate the inward man involved him several years in the most distressing spiritual conﬂicts described with extreme power in his grace abounding they conducted him eventually to peace and into the baptist congregation of gifford who had been helpful to him in 1655 he became

means oppressive indeed in the ﬁrst part of it he enjoyed large measure of liberty afterwards withdrawn he supported himself by making tagged laces well by the publication of some books of which grace abounding 1666 is the most important the ﬁrst part of pilgrim s progress was also written in prison but bunyan s best biographer john brown almost proves during second and comparatively brief conﬁnement in in 1672 bunyan published his defence of justiﬁcation by faith coarse and violent attack on the design of christianity by afterwards bishop fowler one of the most tolerant divines of the age but who was provo ked to reply with almost equal acrimony in the same year charles s merciful but entirely illegal suspension of all statutes against papists and nonconformists liberated bunyan

are illustrated by charming anecdote ah bunyan said grateful hearer that was sweet sermon you need not tell that replied bunyan the devil whispered it to before i was well out of the it is unnecessary to dwell at any great length upon the characteristics of so famous and universally known book pilgrim s progress though professedly vision and treating of spiritual things it ranks with robinson crusoe and gulliver s travels one of the great realistic books of the english language all three are examples of the possibility of rendering scenes wholly imaginary and in fact impossible truer to the apprehension than experience itself by the narrator s own air of absolute convic tion and by unswerving ﬁdelity to truth of detail in bunyan s case the triumph is the more remarkable his personages are not even imaginary men and women but mere embodiments of moral or theological qualities yet faithful and hopeful are real crusoe and friday before he began to write he must have realized what he wished to describe with vividness only conceiva ble by regarding it an outward expression of his own spiritual experience he had himself been christian and faithful and the captive in doubting castle he had gazed on vanity fair and passed through the valley of the shadow of death the fact that his allegory is in truth an autobiography explains what macaulay calls the characteristic peculiarity of pilgrim s progress it is the only work of its kind which possesses strong human interest other allegories only amuse the fancy the allegory of bunyan has been read by many thousands with elsewhere he says pilgrim s progress is perhaps the only book about which after the lapse of hundred years the educated minority has come over to the opinion of the common peopl it may be added that pilgrim s progress unlike other celebrated works is bona ﬁde and unmistakable allegory don quixote may have much deeper purpose than that of satirizing chivalric romances but not one reader in hundred cares to fathom it spenser undoubtedly intended to shadow forth elizabeth in gloriana but the percepti on of the poet s purpose contributes nothing to the enjoyment of his poem in bunyan however the allegory is the book too plain to be overlooked by the most careless reader and all the minor allegories that combine to enrich the main action are equally apparent what they are and yet the obvious invention has all the force of reality bunyan says macaulay is almost the only writer who ever gave to the abstract the interest of the concrete in the works of many celebrated authors men are mere personiﬁcat ions the mind of bunyan on the other hand was so imaginative that personiﬁcations when he dealt with them became men dialogue between two qualities in his dream has more dramatic effect than dialogue betwee n two human beings in most macaulay proceeds to compare bunyan in this particular with shelley and the comparison is just but it is surprising that neither he nor froude should have dwelt on bunyan s deeper afﬁnity to great predecessor of whom he assuredly never read dante s personiﬁcations indeed are feeble compared to bunyan s it is doubtful whether some of them are even intended such the might of his imagination however like bunyan s is shown in his power of reconciling us to its wildest ﬂights by the intensity of his realism and the chief distinction is that while bunyan s materials are necessarily drawn from the only worlds he knew the narrow and prosaic world of bedford and the sublime world of the bible dante disposed of all his age could give in philosophy political life human learning the inﬂuence of art and the scrutiny of nature bunyan is hence very contracted and terrestrial dante but so far he goes he is true dante he can not soar with

christian s forsaking his kindred in the city of destruction which to bunyan appeared duty now seems selﬁshness that the fame of both should have survived such profound modiﬁcations of belief is one of the most striking evidences of their greatness one great advantage bunyan possessed the bible had prepared the way him there is probably other such instance of the assimilation of one literature by another the domestication of the bible in england the greek and hebrew authors of the scriptures were better known to the public that bunyan principally addressed than the majority of their own writers and he had need like other men of original genius to painfully create the taste by which he was ultimately to be judged from the ﬁrst pilgrim s progress took rank classic well might arnold call it comple reﬂection of its chief blemish the somewhat prosaic and character of its piety harmonized entirely with the current teaching of the pulpit and offered to generation which had not so much heard of other its popularity soon received the usual attestation of piracies spurious continuations and imitations in all languages the question whether bunyan was indebted his allegory to any predecessor is hardly worth discussing some general resemblance must necessarily exist between books treating of pilgrimages and here the resemblance is more than general the second part was published in its inferiority to the ﬁrst part is universally admitted but is less than is usually entailed by the endeavour to append an artiﬁcial supplement to an inspired book many passages are fully worthy of the ﬁrst part and whole it abounds with life and variety three only of bunyan s numerous publications besides pilgrim s progress claim place in literature the holy war 1682 the life and death of badman 1680 grace abounding 1665 of these the holy war is the most important and affords highly instructive contrast with pilgrim s progress it is the peculiar virtue of the latter while full of wisdom and proﬁtableness to be in way professedly didactic bunyan himself tells us that he did not sit down to compose it the thoughts came spontaneously into his mind he wrote it because he could not help himself there was thus need laboriously instilling lessons which inhered in the original conception and came forward of themselves the story ﬂowed along the elaborate construction of the holy war precludes belief in like inspiration there can in fact be little doubt that the idea is consciously derived from paradise lost in both the banished ﬁends cast about some means of retaliating upon their omnipotent foe in milton their attack is levelled against the garden of eden in bunyan against the soul of man all human attributes virtuous or vicious are allegorized with graphic liveliness but at length one wearies of the crowd of abstractions and where strength was most necessary bunyan is weak eman uel is not godlike and diabolus is not terrible the book is perhaps chieﬂy interesting an index to the great progress effected since bunyan s time in spirituality regar ds men s religious conceptions and in freedom and enlightenment concerns the things of earth one would now depict the offended majesty of heaven so like the offended majesty of the stuarts or deem that the revolters offence could be mitigated by the abjectness of their submission or try criminals with such unfairness or lecture them upon conviction with such lack of judicial decorum bunyan s own spirit seems narrower than of old among the traitors upon whom emanuel s ministers execute justice he includes not only notruth and pitiless but also and who represent the majority of the members of the church of england the whole tone in truth is such might be expected from one nurtured upon the old rather than the new testam ent and who had never conceived any doubts of the justice of the israelites dealings with the canaanites the literary power nevertheless is unabated much ingenuity is shown in keeping up the interest of the story and there is the old gift of vitalizing abstractions by uncompromising realism of treatment the following passage is remarkable instance of the dependence of bunyan s style

tabor going before them and now you must think that those of the town that had all this while waited to hear of their death could not but be exercised with sadness of mind and with thoughts that pricked like thorns nor could their thoughts be kept to one point the wind blew with them all this while at great uncertainties yea their hearts were like balance that had been disquieted with shaking hand but at last they with many long look looked over the wall of mansoul they thought that they saw some returning to the town and thought again who should they be at last they discern ed that they were the prisoners but can you imagine how their hearts were surprised with wonder especially when they perceived also in what equipage and with what honour they were sent home they went down to the camp in black but they came back to the town in white they went down to the camp in ropes they came back in chains of gold they went down to the camp with their feet in tatters but they came back with their steps enlar ged under them they went also to the camp looking death but they came back from thence with assurance of life they went down to the camp with heav y hearts but came back again with pipe and tabor playing before them so so soon they were come to gate the poor and tottering town of mansoul adventured to give shout and they gave such shout made the captains in the prince s army leap at the sound thereof alas them poor hearts who could blame them since their dead friends were come to life again it was to them life from the dead to see the ancients of the town of mansoul to shine in such splendour they looked nothing but the axe and the block but behold joy and gladness comfort and consolation and such melodious notes attending of them that was sufﬁcient to make sick man well so when they came up they saluted each other with welcome welcome and blessed be he that spared you they added also we see it is well with you but how must it go with the town of mansoul and will it go well with the town of mansoul said they then answered them the recorde r and my lord mayor oh tidings glad tidings good tidings of good and of great joy to poor mansoul then they gave another shout that made the earth to ring again after this they enquired yet more particularly how things went in the camp and what message they had from emmanuel to the town so they told them all passages that had happened to them at the camp and every thing that the prince did to them this made mansoul wonder at the wisdom and grace of the prince emmanuel then they told them what they had received at his hands the whole town of mansoul and the recorder delivered it in these words pardon pardon pardon mansoul and this shall mansoul know then he commanded and they went and summoned mansoul to meet together in the orrow there to hear their general pardon read but who can think what turn what change what an alteration this hint of things did make in the countenance of the town of mansoul man of mansoul could sleep that night joy in every house there was joy and music singing and making merry telling and hearing of mansoul s happiness was then all that mansoul had to and this was the burden of all their song oh more of this at the rising of the sun more of this morrow who thought yesterday would one say that this day would have been such day to us and who thought that saw our prisoners go down in irons that they would have returned in chains of gold yea they that judged themselves they went to be judged of their judge were by his mouth acquitted not that they were innocent but of

realism is perhaps the more effective from being wholly devoid of the least particle of imagination the genesis and purpose of the book are thus stated by the author i was considering with myself what i had written concerning the progress of the pilgrim from this world to glory and how it had been acceptable to many in this nation it came again into my mind to write then of him that was going to heaven so now of the life and death of the ungodly and of their travel from this world to had this conception been strictly carried out the narrative must have been failure from the want of admixture of light and shade the christian of the pilgrim s progress is mixed character and though we are scarcely in doubt to the ultimate success of his adventure this is sufﬁciently chequered with peril and hardship to keep our interest alert this evidently can not be the case with badman whose career is not only monotony but monotony of sordid evil and who only excites ﬂickering sort of interest in virtue of the sympathy naturally felt the victim of the animosity of his creator bunyan however has not been faithful to his original plan and has in measure redeemed one fault in art by committing another rule nothing is more reprehensible in ﬁction than inordinate digression but here it is the greatest relief to be turned away from the repulsive career of badman to the running commentary in which bunyan opens his mind on variety of subjects spiritual and secular ranging from earnest rebukes of the maxim to be anon formulated buy in the cheapest market and sell in the dearest to foolish stories of the deaths of persecutors quite in the vein of the methodist anecdotes satirized by sydney smith this garrulity is greatly promoted by the inartistic character of the machinery employed dialogue between wiseman and attentive which allows the writer to say whatever he pleases it is eviden t that he has real persons and actual transactions continually in his mind and it would not be surprising to learn that his book made inconsiderable commotion in the town of bedford grace abounding resembles thousands of similar narratives in essentials differing principally in the vigour with which terrifying religious experience is portrayed it does not some seem to have taken granted termi nate with what would be technically considered bunyan s conversion on the contrary large portion is

https most important part of the posthumous papers of samuel butler the discovery of which in the eighteenth century has been mentioned was his characters composed upon the model of theophrastus and fairly entitling him to the appellation of the english theophrastus which is not the highest encomium imaginable the only work of the kind which has come down to us from antiquity the characters of theophrastus which are in reality much later than the time of that successor of aristotle have passed models reputation in excess of their desert they offer an acute and entertaining enumeration of various peculiarities of character but not succeed in presenting the personage whole and have much the air of being compiled from traits delineated with real truth of representation by the comic poets butler s characters are of just the same kind and his work is rather museum of particulars than gallery of portraits the age of charles ii by means lives in him the age of anne lives in addison la bruyère butler s more celebrated french successor who certainly never read and probably never heard of him fell into precisely the same error from too timid an adherence to theophrastus and the improvement upon him effected by addison may be compared to the service rendered to sculpture by dædalus the ﬁrst it is said to show the human form in motion isolated remarks in butler s essays are frequently very shrewd and pregnant when he says of the newsmonger he would willingly bear his share in any public calamity to have the pleasure of hearing and telling it or of the hunter let the hare take which way she will she seldom fails to lead him at to the alehouse or the description of prince s unworthy favourite fog raised by the sun to obscure his own many of butler s miscellaneous thoughts appended to the characters are highly acute and exhibit happy talent illustrating abstract ideas by comparison with sensible objects instance oaths and obligations in the affairs of the world are like ribands and knots in dressing that seem to tie something but in politics butler is of course loyalist and one whose loyalty is intensiﬁed by his æsthetic dislike to puritanism in which he was constitutionally incapable of seeing anything but cant at the same time the contempt which man of understanding he could not help entertaining the conduct of affairs under the restoration and disappointment at the neglect with which he was himself treated seem to have almost reduced him to condition of political scepticism the worst governments are the best when they light in good hands and the best the worst when they fall into bad ones remark condensed into famous couplet by pope who appears to have become acquainted with butler s through atterbury it is worth observing that butler not only prefers ben jonson to shakespeare but seems to take his superiority granted virgil who wanted much of that natural easiness of wit that ovid had did nevertheless with hard labour and long study arrive at higher perfection than the other with all his dexterity of wit but less industry could attain to the same we may observe of jonson and shakespeare he that is able to think long and judge well will be sure to ﬁnd out better things than another man can hit upon suddenly though of more quick and ready parts which is commonly but chance and the other art and one special distinction of butler s is to have been perhaps the ﬁrst english satirist of mark who made parody political weapon or at least showed its capabilities this purpose it does not appear that any of his political parodies were printed in his lifetime jack cade s speeches in shakespeare are indeed sufﬁcient model but butler worked out the hint elaborately in his ﬁctitious speeches in the rump parliament his mock eulogium of this body or segment of body in the oration supposed to be delivered at harringto n s rota and the parody of prynne s style in the imaginary correspondence between him and john audland the quaker butler s remains were only partially printed in 1759 but the mss from which thyer s publication was drawn were acquired in 1885 by the british museum his selection seems to have been in general exceedingly judicious but the opportunity may be taken of giving some examples of butler s unpublished thoughts there is better argument to prove that the scriptures were written by

real value than the more exact and pragmatical narratives which have superseded it the glow of youth is upon it it paints vividly the great scientiﬁc awakening which coincided with the accession of charles ii the mere list of the experiments which the royal society had performed or proposed to perform attests the devouring scientiﬁc curiosity of the age and shows at once the reaction of men s minds in the direction of the tangibly useful after long series of fruitless theological and political controver sies and how deep in the long run had been the inﬂuence of the great man who had lost his life in performing an experiment at the same time there is humorous side to the picture much of the curiosity of the time was idle much was founded on credulity many of the queries which sprat catalogues with such complacency would now be thought too trivial to engage the attention of learned society and some are not little absurd in the main however they are most signiﬁcant of the new spirit that had come into the world counter spirit was necessarily called into being also sprat combats the objections of churchmen by proving that enthusiasts can not be natural philosophers and

without brief notice of two foreign visitors to the country whose narratives translated into english have probably been more read here than at home and from whom much valuable information may be derived sorbière philosophe r of gassendi s school protestant by birth but who had become nominal catholic visited england in being he admits entirely ignorant of the language his attention was principally given to the intellectual aspects of the country which were not unfamiliar to him from his acquaintance with the works of englishmen who had written in latin his accounts of oxford and the royal society are neither unamusing nor unins tructive he has true veneration english men of science especially bacon whom he pronounces the greatest man the interest of natural philosophy that ever of english letters he can only say that he understands that all english eloquence consists in mere pedantry writing in the character of courtier sorbière expresses himself antagonistically to the english constitution but it is difﬁcult to believe that his remarks are not sometimes ironical he can hardly have thought it very extravagant idea on the part of the commons that their king ought to apply himself entirely to maintain the public peace to promote the happine ss of his people and to advance the honour and reputation of his country abroad much possibly he we are nevertheless informed that this and similar views arise from particular inclination they have by nature to supply themselves with such disrespectful arguments the travels in england of duke cosmo medici to the grand duchy of tuscany were performed in 1669 and described by signor magalotti memb er of his suite whose manuscript account was translated into english and published in they are more interesting than most foreign narratives of english travel in so far cosmo having landed at plymouth and travell ed up to london and having afterwards made excursions to oxford cambridge and other places saw more of english country life than usual and inasmuch they are accompanied by excellent sketches taken by artists in his suite it is most delightful to be thus enabled to see towns and villages and houses exactly they appeared in the days of charles and it is only to be regretted that the artists did not exercise their pencils upon the streets of london magalotti is an intelligent and inquisitive traveller but voyaging in the train of prince and unacquainted with the language he can tell us little respecting the people his account of what fell within his sphere is sensible and impartial with few errors such the strange assertion that clarendon had been secret ly presbyterian he is too much of courtier to inform us respecting the court of charles except in the enumeration of titled persons and ofﬁcials in which he is very exact he gives fair account of the royal society and of the theatre but seems unconscious of the existence of english literature outside the walls of the playhouse pg 277 pg 278 the project gutenberg ebook of the age of dryden by garnett https have now accompanied the literature of the restoration period from its apparently sudden manifestation contemporaneously with the return of the exiled monarch to its transition into what is so appropriately in one point of view so unaptly in anothe r termed england s augustan age we have seen that this apparent abruptness was deceptive arising from the interruption of english literary development by the civil war and its consequences and that the restoration literature represented tendencies which must inevitably have prevailed without the infusion of any french element the old elizabethan mode had become inadequate to the vastly extended needs of the time and we are now able to recognize the literature of the restoration in its proper connection transition to the thoroughly practical and style of the eighteenth century which having worked itself out in its turn and arrived at an impracticable position through the total negation of imaginati on by its most characteristic representatives 15 brought about the revival of the elizabethan spirit in the imaginative spiritual and at the same time intensely human literature of the nineteenth century this in turn seems threatened with decay from the exag geration of its characteristic qualities and the antidote might be sought in less hopeful quarters than in the sound sense manly vigour and solid execution of the robust if prosaic writers of the age of dryden f t n t s fox thought that shakespeare s reputation would have
