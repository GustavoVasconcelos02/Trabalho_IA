who have smiled upon the world in the supreme adaptation of means to an end there is constant nobility neither ambition nor virtue is the essential of perfect action how shall you contemplate with indifference the career of an artist whom genius or good guidance has compelled to exercise his peculiar skill to indulge his ﬁner aptitudes masterly theft rises in its claim to respect high above the reprobation of the moralist the scoundrel when once justice is quit of him has right to be appraised by his actions not by their effect and he dies secure in the knowledge that he is commonly more distinguished if he be less loved than his virtuous contemporaries while murder is wellnigh old life property and the pocket invented theft among the arts it was not until avarice had devised many cunning trick the protection of wealth until civilisation had multiplied the forms of portable property that thieving became liberal and an elegant profession true in pastoral society the lawless man was eager to lift cattle to break down the barrier between robbery and warfare but the contrast is sharp between the savagery of the ancient reiver and the polished perform ance of captain hind between the daub of the pavement and the perfection of velasquez so long the gothic spirit governed europe expressing itself in useless ornament and wanton brutality the more delicate crafts had hope of exercise even the adventurer upon the road threatened his victim with bludgeon nor was it until the breath of the renaissance had viviﬁed the world that gentleman and an artist could face the traveller with courteous demand his purse but the age which witnessed the enterprise of drake and the triumph of shakespeare knew also the prowess of the highwayman and the dexterity of the cutpurse though the art displayed all the freshness and curiosity of the primitives still it was art with gamaliel ratsey who demanded scene from hamlet of riﬂed player and who could not rob cambridge scholar without bidding him deliver an oration in wood theft was already better than vulgar extortion moll cutpurse whose intelligence and audacity were never bettered was among the bravest of the elizabethans her temperament was large and reckless ben jonson own neither her tongue nor her courage knew the curb of modesty and she was the ﬁrst to reduce her craft to set of wise and imperious rules she it was who discovered the secret of discipline and who insisted that every member of her gang should undertake other enterprise than that which nature had framed him thus she made easy the path that other hero of whom you are told that his band was made up several sorts of wicked artists of whom he made several uses according he perceived which way every man particular talent lay this dun was his up the use of his comrades stringent and stately code and he was wont to deliver an address to all novices concerning the art and mystery of robbing upon the highway under auspices so brilliant thievery could not but ﬂourish and when the stuarts sat upon the throne it was already lifted above the level of questioning experiment every art is shaped by its material and with the variations of its material it must perforce vary if the skill of the cutpurse compelled the invention of the pocket it is certain that the rare difﬁculties of the pocket created the miraculous skill of those crafty ﬁngers which were destined to empty it and increased obstacles are perfection best incentive ﬁner cunning grew out of the fresh precaution history does not tell us who it was that discovered this new continent of roguery those there are who give the credit to the valiant moll cutpurse but though the roaring girl had wit to conceive thousand strange enterprises she had not the hand to carry them out and the book of scoundrels by charles whibley https must needs have been man of action moreover her nickname suggests the more ancient practice and it is wiser to yield the credit to simon fletcher whose praises are chanted by the early historians now simon says his biographer was upon to be the greatest artist of his age by all his contemporaries the son of baker in rosemary lane he early deserted his father oven life of adventure and he claims to have been the ﬁrst collector who stealing the money yet left the case the new method was incomparably more subtle than the old it afforded an opportunity of hitherto unimagined delicacy the wielders of the scissors were aghast at skill which put their own clumsiness to shame and which to previous generation would have seemed the wildest fantasy yet so strong is habit that even when the picking of pockets was recognised industry the superﬂuous scissors still survived and many rogue has hanged upon the tree because he attempted with vulgar implement such feats his unaided forks had far more easily accomplished but despite the innovation of simon fletcher the highway was the glory of elizabeth the still greater glory of the stuarts lacedæmonians were the only people said horace walpole the english who seem to have put robbery on right foot and the english of the seventeenth century need fear the rivalr y of lacedæmonian they were indeed the most valiant and graceful robbers that the world has ever known the civil war encouraged their profession and since many of them had fought their king proper hatred of cromwell sharpened their wits they were scholars well gentlemen they tempered their sport with merry wit their avarice alone surpassed their courtesy and they robbed with so perfect regard the proprieties that it was only the pedant and the parliamentarian who resented their interference nor did their princely manner fail of its effect upon their victims the middle of the seventeenth century was the golden age not only of the robber but of the robbed the game was played upon either side with scrupulous respect potent if unwritten law neither might nor right was permitted to control the issue gaily attired superbly mounted highwayman would hold up coach packed with armed men and take purse from each though vigorous remonstrance might have carried him to tyburn but the traveller knew his place he did what was expect ed of him in the best of tempers who was he that he should yield in courtesy to the man in the vizard it was monstrous the one to dischar ge his pistol so the other could not resist without committing an outrage upon tradition one wonders what had been the result if some mannerless reformer had declined his assailant invitation and drawn his sword maybe the sensitive art might have died under this sharp rebuf but none save regicides were known to resist and their resistance was never more forcible than volley of texts thus the swaggered it with insolent gaiety knowing worse misery than the fear of the tree so long he followed the rules of his craft but let touch of brutality disgrace his method and he appealed in vain sympathy or indulgence the rufﬁan instance of whom it is grimly recorded that he added to his booty neither deserved nor received the smallest consideration delivered to justice he speed ily met the death his vulgarity merited and the road was taught the salutary lesson that wigs were sacred trinkets hallowed by association with the eighteenth century the highway fell upon decline doubt in its silver age the century beginning many brilliant deed was done something of the old policy survived and men of spirit still went upon the pad but the breadth of the ancient style was speedily forgotten and by the time the first geor ge climbed to the throne robbery was already sordid trade neither side was conscious of its noble obligation the vulgar audacity of bullying thief was suitably answered by the ungracious involuntary submission of the terriﬁed traveller from end to end of england you might hear the cry of and delive yet how changed the accent the beauty of gesture the deference of carriage the ready response to legitimate the qualit ies of digniﬁed art were lost ever its professors increased in number the note of aristocracy once dominant was silenced the meanest rogue who could hire horse might cut contemptible ﬁgure on bagshot heath and feel shame at robbing poor man that augustan age whose brightest ornament was captain was something of distinction to be decently plundered century later there was none so humble but he might be asked to empty his pocket in brief the blight of democracy was upon what should have remained reﬁned secluded art and nowise is the decay better illustrated than in the appreciation of bunglers whose exploits were scarce worth record james maclaine instance was the hero of his age in history of cowards he would deserve the ﬁrst place and the highwayman he was pompously styled enjoyed triumph denied to many victorious general lord mountford led half white to him honour on the book of scoundrels by charles whibley https his arrest on the ﬁrst sunday which he spent in newgate three thousand jostled entrance to his cell and the poor devil fainted three times at the heat caused by the throng of his admirers so long his fate hung in the balance walpole could not take up his pen without compliment to the man who claimed to have robbed him near hyde park yet more pitiful rascal never showed the white feather not once was he known to take purse with his own hand the summit of his achievement being to hold the horses heads while his accomplice spoke with the passengers poltroon before his arrest in court he whimpered and whinnied mercy he was carried to the cart pallid and trembling and not even his preposterous ﬁnery availed to hearten him at the gallows taxed with his timidity he attempted to excuse himself on the inadmissible plea of moral rectitude i have much personal courage in an honourable cause he exclaimed in passage of false dignity any man in britain but i knew i was committing acts of injustice so i went to them half loth and half consenting and in that sense i own i am coward indeed the disingenuousness of this proclamation is remarkable its hypocrisy well might he brag of his courage in an honourable cause when he knew that he could never be put to the test but what palliation shall you ﬁnd rogue with so little pride in his art that he exercised it loth half consenting it is not in this recreant spirit that masterpieces are achieved and maclaine had better have stayed in the far highland parish which bred him than have attempted to cut ﬁgure in the larger world of london his famous encounter with walpole should have covered him with disgrace it was ignoble at every point and the art was so little understood that it merely added leaf to his crown of glory now though walpole was far too to oppose the demand of an armed stranger maclaine in deﬁance of his craft dischar ged his pistol at an innocent head true he wrote letter of apology and insisted that had the one proved fatal he had another in reserve himself but not even walpole would have believed him had not an amiable faith given him an opportunity the answering quip i less than say i will be hanged if he is maclaine was coward and thief so also he was snob and gentleman his boasted elegance was not more respectable than his art fine clothes are the embellishment of true adventurer they hang ill on the sloping shoulders of poltroon and maclaine with all the ostensible weaknesses of his kind would claim regard the strength that he knew not he occupied costly apartment in james street his morning dress was crimson damask banjam silk shag waistcoat trimmed with lace black velvet breeches white silk stockings and yellow morocco slippers but since his magniﬁcence added jot to his courage it was rather mean than admirable indee d his whole career was marred by the provincialism of his native manse and he was the adored of an intelligent age he basked few brief weeks in the noonday sun of fashion if distinction was not the heritage of the eighteenth century its glory is that now and again giant raised his head above the stature of prevailing rectitude the art of verse was lost in rhetoric the noble prose invented by the elizabethans and reﬁned under the stuarts was whittled away to common sense by the admirers of addison and steele swift and johnson gibbon and fielding were apparitions of strength in an amiable ineffective age they emer ged sudden from the impeccable greyness to which they afforded an heroic contrast so while the highway drifted to vulgar incompetence the craft was illumined by many ﬂash of unexpected genius the brilliant achievements of jonathan wild and of jack sheppard might have reliev ed the gloom of the darkest and their separate masterpieces make some atonement the envir oning cowardice and stupidity above all the eighteenth century was newgate golden age now the ﬁrst time and the last were the rules and customs of the jug perfectly understood if jonathan the great was unrivalled in the art of clapping his enemies into prison if jack the was supreme in the rarer art of getting himself out even the meanest criminal of his time knew what was expected of him so long he wandered within the walled yard or listened to the minist rations of the besmirched ordinary he might show lamentable lack of cleverness in carrying off his booty he might prove too easy victim to the wiles of the but he never fell short of courage when asked to sustain the consequences of his crime newgate compared by one eminent author to university by another to ship was republic whose liberty extended only so far its iron door while there was liberty without there was licence within and if the culprit who paid the smallest indiscretion with his neck understood the etiquette of the place he spent his last weeks in an orgie of rollicking lawlessness he drank he book of scoundrels by charles whibley https diced he received his friends or chaffed the ordinary he attempted through the cunning of the clerk to bribe the jury and when every artiﬁce had failed he went to tyburn like man if he knew not how to live at least he would show resentful world how to die country wrote sir smith distinguished lawyer of the time malefactors go to execution more intrepidly than in england and assuredly buoyed up by custom and the approval of their fellows wild victims made brave show at the gallows nor was their bravery the result of common callousness they understood at once the humour and the delicacy of the situation though hitherto they had chaffed the ordinary they now listened to his exhortation with at least semblance of respect and though their last night upon earth might have been devoted to joyous company they did not withhold their ear from the bellman chant twelve last midnight upon would interrupt the most spirited discourse they would check the tour of the mellowest bottle to listen to the solemn doggerel you that in the condemn hole lie groaned the bellman of sepulchre in his duskiest voice and they who held revel in the condemned hole prayed silence of their friends the familiar cadences all you that in the condemn hole lie prepare you you shall die watch all and pray the hour is drawing near that you before th almighty must appear examine well yourselves in time repent that you may not t eternal flames be sent and when pulchre bell tolls the lord above have mercy on your souls past twelve even if this warning voice struck momentary terror into their offending souls they were up betimes in the morning eager to pay their ﬁnal debt their journey from newgate to tyburn was triumph and their vanity was unabashed at the droning menaces of the ordinary at one point chorus of maidens cast wreaths upon their way or pinned nosegays in their coats that they might not face the executioner unadorned at the crown tavern they quaffed their last glass of ale and told the landlord with many leer and smirk that they would pay him on their way back though gravity was asked it was not always given but in the eighteenth century courage was seldom wanting to the common citizen violent death was and is the worst of horrors to the ancient highwayman it was the odd trick lost in the game of life and the highwayman endured the rope the practised gambler loses his estate without blenching one there was who felt his leg tremble in his own despite wherefore he stamped it upon the ground so violently that in other circumstances he would have roared with pain and he left the world without tremor in this spirit cranmer burnt his recreant right hand and in either case the glamour of unique occasion was stimulus to courage but not even this brilliant treatment of accessories availed to save the highway from disrepute indeed it had become the proﬁtless pursuit of braggarts and loafers long before the abolition of the destroyed its opportunity in the meantime however the pickpock et was master of his trade his strategy was perfect his sleight of hand delicate long lithe ﬁngers and nimble brains could make it he had discarded ever those clumsy instruments whose use had barred the progress of the primitives the breas behind the tightest buttoned coat presented difﬁculty to his love of research and he would penetrate the stoutest frieze or the lightest satin easily jack sheppard made hole through newgate his trick of robbery was so simple and yet so successful that ever since it has remained tradition the collision the victim murmured apology the hasty scufﬂe the booty handed to the who is out of sight before the hue and cry can be was the policy advocated two hundred years ago such is the policy pursued to day by the few artists that remain throughout the eighteenth century the art of held its own though its reputation paled in the glamour of the highway it culminated in geor ge barrington whose vivid genius persuaded him to work alone and to carry off his own booty it still ﬂourished in silver age when the incomparable haggart performed his prodigies of skill even in our prosaic time some ﬂashes of the ancient glory have been seen now and again circumstances have driven it into eclipse when the facile sentiment of the early victorian poised the tear of sympathy upon every trembling eyelid the most obdurate was forced to provide himself with silk handkerchief of equal size and value now wipe is the easiest booty in the world and the artful dodger might grow rich without the exercise of the smallest skill but wipes dwindled with dwindling sensibility and once more the pickpocket was forced upon cleverness or book of scoundrels by charles whibley https the same time the more truculent trade of housebreaking was winning lesser triumph of its own never save in the hands of one or two distinguished practitioners has this clumsy brutal pursuit taken on the reﬁnement of an art essentially modern it has generally been pursued in the meanest spirit of gain deacon brodie clung to it to diversion but he was an amateur without clear understanding of his craft possibilities the sole monarch of housebreakers was charles peace at single stride he surpassed his predecessors nor has the greatest of his imitators been worthy to hand on the candle which he left at the gallows the rest there is small distinction in breaking windows wielding crowbars and battering the brains of defenceless old gentlemen and it is to such miserable tricks this that he who two centuries since rode abroad in all the glory of the descends in these days of avarice and stupidity the legislato rs who decreed that henceforth the rope should be reserved the ultimate crime of murder were inspired with proper sense of humour and proportion it would be ignoble to dignify that ugly enterprise of the cracking of suburban cribs with the same punishment which was meted out to claude duval and the immortal switcher better the churl the disgrace of portland than the chance of heroism and respect given at the tree and where are the heroes whose art was glorious their intrepidity one and all they have climbed the ascent of tyburn one and all they have leaped resplendent from the cart the world which was the joyous playground of highwaymen and pickpockets is now the arcadia of swindlers the man who once went forth to meet his equal on the road now plunders the defenceless widow or the foolish clergyman from the security of an ofﬁce he has changed black bess brougham his pistol cigar sleek sits upon the head which once carried jaunty hat spats have replaced the tops of ancient times and heavy fur coat advertises at once the wealth and inaction of the modern brigand longer does he roam the heaths of hounslow or bagshot longer does he track the grazier to country fair fearful of an encounter he chooses the ﬁelds of his enterprise the byways of the city and the advertisement columns of the smugly christian press he steals without risking his skin or losing his respectability the suburb wherein he brings up blameless family regards him its most renowned benefactor he is generally pillar or buttress of the church and oftentimes mayor with his wealth he promotes charities and endows schools his portrait is painted by academician and hangs until disaster overtakes him in the of his adopted borough how much worse is he than the of old they were brave lions he is very louse timidity his conduct is meaner than the conduct of the most rufﬁanly burglar that ever worked of art he has not the remotest inkling though his greed is bounded by the bank of england he understands not the elegancies of life he cares not how he plumps his purse so long it be full and if he were capable of conceiving grand effect he would willingly surrender it pocketed this side the channel in brief romance and the pictures are dead and in france the last refuge of crime there are already signs of decay the abbé bruneau caught whiff of style and invention from the past that other was his forth pure creator he owed his prowess to the exam ple of none but in paris crime is too often passionel and crime passionel is crime with purpose which like the novel with purpose is conceived by dullard and carried out the gratiﬁcation of the to whitewash the scoundrel is to put upon him the heaviest dishonour dishonour comparable only to the monstrously illogical treatment of the condemned when once hero has forfeited his right to comfort and freedom when he is deemed longer ﬁt to live upon earth the prison chaplain encouraging him to ﬁnal act of hypocrisy gives him free pass so to say into another and more exclusive world so too the moralist would test the thief by his own narrow standard forgetting that all professions are not restrained by the same code the road has its ordinances well the and if the thief is commonly bad moralist it is certain that moralist was ever great thief why then detract from man legitimate glory is it not wiser to respect deep intuition of oneness which colerid ge says is the bottom of our faults well our virtues to recognise that fault in an honest man is virtue in scoundrel after all he is eminent who in obedience to his talent does prodigies of valour unrivalled by his fellows and none has so many opportunities of various eminence the scoundrel the qualities which may proﬁtably be applied to cross life are uncommon and innumerable it is not given to all men to be courage which shall face an enemy under the starlight or beneath the shadow of wall which shall track its prey to book of scoundrels by charles whibley https lair is far rarer than cowardice the recklessness that risks all present advantage is called genius if victorious general urge it to success nor can you deny to the intrepid highwayman whose sudden resolutio n triumphs at an instant of peril the possession of an admirable gift but all heroes have not proved themselves excellent at all points this one has been distinguished the courtly manner of his attack that other prescience which discovers booty behind or within the pocket of buttoned coat if cartouche was master of strategy barrington was unmatched in another branch and each may claim the credit due to peculiar eminence it is only thus that you may measure conﬂicting talents it were unfair to judge poet by brief experiment in prose so it would be monstrous to cheapen the accomplishments of pickpocket because he bungled at the concealment of his gains stern test of artistry is the gallows perfect behaviour at an enforced and public scrutiny may properly be esteemed an effect of effect which has not too often been rehearsed there is reason why the scoundrel fairly beaten at the last point in the game should not go to his death without swagger and without remorse at least he might comfort himself with such phrases dance without the music and he has not often been lacking in courage what he has missed is dignity his pitfalls have been unctuosi ty on the one side bravado on the other it was the prison ordinary who ﬁrst misled him into the assumption of piety which neither preacher nor disciple understood it was the prison ordinary who persuaded him to sign his name to lying confession of guilt drawn up in accordance with foolish and inexorable tradition and to deliver such last dying speech would not disappoint the mob the set phrases the vain prayer offered other sinners the hypocritical profession of superior righteousness were neither noble nor sincere when tom jones instance was hanged in 1702 after prosperous career on hounslow heath his biographer declared that he behaved with more than usual and decency because he pretty deal of good advice to the young men present exhorting them to be industrious in their several callings whereas his biographer should have discovered that it is not thus that your true hero bids farewell to frolic and adventure little in accordance with good taste was the last appearance of the infamous jocelin harwood who was swung from the cart in 1692 murder and robbery he arrived at tyburn insolently drunk he blustered and ranted until the spectators hissed their disapproval and he died vehemently shouting that he would act the same murder again in the same case unworth y also was the last dying repartee of samuel shotland notorious bully of the eighteenth century taking off his shoes he hurled them into the crowd with smirk of delight father and mother often told he cried i should die with my shoes on but you may all see that i have made them both liars great man dies not with so mean jest and tyburn was untouched to mirth by shotland facile humour on the other hand there are those who have given splendid example of brave and digniﬁed death brodie was sorry bungler when at work but perfect artist at the gallo ws the glory of his last achievement will never fade the muttered prayer unblemished by hypocri sy the jest thrown at geor ge metaphor from the silent adjustment of the cord which was to strangle him these last ofﬁces were performed with an unparalleled quietude and restraint though he had pattered the ﬂash to all his wretched accomplices there was trace of the last dying speech in his ﬁnal utterances and he set an example of simple greatness worthy to be followed even to the end of time such is the type but others also have given proof of serene temper tom austin masterpiece was in another kind but it was none the less masterpiece at the very moment that the halter was being put about his neck he was asked by the chaplain what he had to say before he died says he woman yonder with some curds and whey and i wish i could have pennyworth of them before i am hanged because i know when i shall see any again there is brave irrelevance in this very human desire which is beyond praise valiant also was the conduct of roderick audrey who after brief but brilliant career paid his last debt to the law in he was but sixteen and says his biogra pher went very decent to the gallow s being in white waistcoat clean napkin white gloves and an orange in one hand so well did he play his part that one wonders jack ketch did not shrink from the performance of his but throughout his short life roderick very name is an echo of romance contem pt whatever was common or ugly not only was his appearance at tyburn lesson in elegance but he thieved none ever thieved before or since with other accomplice than thus he would book of scoundrels by charles whibley https house wherein he espied sideboard of plate and at last bidding his playmate ﬂutter through an open window into the parlour he would follow upon the excuse of recovery and once admitted would carry off much silver he could conceal none other ever attempted so graceful an artiﬁce and yet audrey journey to tyburn is even more memorable than the story of his gay accomplice but it is not only the truly great who have won themselves an enduring reputation there are men not few esteemed like the popu lar novelist not their art but some foolish gift some facile trick of notoriety whose actions have tickled the fancy not the understanding of the world the coward and the impostor have been set upon pedestal of glory either by accident or by the whim of posterity more than century dick turpin has appeared not so much the greatest of highwaymen the highwaymen incarnate his prowess has been extolled in novels and upon the stage his ride to york is still bepraised feat of miraculous courage and endurance the death of black bess has drawn ﬂoods of tears down the most callous cheeks and the truth is that turpin was never gentleman of the road at all black bess is pure an invention the famous ride to york the rufﬁan who is said to have ridden the phantom mare from one end of england to the other was common butcher who burned an old woman to death at epping and was very properly hanged at york the stealing of horse which he dared not bestride not one incident in his career gives colour to the splendid myth which has been woven round his memory once he was in london and he died at york so much is true but there is naught to prove that his progress from the one town to the other did not occupy year nor is there any reason why the halo should have been set upon his head rather than upon another strangest truth of all none knows at what moment dick turpin ﬁrst shone into glory at any rate there is gap in the tradition and the of the time may not be credited with this vulgar error perhaps it was the popular drama of skelt which put the rufﬁan upon the black mare back but whatever the date of the invention turpin was popular hero long before ainsworth sent him rattling across england and in order to equip this butcher with false reputation valiant ofﬁcer and gentleman was stripped of the credit due to magniﬁcent achievement though turpin tramped to york at journeyman leisure nicks rode thither at the intrepid and gallant whom charles in admiration of his feat was wont to call swiftnicks this valiant collector whom posterity has robbed turpin embellishment lived at the highest moment of his art he knew by rote the lessons taught by hind and duval he was fearless rider and courteous thief now one morning at ﬁve of the clock he robbed gentleman near barnet of and riding straight york he appeared on the bowling green at six in the evening being presently recognised by his victim he was apprehended and at the trial which followed he pleaded triumphant alibi but vanity was too strong discretion and sooner was swiftnicks out of danger than he boasted well he might of his splendid courage forthwith he appeared popular hero obtained commission in lord moncastle regiment and married fortune and then came turpin to ﬁlch his glory nor need turpin have stooped to vicarious notoriety he possessed certain rough half conscious humour which was not despicable he purchase d new fustian coat and pair of pumps in which to be hanged and he hired ﬁve poor men at ten shillings the day that his death might not go unmourned above all he was distinguished in prison crowd thronged his cell to identify him and one there was who offered to bet the keeper half guinea that the prisoner was not turpin whereupon turpin whis pered the keeper him the wager you fool and i will go you halves surely this impudent indifference might have kept green the memory of the man who never rode to york if the scoundrel may claim distinction on many grounds his character is singularly uniform to the anthropologist he might well appear the survival of savage race and savage also are his manifold superstitions he is creature of times and seasons he chooses the occasion of his deeds with scrupulous care he examines his formidable crowbars and jemmies at certain hours he would refrain from action though every circumstance favoured his success he would rather obey the restraining voice of wise unreasoning wizardry than ﬁll his pockets with the gold which his human soul is ever hungry there is law of man he dares not break but he shrinks in horror from the infringement of the unwritten rules of savagery though he might cut throat in defence he would never walk under ladder and if the 13th fell on friday he would starve that day rather than obtain loaf by the method he best understands he consults the omens with patient divination the augurs of old and so long he carries an amulet in his pocket though it be but pebble or polished nut he is ﬁlled with an irresistible courage him the worst terror book of scoundrels by charles whibley https is the evil eye and he would rather be hanged by an unsuspected judge than receive an easy stretch from one whose glance he dared not face and while the anthropologist claims him savage whose civilisation has been arrested at brotherhood with the solomon islanders the politician might pronounce him true communist in that he has preserved wholesome contempt of property and civic life the pedant again would feel his bumps prescribe gentle course of bromide and hope to cure all the sins of the world by municipal turkish bath the wise man respecting his superstitions is content to take him he ﬁnds him and to deduce his character from his very candid history which is unaf fected by pedant or politician before all things he is sanguine he believes that chance the great god of his endeavour ﬁghts upon his side whatever is lacking enterprise will fulﬁl and if only the omens be favourable he fears neither detection nor the gallows his courage proceeds from this sanguine temperament strengthened by shame and tradition rather than from magnanimity he hopes until despair is inevitable and then walks ﬁrmly to the gallows that comrade may suspect the white feather his ambition too is the ambition of the savage or of the child he despises such immaterial advantages power and inﬂuence being perfectly content if he have smart coat on his back and bottle of wine at his elbow he would rather pick lock than batter constitution and the world would be well lost if he and his doxy might survey the ruin in comfort but if his ambition be modest his love of notoriety is boundless he must be famous his name must be in the mouths of men he must be immortal week in rough woodcut and then what matters it how soon the end his braveries have been hawked in the street his prowess has sold special edition he is the ﬁrst of his race until luckier rival eclipses him thus also his dandyism is inevitable it is not enough him to cover his must dress and though his taste is sometimes unbridled it is never insigniﬁcant indeed his biographers have recorded the expression of his fancy in coats and patiently and enthusiastically they have applauded his courage and truly the love of magniﬁcence which he shares with all artists is sincere and characteristic when an accomplice of jonathan wild robbed lady at windsor his equipage cost him forty pounds and nan hereford was arrested shoplifting at the very moment that four footmen awaited her return with an elegant his vanity makes him but prudish lover who desires to woo less than to be wooed and at all times and through all moods he remains the primeval sentimentalist he will detach his life entirely from the catchwords which pretend to govern his actions he will sit and croon the most heartrending ditties in celebration of and mother love and then set forth incontinently upon planned errand of plunder all his artistry he lacks balance ﬂagrantly popular politician or an advanced journalist therefore it is the more remarkable that in one point he displays certain caution he boggles at superﬂuous murder all his contempt of property he still preserves respect life and the least suspicion of unnecessary brutality sets not only the law but his own fellows against him like all men whose god is opportunity he is reckless gambler and like all gamblers he is monstrously extravagant in brief he is tangle of picturesque qualities which until our own generation was incapable of nothing save dulness the bible and the newgate these twain were geor ge borrow favourite reading and all save the psychologist and the pedant will applaud the preference the annals of the are distinguished by an epic severity fearless directness of speech which you will hardly match outside the iliad or the chronicles of the kings but the newgate calendar did not spring made into being it is the result of curious and gradual development the came ﬁrst with their bold type their coarse paper and their clumsy characteristic which none can contemplate without an enchanted sentiment here at last you come upon literature which has been read to pieces the very rarity of the slim rough volumes proves that they have been handed from one greedy reader to another until the great libraries alone are rich enough to harbour them they not boast the careful elegance of famous press many of them came from the of country town yet the least has simplicity and concision which are unknown in this age of popular ﬁction even their lack of invention is admirable the same woodcut might be used to represent guy earl of warwick or the last highwayman who suffered at tyburn so the same enterprise is ascribed with delightful ingenuousness to all the heroes who rode abroad under the stars to ﬁll their pockets the life and death of gamaliel ratsey delighted england in 1605 and was the example of after ages the anecdote of the road was already crystallised and henceforth the robber was unable to act contrary to the will of the thus there grew up of thievery the very book of scoundrels by charles whibley https the same motive suggests the fairytale and in the legends of every country there is an identical element which the anthropologists call so in the annals of adventure there is set of invariable incidents which are the essence of thievery the industrious hack s to whom we owe the entertainment of the being seedy parsons or lawyers clerks were conscious of their literary deﬁciencies they preferred to obey tradition rather than to invent ineptitudes so you may trace the same jest the same intrigue through the unnumbered lives of three centuries and if being philosopher you neglect the obvious plagiarism you may induce from these similarities cunning theory concerning the uniformity of the human brain but the easier explanation is always the more satisfactory and there is little doubt that in versatility the thief surpassed his historian had the still been scattered in disregarded corners they would have been unknown or misunderstood happily man of genius came in the nick to convert them into vivid and sparkling piece of literature the time could show this was captain alex ander smith whose lives of the highwaymen published in 1719 was properly described by its author ﬁrst impartial piece of this nature which ever appeared in english now captain smith inherited from nameless father other patrimony than ﬁerce loyalty to the stuarts and the sanguine temperament which views in horror life though mere foundling he managed to acquire the rudiments and he was not wholly unlettered when at eighteen he took to the road his courage fortiﬁed by an intimate knowledge of the great tradition was rewarded by an immediate success and he rapidly became the master of so much leisure enabled him to pursue his studies with pleasure and distinction when his companions damned him milksop he was loftily contemptuous conscious that it was not in intelligence alone that he was their superior while the stuarts were the gods of his idolatry while the regicides were the ﬁends of his frank abhorrence it was from the elizabethans that he caught the splendid vigour of his style and he owed not only his historical sense but his living english to the example of philemon holland moreover it is to his constant glory that living at time that preferred well to attenuate the english tongue to degrade the profession of the highway he not only rode abroad with fearless courtesy but handled his own language with the force and spirit of an earlier age he wrote with the authority of courage and experience hazardous career had driven envy and malice from his dauntless breast thoug h he confesses debt to certain and eminent divines of the church of england he owed greater debt to his own observation and he better to recognise with enthusiasm those deeds of daring which only himself has rivalled master of etiquette he distributed approval and censure with impartial hand and he was quick to condemn the smallest infraction of an ancient law nor was he insensible to the dignity of history the best models were always before him with admirable zeal he studied the manner of such masters thucydides and titus livius of padua above all he realised the importance of setting appropriate speeches in the mouths of his characters and permitting his heroes to speak themselves he imparted to his work an irresistible air of reality and good faith his style always studied was neither too low nor too high his subject an sentence was hateful to him foul thrust or stolen advantage abroad craftsman he carried into the closet the skill and energy which distin guished him when the moon was on the heath though not born to the arts of peace he was determined to prove his respect letters and his masterpiece is less pompous in manner than it is estimable in tone and sound in reﬂection he handled slang one who knew its limits and possibilities employing it not the sake of eccentricity but to give the proper colour and sparkle to his page indeed his intimate acquaintance with the vagabonds of speech enabled him to compile dictionary of pedlar french which has been pilfered by whole battalion of imitators moreover there was none of the proverbs of the pavement those ﬁrst cousins of slang that escaped him and he assumed all the licence of the in the treatment of his captain smith took the justest view of his subject him robbery in the street on the highway was the ﬁnest of the arts and he always revered it its own sake rather than vulgar proﬁt though to deceive the public he abhorred villainy in word he never concealed his admiration in deed of who robs like gentleman is beauty in all the works of nature he observes in one of his wittiest exordia we are unable to deﬁne though all the world is convinced of its existence so in every action and station of life there is grace to be attained which will make man pleasing to all about him and serene in his own mind some there are he continues who have placed beauty in vice itself otherwise it is hardly probable that they could commit so many irregularities with strong gust and an appearance of satisfaction book of scoundrels by charles whibley https that the word is used in its conventional sense we have here the key to captain smith position he judged his heroes achievements with the intellig ent impartiality of connoisseur and he permitted other prejudice than an unfailing loyalty to interrupt his opinion though he loved good english he loved good wine he was never so happy when in imagination he was tying the legs of regicide under the belly of an ass and when in the manner of bookseller hack he compiled comical and tragical history of the lives and adventures of the most noted baylif fs adoration of the royalists persuaded him to miss his chance so brave spirit himself should not have looked complacently upon the ofﬁcers of the law but he saw in the gloriﬁcation of the baylif f another chance of castigating the roundheads and thus he set an honoriﬁc crown upon the brow of man natural enemy unsanctiﬁed rascals wrote he run into any man debt without paying him and if their creditors were cavaliers they thought they had much right to cheat the israelite s had to spoil the egyptians of their and jewels alas the boot was ever on the other leg and yet you can not but admire the captain valiant determination to sacriﬁce probability to his legitimate hate of his declining years and death there is record one likes to think of him released from care and surrounded by books ﬂowers and the good things of this earth now and again maybe he would muse on the stirring deeds of his youth and more often he would put away the memory of action to delight in the masterpiece which made him immortal he would recall with pleasure doubt the ready praise of richard steele his most appreciative critic and smile contemptuously at the baseness of his friend and successor captain charles johnson now this ingenious writer was wont to boast when the ale of fleet street had empurpled his nose that he was the most intrepid highwayman of them all upon time he would shout with an arrogant gesture i was known from blackheath to hounslow from ware to shooter hill and the truth is the only he ever committed was plagiarism the title of captain should have deceived nobody the braggart never stole anything more difﬁcult of acquisition than another man words he picked brains not pockets he committed the greater sin and ran risk he helped himself to the admirable inventions of captain smith without apology or acknowledgment and though to lighten the of his sin he never skipped an opportunity of maligning his victim again and again in the very act to steal he will declare vaingloriously that captain smith stories are inventions but doubt was check to the habit of plunder and you knew that at every reproach expressed so to say in he plied the scissors with the greater energy the most cunning theft is the tag which adorns the of his book little villains oft submit to fate that great ones may enjoy the world in state thus he quotes from gay and you applaud the aptness of the quotation until you discover that already it was used by steele in his appreciation of the heroic smith however johnson has his uses and those to whom the masterpiece of captain alexander is inaccessible will turn with pleasure to the general history of the lives and adventures of the most famous highwaymen murderers and will feel regret that once they are receiving stolen goods though johnson fell immeasurably below his predecessor in talent he manifestly excelled him in scholarship sojourn at the university had supplied him with ﬁne assortment of latin tags and he delighted to prove his erudition by the citation of the chronicles had he possessed sense of humour he might have smiled at the irony of committing theft upon the historian of thieves but he was too vain and too pompous to smile at his own weakness and thus he would pretend himself venturesome highwayman brave writer and profound scholar indeed so far did his pride carry him that he would have the world believe him the same charles johnson who wrote the gentleman cully and the successful pyrate thus with boastful chuckle he would quote johnson who now to sense now nonsense leaning means not but blunders round about meaning thus ignoring the insult he would plume himself after his drunken fashion that he too was an enemy of pope yet johnson has remained an example the literature of scoundrelism is persistent in its form in its harman caveat which ﬁrst saw the light in 1566 serves model to an unbroken series of such books the london spy so from johnson in due course were developed the newgate calendar and those innumerable records which the latter half of book of scoundrels by charles whibley https century furnished us forth the celebrated calendar was in its origin nothing more than list of prisoners printed in folio slip but thereafter it became the malefactor bloody register which we know its plan and purpose were to improve the occasion the thief is longer esteemed an artist or appraised upon his merits he is the awful warning which shall lead the sinner to repentance says the preface giddy thoughtless youth may see in mirror the fatal consequences of deviating from virtue here he may tremble at the discovery that the best talents are prostituted to the basest purposes but in spite of proper reﬂections of the whole affair the famous calendar deserved the praise of borrow there is directness in the narration which captures all those whom life and literature are something better than psychologic formulæ moreover the motives which drive the brigand to his doom are brutal in their simplicity and withal genuine and sincere greed vanity and lust can make them the true amateur takes pleasure even in the pious exhortations because he knows that they crawl into their place lest the hypocrite be scandalised but with years the newgate calendar also declined and at last it has followed other dead literatures into the night meanwhile the broadside had enjoyed an unbroken and prosperous career up and down london up and down england hurried the patterer or flying stationer there was murder theft conspiracy which did not tempt the gutter muse to doggerel but it was not until james catnach came up from alnwick to london in 1813 that the trade reached the top of its prosperity the vast sheets which he published with their scurvy couplets and the admirable picture serving in its time hundred executions have not lost their power to fascinate theirs is the aspect of the early woodcut the coarse type and the catchpenny headlines are perpetual delight you unfold them your care keeps pace with your admiration and you can not feel them crackle beneath your hand without enthusiasm and without regret he was catnach and the image of his rufﬁans was commonly far from portraiture his verses were remote from poetry but he put together in roughly artistic shape the last murder robbery or scandal of the day his masterpieces were far too popular to live and if they knew so vast circulation they are hard indeed to come by and now the art is wellnigh dead though you may discover an infrequent survival in country town but how should catnach were he alive compete with the special edition of an evening print the decline of the scoundrel in fact has been followed by the disappearance of and broadside the education act which made the cheap novel necessity destroyed at blow the literature of the street since the highwayman wandered into the city the patterer has lost his occupation robbery and murde r have degenerated into chinese puzzles whose solution is pleasant irritant to the idle brain the misunderstanding of poe has produced vast polyglot literature which one would not give in exchange single chapter of captain smith vautrin and bill sykes are already discredited and it is false reﬂection of dupin which dazzles the eye of moral and unimaginative world yet the wise man sighs those fearless days when the brilliant macheath rode vizarded down shooter hill and presently saw his exploits set forth with the proper accompaniment of renowned and ancient woodcut upon penny broadside capt ain hind james hind the master thief of england the fearless captain of the highway was born at chipping norton in his father simple saddler had so poor an appreciation of his son magnanimity that he apprenticed him to butcher but hind destiny was to embrue his hands in other than the blood of oxen and he had not long endured the restraint of this common craft when forty shillings the gift of his mother purchased him an escape and carried him triumphant and ambitious to london even in his negligent schooldays he had fastened upon ﬁtting career born adventurer he sought only enterprise and command if commission in the army failed him then he would risk his neck upon the road levying his own tax and imposing his own conditions to one of his dauntless resolution an opportunity need never have lacked yet he owed his ﬁrst preferment to happy accident surprised one evening in drunken brawl he was hustled into the poultry counter book of scoundrels by charles whibley https made acquaintance over fresh bottle with robert allen one of the chief rogues in the park and rufﬁan who had mastered every trick in the game of plunder dexterous an intrepid blade allen had also the keenest eye untested talent and he detected hind shining qualities after the ﬁrst glass sooner had they paid the price of release than hind was admitted of his comrade gang he took the oath of fealty and by way of winning his spurs was bid to hold up traveller on shooter hill granted his choice of mount he straightway took the ﬁnest in the stable with that keen perception of which never deserted him and he confronted his ﬁrst victim in the liveliest of humours there was falter in his voice hint of inexperience in his manner when he shouted the and deliver the horseman fearful of his life instantly surrendered purse of ten sovereigns to the most practised assailant on the road whereupon hind with ﬂourish of ancient courtesy gave him twenty shillings to bear his charges said he handsale sake and thus they parted in mutual compliment and content allen was overjoyed at his novice prowess you not see he cried to his companions he robbed him with grace and well did the trooper deserve his captain compliment his art was perfect from the ﬁrst in bravery in gallantry he knew rival and he plundered with so elegant style that only churlish victim could resent the extortion he would soon have turned his back upon an enemy demand purse uncovered every man he had quip every woman compliment nor did he ever conceal the truth that the means were him important the end though he loved money he still insisted that it should be yielded in freedom and good temper and while he emptied more coaches than any man in england he was never at loss admirers under allen he served brilliant apprenticeship enrolled servant he speedily sat at the master right hand and his nimble brains devised many pretty campaign while success dogged the of the gang with wealth came immunity and not one of the warriors had the misfortune to look out upon the world through grate they robbed with dignity even with splendour now they would drive forth in coach and four carrying with them whole armoury of offensive weapons now they would take the road apparelled noblemen and attended at discreet distance by their proper servants but recklessness brought the inevitable disaste r and it was less personage than oliver cromwell who overcame the hitherto invincible allen handful of the gang attacked oliver on his way from huntingdon but the marauders were outmatched and the most of them were forced to surrender allen taken swung at tyburn hind with his better mount and defter horsemanship rode clear away the loss of his friend was lesson in caution and henceforth hind resolved to follow his craft in solitude he had embellished his native talent with all the instruction that others could impart and he reﬂected that he who rode alone neither ran risk of discovery nor had any need to share his booty thus he began his easy untrammelled career making time and space of account by his rapid fearless journeys now he was prancin g the moors of yorkshire now he was scouring the plain between gloucester and tewkesbury but wherever he rode he had purse in his pocket and jest on his tongue to recall his prowess is to ride with him in fancy under the open sky along the fair beaten road to put up with him at the busy white posthouse to drink unnumb ered pints of mulled sack with the landlord to exchange boastful stories over the hospitable ﬁre and to ride forth in the morning with the joyous uncertainty of travel upon you failure alone lay outside his experience and he presently became at once the terror and the hero of england not only was his courage conspicuous luck also was his constant compan ion and happy bewitchment protected him three years against the possibility of harm he had been lying at hatﬁeld at the geor ge inn and set out in the early morning london he neared the an old beldame begged an alms of him and though hind not liking her visage would have spurred forward the beldame glittering eye held his horse motionless woman cried hind ﬂinging her crown i am in haste pray let pass answered the witch days i have awaited your coming would you have lose my labour now and with hind assent the sphinx delivered her message hind said she life is beset with constant danger and since from your birth i have wished you well my poor skill has devised perfect safeguard with this she gave him small box containin g what might have

my devotion seek again and i will renew the virtue of the charm book of scoundrels by charles whibley https took the box joyfully but when he turned to murmur word of gratitude the witch struck his nag ﬂanks with white wand the horse leapt vehemently forward and hind saw his benefactress more henceforth however warning voice spoke to him plainly did the demon to socrates and had he but obeyed the beldame admonition he might have escaped violent death he passed the last day of the third year at the siege of youghal where deprived of happy guidance he was seriously woun ded and whence he presently regained england to his own undoing so long he kept to the road his life was one long comedy his wit and address were inexhaustible and fortune never found him at loss he would avert suspicion with the tune of psalm when habited like pious shepherd he broke traveller head with his crook and deprived him of his horse an early adventure was to force parson who had drunk cup too much at wedding into rarely farcical situation hind having robbed two gentlemen servants of round sum went ambling along the road until he encountered parson said he i am closely pursued by robbers you i dare swear will not stand by and see plundered before the parson could protest he thrust pistol into his hand and bade him ﬁre it at the ﬁrst comer while he rode off to raise the county meanwhile the riﬂed travellers came up with the parson who straightway mistaking them thieves ﬁred without effect and then riding forward ﬂung the pistol in the face of the nearest thus the parson of the parish was dragged before the magistrate while hind before his dupe could furnish an explanation had placed many mile between himself and his adversary though he could on occasion show clean pair of heels hind was never lackin g in valiance and another day meeting traveller with hundred pounds in his pocket he challenged him to ﬁght there and then staked his own horse against the money and declared that he should win who drew ﬁrst blood i am the conqueror said the magnanimous captain i will give you ten pounds your journey if you are favoured of fortune you shall give your servant horse the terms were instantly accepted and in two minutes hind had run his adversary through the but ﬁnding that his victim was but poor squire going to london to pay his composition he not only returned his money but sought him out surgeon and gave him the best dinner the countryside could af ford thus it was his pleasure to act providence many time robbing peter to pay paul and stripping the niggard that he might indulge his fervent love of generosity of all usurers and bailif fs he had wholesome horror and merry was the prank which he played upon the extortionate lender of warwick riding on an easy rein through the town hind heard tumult at street corner and inquiring the cause was told that an innkeeper was arrested by thievish usurer paltry twenty pounds dismounting this providence in dischar ged the debt cancelled the bond and took the innkeeper goods his own security and thereupon overtaking the usurer friend he exclaimed i lent you late sum of twenty pounds repay it at once or i take your miserable life the usurer was obliged to return the money with another twenty interest and when he would take the law of the innkeeper was shown the bond duly cancelled and was ﬂogged wellnigh to death his pains so hind rode the world up and down redressing grievances like an eastern monarch and rejoicing in the abasement of the evildoer nor was the spirit of his adventure bounded by the ocean more than once he crossed the seas the hague knew him and amsterdam though these somnolent cities gave small occasion the display of his talents it was from scilly that he crossed to the isle of man where being recommended to lord derby he gained high favour and received in exchange his jests comfortable stipend hitherto said the chronicles thieving was unknown in the island man might walk whither he would bag of gold in one hand switch in the other and fear danger but sooner had hind appeared at douglas than honest citizens were pilfered at every turn in dismay they sought the protection of the governor who instantly suspected hind and gallantly disclosed his suspicions to the captain lord exclaimed hind blush upon his cheek i protest my innocence but willingly will i suffer the heaviest penalty of your law if i am recognised the thief the victims confronted with their robber knew him not picturing to the governor monster with long hair and unkempt beard hind acquitted with apologies fetched from his lodging the disguise of periwig and beard laugh who win he murmured and thus forced forgiveness and chuckle even from his judges became captain hind was staunch in his loyalty to his murdered king to strip the wealthy was always reputable but to rob regicide was masterpiece of book of scoundrels by charles whibley https fervent zeal to lighten cromwell pocket had brought the illustrious allen to the gallows but hind was not one whit abashed and he would never forego the chance of an encounter with his country enemies his treatment of hugh peters in enﬁeld chace is among his triumphs at the ﬁrst encounter the presbyterian plucked up courage enough to oppose his adversary with texts to hind command of and deliver duly enforced with loaded pistol the ineffable peters replied with sanctimoniously upturned shalt not steal let him that stole steal more adding thereto other variations of the eighth commandment hind immediately countered with exhortations against the awful sin of murder and rebuked the blasphemy of the regicides who to defend their own infamy would wrest scripture from its meaning you not monster of impiety mimicked hind in the preacher own voice your own advantage the words of the psalmist who said bind their kings with chains and their nobles with fetters of iron moreover was it not solomon who wrote men not despise thief if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry and is not my soul hungry gold and the regicides discomﬁture peters was still fumbling after texts when the ﬁnal argument thy money or i will send thee out of the world frightened him into submission and thirty broad pieces were hind reward not long afterwards he confronted bradshaw near sherborne and having taken from him purse fat with jacobuses he bade the sergeant stand uncovered while he delivered discourse upon gold thus shaped by tradition marry sir this is the metal that wins my heart ever precious gold i admire and adore thee much bradshaw prynne or any villain of the same stamp this is that incomparable medicament which the republican physicians call the wonder plaster it is truly catholic in operation and somewhat akin to the jesuit powder but more effectual the virtues of it are strange and various it makes justice deaf well blind and takes out spots of the deepest treason more cleverly than does common stains it alters man constitution in two or three days more than the virtuo so transfusion of blood can in seven years is great alexiopharmick and helps poisonous principles of rebellion and those that use them it miraculously exalts and puriﬁes the eyesight and makes traitors behold nothing but innocence in the blackest malefactors is mighty cordial declining cause it stiﬂes faction or

properly applied to the ﬁst that is in decent manner and competent dose it infalli bly performs all the cures which the evils of humanity crave thus having spoken he killed the six horses of bradshaw coach and went contemptuously on his way but he was not cavalier merely in sympathy nor was he content to prove his loyalty by robbing roundheads he too would strike blow his king and he showed ﬁrst with the royal army in scotland and afterwards at worcester what he dared in righteous cause indeed it was his part in the unhappy battle that cost him his life and there is strange irony in the reﬂection that on the same day whereon sir thomas urquha rt lost his precious manuscripts in worcester kennels the neck of james hind was made ripe the halter his capture was due to treachery towards the end of 1651 he was lodged with one denzys barber over against dunstan church in fleet street maybe he had chosen his its neighbourhood to moll cutpurse own sanctuary but pack of traitors discovered him and haling him before the speaker of the house of commons got him committed forthwith to newgate at ﬁrst he was charged with theft and murder and was actually condemned killing geor ge sympson at knole in berkshire but the day after his sentence an act of obliv ion was passed and hind was put upon trial treason during his examination he behaved with the utmost gaiety boastfully enlar ging upon his services to the king cause are ﬁlthy jingling spurs said he he left the bar pointing to the irons about his legs i hope to exchange them ere long his humour remained with him to the end he jested in prison he jested on the road and it was with light heart that he mounted the scaffold built him at worcester his was the fate reserved traitors he was hanged drawn and quartered and though his head was privily stolen and buried on the day of execution his quarters were displayed upon the town walls until time and the birds destoyed sic them utterly thus died the most famous highwayman that ever drew rein upon an english road and he died the death of hero the unnumbered crimes of violence and robbery wherewith he might have been charged weighed not feather weight upon his destiny he suffered not in the cause of plunder but in the cause of charles stuart and in thus excusing his death his contemporaries did him book of scoundrels by charles whibley https while in treasonable loyal ty he had thousand rivals on the road he was the ﬁrst exponent of the grand manner the middle of the seventeenth century was in truth the golden age of the road not only were all the highwaymen cavaliers but many cavalier turned highwayman broken at their king defeat hundred captains took pistol and vizard and revenged themselves freebooters upon the king enemies and though hind was outlaw ﬁrst and royalist afterwards he was still the most brilliant collector of them all if he owed something to his master allen he added from the storehouse of his own genius host of new precepts and was the ﬁrst to establish an enduring tradition before all things he insisted upon courtesy guinea stolen by an awkward rufﬁan was sorry theft levied by gentleman of the highway it was tribute paid to courage by generosity nothing would atone an insult offered to lady and when it was hind duty to seize part of gentlewoman dowry on the petersﬁeld road he not only pleaded his necessity in eloquent excuse but he made many promises on behalf of and damsels in distress never would he extort trinket to which association had given sentimental worth during long career he never left any man save roundhead penniless upon the road nor was it his custom to strip the master without giving the man triﬂe his pains his courage moreover was equal to his understanding since he was afraid of nothing it was not his habit to bluster when he was not determined to have his way when once his pistol was level led when once the solemn order was given the victim must either ﬁght or surrender and hind was never the man to decline combat with any weapons and in any circumstances like the true artist that he was he neglected detail of his craft he was perfect shot so also he was ﬁnished horseman and his skill not only secured him against capture but also helped him to the theft of such horses his necessities required or to the exchange of jade mettled prancer once upon time credulous farmer offered twenty pounds and his own gelding the captain mount hind struck bargain at once and they jogged along the road he persuaded the farmer to set his horse at the tallest hedge the broadest ditch the bumpkin failed hind knew he would fail and begging the loan an instant of his ancient steed hind not only showed what horsemanship could accomplish but straightway rode off with the better horse and twenty pounds in his pocket so marvellously did his reputation grow that it became distinction to be outwitted by him and the brains of innocent men were racked to invent tricks which might have been put upon them by the illustrious captain thus livelier jests and madder exploits were fathered upon him than upon any of his kind and he has remained two centuries the prime favourite of the robbing alone he could afford to despise pedantry did he meet traveller who amused his fancy he would give him the ﬁddler paid or what not though the highway had not its code of morals nor did he scruple when it served his purpose to rob the bunglers of his own profession by this means indeed he raised the standard of the road and warned the incompetent to embrace an easier trade while he never took shilling without sweetening his depredation with joke he was like all humorists an acute philosopher what i tell you he said to the foolish persons who once attempted to rob him the master of england not yourself small sums but aim high and great ones the least will bring you to the gallows there in ﬁve lines is the whole philosophy of thieving and many poor devil has leapt from the cart to his last dance because he neglected the counsel of the illustrious hind among his aversions were lawyers and i could wish he exclaimed in court fees were little used in england among lawyers the eating of swine ﬂesh was among the jews when you remember the terms of friendship whereon he lived with moll cutpurse his hatred of the catcher who would hang his brother lucre of ten pounds which is the reward or who would swallow false oath easily one would swallow buttered ﬁsh is triﬂe mysterious perhaps before his death an estrangement divided hind and moll was it that the roaring girl was too anxious to take the credit of hind success or did he harbour the unjust suspicion that when the last descent was made upon him at the barber moll might have given friendly warning of this he made confession but the honest thief was ever liberal hater of spies and attorneys and hind prudence is unquestioned miracle of intelligence master of style he excelled all his contemporaries and set up posterity an unattainable standard the eightee nth century ﬂattered him by its imitation but cowardice and swagger compelled it to limp many dishonourable league behind despite the single inspiration of dancing corant upon the green claude duval compared to hind was an empty braggart captain stafford spoiled the best of his effects with more book of scoundrels by

her acquainted with all the divers and rumpads of the town the time moreover was favourable to enterprise and once again was genius born into golden age the cutting of purses was an art brought to perfection and already the more elegant practice of picking pockets was understood the transition gave scope endless ingenuity and moll was not slow in mastering the theory of either craft it was changing fashion of dress i have said which forced new tactic upon the thief the pocket was invented because the hanging purse was too easy prey the thievish scissors and sooner did the world conceal its wealth in pockets than the was born to extract the booty with his long nimble ﬁngers the trick was managed with an admirable forethought which has been constant example to after ages the ﬁle was always accompanied by bull whose duty it was to jostle and distract the victim while his pockets were riﬂed the bung or what not was rapidly passed on to the attendant rub who scurried off before the cry of stop thief could be raised thus was the craft of thieving practised when moll was enrolled humble member of the gang yet nature had not endowed her with the qualities which ensure an active triumph best signs and marks of happy industrious hand wrote the hoyden long middle ﬁnger equally suited with that they call the fool or ﬁrst ﬁnger now though she was never clumsy jade the practice of

her gang get to work overnight and carry off wealthy swag she had due intelligence of the affair betimes next morning so that furnished with an inventory of the booty she might make just division or

freedom if he dared conceal the booty that was his he had an enemy more powerful than the law and many time did contumacy pay the last penalty at the gallows but the faithful also had their reward moll never deserted comrade and while she lived in perfect safety herself she knew well how to contrive the safety of others nor was she content merely to dischar ge those duties of the fence which an instinct of statecraft designed her her restless brain seethed with plans of plunder and if her hands were idle it was her direction that emptied half the pockets in london having drilled her army of divers to an unparalleled activity she cast about some fresh method of warfare and so enrolled regiment of heavers who would lurk at the mercers doors an opportunity to carry off ledgers and the price

ever seeking her aid and already empress of the thieves she presently aspired to the friendship and patronage of the highwaymen though she did not dispose of their booty she was appointed their banker and vast was the treasure entrusted to the coffers of honest moll now it was her pride to keep only the best company she hated stupidity worse than clumsy hand and they were men of wit and spirit who frequented her hous thither came the famous captain hind the regicides inveterate enemy whose lofty achievements moll with an amiable extravagance was wont to claim her own thither came the unamiably notorious mull sack who once emptied cromwell pocket on the mall and whose courage was formidable his tongue another favourite was the ingenious crowder whose humour it was to take the road habited like bishop and who surprised the victims of his greed with ghostly counsel thus it was merry party that assembled in the lady parlour loyal to the memory of the martyred king and quick to ﬂing back an of fending pleasantry but the house in fleet street was refuge well resort the sanctuary of hundred rascals whose misdeeds were not too ﬂagrantly discovered while moll always allowed discretion to govern her conduct while she would risk present security vague promise of advantages to come her secret inﬂuence in newgate made her more powerful than the hangman and the whole bench of judges there was turnkey who was not her devoted servitor but it was the clerk of newgate to whom she and her family were most deeply beholden this was one ralph briscoe pretty fellow ever deserted the law though wizened and clerkly in appearance he was of lofty courage and moll was heard to declare that had she not been sworn to celibacy she would have cast an eye upon the faithful ralph who was obedient to her behests whether at gaol delivery or bear garden her he would pack jury or get reprieve him she would bait bull with the ﬁercest dogs in london why then should she fear the law when the clerk of newgate and gregory the hangman fought upon her side others the arbiter of life and death she was only thrice in an unexampled career confronted with the law her ﬁrst occasion of arrest was so paltry that it brought discredit only on the constable this very dogberry encountered moll returning down ludg ate hill from some lanthorn carried pompously before her startled by her attire he questioned her closely and receiving insult answer promptly carried her to the round house the customary garnish made her free or the prison and next morning brief interview with the lord mayor restored moll to liberty but not to getfulness she had yet to wreak her vengeance upon the constable monstrous affront and hearing presently that he had rich uncle in shropshire she killed the old gentleman in imagination and made the constable his heir instantly retainer in the true garb and accent of the country carried the news to dogberry and sent him off to ludlow on the costliest of fool erran ds he purchased horse and set forth joyously became man of property he limped home broken in purse and spirit the hapless object of ridicule and contempt perhaps he guessed the author of this sprightly outrage but moll her part was far too ﬁnished humorist to reveal the truth and hereafter she was content to swell the jesting chorus her second encounter with justice was mere pleasantry and it was only her marvellous generalship that snatched her career from untimely ruin and herself from the clutch of master gregory two of her emissaries had encountered farmer in chancery lane they spoke with him ﬁrst at smithﬁeld and knew that his pocket was well lined with an improvised quarrel at threw the farmer off his guard and though he defended the money his watch was snatched from his fob and duly carried to moll the next day the victim anxio us to repurchase his watch repaired to fleet street where moll generously promised to recover the stolen property unhappily security had encouraged recklessness and the farmer turned to leave he espied his own watch hanging among other trinkets upon the wall with rare discretion he held his peace until he had called constable to his aid and this time the roaring girl was lodged in newgate with an ugly crime laid to her char ge committed trial she demanded that the watch should be left in the constable keeping and pleading not guilty when the sessions came round insisted that her watch and the farmer were not the same the farmer anxious to acknowledge his property demanded the constable to deliver the watch that it might be sworn to in open court and when the constable put his hand to his pocket the only piece of damning evidence had vanished stolen by the nimble ﬁngers of one of moll book of scoundrels by charles whibley https with admirable trickery and perfect sense of dramatic effect she contrived her escape and never again ran the risk of sudden discovery experience brought caution in its train and though this wiliest of fences lived almost within the shadow of newgate though she was familiar in the prison yard at the globe tavern her nightly resort she obeyed the rules of life and law with so precise an exactitude that suspicion could never fasten upon her her kingdom was midway between robbery and justice and she controlled the mystery of thieving so in reality she meted out punishment to the evildoer honest citizens were robbed with small risk to life or property moll always frowned upon violence and was ever ready to restore the booty fair ransom and the thieves driven by discipline to certain humanity plied their trade with an obedience and orderliness hitherto unknown moll then was mean achievement her career was not circumscribed by her trade and the roaring girl the daredevil companion of the wits and bloods enjoyed fame less glorious than the queen of thieves moll in frieze jerkin and black safeguard thus in the old comedy she comes upon the stage and truly it was by her clothes that she was ﬁrst notorious by accident woman by habit man she must needs invent costume proper to her pursuits but she was shrieking reformer fanatic spying regeneration in pair of breeches only in her attire she showed her wit and she went to in such dress well became her favourite sport she was not of those who in spurs but never ride the jerkin the doublet the galligaskins were put on to serve the practical purposes of life not to attract the policeman or the spinster and when petticoat spread its ample folds beneath the doublet not only was her array handsome but it symbolised the career of one who was neither man nor woman and yet both after while however the petticoat seemed too tame her stalwart temper and she exchange d it the great dutch slop habited in which unseemly garment she is pictured in the ancient prints up and down the town she romped and scolded earning the name which middleton gave her in her green girlhood has the spirit of four great parishes says the wit in the comedy voice that will drown all the city if gallant stood in the way she drew upon him in an instant and he must be clever swordsman to hold his ground against the tomboy who had laid low the german fencer himself good fellow always she had ever merry word the passer and so sharp was her tongue that none ever put trick upon her not to know moll was to be inglorious and she from one company to another like fat eel between dutchman ﬁngers now at parker ordinary now at the bear garden she frequented only the haunts of men and not until old age came upon her did she endure patiently the presence of women her voice and speech were suited to the galligaskin she was true disciple of maltre françois hating nothing so much mincing obscenity and if she ﬂavoured her discourse with many blasphemous quip the blasphemy was so malicious customary like the blood she was she loved good ale and wine and she regar ded it among her proudest titles to renown that she was the ﬁrst of women to smoke tobacco many was the pound of best virginian that she bought of mistress gallipot and the pipe with monkey dog and eagle is her constant emblem her antic attire the fearless courage of her pranks now and again involved her in disgrace or even jeopardised her freedom but her unchanging gaiety made light of disaster and still she laughed and rollicked in deﬁance of prude and pedant her companion in many fantastical adventure was banks the vintner of cheapside that same banks who taught his horse to dance and shod him with silver now once upon time right witty sport was devised between them the vintner bet moll that she would not ride from charing cross to shoreditch astraddle on horseback in breeches and doublet boots and spurs the hoyden took him up in moment and added of her own devilry trumpet and banner she set out from charing cross bravely enough and trumpeter being an unwonted spectacle the eyes of all the town were clapped upon her yet none knew her until she reached bishopsgate where an set up the cry cutpurse on horseback instantly the cavalie r was surrounded by noisy mob some would have torn her from the saddle an imagined insult upon womanhood others more wisely minded laughed at the prank with merrime nt every minute the throng grew denser and it had fared hardly with roystering moll had not wedd ing and the arrest of debtor presently distracted the gaping idlers the mob turned to gaze at the fresh wonder she spurred her horse until she gained newington by an unfrequented lane there she waited until night should cover her progress to shoreditch and thus peacefully she returned home to lighten the vintner pocket of twenty book of scoundrels by charles whibley https fame of the adventure spread abroad and that the scandal should not be repeated moll was summoned before the court of arches to answer charge of appearing publicly in mannish apparel the august tribunal had terror her and she received her sentence to penance in white sheet at paul cross during on sunday with an audacious contempt might well have shamed black dog she proudly exclaimed and why should she dread the white sheet when all the spectators looked with lenient eye upon her professed discomﬁture halfpenny she said would have travelled to every of england in the guise of penitent and having tippled off three quarts of sack she swaggered to paul cross in the maddest of humours but not all the courts on earth could lengthen her petticoat or contract the dutch slop by single fold while perhaps she chastened her costume yet she soon reverted to the ancient mode and to her dying day went habited man bear baiting was the passion of her life so she was scrupulous in the care and training of her dogs she gave them each wrapping them from the cold in sheets and blankets while their food would not have dishonoured gentleman table parrots too gave sense of colour and companionship to her house and it was in this love of pets and her devotion to cleanliness that she showed trace of dormant womanhood abroad ribald and scold at home she was the neatest of housewives and her parlour with its mirrors and its manifold ornaments was the envy of the neighbours so her trade ﬂourished and she lived life of comfort of plenty even until the civil war threw her out of work when an unnatural conﬂict set the whole country at loggerheads what occasion was there the honest prig and it is not surprising that like all the gentlemen adventurers of the age moll remained most stubbornly loyal to the king cause she made the conduit in fleet street run with wine when charles came to london in 1638 and it was her amiable pleasantry to give the name of straf ford to clever cunning bull and to dub the dogs that assailed him pym hampden and the rest that right heartily she might applaud the courage of straf ford he threw of f his unwary assailants so long the quarrel lasted she was compelled to follow profession more ancient than the fence there is one passion which war itself can not extinguish when once the king had laid his head upon bed when once the protector had proclaimed his supremacy the industry of the road revived and there was not single diver or rumpad that did not declare eternal war upon the regicides with laudable devotion to her chosen cause moll despatched the most experienced of her gang to rob lady fairfax on her way to church and there is tradition that the roaring girl hearing that fairfax himself would pass by hounslow rode forth to meet him and with her own voice bade him stand and deliver one would like to believe it yet it is scarce credible if fairfax had spent the balance of an ignominious career in being plundered by band of loyal brigands he would not have had time to justify the innumerable legends of pockets emptied and pistols levelled at his head moreover moll herself was laden with years and she had always preferred the council chamber to the battleﬁeld but it is certain that with captain hind and mull sack to aid she schemed many clever plot against the roundheads and nobly she played her part in avenging the martyred king thus she declined into old age attended like queen mary by her maids who would card reel spin and beguile her leisure with sweet singing though her spirit was untamed the burden of her years compelled her to tranquil life she who formerly never missed must now content herself with her fortune moreover had been wrecked in the civil war though silver shells still jingled in her pocket time was she knew the rattle of the yellow boys but she never lost courage and died at last of dropsy in placid contentment with her lot assuredly she was born at time well suited to her genius had she lived she might have been she might even have discussed some paltry problem of sex in printed obscenity in her own freer wiser age she was not man detractor but his rival and if she never knew the passion of love she was always loyal to the obligation of friendship by her will she left twenty pounds to celebrate the second charles restoration to his kingdom and you contemplate her career with the single regret that she died brief year before the red wine thus generously bestowed bubbled at the book of scoundrels by charles whibley https than wild when jonathan wild and the count la ruse in fielding narrative took hand at cards jonathan picked his opponent pocket though he knew it was empty while the count from sheer force of habit stacked the cards though wild had not farthing to lose and if in his uncultured youth the great man stooped to prig with his own hand he was early cured of the weakness so that fielding picture of the hero taking from the ordinary pocket in the very moment of death is entirely fanciful machiavel of thieves contemporary styled him left others to accomplish what his ingenuity had planned his was the high policy of theft if he lived on terms of familiar intimacy with the the the of london he was none the less the friend and minister of justice he enjoyed the freedom of newgate and the old bailey he came and went he liked he packed juries he procured bail he manufactured evidence and there was scarce an assize or sessions passed but he slew his man the world knew him robber yet could not refuse his brilliant service at the poultry counter you are told he laid the foundations of his future greatness and to the poultry counter he was committed some triﬂing debt ere he had fully served his apprenticeship to the art and mystery of there he learned his craft and at his enlar gement he was able forthwith to commence his plan was conceived with an effrontery that was nothing less than genius on the one side he was the factor or rather the tyrant of the on the other he was the trusted agent of justice the benefactor of the outraged and the plundered among his earliest exploits was the recovery of the countess of chair impudently carried off when her ladyship had but just alighted and the courage wherewith he brought to justice the murderers of one knap who had been slain some triﬂing booty established his reputation upon rock he at once advertised himself in the public prints general of great britain and ireland and proceeded to send to the gallows every scoundrel that dared dispute his position his opportunities of gain were inﬁnite even if he did not organise the robbery which his cunning was presently to discover he had spies in every hole and corner to set him on the felon track nor did he leave single enterprise to chance divided the city and suburbs into wards or divisions and appointed the persons who were to attend each ward and kept them strictly to their duty if subordinate dared to disobey or to shrink from murder jonathan hanged him at the next assize and happily him he had not single confederate whose neck he might not put in the halter when he chose thus he preserved the union and the ﬁdelity of his gang punishing by judicial murder the smallest insubordination the faintest suspicion of rivalry even when he had shut his victim up in newgate he did not leave him so long there was chance of blackmail he would make the most generous offers of evidence and defence to every thief that had stiver left him but whether or not he kept his depended upon policy and inclination on one occasion when he had brought friend to the old bailey and relented at the last moment he kept the prosecutor drunk from the noble motive of until the case was over and so esteemed was he of the ofﬁcers of the law that even this interference did but procure reprimand his meanest action marked him out from his fellows but it was not until he habitually pillaged the treasures he afterwards restored to their grateful owners handsome consi deration that his art reached the highest point of excellence the event was managed by him with amazing adroitness from beginning to end it was he who discovered the wealth and habit of the victim it was he who posted the thief and seized the plunder giving paltry commission to his hirelings the trouble it was he who kept whatever valuables were lost in the transaction and he was the servant of the court discovery or inconvenience was impossible surely the machiavel of thieves is justiﬁed of his title he was known to all the rich and titled folk in town and if he was generally able to give them back their stolen valuables at something more than double their value he treated his clients with most proper insolence when lady was unlucky enough to lose silver buckle at windsor she asked wild to recover it and offered the hero twenty pounds his trouble madam says he offer nothing it cost the gentleman who took it forty pounds his coach equipage and other expenses to windsor his impudence increased with success and in the geniality of his cups he was wont to boast his amazing rogueries not without vanity at the poor understandings of the greatest part of mankind and his own superior cunning book of

mary the hempen widow of scull his humour was most happily expressed he distribu ted white ribbons among the turnkeys he gave the ordinary gloves and favours he sent the prisoners of newgate several ankers of brandy punch was ﬁtting complaisance since his fortune was drawn from newgate and since he was destined himself few years later to drink liquor nowhere spoken against in the the same ordinary whom he thus magniﬁcently decorated endowed with conside rable courage while he had the prudence to save his skin and despite his bravado he was known on occasion to yield plundered treasure to an accomplice who set pistol to his head but it is certain that the accomplice died at tyburn his pains and on equal terms jonathan was resol ute with the best on the trail he was savage wild beast when he arrested james wright robbery committed upon the persons of the earl of and the lord bruce he held on to the victim chin by his exploit which reminds you of the illustrious tiger roche even in his lifetime he was generously styled the great the scour ge of london he betrayed and destroyed every man that ever dared to live upon terms of friendship with him it was jonathan that made blueskin thief and jonathan screened his creature from justice only so long clemency seemed proﬁtable at the ﬁrst hint of disobedience blueskin was committed to newgate when he had stood his trial and was being taken to the condemned hole he beckoned to wild though to conference and cut his throat with penknife the assembled rogues and turnkeys thought their jonathan dead at last and rejoiced exceedingly therein straightway the poet of newgate garland leaped into verse then hopeless of life he drew his penknife and made sad widow of jonathan wife but forty pounds paid her her grief shall appease and every man round may rob if he please but jonathan recovered and molly his wife was destined second time to win the conspicuous honour that belongs to hempen widow his career drew to its appointed close fortune withheld her smiles got so peery complained the great man ingeniou s men were put to dreadful shifts and then highest tribute to his greatness an act of parliament was passed which made it capital offence prig to steal with the hands of other people and in the increase of public vigilance his undoing became certain on the 2nd of january 1725 day not easy to forget creature of wild spoke with ﬁfty yards of lace worth at his captain bidding and wild having otherwise disposed of the plunder was charged on the 10th of march that he feloniously receive of katharine stetham ten guineas on account and under colour of helping the said katharine stetham to the said lace again and did not then nor any time since discover or apprehend or cause to be apprehended and brought to justice the persons that committed the said felony thus runs the indictment and to the inexpressible relief of lesser men jonathan wild was condemned to the gallows thereupon he had serious thoughts of his house in order with an ironical smile he demanded an explanation of the text is every one that hangeth on tree but presently reﬂecting that time was but short in this world he improved it to the best advantage in eating drinking swearing cursing and talking to his visitants all his bragging drink alone preserved his courage was very restless in the condemned hole though gave little or attention to the condemned sermon which the purblind ordinary preached before him and which was in fielding immortal phrase the greeks foolishness but in the moment of death his distinction returned to him he tried and failed to kill himself and his progress to the nubbing cheat was triumph of execration he reached tyburn through howling mob and died to yell of universal joy the ordinary has left record so preciou s and so lying that it must needs be quoted at length the great confession is masterpiece of comfort and is so far removed from the truth completely to justify fielding incomparable creation there was room mercy book of scoundrels by charles whibley https could i expect mercy who never showed any does the devil dodger dishonour our jonathan memory soon i came into the condemned hole i began to think of making preparation my soul to part with my wife my dear molly is so great an afﬂiction to that it touches to the quick and is like daggers entering into my heart how tame the ordinary falsehood to the brilliant invention of fielding who makes jonathan kick his tishy in the very shadow of the tree and the rever end gentleman gains in unction he goes the cart they all kneeled down to prayers and seemed very penitent the ordinary used all the means imaginable to make them think of another world and after singing penitential psalm they cry lord jesus christ receive our souls the cart drew away and they were all turned off this is good an account can be given by poor ordinary if he was modest he was also untruthful and you are certain that it was not thus the hero met his death even had fielding never written his masterpiece jonathan wild would still have been surnamed great scarce appeared in the year of jonathan death that did not expose the only right and true view of his character business says one hack of prison literature all times was to put false gloss upon things and to make fools of mankind another precisely formulates the theory of greatness insisted upon by fielding with so lavish an irony and so masterly wit while it is certain that the history of the late jonathan wild is noble piece of irony literature can show while the qualities of wit and candour it is equa l to its motive it is likewise true that therein you meet the indubitable jonathan wild it is an enter tainment to compare the of the time with the reasoned ﬁnished work of art not in any spirit of since accuracy in these matters is of small account but with intent to show how doubly fortunate fielding was in his genius and in his material of course the writer rejoiced in the aid of imagination and eloquence of course he embellished his picture with such inspirations miss laetitia and the count of course he preserves from the ﬁrst page to the last the highest level of unrivalled irony but the sketch was there before him and lawyer clerk had treated jonathan in vein of heroism within few weeks of his death and since plain statement is never so true ﬁction fielding romance is still more credible still convinces with an easier effort than the serious and pedestrian records of contemporaries nor can you return to its pages without realising that so far from being evolution of purely intellectual conception jonathan wild is magniﬁcently idealised and ironical portrait of great man parallel m oll cutpurse and jonathan w ild they plied the same trade each with incomparable success by her by him the art of the fence was carried to its ultimate perfection in their hands the high policy of theft wanted nor dignity nor assurance neither harboured single scheme which was not straightway translated into action and they were masters at once of newgate and the highway none might rob without the encouragement of his emperor so none was hanged at tyburn while intrigue or bribery might avail to drag neck from the halter and not even moll herself was more bitterly tyrannical in the control of reckless gang than the jonathan wild they were statesmen rather than if they might direct the enterprises of others and determined to punish the lightest disobedience by death the mind of each was readier than his right arm and neither would risk an easy advantage by misunderstood or unwonted sleight of hand but when you leave the exercise of their craft to contemplate their character with larger eye it is the woman who at every point has the advantage not only was she the peerless inventor of new cunning she was at home and abroad the better fellow the suppression of sex was in itself an unparalleled triumph and the most envious detractor could not but marvel at the domination of her womanhood moreover she shone in gayer more splendid epoch the worthy contemporary of shakespeare she had small difﬁculty in performing feats of

cut his throat but blunt and scratching like saw she laughed with laugh that echoed from ludgate to charing cross and her voice drowned all the city he grinned rarely and with malice he piped in voice shrill and acid the tricks of his mischievous imagination she knew cruelty beyond the necessities of her life and none regretted more than she the inevitable death of traitor he lusted after destruction with ﬁendish temper which was grim anticipation of sade he would even smile he saw the noose tighten round the necks of the poor innocents he had beguiled to tyburn it was his boast that he had contrived robberies the mere glory of dragging his silly victims to the gallows but moll though she stood between the robber and his prey would have sacriﬁced hundred commissions rather than see her friends and comrades strangled her temperament compe lled her to the loyal support of her own order and she would have shrunk in horror from her rival who all his assumed friendship with the thief was staunch and subtle ally of justice before all things she had the genius of success her public offences were trivial and condoned she died in her bed full of years and of honours beloved by the gentry reverenced by all the judges on the bench he all the sacriﬁces he made to law died execrated alike by populace and police already blueskin had done his worst with already jack sheppard and his comrades had warned drury lane against the infamous and so anxious on the other hand was the law to be quit of their too zealous servant that an act of parliament was passed with the sole object of placing jonathan head within the noose his method meagre though masterly lulled him too soon to an impotent security she with her larger view of life her plumper sense of style was content with nothing less than an ultimate sovereignty and manifestly did she prove her superiority though born the wimple she was more of man than the breeched and stockinged jonathan whose only deed of valiance was to hang terrier by his teeth to an evasive enemy while he cheated at cards and cogged the dice she trained dogs and never missed he shrank like the coward that he was from the exercise of manly sports she cared not what were the weapons f or long she vanquished her opponent she scoured the town in search of insult he did but exert his cunning when quarrel was put upon him who then shall deny

thousand pounds well lost if she did but compass the discomﬁture of indeed if jonathan the limped painfully after his magniﬁcent example jonathan the man and the sportsman confessed pitiful inferiority to the valiant moll thus she avenged her sex by distancing the most illustrious of her rivals and if he pleads his credit taste theology hers is the chuckle of contemptuous superiority she

inherited from some nameless warrior both courage and resource he was born in easy circumstances and gently nurtured in the distant village of kensington though cast in scholar mould and very apt learning he rebelled from the outset against career of inaction his lack of strength was never check upon his high stom ach he would ﬁght with boys of twice his size and accept the certain defeat in cheerful spirit of dogged pugnacity moreover if his arms were weak his cunning was his tongue and before his stricken eye had paled he had commonly executed an ample vengeance upon his enemy nor was it industry that placed him at the top of the class ready wit made him master of the knowledge he despised but he would always desert his primer to follow the hangman lumbering cart up tyburn hill and still mere imp of mischief he would run the weary way from kensington to shoe lane on the distant chance of he was present so he would relate in after years when sir thomas jermin man put his famous

to ﬁght the cock in sir thoma s jermin name and laid level hundred against his own bird so lofty was sir thomas repute that backers were easily found but the dunghill rooster instantly showed clean pair of heels and the cheat was justiﬁed of his cunning thus ralph briscoe learnt the ﬁrst lessons in that art of sharping wherein he was afterwards an adept and when he left school his head was packed with many proﬁtable device which book learning could impart his father howev er still resolute that he should join an intelligent profession sent him to gray inn that he might study law here

her that wisest of reasons which is reason at all because he loved her in his eyes she was the queen not of misrule but of hearts had throne been his she should have shared it and he wooed her with shy intensity which ennobled him even in her austere regard alas she was unable to return his passion and she lamented her own obduracy with characteristic humour she made attempt to conceal her admiration notable and famous person she called him confessing that was right her tooth and made to her mind in every part of him he had been bred up in the same exercise of baiting which was her own delight she had always praised his towardliness and prophesied his preferment but when he paid her court she was obliged to decline the honour while she esteemed the compliment in truth she was completely insensible to passion or she exclaimed in phrase of brilliant independence i should have hired him to my embraces the sole possibility that remained was platonic friendship and briscoe accepted the situation in excellent humour since he came to know himself again it is moll that speaks always deported himself to with an abundance of regard calling his aunt and his aunt she remained unto the end bound to him in proper and natural alliance different they were in aspect they were strangely alike in taste and disposition nor was the paris garden their only his sorry sojourn in gray inn had thrown him on the side of the aker and he had acquired strange cunning in the difﬁcult art of evading justice instantly moll recognised his practical value and exerting all her talent intrigue presently secured him the clerkship of newgate here at last he found scope not only his learning but that spirit of adventure that breathed within him his meagre acquaintance with letters placed him on pinnacle high above his colleagues now and then prisoner proved his equal in wit but he was manifestly superior in intelligence to the governor the ordinary and all the warders he speedily seized and hereafter retained the real sovereignty of newgate his early progress was barred by envy and contempt why asked the men in possession should this shrivelled stranger ﬁlch our privi leges and briscoe met their malice with an easy smile knowing that at all points he was more than their match his alliance with moll stood him in good stead and in few months the twain were the supreme arbiters of english justice should highwayman seek to save his neck he must ﬁrst pay fat indemnity to the newgate clerk but since moll was the appointed banker of the whole family she was quick to sanction whatever price her accomplice suggested and briscoe had hundred other tricks whereby he increased his riches and repute there was debtor came to newgate whom the clerk would not aid if he believed the kindness proﬁtable suppose his inquiries gave an assurance of his victim recovery he would house him comfortably feed him at his own table lend him money and even condescend to win back the generous loan by the his civility gave him general popularity among the prisoners and his appearance in the yard was signal subdued hilarity he drank and gambled with the roysterers he babbled cheap philosophy with the erudite and he sold the necks of all to the highest bidder though now and again he was convicted of mercy or revenge he commonly held himself aloof from human passions and pursued the one sane end of life in an easy security the hostility of his colleagues irked him but little few tags of latin the friendsh ip of moll and casual threat of exposure frightened the governor into acquiescence but the ordinary was more difﬁcult of conciliation the clerk had not been long in newgate before he saw that between the reverend gentleman and himself there could be naught save war hitherto the ordinary had reserved to his own proﬁt the right of intrigue he it was who had received the money of the sorrowing relatives and untied the noose when book of scoundrels by charles whibley https good to him briscoe insisted upon division of labour is your busin ess he said save the scoundrels in the other world leave to the proﬁt of their salvation in this and the clerk triumphed after his wont freedom jingled in his pocket he doled out comfort even life to the oppressed and he extorted comfortab le fortune in return privileges which were never in his gift without the walls of newgate the house of his frequentation was the tavern thither he would wander every afternoon to meet his clients and to extort in this haunt of criminals and pettifoggers man was better received than the newgate clerk and while he assumed manner of generous cordialit y it was strange sight to see him winc when some sturdy rufﬁan slapped him too strenuously upon the back he had joke and chuckle all and his merry quips dry they were were joyously quoted to all his legal ingenuity appeared miraculous and it was conﬁdently asserted in the coffee house that he could turn black to white with so persuasive an argument that there was judge on the bench to confute him but he was not omnipotent and his zeal encountered many serious check at times he failed to save the necks even of his intimates since when once rufﬁan was notorious moll and the clerk fought vainly his release thus it was that cheney the famous wrestler whom ralph had often backed against all comers died at tyburn he had been taken by the troopers upon the highway seized after desperate resistance he was wounded wellnigh to death and briscoe quoted dozen precedents to prove that he was unﬁt to be tried or hanged argument failing the muniﬁcent clerk offered ﬁfty pounds the life of his friend but to purpose the valiant wrestler was carried to the cart in chair and so lifted to the gallows which cured him of his gaping wounds when the commonwealth administered justice with pedantic severity briscoe inﬂuence still further declined there was longer scope in the state men of spirit even the gaols were handed over to the stern mercy of puritans moll herself had fallen upon evil times and ralph briscoe determined to make last effort wealth and retirement at the very moment when his expulsion seemed certain an heiress was thrown into newgate upon charge of murdering too importunate suitor the chain of evidence was complete the dagger plunged in his heart was recognised her own she was seen to decoy him to the secret corner of wood where his raucous was silenced ever taken off her guard she had even hinted confession of her crime and nothing but intrigue could have saved her gentle neck from the gallows briscoe hungry her promised assistance he bribed he threatened he cajoled he twisted the law only he could twist it he suppressed honest testimony he procured false in ﬁne he weakened the case against her with so resistless an effrontery that not the hanging judge himself could convict the poor innocent at the outset he had agreed to accept handsome bribe but the trial approached his avarice increased and he would be content with nothing less than the lady hand and fortune not that he loved her his heart was long since given to moll cutpurse but he knew that his career of depredation was at an end and it became him to provide his declining years the victim repulsed his suit regretting thousand times that she had stabbed her ancient lover at last bidden summarily to choose between death and the clerk she chose the clerk and thus ralph briscoe left newgate the richest squire in western county henceforth he farmed his land like gentleman drank with those of his neighbours who would crack bottle with him and unlocked the strange stores of his memory to bumpkins who knew not the name of newgate still devoted to sport he hunted the fox and made such his youthf ul imagination could never have pictured so he lived life of country ease and died churchwarden and he deserved his prosperity he carried the soul of falstaf f in the shrunken body of justice shallow gilderoy and the string book of scoundrels by charles whibley https he stood six feet ten in his stockinged feet and was the tallest rufﬁan that ever cut purse or held up coach on the highway mass of black hair curled over low forehead and glittering eye intensiﬁed his villainous aspect nor did deep scar furrowing his cheek from end to end soften the horror of his sudden apparition valian t men shuddered at his approach women shrank from the distant echo of his name ﬁfteen years he terrorised scotland from caithness to the border and the most partial chronicler never insulted his memory with the record of good deed he was born to gentle family in the calendar of monteith and was celebrated even in boyhood his feats of strength and daring while still at school he could hold hundredweight at length and crumple up horseshoe like wisp of hay the ﬂeetest runner the most desperate ﬁghter in the country he was already famous before his name was besmirched with crime and he might have been immortalised the hercules of the seventeenth century had not his ambition been otherwise ﬂattered at the outset though the inclination was never lacki ng he knew small temptation to break the sterner laws of conduct his pleasures were abundantly supplied by his father generosity and he had need to refrain from such vices became gentleman if he was drunkard it was because his head was equal to the severest strain and despite his forbidding expression he was always successful breaker of hearts his very masterfulness overcame the most stubborn resistance and more than once the pressure of his dishonourable suit converted hatred into love at the very time that he was denounced scotland disgrace his praises were chanted in many dejected ballad was bonny boy sang one maiden had roses till his shoon his stockings were of silken soy wi garters hanging doon but in truth he was admired less his amiability than that quality of governance which when once he had torn the decalogue to pieces made him veritable emperor of crime his father death was the true beginning of his career modest patrimony was squandered in six months and gilderoy had penny left wherewith to satisfy the vices which insisted upon indulgence he demanded money at all hazards and money without toil while his more loudly clamant needs were fulﬁlled by the amiable simplicity of his mother whom he blackmailed with insolence and contempt and when she wearied by his shameless importunity at last withdrew her support he determined upon monstrou s act of vengeance with noble affectation of penitence he visited his home promised reform at supper and said in the broken accent of reconciliation sooner was the house sunk in slumber than he crawled stealthily upstairs in order to forestall by theft promised generosity he opened the door of the in hushed silence but the wrenching of the cofferlid awoke the sleeper and gilderoy having cut his mother throat with an infamous levity seized whatever money and jewels were in the house cruelly maltreated his sister and laughingly burnt the house to the ground that the possibility of evidence might be destroyed henceforth his method of plunder was assured it was part of his philosophy to prevent detection by murder and the ﬂames from the burning walls added pleasure to his lustful eye his march across scotland was marked by slaughtered families and ruined houses plunder was the ﬁrst cause of his exploits but there is doubt that death and arson were solace to his ﬁerce spirit and while this giant of cruelty knew neither check nor hindrance presently it became superstition with him that death was the inevitable accompaniment of robbery and he was incapable of remorse he grew callous and neglected the simplest precautions at dunkeld he razed riﬂed house to the ground and with the utmost effrontery repeated the performance at aberdeen but at last he had been tracked by company of soldiers who that justice might not be cheated of her prey carried him to gaol where after the briefest trial he was condemned to death gilderoy however was still master of himself his immense strength not only burst his bonds but broke prison and this invincible samson was once more free in aberdeen inspiring that respectable city with legendary dread the reward of one hundred pounds was offered in vain had he shown himself on the road in broad daylight none would have dared to arrest him and it was not until book of scoundrels by charles whibley https were deliberately laid that he crossed the sea the more violent period of his career was at an end never again did he yield to his passion burning and sudden death and if the world found him unconquerable his is proved by the fact that in the heyday of his strength he turned from his unredeemed brutality to gentler method he now deserted scotla nd france with which like all his countrymen he claimed cousinship and so profoundly did he impose upon paris with his immense stature his elegant attire his courtly manners he was courtesy itself when it pleased him that he was taken an eminent scholar or at least soldier of fortune prosperity might doubtless have followed discreet profession but gilderoy must still be thieving and he reaped rich harvest among the unsuspicious courtiers of france his most highly renowned exploit was performed at denis and the record of france humiliation is still treasured the great church was packed with ladies of fashion and their devout admirers richelieu attended in state the king himself shone upon the assembly the strange scotsman whom man knew and all men wondered at attracted hundred eyes to himself and his magniﬁcent equipment but it was not his to be idle and at the very moment whereat mass was being sung he contrived to lighten richelieu pocket of purse the king was delighted witness of the theft gilderoy assuming an air of facile intimacy motioned him to silence and he deeming it trick put upon richelieu by friend hastened at the to ask his minister if perchance he had purse of gold upon him richelieu instantly discovered the loss to the king uncontrolled hilarity which was mitigated when it was found that the thief having emptied the king pocket at the unguarded moment of his merriment had left them both the poorer such were gilderoy interludes of gaiety and when you remember the cynical ferocity of his earlier performance you can not deny him the credit of versatility he stayed in france until his ominous reputation was too widely spread whereupon he crossed the pyrene es travelling like gentleman in brilliant carriage of his own from spain he carried off priceless collection of silver plate and he returned to his own country fatigued yet unsoftened by the grand tour meanwhile forgetful generation had not kept his memory green the monster who punished scotland year ago with ﬁre and sword had passed into oblivion and gilderoy was able to establish himself new reputation he departed far possible from his ancient custom joined the many cavaliers who were riding up and down the country pistol in hand and presently proved dauntless highwayman he had not long ridden in the neighbourhood of perth before he met the earl of linlithgow from whom he took gold watch diamond ring and eighty guineas being an outlaw he naturally espoused the king cause and would have given year of his life to meet regicide once upon time says rumour he found himself face to face with oliver cromwell whom he dragged from his coach set ignominiously upon an ass and so turned adrift with his feet tied under the beast belly the story is incredible not only because the loyal historians of the time caused oliver to be robbed daily on every road in great britain but because our gilderoy had he ever confronted the protector most assuredly would not have allowed him to escape with his life tired of scouring the highway gilderoy resolved upon another enterprise he collected band of fearless rufﬁans and placed himself at their head with this army to aid he harried sutherland and the north lifting cattle plundering homesteads and stopping wayfarers with humour and adroitness worthy of robin hood longer lawless adventurer he made his own conditions of life and forced the people to obey them he who would pay gilderoy fair contribution ran risk of losing his sheep or oxen but evasion was impossible and the smallest suspicion of falsehood was punished by death the peaceably inclined paid their toll with regret the more daring opposed the raider to their miserable undoing the timid satisﬁed the utmost exactions of gilderoy and deemed themselves fortunate if they left the country with their lives thus scotland became land of dread the most restless man within her borders hardly dare travel beyond his byre the law was powerless against this indomitable scour ge and the reward of thousand marks would have been offered in vain had not gilderoy cruelty estranged his mistress this cunningham was her avarice than in revenge many insults and inﬁdelities at last betrayed her master having decoyed him to her house she admitted ﬁfty armed men and thus imagined full atonement her unnumbered wrongs but gilderoy was triumphant to the last instantly suspecting the treachery of his mistress he burst into her chamber and that she might not enjoy the price of blood ripped her up with hanger then he turned deﬁant upon the army arrayed against him and killed eight men before the others captured book of scoundrels by charles whibley https after desperate struggle he was loaded with chains and carried to edinbur gh where he was starved three days and then hanged without the formality of trial on gibbet thirty feet high set up in the grassmarket even then scotland vengeance was unsati sﬁed the body cut down from its ﬁrst gibbet was hung in chains forty feet above leith walk where it creaked and gibbered warning to evildoers half century until at last the inhabitan ts of that respectable quarter petitioned that gilderoy bones should cease to rattle and that they should enjoy the peace impossible his jingling skeleton gilderoy was scoundrel villain of schoolgirl romance he felt remorse little he felt fear and there was crime from whose commission he shrank before his death he confessed to murders and bragged that he had long since lost count of his robberies and rapes something must be abated boastfulness but after all deduction there remains tale of crime that is unsurpassed his most admirably artistic quality is his complete consistence he was rufﬁan ﬁnished and rotund he made concession he betrayed weakness though he never preached sermon against the human race he practised brutality which might have proceeded from gospel of hate he spared neither friends nor relatives and he murdered his own mother with light heart he sent strange widow of aberdeen to her death his skill is undoubted and he proved by the discipline of his band that he was not without some talent of generalship but he owed much of his success to his physical strength and to the temperament which never knew the scandal of hesitancy or dread born marauder he devoted his life to his trade and despite his travels in france and spain he enjoyed few intervals of merriment even the humour which proved his redemption was dour and grim scotland can furnish at her grimmes and dourest here is specimen will serve well another three of gilderoy gang had been hanged according to the sentence of certain lord of session and the chieftain his own vengeance and the intimidation of justice resolved upon an exemplary punishment he waylaid the lord of session emptied his pocket s killed his horses broke his coach in pieces and having bound his lackeys drowned them in pond this was but the prelude of revenge presently and here is the touch of humour he made the lord of session ride at dead of night to the gallows whereon the three malefactors were hanging one arm of the crossbeams was still untenanted my soul mon cried gilderoy to the lord of session this gibbet is built to break people craigs and is not uniform without another i must hang you upon the vacant beam and straightway the lord of session swung in the moonlight and gilderoy had cracked his black and solemn joke this sense of fun is the single trait which relieves the colossal turpitude of gilderoy and though even his turpitude was melodramatic in its lack of balance it is unity of character which is the foundation of his greatness he was fumbler led away from his purpose by the ﬁrst diversion his ambition was clear before him and he never fell below it he deﬁed scotland ﬁfteen years was hanged so high that he passed into proverb and though his handsome sinister face might have made women his slaves he was never betrayed by passion or by virtue to an amiability jack the pig stood in the solitude of the north road its simple front its neatly balanced windows curtained with white gave it an air of comfort and tranquillity the smoke which curled from its hospitable chimney spoke of warmth and good fare to pass it was to spurn the last chance of bottle many weary mile and the prudent traveller would always rest an hour by its ample ﬁreside or gossip with its fantastic hoste ss now the hostess of the little inn was ellen roach friend and accomplice of jack once the most famous woman in england and still after weary stretch at botany bay the strangest of companions the most buxom of spinsters her beauty was elusive even in her triumphant youth and had neither softened her traits nor reﬁned her expression her auburn hair once the glory of covent garden was fading to withered grey she was never tall enough to endure an encroaching stoutness with equanimity her dumpy ﬁgure made you marvel at her past success book of scoundrels by charles whibley https had furrowed her candid brow into wrinkles but when she opened her lips she became instantly animated with glass before her on the table she would prattle frankly and engagingly of the past strange cities had she seen she had faced the dangers of an adventurous life with calmness and good temper and yet botany bay with its attendant horrors was already fading from her memory in imagination she was still with her incomparable hero and it was her solace after ﬁfteen years to sing the praise and echo the perfections of jack well i remember she would murmur though unconscious of her audience unhappy day when jack rann was ﬁrst arrested it was may and he came back ained and weary in the brilliant dawn he had stopped shay near the stone on the hounslow word of his confession is burnt into my had taken watch and handful of guineas i was glad enough of the money there was penny in the house and presently i sent the ant to make the best bargain she could with the watch but the silly jade by the saddest of mish aps took the trinket straight to the very man who made it and he suspecting theft had us both arrested even then jack might have been safe had not the devil prompted to speak the truth dismay ed by the magistrate i owned wretched woman that i was that i had received the watch from rann and in two hours jack also was under lock and key yet when we were sent trial i made what amends i could i declared on oath that i had never seen jack in my life his name came to my lips by accident and hector they would the lawyers could not frighten to an acknowledgment meanwhile jack own behaviour was grand i was the proudest woman in england i stood by his side in the dock when you compared him with sir john fielding you did not doubt an instant which was the ﬁner gentleman and what dandy was my jack though he came there to answer his life he was all ribbons and furbelow his irons were tied up with the daintiest blue bows and in the breast of his coat he carried bundle of ﬂowers large his neck quivered in the noose yet he was never cowed to civility i know more of the matter than you he cried indignantly half so much neither and if the magistrate had not been an oaf he would not have dared to disbelieve my jack that time we escaped with whole skins and off we went after dinner to vauxhall where jack was more noticed than the ﬁercest of the bloods and where he ﬁlled the heart of geor ge barrington with envy nor was he idle despite his recent escape he brought away two watches and three purses from the garden so that our necessities were amply supplied ah i should have been happy in those days if only jack had been faithful but he had roving eye and joyous temperament and though he loved better than any of the baggages to whom he paid court he would not visit so often he should why once he was hustled off to bow street because the watch caught him climbing in at doll frampton window and she the shameless minx got him off by declaring in open court that she would be proud to receive him whenever he would deign to ring at her bell that is the penalty of loving great man you must needs share his affection with set of unworthy wenches yet jack was always kind to and i was the chosen companion of his pranks can i forget the splendid ﬁgure he cut that day at bagnigge wells we had driven down in our coach and all the world marvelled at our magniﬁcence jack was brave in scarlet coat tambour waistcoat and white silk stock ings from the knees of his breeches streamed the strings eight at each whence he got his name and he plucked off his the dinner rose at him that was moment worth living and when after his ﬁrst bottle jack rattled the glasses and declared himself highwayman the whole company shuddered but my friends quoth he i am making holiday so that you have naught to fear when the wine in the wit out and jack could never stay his hand from the bottle the more he drank the more he bragged until thoroughly fuddled he lost ring from his ﬁnger and charged the miscreants in the room with stealing it however hiccupped he is mere nothing worth paltry hundred than lazy evening work so i let the triﬂing theft pass but the cowards were not content with jack generosity and seizing upon him they thrust him neck and crop through the window they were seventeen to one the loons and i could but leave the marks of my nails on the cheek of the foremost and follow my hero into the yard where we took coach and drove sulkily back to covent garden yet he was not always in mad humour in fact jack all his gaiety was proud melancholy man the shadow of the tree was always upon him and he would make miserable by talking of his certain doom i have hundred pounds in my pocket he would say i shall spend that and then i sha last long and though i never thought him serious his book of scoundrels by charles whibley https true enough only few months before the end we had visited tyburn together with his usual carelessness he passed the line of constables who were on guard it is very proper said he in his jauntiest tone that i should be spectator on this melancholy occasion and though none of the dullards took his jest they instantly made way him my jack was always gentleman though he was bred to the stable and his bitterest enemy could not have denied that he was handsome his open countenance was honest the day and the brown curls over his forehead were more elegant than the smartest wig wherever he went the world did him honour and many time my vanity was sorely wounded i was pretty girl mind you though my travels have not improved my beauty and i had many admirers before ever i picked up jack rann at masquerade why there was templar with two thousand year who gave carriage and servants while i still lived at the dressmaker in oxford street and i was not out of my teens when the old jew in mary axe took into keeping but when jack was by i had chance of admiration all the eyes were glued upon him and his poor doxy had to be content with furtive look thrown over stranger shoulder at barnet races the year before they sent across the sea we were followed by crowd the livelo ng day and truly jack in his blue satin waistcoat laced with silver might have been peer at any rate he had not his equal on the course and it is small wonder that never moment were we left to ourselves happiness does not last ever only too often we were gravelled lack of money and jack ﬁnding his purse empty could naught else than hire hackney and take to the road again while i used to lie awake listening to the watchman raucous voice and praying god to send back my warrior rich and scatheless so times grew more and more difﬁcult jack would stay whole night upon the heath and come home with an empty pocket or beggarly half crown and there was nothing after shabby coat that he hated half so much sherif f ofﬁcer learn lesson in politeness he said to one of the wretches who dragged him off to the marshalsea when sir john fielding people come after they use genteelly they only hold up ﬁnger beckon and i follow quietly lamb but you bluster and insult though you had never dealings with gentlemen poor jack he was of proud stomach and could not abide interference yet they would never let him go free and he would have been so happy had he been allowed his own way to pull out rusty pistol now and again and to take purse from these were innocent pleasures and he never meant to hurt but all his kindness of heart all his love of splendour and ﬁne clothes they took him at last this time too it was watch which was our ruin how often did i warn him jack i would say take all the money you can guineas tell tale but leave the watches in their owners fobs alas he did not heed my words and the last man he ever stopped on the road was that pompous rascal bell then chaplain to the princess amelia give your money screamed jack and take notice or i blow your brains out and the doctor gave him all that he had the spirited and it was more than eighteenpence now what should man of courage with eighteenpence so poor jack was forced to seize the parson watch and trinkets well and thus it was that second time we faced the blind beak when jack brought home the watch i was seized with shuddering presentiment and i would have given the world to throw it out of the window but i could not bear to see him pinched with hunger and he had already tossed the doctor eighteenpence to beggar woman so i trudged off to the pawnbroker to get what price i could and i bethought that none would know what i was so far away oxford street but the monster behind the counter had quick suspicion though i swear i looked innocent babe he discovered the owner of the watch and infamously followed to my house next day we were both arrested and once more we stood in the hot stiﬂing court of the old bailey jack was radiant ever the one spot of colour and gaiety in that close sodden atmosphere when we were taken from bow street thousand people formed our guard of honour and month we were the twin wonders of london the lightest word the ﬂeetest smile of the renowned highwayman threw the world into ﬁt of excitement and glimpse of rann was worth king ransom i could look upon him all day nothing and i knew what fever of fear throbbed behind his mask of happy contempt yet bravely he played the part unto the very end if the toasts of london were determined to gaze at him he assured them they should have proper salve their eyes so he dressed himself sportsman his coat and waistcoat were of cloth his buckskin breeches were spotlessly new and all tricked out with the famous strings his hat was bound round with silver cords and even the ushers of the court were touched to courtesy book of scoundrels by charles whibley https whisper to we stood in the dock cheer up my girl i have ordered the best supper that covent garden can provide and we will make merry when this foolish old judge has done his duty the supper was never eaten through the weary afternoon we waited acquittal the autumn sun sank in hopeless gloom the wretched lamps twinkled through the jaded air of the in an hour i lived thous and years of misery and when the sentence was read the words carried sense to my withered brain it was only in my cell i realised that i had seen jack rann the last time that his coat would prove ﬁnal and inef faceable memory i who had never been married was already hempen widow but i was too hopelessly heartbroken my lover fate to think of my own paltry hardship i never saw him again they told that he suffered at tyburn like man and that he counted upon rescue to the very end they told still bitterer news to hear that two days before his death he entertained seven women at supper and was in the wildest humour this almost broke my heart it was an inﬁdelity committed on the other side of the grave but poor jack he was good lad and loved more than them all though he never could be faithful to and thus bidding the drawer bring fresh glasses ellen roach would end her story though she had told it hundred times at the last words tear always sparkled in her eye she lived without friend and without lover faithful to the memory of string jack who her was the only reality in the world of shades her midd was distant her youth the dressmaker in oxford street was vague dream the inhospitable shore of botany bay so she waited on to weary eld proud of the pig comfort prouder still that two years she shared the glory of jack rann and that she did not desert her hero even in his punishment parallel gilderoy and jack their closest parallel is the notoriety which dogged them from the very day of their death each his own exploits was the most famous man of his time the favourite of broadsides the prime hero of the and each owed his fame much to good fortune to merit since both were excelled in their generation by more skilful scoundrels if gilderoy was unsurpassed in brutality he fell immeasurably below hind in artistry and wit nor may he be compared to such accomplished highwaymen mull sack or the golden farmer his method was not elevated by touch of the grand style he stamped all the rules of the road beneath his contemptuous foot and cared not what enormity he committed in his quest gold yet though he lived in the true augustan age he yielded to one of his rivals in glorious recognition so too jack rann of the sixteen strings was near contemporar y of geor ge barrington while that prig was making brilliant appearance at vauxhall and emptying the pockets of his intimates rann was riding over hounslow heath and ﬂashing his pistol in the eye of the wayfarer the very year in which jack danced his last jig at tyburn barrington had astonished london by fruitless attempt to steal prince orlof f miraculous and not even ellen roach herself would have dared to assert that rann was barrington equal in sleight of hand but rann holds his own against the best of his craft with an imperishable name while host of more distinguished cracksmen are excluded even from the newgate calendar in truth there is one quality which has naught to with artistic supremacy and in this quality both rann and gilderoy were rich beyond their fellows they knew none better how to impose upon the world had their deserts been even less than they were they would still have been bravely notorious it is common superstition that the talent advertisement has but transitory effect that time sets all men in their proper places nothing can be more false he who has once declared himself among the great ones of the earth not only holds his position while he lives but forces an unreasoning admiration upon the future though he declines from the lofty throne whereon his own vanity and love of praise have set him he still stands above the modest level which contents the genuinely great why does book of scoundrels by charles whibley https throw shadow upon the worthier poets of his time because he had the faculty of displacement because he could compel the world to profess an interest not only in his work but in himself why is michael angelo loftier ﬁgure in the history of art than donatello the supreme sculptor of his time because donatello had not the temper which would bully hundred popes and extract magniﬁcent advertisement from each encounter why does shelley still claim larger share of the world admiration than keats his indubitable superior because shelley was blessed or cursed with the trick of interesting the world by the accidents of his life so by similar faculty gilderoy and jack rann have kept themselves and their achievements in the light of day had they lived in the nineteenth century they might have been the vendors of patent pills or the chairmen of bubble companies whatever trade they had followed their names would have been on every hoarding their wares would have been puffed in every journal they understood the art of publicity better than any of their contemporaries and they are remembered not because they were the best thieves of their time but because they were determined to interest the people in their misdeeds gilderoy brutality which was always theatrical ensured constant remembrance and the lofty gallows added to his repute while the brilliant inspiration of the strings which decorated rann breeches was sufﬁcient to conquer death how should hero sink to oblivion who had chosen himself so splendid name jack so far then their achievement is parallel and parallel also is their taste melodrama each employed means too great or too violent the end in view gilderoy burnt houses and ravished women when his sole object was the acquisition of money jack terriﬁed bagnigge wells with the dreadful announcement that he was highwayman when his kindly stupid heart would have shrunk from the shedding of drop of blood so they both blustered through the world the one in deed the other in word and both played their parts with so little reﬁnement that they frightened the groundlings to timid admiration here the resemblance is at an end in the essentials of their trade gilderoy was professional rann mere amateur they both bullied but while jack was content to shout threats and pick up gilderoy breathed murder and demanded vast ransom only once in his career did the scotsman become gay and debonair only once did he relax the tension of his frown and pick pockets with the lightness and freedom of gentleman it was on his voyage to france that he forgot his old policy of arson and pillage and truly the court of the great king was not the place his rapacious cruelty jack rann on the other hand would have taken life prolonged jest if sir john fielding and the sherif fs had not checked his mirth he was but bungler on the road with more resource than he might have learned from the common or from the dying speeches hawked in newgate street but he had ﬁne talent merriment he loved nothing so well smart coat and pretty woman thieving was passion with him but necessity how could he dance at masquerade or court his ellen with an empty pocket so he took to the road the sole profession of an idle man and he bullied his way from hounslow to epping in sheer lightness of heart after all to rob bell of eighteenpence was the work

the ineffaceable ensigns of his intemperance yet there was grimy humour in his forbidding aspect the fusty black coat which sat ill upon his shambling frame was all besmirched with spilled snuff and the lees of thousand quart pots the bands of his profession were ever awry upon tattered shirt his ancient wig scattered dust and powder he went while single buckle of some tawdry metal gave look of oddity to his clumsy slipshod feet caricature of man he ambled and chuckled and seized the easy pleasures within his reach there was never summer day but he caught upon his brow the few faint gleams

such hours should have been given to study in drinking dicing and even less reputable pleasures yet repentance was always easy and he accepted his ﬁrst curacy at newmarket with brave heart and good hopefulness fortunate was the choice of this early cure had he been gently guided at the outset who knows but he might have lived out his life in respectable obscurity but newmarket then now was town of jollity and dissipation and pureney yielded without persuasion to the pleasures denied his cloth there was ever ﬁre to extinguish at his throat nor could he veil his wanton eye at the sight of pretty wench again and again the lust of preaching urged him to repent yet he slid back upon his past gaiety until parson pureney became byword dismissed from newmarket in disgrace he wandered the

reverend thomas pureney revealed his true talent the rufﬁan had sense of drama so he was determined that his words should scald and bite the penitent when the condemned pew was full of sunday his happiness was complete now his deep chest would hurl salvo on salvo of platitudes against the now his voice lowered to whisper would coax the hopeless prisoners to prepare their souls in paroxysm of feigned anger he would crush the cushion with his clenched ﬁst or leaning over the pulpit side though to approach the nearer to his victims would roll cold and bitter eye upon them of cat watching

devoutly was the pantomime studied that you almost heard the creak of the retreating cart the phantom culprit was turned off but his conduct in the pulpit was due to ferocity of temperament he merely exercised his legitimate craft so long newgate supplied him with an enforced audience so long would he thunder and bluster at the wrongdoer according to law and the dictates of his conscience many in

prowess on the morrow the was all and shattered from the castle he had forced his way through wall into the red room whose bolts bars and hinges he had ruined to gain the chapel the road thence to the roof and to freedom was hindered by three stubborn iron doors yet naught stood in the way of sheppard genius and he was sensible at last of the night air chill upon his cheek but liberty was not yet there was still fall of forty feet and he must needs repass the wreckage of his own making to ﬁlch the blankets from his cell in terror lest he should awaken the master debtors he hastened back to the roof lashed the coverlets together and the city clocks clashed twelve he dropped noiselessly upon the leads of turner house built against the prison outer wall behind him newgate was cut out black

minded his the letter to his bafﬂed guardian already sketched in his mind tickled him afresh when suddenly he leaps to his feet and begins to force the garret window the turner maid was heavy sleeper and sheppard crept from her garret to the twisted stair in peace once on lower ﬂoor his heart beat faster at the trumpetings of the turner nose but he knew check until he reached the street door the bolt was withdrawn in an instant but the lock was turned and the key nowhere to be found however though the risk of disturbance was greater than in newgate the task was light enough and with an iron link from his fetter and rusty nail which had served him bravely the box was wrenched off in trice and sheppard stood unattended in the old bailey at ﬁrst he was minded to make his ancient haunts or to conceal himself within the liberty of westminster but the fetter were still upon his legs and he knew that detection would be easy long he was thus embarrassed wherefore weary and he turned his steps northward and never rested until he had gained finchley common at break of day when the world from the fear of thieves he feigned limp at cottage door and borrowed hammer to straighten pinching shoe five minutes behind hedge and his anklets had dropped from him and thus free man he took to the high road after all he was persuaded to desert london and to escape while from the sturdy embrace of edgworth bess moreover if bess herself were in the he still feared the interested affection of book of scoundrels by charles whibley https that other doxy whose avarice would surely drive him upon dangerous enterprise so he struck across country and kept starvation from him by petty theft up and down england he wandered in solitary insolence once saith rumour his lithe apparition startled the peace of nottingham once he was wellnigh caught begging wort at in thames street but he might well have lingered in newgate waste his opportunity far from the delights of town the old lust of life still impelled him and week after the was raised he crept at dead of night down drury lane here he found harbourage with friendly fence wild mortal enemy who promised him safe conduct across the seas but the desire of work proved too strong prudence and in fortnight he had planned an attack on the pawnshop of one rawling at the four balls in drury lane sheppard whom house ever built with hands was strong enough to hold was better skilled at breaking out than at breaking in and it is remarkable that his last feat in the cracking of cribs was also his greatest its very conception was masterpiece of effrontery drury lane was the catcher chosen territory yet it was the four balls that jack designed attack and watches wigs were among his booty whatever he could not crowd upon his person he presented to brace of women tricked out in his stolen ﬁnery he drank and swaggered in clare market he was dressed in superb suit of black diamond fawney ﬂashed upon his ﬁnger his light was worth less than seven pounds pistols and golden guineas jostled one another in his pockets thus in brazen magniﬁcence he marched down drury lane on certain saturday night in november towards midnight he visited thomas nicks the butcher and having bargained three ribs of beef carried nicks with him to chandler hard by that they might ratify the bargain with dram unhappily boy from the and crown sounded the alarm coming into the chandler the empty he instantly recognised the incomparable and lost time in acquainting his master now bradford of the and crown was who with the zeal of triumphant dogberry summoned the watch and in less than half an hour jack sheppard was screaming blasphemies in on his way home to newgate the received him with deference and admiration three hundred pounds weight of irons were put upon him an adornm ent and the governor professed so keen solicitude his welfare that he never left him unattended there was scarce beautiful woman in london who did not solace him with her condescension and enrich him with her gifts not only did the president of the royal academy deign to paint his portrait but far greater honour hogarth made him immortal even the king displayed proper interest demanding full and precise account of his escapes the hero himself was drunk with ﬂattery he bubbled with ribaldry he touched off the most valiant of his contemporaries in ludicrous phrase but his chief delight was to illustrate his prowess to his distinguished visitors and nothing pleased him better than to slip in and out of his chains confronted with his judge he forthwith proposed to rid himself of his handcuf fs and he preserved until the fatal tree an illimitable pride in his artistry nor would he believe in the possibility of death to the very last he was conﬁrmed in the hope of pardon but pardon failing him his single consolation was that his procession from westminster to newgate was the largest that london had ever known and that in the crowd constable broke his leg even in the condemned hole he was unreconciled if he had broken the castle why should he not also evade the gallows wherefore he resolved to carry knife to tyburn that he might cut the rope and so losing himself in the crowd ensure escape but the knife was discovered by his warder vigilance and taken from him after desperate struggle at the scaffold he behaved with admirable gravity confessin g the wickeder of his robberies and asking pardon his enormous crimes two virtues he boasted at the moment that the cart left him dancing without the music i have ever cherished an honest

incomparable artist who in his own separate ambition of remains and will ever remain unrivalled his most brilliant efforts were the result neither of strength nor of cunning so slight was he of build so deﬁcient in muscle that both edgworth bess and mistress maggot were wont to bang him to their own mind and purpose and an escape so magniﬁcently planned so bravely executed was his from the strong

could not have employed his gifts in more reputable book of scoundrels by charles whibley https car touche of all the heroes who have waged private and undeclared war upon their neighbours dominique cartouche was the most generously endowed it was but his resolute contempt politics his unswerving love of plunder its own sake that prevented him from seizing throne or questing after the empire of the world the modesty of his ambition sets him below cæsar or napoleon but he yields to neither in the genius of success whatever he would attain was his on the instant nor did failure interrupt his career until treachery of which he went in perpetual terror involved himself and his comrades in ruin his talent of generalship was unrivalled none of the gang was permitted the liberty of lance by cartouche was the order given and so long the chief was in repose paris might enjoy her sleep when it pleased him to join battle whistle was enough now it was revealed to his intelligence that the professional thief who devoted all his days and such of his nights were spared from depredation to wine and women was more readily detected than the who did but crack crib or cry and deliver on proper occasion wherefore he bade his soldiers take service in the great houses of paris that secure of suspicion they might still be ready to obey the call of duty thus also they formed reconnoitring force whose vigilance prize might elude and nowhere did cartouche display his genius to ﬁner purpose than in this prudent disposition of his army it remained only to efface himself and therein he succeeded admirably by never sleep ing two following nights in the same house so that when cartouche was the terror of paris when even the king trembled in his bed none knew his stature nor could recognise his features in this shifting and impersonal vizard he broke houses picked pockets robbed on the pad one night he would terrify the faubour g germain another he would plunder the humbler suburb of antoine but on each excursion he was companioned by experts and the map of paris was rigidly apportioned among his followers to each district captain was appointed whose business it was to apprehend the customs of the quarter and thus to indicate the proper season of attack ever triumphant with ever jingling in his pocket cartouche lived life of luxurious merriment favourite haunt was cabaret in the rue dauphine chosen the sanest of reasons his captain ferrand declared that the landlady was femme here he would sit with his friends and his women and thereafter drive his chariot across the pont neuf to the sunnier gaiety of the ﬁnished dandy he wore by preference coat with silver buttons his breeches and stockings were on famous occasion of black silk while sword scabbarded in satin hung at his hip but if cartouche like many another great man had the faculty of enjoyment if he loved wine and wit and mistresses handsomely attired in damask he did not therefore neglect his art when once the gang was perfectly ordered murder followed robbery with so instant frequency that paris was cry of straightway ensured an empty street the king took counsel with his ministers muniﬁcent rewards were offered without effect the thief was still at work in all security and it was pretty irony which urged him to strip and kill on the highway one of the king own pages also he did his work with so astonishing silence with so reasoned certainty that it seemed impossible to take him or his minions before all he discouraged the use of ﬁrearms pistol his philosophy urged an excellent weapon in an emer gency but reserve it emer gencies at close quarters it is none too sure and why give the alarm against yourself therefore he armed his band with loaded staves which sent their enemies into noiseless and fatal sleep thus was he wont to laugh at the police deeming capture plain impossibility the traitor in sooth was his single irremediable fear and if ever suspicion was aroused against member of the gang that member was put to death with the shortest shrift it happened in the last year of cartouche supremacy that comrade fell in love with pretty dressmaker the indiscretion was the less pardonable since the dressmaker had horror book of scoundrels by charles whibley https and impudently tried to turn her lover from his trade cartouche discovering the backslider resolved upon public exhibition befor the assembled band he charged the miscreant with treason and cutting his throat disﬁgured his face beyond recognition thereafter he pinned to the corse the following

guard straightly did pacôme summon du chtelet and assuming his guilt certitude bade him surrender his captain friend said he i know you an associate of carto uche your hands are soiled with murder and rapine confess the of cartouche or in hours you are broken on the wheel vainly did du châtelet protest his ignorance pacôme was resolute and before the interview was over the robber confessed that cartouche had given him rendezvous at nine next day in the grey morning thirty soldiers crept forth guided by the traitor habits bourgeois et chasseur the house where cartouch had lain it was an inn kept by one savard near la haulte borne la courtille and the soldiers though they lacked not numbers approached the chieftain lair shaking with terror in front marched du châtelet the rest followed in indian ﬁle ten paces apart when the traitor reached the house savard recognised him friend and entertained him with familiar speech there anybody upstairs demanded du châtelet replied savard the four women upstairs asked du châtelet again they are came the answer savard knew the password of the day instantly the soldiers ﬁlled the tavern and mounting the staircase discovered cartouche with his three lieutenants balagny limousin and blanchard one of the four still lay abed but cartouche with all the dandy respect his clothes was mending his breeches the others hugged ﬂagon of wine over the ﬁre so fell the scour ge of paris into the grip of justice but once under lock and key he displayed all the qualities which made him supreme his gaiety broke forth into contempt of his gaolers and the lieutenant criminel who would interrogate him was covered with ridicule not an instant did he bow to fate all shackled he was his legs engarlanded in heavy he called his tempered his merriment with the meditation of escape from the ﬁrst he denied all knowledge of cartouche insisting that his name was charles bour guignon and demanding burgundy that he might drink to his country and thus prove him true son of the soil not even the presence of his mother and brother abashed him he laughed them away impostors hired by false justice to accuse and to betray the innocent word of confession crossed his lips and he would still entertain the ofﬁcers of the law with joke and epigram thus he won over handful of the guard and begging solitude he straightway set about escape with courage and an address which jack sheppard might have envied his delicate ear discovered that cellar lay beneath his cell and with the old nail which lies on the ﬂoor of every prison he made his way downwards into boxmaker shop but barking dog spoiled the enterprise the boxmaker and his daugh ter were immediately abroad and once more cartouche was lodged in prison weighted with still heavier garters then came period of splendid notoriety he held his court he gave an easy rein to his wit he received duchesses and princes with an air of amiable patronage few there were of his visitants who left him

cartouche upon the stage in three acts and lavished upon its theme the resources of then intelligent art le grand author of the piece deigned to call upon the king of thieves spoke some words of argot with him and by way of conscience money gave him hundred crowns cartouche set little store by such patronage he pocketed the crowns and then put an end to the comedy by threatening that if it were played again the companions of cartouche would punish all such miscreants dared to make him laughing stock cartouche would endure ridicule at book of scoundrels by charles whibley https hand at the very instant of his arrest all he was he kicked constable who presumed to smile at his discomﬁture his last days were spent in resolute abandonment true he once attempted to beat out his brains with the fetters that bound him true also he took poison that had been secretly conveyed within the prison but both attempts failed and more scrupulously watched he had other course than jollity lawyers and priests he visited with like and bitter scorn and when on november 27 1721 he was led to the scaffold not word of confession or contrition had been dragged from him to the last moment he cherished the hope of rescue and eagerly he scanned the crowd the faces of his comrades but the gang trusting to its leader nobility had broken its oath with contemptuous dignity cartouche determined upon revenge proudly he turned to the priest begging respite and the opportunity of speech forgotten by his friends he resolved to spare single soul he betrayed even his mistresses to justice of his gang forty were in the service of mlle montpensier who was already in spain while two obeyed the duchesse ventadour his confession in brief was so dangerous document it betrayed the friends and servants of so many great houses that the ofﬁcers of the law found safety their patrons in its destruction and not line of the hero testimony remains the trial of his comrades dragged on many year and after cartouche had been cruelly broken on the wheel not few of the gang of which he had been at once the terror and inspiration suffered like fate such the career and such the ﬁtting end of the most distinguished marauder the world has known thackeray with better guide than was minded to belittle him now habiting him like scullion now sending him forth on some petty errand of but all thackeray

distinguished success and it was the good fortune of both cartouche and sheppard to be born in the nick of time rivals in talent they were also near contemporaries and the scour ge of paris may well have been famous in the purlieus of clare market before jack the paid the last penalty of his crimes each of these great men harboured similar ambition so their careers are closely parallel born in humble rank of life jack like cartouche was the architect of his own fortune jack like cartouche lived to be ﬂattered by noble dames and to claim the solicitude of his sovereign and each owed his rather to natural genius than to sympathetic training but all the briton artistry the frenchman was in all points save one the superior sheppard brain carried him not beyond the wants of and the extortions of poll maggot who knows but he might have been respectable citizen with never chance the display of his peculiar talent had not hunger and his mistress greed driven him upon the pad history records brilliant robbery of his own planning and so circumscribed was his imagination that he must needs pick out his own friends and benefactors depredation his paltry sense of discipline permitted him to be betrayed even by his brother and pupil and there was cracksman of his time over whose head he held the rod of terror even his hatred of jonathan wild was the result not of policy but of prejudice cartouche on the other hand was always perfect when at work the master of himself he was also the master of his fellows there was detail of civil war that he had not made his own and he still remains after nearly two centuries the greatest captain the world has seen never did he permit an enterprise to fail by accident never was he impelled by hunger or improvidence to ﬁght battle

art the sport of the one was to break in of the other to break out true the briton proved his inferiority by too frequently placing himself under lock and key but you will forgive his every weakness the unexampled skill wherewith he extricated himself from the stubbornest dungeon cartouche would scarce have given sheppard menial ofﬁce in his gang how cordially sheppard would have despised cartouche solitary experiment in escape to be foiled by dog and boxmaker daughter would not that have seemed contemptible to the master breaker of those unnumbered doors and walls which separate the castle from the freedom of newgate roof such then is the contrast between the heroes sheppard claims our admiration one masterpiece cartouche has sheaf of works which shall carry him triumphantly to the remotest future and when you forget while professional rivalry and consider the delicacies of leisure you will ﬁnd the frenchman greatness still indisputable at all points he was the prettier gentleman sheppard to be sure had sense of ﬁnery but he was so unused to grandeur that vulgarity always spoiled his effects when he hied him from the pawnshop laden with booty he must cram what he

deserved the untoward fate of those who overlook their talents limitation and when this master of pickpockets followed barney through the window of secluded house upon the york road he might already have felt the noose tightening at his neck the immediate reward of this bungled attack was thirty pounds but two days later he was committed with barney to the durham assizes where he exchanged the

secured him with pitiless severity round his waist he carried an iron belt whereto were padlocked the chains clanking at his wrists and ankles thus tortured and helpless he was fed sucking turkey in bedlam but his sorrows vanished and his dying courage revived at sight of the torchlight procession which set forth from dumfries to greet his return his coach was hustled by mob thousands strong eager to catch sight of haggart the murderer and though the spot where he slew morrin was like ﬁre beneath his passing feet he carried to his cell heart and brain aﬂame with gratiﬁed vanity his guilt

couple of days simms had eased collector at eversey bank of three hundred pounds this enterprise two others climbed the gallows and the robber pride in his capture was miserably lessened by the shedding of innocent blood but he forgot his remorse speedily he dissipated his money and sentimentality neither damped his enjoyment nor restrained his energy even his brief visits to london were turned to the best account and though he would have the world believe him mere voluptuary his eye was bent sternly upon business if he did lose his money in gambling hell he knew who won it and spoke with his opponent on the homeward way in his eyes fuddled rake was alway s fair game and the stern windows of clement church looked down upon many proﬁtable adventure his most distinguished journey was to ireland whither he set forth to ﬁnd market his stolen treasure but he determined that the road should bear its own charges and he reached dublin richer man than he left london in three months he was penniless but he did not begin trade again until he had recrossed the channel and having got to work near chester he returned to the piazza fat with notes with success his extravagance increased and living the life of man about town he was soon harassed by debt more than once he was lodged in the marshalsea and his violent temper resented the interference of dun he became notorious his assaults upon sherif f ofﬁcers and thus his poor skill grew poorer forgetting his trade he expected that brandy would ease his embarrassment at last sodden with drink he enlisted in the guards from which regiment he deserted only to be pressed aboard freed by clever trick he took to the road again until paltry theft from barber transp orted him to maryland there he turned sailor and his ship the two sisters being taken by privateer he contrived to scramble into portugal whence he made his way back to england and to the only adventure of which he was master he landed with more money than the price of pistol but he prigged prancer at bristol horsefair and set out upon his last journey the tide of his fortune was at ﬂood he crammed his pockets with watches he was owner of enough diamonds to set up shop in fashionable quarter of guineas he had many would support his magniﬁcence half year and at last he resolved to quit the road and to live like the gentleman he was to this prudence he was the more easily persuaded because not only were the eager his capture but he was deserter whose sole chance of quietude was decent obscurity his resolution was taken at albans and over comfortable dinner he pictured serene and uneventful future on the morrow he would set forth to dublin sell his handsome stock of jewels and forget that the cart ever lumbered up tyburn hill so elated was he with his growing virtue that he called second bottle and the port heated his blood his ﬁngers tingle d action third bottle proved beyond dispute that only the craven were idle why he excla imed generous with wine the most industrious rufﬂer of england condescend to inaction instantly he summoned the ostler screaming his horse and before redburn he had emptied four pockets and had exchanged his own tired jade fresh and willing beast still exultant in his contempt of cowardice he faced the warrington stage and made off with his plunder at drunken gallop arrived at dunstable he was so befogged with liquor and pride that he entered the inn the goal of the very coach he had just encountered he had scarce called quartern of brandy book of scoundrels by charles whibley https robbed passengers thronged into the kitchen and the fright gave him enough sobriety to leave his glass untasted and stagger to his horse in wild fury of arrogance and terror of conﬂicting vice and virtue he pressed on to hockclif fe where he took refuge from the rain and presently fuddled with more brandy he fell asleep over the kitchen ﬁre by this time the hue and cry was raised and the hero lay helpless in the corner three troopers burst into the inn levelled their pistols at his head and threatened death if he put his hand to his pocket half asleep and wholly drunk he made not he smallest show of resistance he surrendered all his money watches and diamonds save little that was sewn into his neckcloth and sulkily crawled up to his thither the troopers followed him and having restored some nine pounds at his urgent demand they watched his heavy slumbers all his brandy simms slept but uneasily and awoke in the night sick with the remorse which is bred of ruined plans and splitting head he got up wearily and sat over the ﬁre good deal chagrined to quote his own simple phrase at his miserable capture escape seemed hopeless indeed there crouched the vigilant troopers scowling on their prey thousand plans chased each other through the hero fuddled brain and at last he resolved to tempt the cupidity of his guardians and to make himself master of their there were still left him couple of seals one gold the other silver and watching his opportunity simms ﬂung them with ﬂourish in the ﬁre it fell out he expected the hungry troopers made dash to save the trinkets the prisoner seized brace of pistols and leapt to the door but alas the pistols missed ﬁre harry was immediately overpowered and on the morrow was carried sick and sorry before the justice from dunstable he travelled his last journey to newgate and being condemned at the old bailey he was hanged till he was dead and his body thereafter was carried dissection to surgeon in that same covent garden where he ﬁrst deserted his hackney cab the pleasures of the town harry was neither brillian t thief nor courteous highwayman there was touch of the grand manner even in his prettiest achievement his predecessors had made pistol and vizard an overwhelming terror and he did but proﬁt by their tradition when he bade the cowed traveller stand and deliver his profession he practised it neither demande d skill nor incurred danger though he threatened death at every encounter you never hear that he pulled trigger throughout his career if his opponent jeered and rode off he rode off with whole skin and full pocket once even this renowned adven turer accepted the cut of across his face nor made any attempt to avenge the insult but his manifold shortcomings were hindrance to his success wherever he went between london and york he stopped coaches and levied his tax threatening voice an arched eyebrow an arrogant method of ﬁngering an unloa ded pistol conspired with the craven indolent habit of the time to make his every journey proces sion of triumph he was capable of performing all such feats the age required of him but you miss the spirit the bravery the urbanity and the wit which made the adventurer of the seventeenth century ﬁgure of romance one point only of the great tradition did harry simms remember he was never unwilling to restore trinket made precious by sentiment once when he took gold ring from gentleman ﬁnger gentlewoman burst into tears exclaiming goes your father ring whereupon simms threw all his booty into hat saying god sake take that or anything else you please in all other respects he was bully with the hesitancy of coward rather than the proper rival of hind or duval apart from the exercise of his trade he was very mohock brutality he would his victims whenever their drunkenness permitted the freedom and he had better gifts the women who were kind to him than cruelty and neglect one of his many imprisonments was the result of monstrous ferocity in quarrel he tells you gravely i ran into woman eye and well did he deserve his sojourn in the new prison at another time he rewarded the keeper of who supported him six months by stealing her watch and when she grumbled at his insolence he reﬂected with chuckle that she could more easily bear the loss of her watch than the loss of her lover even in his gaiety there was an unpleasant spice of greed and truculence once when he was still seen in fashionable company he went to masquerade dressed in rich spanish habit lent him by captain in the guards and he made so ﬁne show that he captivated young and beautiful cyprian whom when she would have treated him with generosity he did but reward with the loss of all her jewels moreover he had so small regard his craft that he would spoil his effects by drink or debauchery and though highwayman he cared so little style that he would lief trick drunken gamester face his man on bagshot heath or beneath the shade of epping forest book of scoundrels by charles whibley https not his success because like the success of the popular politician it depended rather upon his dupes than upon his merit you approve not his rafﬁsh exploits in the hells of covent garden or drury lane but you can not withhold respect from his consistent dandyism and you are grateful the record that engaged in mean enterprise he was dressed green velvet frock and short lac waistcoat above all his picture sque capture at hockclif fe atones much stupidity the resolution wavering at the wine glass the last drunken ride from are inventions in experience which should make simms immortal and when he sits the ﬁreside good deal chagrined he recalls the arrest of far greater of cartouche who was surprised by the soldiers at his bedside stitching torn pair of breeches his autobiography wherein relates the truth dying man seemed excellent in the eyes of borrow who loved it so well that he imagined sentence ascribed it falsely to simms and then rewarded it with extravagant applause but gentleman harry knew how to tell simple story and the book wrote by myself while under sentence of death is his best performance in action he had many faults if he was highwayman among rakes he was but rake among highwaymen parallel the sw itcher and gentlem an harry haggar t and simms are united in the praise of borrow and in the generous applause of posterity each resumes his own generation the prowess of his kind each has assured his immortality by an experiment in literature and if epic simplicity and rapid narrative are the virtues of biography it is difﬁcult to award the prize the switcher preferred to write in the rough lingo wherein he best expressed himself he packs his pages with slang telling his story of thievery in the true language of thieves gentleman harry became person of quality mimicked the dialect wherewith he was familiar in the more fashionable of covent garden both write with out the smallest suggestion of false shame or idle regret and natural vanity lifts each of them out of the pit of commonplace on to the tableland of the heroic they set forth their depredation victorious general might record his triumphs and they excel the nimblest ordinary that ever penned dying speech in all the gifts of the historian but when you leave the study the ﬁeld the switcher instantly declares his superiority he had the happiness to practise his craft in its heyday while simms knew but the of noble tradition haggart moreover was an expert pursuing difﬁcult art while simms was bully plundering his betters by bluff simms boasted quality which might be set off against the accurate delicacy of haggart hand the english man grew rich upon rolling eye and rusty pistol he put on his manner and believed that the world would deny him nothing the scot rejoicing in his exquisite skill went to work without fuss or bluster and added the joy of artistic pride to his delight in plunder though simm manner seems the more chivalrous it required not one tithe of the courage which was haggart necessity on horseback with the semblance of man may easily challenge coachful of women it needs cool brain and sound courage to empty pocket in the watchful presence of spies and policemen while gentleman harry chose lonely road or the cover of night his exploits the switcher always worked by day hustled by crowd of witnesses their hours of leisure furnish yet more striking contrast simms was polished dandy delighting in his clothes unhappy if he were deprived of his bottle and his game haggart on the other hand was before all things sealed to his profession he would have deserted the gayest masquerade had he ever strayed into so light frivolity the chance of lightening pocket he tasted but few amusements without the limits of his craft and he preserved unto the end touch of that dour character which is the heritage of his race but withal he was an amiable decent body who would have recoiled in horror from the drunken brutality of gentleman harry though he bragged to geor ge combe of his pitiless undoing of wenches he never thrust into woman eye and he was incapable of rewarding kindness by robbery and neglect arrayed himself in smart white coat and tops but the splendour ill became his book of scoundrels by charles whibley https and he would have stood aghast at the satin frocks and velvet waistcoats of him who broke the hearts of drury lane but if he were gentler in his life haggart was prepared to ﬁght with more reckless courage when his trade demanded it it was the gentleman boast that he never shed the blood of man when david found turnkey between himself and freedom he did not hesitate to kill though his remorse was bitter enough when he neared the gallows in brief haggart was not only the better craftsman but the honester fellow and though his hands were red with blood he deserved his death far less than did the more truculent less valiant simms each had in his brain the stuff whereof men of letters are made this is their parallel and by way of contrast while the switcher was an accomplished artist gentleman harry was roystering braggart deacon brodie and charles peace brodie william brodie stood at the bar on trial his life he seemed the gallantest gentleman in court thither he had been carried in chair and still conscious of the honour paid him he ﬂashed condescending smile upon his judges his step was jaunty ever his superb attire well became the deacon of guild his coat was blue his vest very garden of ﬂowers while his satin breeches and his stockings of white silk were splendid in their simplicity beneath cocked hat his hair was fully dressed and powdered and even the prosecuting counsel assailed him with the respect due to man of fashion the fellow magniﬁcence was thrown into relief by the squalor of his accomplice geor ge smith had neither the money nor the taste to disguise himself polished rogue and he huddled far from his master he could in the rags of his mean estate nor from this moment did brodie ever abate one jot of his dignity he faced his accusers with clear eye and frigid amiability he listened to his sentence with calm contempt he laughed complacently at the sorry interludes of judicial wit and he faced the last music with bravery and cynicism which bore the stamp of true greatness it was not until after his crime that brodie heroism approved itself and even then his was triumph not of skill but of character always gentleman in manner and conduct he owed the success and the failure of his life to this one quality when in ﬂight he made flushing on board the endeavour the other passengers who knew not his name straightway christened him gentleman the enterprise itself would have been impossible to one less persuasively gifted and its proper execution is tribute to the lofty quality of his mind there was he in london stranger and fugitive yet instead of crawling furtively into ge he charters ship captures the conﬁdence of the captain carries the other passengers to flushing when they were bound leith and compels every one to confess his charm the thief also found him irresistible and while the game lasted the ﬂash kens of edinbur gh murmured the deacon name in the hushed whisper of respect his ﬁne temperament disarmed treachery in london he visited an ancient doxy of his own who with her bully shielded him from justice though betrayal would have met with an ample reward smith if he knew himself the superior craftsman trembled at the deacon nod who thus swaggered it through life with none to withhold the exacted reverence to this same personal compulsion he owed his worldly advancement deacon of the wrights guild while still young man he served upon the council was known one of edinbur gh honoured citizens and never went abroad unmarked by the ﬁnger of respectful envy he was elected in 1773 member of the cape club and met at the isle of man arms in craig close the wittiest men of his time and town book of scoundrels by charles whibley https and ferguson the poet were of the society and it was with such these that brodie might have wasted his vacant hour indeed at the very moment that he was cracking cribs and shaking the ivories he was chosen leader of fashion and gaiety and it was the elegance of the that distinguished him from his fellows the fop indeed had climbed the altitudes of life the cracksman still stumbled in the valleys if he had ready cunning in the planning of an enterprise he must needs bungle at the execution and had he not been associated with geor ge smith king of scoundrels there would be few exploits to record and yet the craft of housebreaker he had one solid advantage he knew the locks and bolts of edinbur gh he knew his had he not fashioned the most of them himself but his knowledge once imparted to his accomplices he cheerfully sank to menial ofﬁce in job did he play principal part he was merely told off by smith or another to guard the entrance and sound the alarm when on the bridge was broken the deacon found the false keys it was smith who carried off such poor booty was found and though the master suggested the attack upon bruce shop knowing full well the simplicity of the lock he lingered at the vintner over game of hazard and let the man pouch sumptuous booty even the onslaught upon the excise ofﬁce which cost his life was contrived with appalling clumsiness the deacon of the wrights guild who could slash wood at his will who knew the artiﬁce of every lock in the city let his men go to work with better implements than the stolen coulter of plough and pair of spurs and when they tackled the ill omened job brodie was of those who brought failure upon it long had they watched the door of the excise long had they studied the habits of its clerks so that they went to work in vain spirit of experiment nor on the fatal night did they force an entrance until they had dogged the porter to his home smith and brown ransacked the place money while brodie and andrew ainslie remained without to give necessary warning whereupon ainslie was seized with fright and brodie losing his head called off the others so that six hundred pounds were left that might have been an easy prey smith indignant at the collapse of the design laid the blame upon his master and they swung brodie grim spirit of farce suggested four pounds apiece the humours of the situation were all the deacon own he dressed the part in black his respectability grinned behind vizard and all the while he triﬂed nonchalantly with pistol breaking the silence with snatches from the beggar opera he promised that all their lead should turn to gold christened the coulter and the crow the great and little samuel and then went off to drink and dice at the vintner how could anger prevail against this undying gaiety and if smith were peevish at failure he was presently reconciled and prepared once more to die his deacon even after escape the amateur is still apparent true he managed the trip to flushing with his ancient extravagance true he employed all the juggleries of the law to prevent his surrender at amsterdam but he knew not the caution of the born criminal and he was run to earth because he would still write to his friends like gentleman his letters during this nightmare of disaster are perfect in their carelessness and in this he demands news of his children becomes father and citizen and furnishes schedule of their education in that he is curious concerning the issue of main and would know whether his black cock came off triumphant nor even in ﬂight did he forget his proper craft but would have his tools sent to charleston that in america he might resume the trade that had made him deacon but his was the art of conduct not of guile and he deserved capture his rare indifference why then with natural impulsion did he risk the gallows why being born thief and innocent of the thief cunning did he associate with so clever scoundrel geor ge smith with cowards craven brown and ainslie the greed of gold doubtless half persuaded him but gold was otherwise attainable and the motive was assuredly far more subtle brodie in fact was of romantic turn he was so to say gloriﬁed schoolboy surfeited with penny dreadfuls he loved above all things to patter the ﬂash to dream himself another macheath to trick himself out with all the trappings of crime he was unﬁt to commit it was never the job itself that attracted him he would always rather throw the dice than force neighbour window but he must needs have distraction from the respectability of his life everybody was at his feet he was deacon of his guild at an age whereat his fellows were striving to earn reputable living his masterpieces were fashioned and the wrights trade was already burden to go upon the cross seemed dream of freedom until he snapped his ﬁngers at the world ﬁlled his mouth with slang prepared his alibi and furnished him whole wardrobe of book of scoundrels by charles whibley https conscious irony maybe he buried his pistols beneath the domestic hearth jammed his dark lantern into the press where he kept his and determined to make an inextricable jumble of his career drink is sometimes sufﬁcient reaction against the orderliness of successful life but drink and cards failed with the deacon and at the vintner of his frequentation he encountered accomplices proper his schemes never was so outrageous protest offered against domesticity yet brodie resolution was romantic after its fashion and was far more respectable than the blackguardism of the french revolution which distracted housewifely disco ntent year after the deacon swung moreover it gave occasion his dandyism and his love of display if in one incarnation he was the complete gentleman in another he dressed the part of the perfect scoundrel and the list of his costumes would have ﬁlled one of his own ledgers but when once the possibility of housebreaking was taken from him he returned to his familiar dignity being questioned by the procur ator fiscal he shrugged his shoulders regretting that other affairs demanded his attention who should say it is unpardonable to disturb the meditations of gentleman he made will bequeathing his knowledge of law to the magistrates of edinbur gh his dexterity in cards and dice to hamilton the and all his bad qualities to his good friends and old companions brown and ainslie not doubting however that their own will secure them rope at last in prison it was his worst complaint that though the nails of his toes and ﬁngers were not quite so long nebuchadnezzar they were long enough mandarin and much longer than he found convenient thus he preserved an untroubled demeanour until the day of his death always polite and even joyous he met the smallest indulgence with enthusiasm when smith complained that respite of six weeks was of small account brodie exclaimed ge what would you and i give six weeks longer six weeks would be an age to us the day of execution was the day of his supreme triumph some men are artists in their lives so the deacon was an artist in his death nothing became him so well his manner of leaving the world there is never blot upon this exquisite performance it is superb impeccable again his dandyism supported him and he played the part of dying man in full suit of black his hair always dressed and powdered the day before he had been jovial and sparkling he had chanted all his ﬂash songs and cracked the jokes of man of fashion but he set out the gallows with ﬁrm step and rigorous demeanour he offered prayer of his own composing and lord he said i lament that i know so little of thee the patronage and the confession are alike characteristic he drew near the scaffold the model of which he had given to his native city few years since he stepped with an agile briskness he examined the halter destined his neck with an impartial curiosity his last pleasantry was uttered he ascended the table ge he muttered are ﬁrst in hand and thereafter he took farewell of his friends only one word of petulance escaped his lips when the halters were found too short his contempt slovenly workmanship urged him to protest and to demand punishment the executioner again ascending the table he assured himself against further mishap by arranging the rope with his own hands thus he was turned off in brilliant assembly the provost and magistrates in respect his dandyism were resplendent in their robes of ofﬁce and though the crowd of spectators rivalled that which paid tardy honour to jonathan wild one was hurt save the customary policeman such was the digniﬁed end of life and the duplicity is the stranger because the real deacon was not brodie the cracksman but brodie the gentleman so lightly did he esteem life that he tossed it from him in careless impulse so little did he fear death that is hanging he asked leap in the dark peace charles peace after the habit of his kind was born of scrupulously honest parents the son of religious he owed to his father not only his singular piety but his love of edged tools he never encountered an iron bar whose scission bafﬂed him so there never was methodist to whose ministrations he would not turn repentant ear after handy portico and rich booty he loved nothing so well discourse not even his precious ﬁddle occupied book of scoundrels by charles whibley https space in his heart than that devotion which the ignorant have termed hypocrisy wherefore his career was less suitable to his ambition than his inglorious end he lived the king of housebreakers and he died warning to all evildoers with prayer of intercession trembling upon his lips the hero boyhood is wrapped in obscurity it is certain that glittering precocity brought disappointment to his maturer years and he was already nineteen when he achieved his ﬁrst imprisonment even then was sorry offence which merited more than month so that he returned to freedom and his ﬁddle with his character unbesmirched serious ever in pious exercises he gained scanty living strolling musician there was never tavern in shefﬁeld where the twang of his violin was unheard and the skill wherewith he extorted music from single string earned him the style and title of the modern paganini but such an employ was too mean his pride and he soon got to work time with better success the mansions of shefﬁeld were his early prey and rich plunder rewarded his intrepidity the design was masterly its accomplishment the grand style is already discernible the houses were broken in quietude and good order none saw the opened window none heard the step upon the stair in truth the victim loss was his ﬁrst intelligence but when the booty was in the robber own safe keeping the empiricism of his method was revealed yet he knew secret and efﬁcient fence to shield him from detection yet he had not learnt that the complete burglar works alone this time he knew two both and one his own sister paltry pair of boots was the clue of discovery and goodly stretch was the proper reward of clumsy indiscretion so twenty years he wavered between the crowbar and the prison house now perfecting brilliant scheme now captured through reckles sness or drink once when mistake at manchester sent him to the hulks he owned his failure was the fruit of brandy and after his wont delivered from the dock little homily upon the beneﬁt of sobriety meanwhile his art was growing to perfection he had at last discovered that burglary demands diligent forethought campaign he had learnt that great work is achieved by multitude of minds before his boat carried off goodly parcel of silk from nottingham he was known to the neighbourhood an enthusiastic and skilful angler one day he dangled his line the next he sat peacefully at the same employ and none suspected that the mild mannered ﬁsherman had under the cloud of night despatched costly parcel to london even the years of imprisonment were not spent peace was still preparing the great achievement of his life and he framed from solitary reﬂection well from his colleagues in crime many an ingenious theory afterwards fearlessly translated into practice and when at last he escaped the slavery of the gaol was the pursuit which covered the sterner business of his life his depredation involved him in suspicion his changing features rendered recognition impossible when the exercise of his trade compelled him to shoot policeman at whalley range another was sentenced the crime and had he not encountered dyson who knows but he might have practised his art in prosperous obscurity until claimed by coward death but stormy with dyson led to the unworthy killing of the woman crime unnecessary and in sense consonant to the burglar craft and charles peace was an outlaw with reward set upon his head and now came period of true splendour like fielding like cervantes like sterne peace reserved his veritable masterpiece the certainty of his last two years were nothing less than march of triumph if you remember his constant danger you will realise the grandeur of the scheme from the moment that peace left bannercross with dyson blood upon his hands he was hunted man his capture was worth ﬁve hundred pounds his features were familiar to hundred hungry detectives had he been less than man of genius he might have taken an unavailing refuge in ﬂight or concealment but content with safety unatten ded by afﬂuence he devised surer plan he became householder now villa is an impregnable stronghold respectability oozes from the dusky mortar of its bricks and escapes in clouds of smoke from its chimneys policeman ever detects desperate rufﬁan in demure coated gentleman who day after day turns an iron gate upon its rusty hinge and thus wrapt in cloak of suburban piety peace waged pitiless and ef fective war upon his neighbours he pillaged blackheath greenwich peckham and many another home of honest worth with noiselessness and precision that were the envy of the whole family the unknown and intrepid burglar was terror to all the clerkdom of the city and though he was secret and secluded peace the two heroes were never identiﬁed at the time of his true eminence he in evelina road peckham and none was more sensible than he how well the address became his book of scoundrels by charles whibley https there he installed himself with his wife and thompson his suite was the envy of the neighbourhood his proclaimed him man of substance his gentle manners won the respect of all peckham hither he would invite his friends to such entertainments the suburb expected his musical evenings were recorded in the local paper while on sundays he chanted the songs of zion with zeal which clapham herself might envy the house in evelina road was mere haunt of quiet gentility it was chosen with admirable forethought and with stern eye upon the necessities of business beyond the garden wall frowned railway embankment which enabled the cracksman to escape from his house without opening the front door by the same embankment he might if he chose convey the trophies of the night work and what mattered it if the windows rattled to the passing train at least cloud of suspicion was dispelled here he lived two years with naught to disturb his tranquillity save thompson taste drink the hours of darkness were spent in laborious activity the open day brought its own distractions there was always bow street wherein to loaf and the study of the criminal law lost none of its excitement from the reward offered outside the fanatic who sat placidly within and the love of music was peace constant solace whatever treasures he might discard in hurried ﬂight he never left ﬁddle behind and so vast became his pilfered collection that he had to borrow an empty room in friend house its better disposal moreover he had fervent pride in his craft and you might deduce from his performance the whole theory and practice of burglary he worked ever without accomplices he knew neither the professional thief nor his lingo and association with involved him in the risk of treachery and betrayal his single colleague was friendly fence and not even at the gallows foot would he surrender the fence name his master quality was constructive imagination accident never marred his design he would visit the house of his breaking until he understood its plan and was familiar with its inhabitants this demanded an amazing circumspection but peace was stealthy cat and he would keep silent vigil hours rather than fail from an over keen anxiety having marked the place of his entry and having chosen an appropriate hour he would prevent the egress of his enemies by screwing up the doors he then secured the room wherein he worked and the job ﬁnished he slung himself into the night by the window so that ere an alarm could be raised his had carried the booty to evelina road such was the outline of his plan but being pedant he varied it at will nor was he likely to court defeat through lack of resource accomplished he was in his proper business he was equally alert to meet the accompanying risks he had brought the art of cozening strange dogs to perfection and the exigence of escape his physical equipment was complete he would resist capture with unparalleled determination and though he shuddered at the shedding of blood he never hesitated when necessity bade him pull the trigger moreover there was space into which he would not squeeze his body and the iron bars were not yet devised through which he could not make an exit was at was surprised by an inquisitive detective who demanded his name and trade i am hawker of spectacles replied peace my licence is downstairs wait two minutes and i show it you the detect ive never saw him again six inches only separated the bars of the window but peace asked more and thus silently he won his freedom true his most daring leap from the not in liberty but in broken head but he essayed task too high even his endeavour and despite his manacles at least he left his boot in the astonished warder grip less remarkable than his skill and daring were his means of evasion even without formal disguise he could elude pursuit at an instant warning his loose plastic features would assume another shape out shot his lower jaw and if by magic the blood ﬂew into his face until you might take him mulatto or if he chose he would strap his arm to his side and let the police be bafﬂed by wooden mechanism decen tly ﬁnished with hook thus he roamed london up and down unsuspected and even after his last failure at blackheath none would have discovered charles peace in john ward the burglar had not woman treachery prompted detection indeed he was an epitome of his craft the complete bur glar made manifest not only did he plan his victories with previous ingenuity but he sacriﬁced to his success both taste and sentiment his dress was always of the most sombre his only wear was the decent black of everyday godliness the least spice of dandyism might have distinguished him from his fellows book of scoundrels by charles whibley https whole vanity lay in his craft nor did the paltry sentiment of friendship deter him from his just course when the panic aroused by the silent burglar was uncontrolled neighbour consulted peace concerning the safety of his house the robber having duly noted the villa imperfections and having discovered the of jewellery and plate complacently riﬂed it the next night though his sustained shock though henceforth his friend thought meanly of his judgment he was rewarded with the solid pudding of plunder and the world whispered of the mysterious marauder with yet colder horror in truth the large simplicity and solitude of his style sets him among the classics and though others have surpassed him at single points of the game he practised the art with such universal breadth and courage were then revolution and are still unsurpassed but the burglar ever ﬁghts an unequal battle one false step and defeat him two years had john ward intimidated the seclusion of south london two years had he hidden from curious world the ugly furrowed visage of charles peace the bald head the rimmed spectacles the squat thick stood but ﬁve feet four in his stockings and adds yet another to the list of have ensured detection but the quick change and the persuasive gesture were omnipotent and until the autumn of 1878 peace was comfortably at large and then an encounter at blackheath put him within the clutch of justice his revolver failed in its duty and valiant he was at last he met his match in prison he was alternately insolent and aggrieved he blustered justice proclaimed himself the victim of sudden temptation and insisted that his intention had been ever innocent but none the less he was sentenced to lifer and the mask of john ward being torn from him he was sent to shefﬁeld to stand his trial charles peace the leap from the train is already recorded and at his last appearance in the dock he rolled upon the ﬂoor petulant and broken man when once the last doom was pronounced he forgot both ﬁddle and crowbar he surrendered himself to those exercises of piety from which he had never wavered the foolish have denounced him hypocrite not knowing that the artist may have life apart from his art and that to peace religion was an essential pursuit so he died having released from an unjust sentence the poor wretch who at whalley range had suffered his crime and offering up consolatory prayer all mankind in truth there was enemy whom he did not intercede he praye d his gaolers his executioner the ordinary his wife thompson his drunken doxy and he went to his death with the sure step of one who having done his duty is reconciled with the world the mob testiﬁed its affectionate admiration by dubbing him and remembered with effusion his last grim pleasantry is the scaffold he asked with sublime earnestness and the answer came quick and sanctimonious short cut to heaven parallel deacon brodie and charles peace not parallel but contrast since at all points peace is brodie antithesis the one is the austerest of classics caring only the ultimate perfection of his work the other is the gayest of romantics happiest when by the way he produces glittering

he had studied the remotest details of his business he was sternly professional in the conduct of his life and became an old there was antic of the policeman wherewith he was not familiar moreover not only had he reduced to science but being ostensibly nothing better than maker he had invented an incomparable set of tools wherewith to enter and evade his neighbour house brodie on the other hand was thief distraction his method was slovenly ignorance could make it though by trade wright and therefore master of all the arts of joinery he was so deﬁcient in seriousness that he stole coulter wherewith to batter the walls of the excise ofﬁce while peace fought the battle in solitude brodie was not only attended by gang but listened to the command of his subordinates and was never permitted to perform book of scoundrels by charles whibley https duty than the sounding of the alarm and yet here is the ironical contrast peace the professional thief despised his brothers and was never heard to patter word of ﬂash brodie the amateur courted the society of all cross coves and would rather express himself in pedlar french than in his choicest scots while the englishman scraped tate and brady from ﬁddle the scot limped chaunt from the beggar opera and thought himself devil of fellow the one was man about town masquerading thief the other the most serious among housebreakers singing psalms in all good faith but if peace was incomparably the better craftsman brodie was the prettier gentleman peace would not have permitted brodie to drive his the length of evelina road but brodie in revenge would have cut peace had he met him in the the one was sombre savage the other jovial comrade and it was witty freak of fortune that impelled both to follow the same trade and thus you arrive at another point of difference the englishman had intelligence of life amenity he knew naught of costume clothes were the limit of his ambition dressed always work he was like the caterpillar which assumes the green of the leaf wherein it hides he wore only such duds should attract the smallest notice and separate him far might be from his business but the scot was ﬁne dandy ever took haphazard to the cracking of kens if his reﬁnement permitted excess of splendour he went ever gloriously and appropriately apparelled he was cultured with scarce touch of provincialism to mar his gay demeanour whereas peace knew little enough outside the practice of burglary and the proper handling of the revolver our charles example could neithe r spell nor write he dissembled his low origin with the utmost difﬁculty and at the best was plastered over when not at work with the parochialism of the suburbs so far the contrast is complete and even in their similarities there is an evident difference each led double life but while brodie was most himself among his own kind the real peace was to be found not in evelina road but marking down policemen in the dusky byways of blackheath brodie grandeur was natural to him peace respectability so far it transcended the man origin was cloak of villainy each again was an inventor and while the more innocent brodie designed gallows the more hardened peace would have gained notoriety by the raising of wrecks and the patronage of plimsoll and since both preserved certain courage to the end since both died on the scaffold becomes man the contrast is once more characteristic brodie cynicism is ﬁne foil to the piety of peace and while each end was natural after its own fashion there is none who will deny to the scot the ﬁner sense of ﬁtness nor did any step in their career explain more clearly the difference in their temperament than their deﬁnitions of the gallows peace it is short cut to heaven brodie it is leap in the dark again the scot has the advantage again you reﬂect that if peace is the most accomplished classic among the housebreakers the deacon is the merriest companion who ever climbed the gallows by the shoulders of the incomparable macheath the man in the grey suit the abbé bruneau who gave his shaven head in atonement unnumbered crimes was ﬁnished exponent of duplicity in the eye of day and of entrammes he shone miracle of by night he prowled in the secret places of laval the world watched him habited in the decent black of his calling sooner was he beyond sight of his parish than his valise was opened and he arrayed the hedge suit of jaunty grey the pleasures which he sacriﬁced the lives of others and his own were squalid enough but they were the best provincial brain might imagine and he sinned the sins of hedge priest with courage and effrontery which his brethren may well envy indeed the man in the grey suit will be sent down the ages with grimmer scandal if with staler mystery than the man in the iron mask he was born of parents who were certainly poor and possibly honest at he counted dozen chouans among his ancestry and brigandage swam in his blood even his childhood was crimson with crimes which the quick memory of the countryside long ago lost in book of scoundrels by charles whibley https of having bred priest he stained his ﬁrst cure of souls with the poor sad sin of arson which the bishop fearful of scandal and loth to check promising career condoned with suitable advancement at entrammes his next beneﬁce he entered into his full inheritance of villainy and here it his own that he devised the grey suit which brought him ruin and immortality to the wild hilarious dissipation of laval the nearest town he fell an immediate and unresisting prey think of the glittering lamps the sparkling taverns the women the manifold fascinations which are the character and delight of this forgotten city why if the abbé bruneau doled out comfort and absolution at should he not enjoy at laval the wilder joys of the ﬂesh lack of mone y was the only hindrance since our priest was not of those who could pursue bonnes fortunes ever he sighed and the blowens but and the blowens he could only purchase with the sovereigns his honest calling denied him there was resource but thievery and embezzlement sins which led sometimes to falsehood or incendiarism and at pinch to the graver enterprise of murder but bruneau was not one to boggle at triﬂes women he would or old dark or fair ugly or beautiful it was all one to and the fools who withheld him riches must be punished their niggard hand while theft here and there cunning extortion of money upon the promise of good works sufﬁced his necessities but still he hungered coup and patiently he devised and watched his opportunity meanwhile his cunning protected him and even if the gaze of suspicion fell upon him he contrived his orgies with so neat discretion that the church which is not wont to expose her malefactors preserved timid and an innocent silence the abbé disappeared with commendable constancy and with that just sense of secrecy which should compel even an archiepiscopal admiration he was not of those who would drag his cloth through the mire not until the darkness he loved so fervently covered the earth would he escape from the dull respectability of entrammes nor did he ever thus escape unaccompanied by his famous valise the grey suit was an effectual disguise to his calling and so jealous was he of the church honour that he in his his tonsure one of his innumerable loves confessed in the that bruneau always retained his hat in the glare of the café protesting that headache rendered him fatally susceptible to draught and such was his thoughtful punctilio that even in the comparative solitude of guilty he covered his shorn locks with nightcap and while his conduct at laval was unimpeachable he always proved nice susceptibility in his return cab carried him within discreet distance of his home whence having exchanged the grey the more sober black he would tramp on foot and thus creep in tranquil and unobserved but simple it is to enjoy enjoyment must still be purchased and the abbé was never guilty of meanness the less guilty scheme was speedily staled and then it was that the abbé bethought him of murder his ﬁrst victim was the widow bourdais who pursued the honest calling of ﬂorist at laval already the curate was on those terms of intimacy which unite the robber with the robbed some months earlier he had imposed forced loan of sixty francs upon his victim but on the 15th of july 1893 he left entrammes resolved upon serious measure the black valise was in his hand he set forth upon the arid windy road before he reached laval he had made the accustomed transformation and it was priest but layman doucely dressed in grey that awaited mme bourdais return from the ﬂower he entered the shop with the coolness of friend and retreated to the door of the parlour when two girls came to make purchase sooner had the widow joined him than he cut her throat and with the ferocity of the beast who loves blood well plunder inﬂicted some forty woun ds upon her withered frame his escape was simple and digniﬁed he called the cabman who knew him well and who knew moreover what was required of him and the priest was snugly in bed though perhaps exhausted with blood and pleasure when the news of the murder followed him to his village next day the crime was common gossip and the abbé friends took counsel with him one there was astonished that the culprit remained undiscovered why should you marvel said bruneau i could kill you and your wife at your own without soul knowing had i taken to evil courses instead of to good i should have been terrible assassin there is touch of the pride which quincey attributes to williams in this boastfulness and throughout the parallel is irresistible williams however was the better dandy he put on and pumps because the dignity of his work demanded ﬁtting costume and bruneau wore the grey suit not without hope of disguise yet you like to think that the abbé looked complacently upon book of scoundrels by charles whibley https and had forethought the cut of his professional coat and if he be not in the ﬁrst ﬂight of artistry remember his provincial upbringing and furnish the proper excuse meanwhile the scandal of the murdered widow passed into forgetfulness and the abbé was still impoverished already he had robbed his vicar and the suspicion of the abbé fricot led on to the ﬁnal and the detected crime now fricot had noted the loss of money and of bonds and though he refrained from exposure he had confesse d to knowledge of the criminal bruneau was naturally sensitive to suspicion and he determine d upon the immediate removal of this danger to his peace on january 2 1894 fricot returned to supper after administering the extreme unction to parishioner while the meal was preparing he went into his garden in sabots and bareheaded and never again was seen alive the supper cooled the vicar was still absent the murderer hungry with his toil ate not only his own but his victim share of the food grimly hinting that fricot would not come back suicide was dreamed of murder hinted up and down the village was the search made and none was more zealous than the distressed curate at last peasant discovered some blocks of wood in the well and before long revealed themselves on the masonry speedily was the body recovered disﬁgured and battered beyond recognition and the voice of the village went up in denunciation of the abbé bruneau immunity had made the culprit callous and in few hours suspicion became certainty bleeding nose was the lame explanation given the stains which were on his clothes on the table on the keys of his harmonium quaint and characteristic folly was it that drove the murderer straight to the solace of his religion you picture him hot and from murder soothing his battered conscience with some devilish requiem the unshrived soul he had just parted from its broken body and leaving upon the harmonium the ineradicable traces of his guilt thus he lived poised between murder and the church spending upon the vulgar dissipation of breton village the blood and money of his foolish victims but him tavernes et les ﬁlles of laval meant veritable paradise and his sojourn in the country is proof enough of limited cunning had he been more richly endowed paris had been the theatre of his crimes it is he goes down to posterity the man in the grey suit and the best friend the cabmen of laval ever knew them indeed he left inconsolable monsieur the childhood of the abbé rosselot is secret his origin and man may know whether belfort or bavaria smiled upon his innocence like mystery enshrouds his early manhood and the malice of his foes who are legion denounces him jesuit of innsbruck but since he has lived within the eye of the world his villainies have been revealed clearly his attainments and history provides him other rival in the corruption of youth than the infamous thwackum it is not every scholar ambition to teach the elements and rosselot adopted his modest calling cloak of crime sooner was he installed in mansion than he became the mansion master and henceforth he ruled his employer domain with the tyrannical severity of grand inquisitor his soul wrapped in the triple brass of arrogance he even dared to lay his hands upon food before his betters were served and presently emboldened by success he would order the dinners reproach the cook with too lavish use of condimen ts and descend with insolent expostulation into the kitchen in week he had opened the cupboards upon dozen skeletons and made them rattle their rickety bones up and down the draughty staircases until the inmates shivered with horror and the terriﬁed neighbours ﬂed the haunted castle lazar once in possession of family secret he felt himself secure and henceforth he was free to browbeat his employer and to ﬂog his pupil to the satisfaction of his waspish nature moreover he was endowed with all the insight and effrontery of trained journalist so sedulous was he in his search after the truth that neither man nor woman could deny him conﬁdence and vinegar ﬂowed in his veins blood it was his merry sport to set wife against husband and children against father not even were the servants safe from his watchful inquiry and housemaids and governesses alike entrusted their hopes and fears to his malicious keeping and when the house had retired to rest with what sinister delight did he chuckle over the frailties and infamies guilty knowledge of which he had dragged from many an unwilling sinner book of scoundrels by charles whibley https oust him when installed was plain impossibility this wringer of hearts was only too glib in the surrender of another scandal and he accepted the last scurrility with christian resignation his unfortunate employer could but strengthen his vocabulary and patiently endure the presence of this smiling demoniacal tutor but too villainous curiosity was not the abbé capital sin not only did he entertain his leisure with wrecking the happiness of united family but he was an enemy open and declared of france it was his amiable pastime at the dinner when he had ﬁrst helped himself to such delicacies tempted his dainty palate to pronounce pompous eulogy upon the german emperor france he would say with an exultant smile is pays pourri which exists merely to be the football of prussia she has but one hope of the monster and that is to fall into the benign occupation of vigorous race once upon infamy is scarce was conducting his young charges past over the lintel of whose door glittered those proud initials r they stand asked this demon barlow and when the patriotic tommy hesitated an answer the preceptor exclaimed with ineffable contempt fous it is wonder then that this foe of his fatherland feared to receive letter openly addressed rather he would slink out under cover of night and seek his correspondence at the poste restante like guilty lover or british tourist the château presles was built his reception it was haunted by secret which none dare murmur in the remotest garret there was more than whisper of murder in the air but the marquis shuddered when his wife eye frowned upon him true the miserable menaldo had disappeared from his seminary ten years since but threats of disclosure were uttered continually and respectability might only be purchased by profound silence here was the abbé most splendid opportunity and he seized it with all the eagerness of greedy temperament the marquise wealthy peasant who was rather at home on the wild than in her stately castle became an instant prey to his devilish intrigue the governess an antic old maid of whose conversation was designed to bring blush to the cheek of the most hardened dragoon was immediately on terms of so frank an intimacy that she ﬂung bread pellets at him across the table and joyously proposed if we may believe the priest on his oath to set up housekeeping with him that they might save expense two irited boys were always at hand to encourage his taste ﬂogging and had it not been the marquis the abbé cup would have been full to overﬂowing but the marquis loved not the lean ogling instructor of his sons and presently began to assail him with all the abuse of which he was master he charged the abbé with unspeakable villainy salop and saligaud were the terms in which he would habitually refer to him he knew the rascal spy and modesty restrained him from proclaim ing his knowledge but whatever insul ts were thrown at the abbé he received with grin complacent shylock was he not conscious that when he liked the pound of ﬂesh was his own with ﬁend duplicity he laid his plans of ruin and death the marquise swayed to his will received him secretly in the blue room whose very colour suggests guilty intrigue though never upon the oath of an abbé when the key was turned in the lock journey to switzerland had freed him from the haunting suspicion of the marquis and at last he might compel the wife to denounce her husband murderer the terriﬁed woman drew the indictment at the abbé dictation and when her husband returned to amand he was instantly thrust into prison nothing remained but to cajole the sons into an expressed hatred of their father and the last enormity was committed by masterpiece of cunning father one chance of escape argued this villain in cassock to be proved an inhuman rufﬁan swear that he beat you unmercifully and you will save him from the guillotine all the dupes learned their lesson with certainty which reﬂects inﬁnite credit upon the abbé method of instruction once in his life the abbé had been moved by greed well by villainy his early exploits had worse motive than the satisfaction of an inhuman lust cruelty and destruction but the marquise was rich and when once her husband head were off might not the abbé reap his share of the gathered harvest the stakes were high but the game was worth the playing and rosselot played it with spirit and energy unto the last card his appearance in court is ever memorable and his ferret eyes glinted through glass at the president he seemed the villain of some middle age romance his head poised upon lean bony frame was embellished with nose thin and sharp the blade of knife his tightly compressed lips were an indication of the rascal determination day in is how spectator described him and if ever sinister nature glared through sinister ﬁgure the abbé character was revealed before he parted his lips in book of scoundrels by charles whibley https he stood and immovable he treated the imprecations of the marquis with cold disdain the burden of proof grew heavy on his back he shrugged his shoulders in weary indifference he told his monstrous story with cynical contempt which has scarce its equal in the history of crime and priest he was he proved that he did not yield to the marquis himsel f in the rabelaisian amplitude of his vocabulary he brought charges against the weird world of presles with an insouciance and brutality which defeated their own aim he described the vices of his master and the sins of the servants in slang which would sit more gracefully upon an idle roysterer than upon pious abbé and his story ended he leered at the court with the satisfaction of one who had dischar ged fearsome duty but his rascality overshot its mark the marquise obedient to his priestly casuistry displayed too ﬁerce zeal in the execution of his commands and he took to ﬂight hoping to lose in the larger world of paris the notoriety which his prowess won him among the poor despised berrichons he left behind our consolation snatch of philosophy which helps to explain his last and greatest achievement who have money exist only to be ﬂeeced thus he spake with reckless revelation of self yet the mystery of his being is still unpierced he is traitor schemer spy but is he an abbé perhaps not at any rate he once attended the des morts and was heard to mumble which every good catholic remembers has place in that solemn service printed by and const able printers to his majesty at the edinbur gh university press
