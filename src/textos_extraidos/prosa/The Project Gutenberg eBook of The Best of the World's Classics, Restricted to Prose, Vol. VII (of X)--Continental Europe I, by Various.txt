happiness that is to know god he is the beginning and the end of every good and he is the highest happiness then said the mind this methinks must be the highest good so that man should need other good nor moreover be solicitous beyond he possesses that which is the roof of all other goods it includes all other goods and has all of them within it it would not be the highest good if any good were

the other felicities all within it and includes and holds them within it and to it there is deﬁciency of none neither has it need of any but they all come from it and again all return to it all waters come from the sea and again all come to the sea there is none in the little fountain which does not seek the sea and again from the sea it arrives at the earth and so it ﬂows gradually through the earth till it again comes to the same fountain that it before ﬂowed from and so again to the sea now this is an example of the true goods which all mortal men desire to obtain tho they by various ways think to arrive at them every man has natural good in himself because every man desires to obtain the true good but it is hindered by the transitory goods because it is more prone thereto some men think that it is the best happiness that man be so rich that he have need of nothing more and they choose life accordingly some men think that this is the highest good that he be among his fellows the most honorable of his fellows and they with all energy seek this some think that the supreme good is in the highest power these desire either themselves to rule or else to associate themselves in friendship with their rulers some persuade themselves that it is the best that man be illustrious and celebrated and have good fame they therefore seek this both in peace and in war many reckon it the greatest good and the greatest happiness that man be always blithe in this present life and fulﬁl all his lusts some indeed who desire these riches are desirous thereof because they would have the greater power that they may the more securely enjoy these worldly lusts and also the riches many there are of those who desire power because they would gather overmuch money or again they are desirous to spread the celebrity of their name on account of such and other like frail and perishable advantages the thought of every human mind is troubled with solicitud and with anxiety it then imagines that it has obtained some exalted goods when it has won the ﬂattery of the people and methinks that it has bought very false greatness some with much anxiety seek wives that thereby they may above all things have children and also live happily true friends then i say are the most precious things of all these worldly felicities they are not indeed to be reckoned worldly goods but divine deceitful fortune does not produce them but god who naturally formed them relations of every other thing in this world man is desirous either that he may through it attain to power or else some worldly lust except of the true friend whom he loves sometimes affection and ﬁdelity tho he expect to himself other rewards nature joins and cements friends together with inseparable love but with these worldly goods and with this present wealth men make oftener enemies than friends by these and by many such things it may be evident to all men that all the bodily goods are inferior to the faculties of the soul we indeed think that man is the stronger because he is great in his body the fairness moreover and the vigor of the body rejoices and delights the man and health makes him cheerful in all these bodily felicities men seek simple happiness it seems to them whatsoever every man chieﬂy loves above all other things that he persuades himself is best him and that is his highest good when therefore he has acquired that he imagines that he may be very happy i not deny that these goods and this happiness are the highest good of this present life every man considers that thing best which he chieﬂy loves above other things and therefore he persuades himself that he is very happy if he can obtain what he then most desires is not now clearly enough shown to thee the form of the false goods that is then possessions dignity and power and glory and pleasure concerning pleasure epicurus the philosopher said when he inquired concerning all those other goods which we before mentioned then said he that pleasure was the highest good because all the other goods which we before mentioned gratify the mind and delight it but pleasure alone chieﬂy gratiﬁes the body but we will still speak concerning the nature of men and concerning their pursuits tho then their mind and their nature be now dimmed and they are by that fall sunk down to evil and thither inclined yet they are desirous so far they can and may of the highest 8 9 10 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics restricted to prose vol vii of x continental europe i by various https drunken man knows that he should go to his house and to his rest and yet is not able to ﬁnd the way thither so is it also with the mind when it is weighed down by the anxieties of this world it is sometimes intoxicated and misled by them so far that it can not rightly ﬁnd out good nor yet does it appear to those men that they at all err who are desirous to obtain this that they need labor after nothing more but they think that they are able to collect together all these goods so that none may be excluded from the number they therefore know other good than the collecting of all the most precious things into their power that they may have need of nothing besides them but there is one that has not need of some addition except god alone he has of his own enough nor has he need of anything but that which he has in himself dost thou think however that they foolishly imagine that that thing is best deserving of all estimation which they may consider most desirable i know that it is not to be despised how can that be evil which the mind of every man considers to be good and strives after and desires to obtain it is not evil it is the highest good why is not power to be reckoned one of the highest goods of this present life is that to be esteemed vain and useless which is the most useful of all those worldly things that is power is good fame and renown to be accounted nothing it is not ﬁt that any one account it nothing every man thinks that best which he most loves we not know that anxiety or difﬁculties or trouble or pain or sorrow is happiness what more then need we say about these felicities does not every man know what they are and also know that they are the highest good and yet almost every man seeks in very little things the best felicities because he thinks that he may have them all if he have that which he then chieﬂy wishes to obtain this is then what they chieﬂy wish to obtain wealth and dignity and authority and this world glory and ostentation and worldly lust of all this they are desirous because they think that through these things they may obtain that there be not to them deﬁciency of anything wished neither of dignity nor of power nor of renown nor of bliss they wish all this and they well that they desire it tho they seek it variously by these things we may clearly perceive that every man is desirous of this that he may obtain the highest good if they were able to discover it or knew how to seek it rightly but they not seek it in the most right way it is not of this world footnotes from the consolations of philosophy the translation of alfred the great modernized boethius is not usually classed roman author altho gibbon said of him that he was the last roman whom cato or cicero could have recognized his countryman chaucer made translation of boethius which was printed by caxton john walton made version in 1410 which was printed at monastery in another early version made by george coluile was published in several others appeared in the sixteenth century thomas aquinas born near aquino italy probably in 1225 died in 1274 entered the dominican order studied at cologne under albertus magnus taught at cologne paris rome and bologna his chief work the summa theologiæ his complete writings collected in definition of happiness 3 11 2 12 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics restricted to prose vol vii of x continental europe i by various https word end has two meanings in one meaning it stands the thing itself which we desire to gain thus the miser end is money in another meaning it stands the near attainment or possession or use or enjoyment of the thing desired if one should say that the possession of money is the miser end or the enjoyment of something pleasant the end of the sensualist in the ﬁrst meaning of the word therefore the end of man is the uncreated good namely god who alone of his inﬁnite goodness can perfectly satisfy the will of man but according to the second meaning the last end of man is something created existing in himself which is nothing else than the attainment or enjoyment of the last end now the last end is called happiness if therefore the happiness of man is considered in its cause or object in that way it is something uncreated but if it is considered in essence in that way happiness is created thing happiness is said to be the sovereign good of man because it is the attainment or enjoyment of the sovereign good so far the happiness of man is something created existing in the man himself we must say that the happiness of man is an act happiness is the last perfection of man but everything is perfect so far it is in act potentiality without actuality is imperfect happiness therefore must consist in the last and crowning act of man but it is manifest that activity is the last and crowning act of an active being whence also it is called by the philosopher the second act and hence it is that each thing is said to be the sake of its activity it needs must be therefore that the happiness of man is certain activity life has two meanings one way it means the very being of the living and in that way happiness is not life of god alone can it be said that his own being is his happiness in another way life is taken to mean the activity on the part of the living thing by which activity the principle of life is reduced to act thus we speak of an active or contemplative life or of life of pleasure and in this way the last end is called life everlasting is clear from the text this is life everlasting that they know thee the only true god by the deﬁnition of boethius that happiness is state made perfect by the aggregate sum of all things good nothing else is meant than that the happy man is in state of perfect good but aristotle has exprest the proper essence of happiness showing by what it is that man is constituted in such state namely by certain activity action is there is one variety that proceeds from the agent to exterior matter the action of cutting and burning and such an activity can not be happiness such activity is not an act and perfection of the agent but rather of the patient there is another action immanent or remaining in the agent himself feeling understanding and willing such action is perfection and act of the agent and an activity of this sort may possibly be happiness since happiness means some manner of ﬁnal perfection happiness must have different meanings according to the different grades of perfection that there are attainable by different beings capable of happiness in god is happiness by essence because his very being is his activity because he does not enjoy any other thing than himself in the angels ﬁnal perfection is by way of certain activity whereby they are united to the uncreated good and this activity is in them one and everlasting in men in the state of the present life ﬁnal perfection is by way of an activity whereby they are united to god but this activity can not be everlasting or continuous and by consequence it is not one because an act is multiplied by interruption and therefore in this state of the present life perfect happiness is not to be had by man hence the philosopher placing the happiness of man in this life says that it is imperfect and after much discussion he comes to this conclusion we call them happy so far happiness can be predicated of men but we have promise from god of perfect happiness when we shall be like the angels in heaven regards this perfect happiness the objection drops because in this state of happiness the mind of man is united to god by one continuous and everlasting activity but in the present life so far we fall short of the unity and continuity of such an activity so much we lose of the 13 14 15 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics restricted to prose vol vii of x continental europe i by various https of happiness there is however granted us certain partici pation in happiness and the more continuous and undivided the activity can be the more will it come up to the idea of happiness and therefore in the active life which is busied with many things there is less of the essence of happiness than in the contemplative life which is busy with the one occupation of the contemplation of truth footnotes from the ethics the complete works of aquinas were published in 1787

controversy to the real authorship of this famous work many early editions bear the name of thomas including one of the year 1471 which is sometimes thought to be the ﬁrst against his authorship it is contended that he was professional copyist and that the use of his name in the ﬁrst edition conformed to custom that belonged more to transcriber than to an author one of the earliest english versions of thomas kempis was made by wyllyam atkynson and printed by wykyns worde in translation by edward hake appeared in many other early english editions are known france twelfth centur geoffrey born

one joined his battle corps the marquis of montferrat advanced toward the palace of bucoleon and having occupied it determined to spare the lives of all those he found therein there were found there women of the highest rank and of the most honorable character the sister of the king of france who had been an empress and the sister of the king of hungary and other women of quality of the treasure that there was in the palace i can not speak there was so much that it was without end or measure besides this palace which was surrender ed to the marquis boniface of montferrat that of blachem was surrendered to henry brother of count baldwin of flanders the booty that was found here was so great that it can only be compared to that which was found in bucoleon 6 each soldier ﬁlled the room that was assigned to him with plunder and had the treasure guarded and the others who were scattered through the city also had their share of spoil and the booty obtained was so great that it is impossible to estimate it and silver and plate and precious stones altar cloths and vestments of silk and robes of ermine and treasure that had been buried under the ground and truly doth testify geof frey of marshal of champag ne when he says that never in the whole of history had city yielded so much plunder every man took much he could carry and there was enough every one thus fared the crusaders and the venetians and so great was the joy and the honor of the victory that god had given them that those who had been in poverty were rich and living in luxury thus was passed palm sunday and easter sunday in the honor and joy which god had granted them and they had good cause to be grateful to our lord they had more than twenty thousand armed men among them all and by the grace of god they had captured four hundred thousand or more and that in the strongest city in the world that is to say city of any size and the best fortiﬁed then it was announced throughout the whole army by the marquis boniface of montferrat who was head of the army and by the barons and the doge of venice that all the booty should be collected and assessed under pain of excommunication and the places were chosen in three churches and they put over them guards french and venetians the most loyal that they could ﬁnd and then each man began to bring his booty and put it together some acted uprightly and others not covetousness which is the root of all evil prevented them but the covetous began from this moment to keep things back and our lord began to like them less oh god how loyally they had behaved up to that moment and the lord god had shown them that in everything he had honored and favored them above all other people and now the righteous began to suffer the wicked the plunder and the booty were collected and you must know that it was not all equally divided there were number of those who retained share in spite of the dread of papal excommunication whatever was brought to the churches was collected and divided between the french and venetians equally had been arranged and you must know that the crusaders when they had divided paid on their part ﬁfty thousa nd marks of silver to the

western christians against its greek rulers this conquest was also inspired by the commercial ambition of the venetians who had long coveted what were believed to be the fabulous riches of the city

the town with hundred knights and ten thousand horsemen and footmen so burned he the count land and spoiled his country and slew his men now the count garin beaucaire was old and frail and his good days were gone over heir had he neither son nor daughter save one young man only such an one i shall tell you aucassin was the name of the damoiseau fair was he goodly and great and featly fashioned of his body and limbs his hair was yellow in little curls his eyes and laughing his face beautiful and shapely his nose high and well set and so richly seen was he in all things good that in him was none evil at all but so suddenly was he overtaken of love who is great master that he would not of his will be knight nor take arms nor follow tourneys nor whatsoever him beseemed therefore his father and mother said to him son go take thine arms mount thine horse and hold thy land and help thy men if they see thee among them more stoutly will they keep in battle their lives and lands and thine and mine father answered aucassin what are you saying now never may god give aught of my desire if i be knight or mount my horse or face stour and battle wherein knights smite and are smitten again unless thou give nicolette my true love that i love so well son said the father this may not be let nicolette go is she out of strange land and the viscount of this town bought her of the saracens and

wilt have i will give thee the daughter of king or count there is man so rich in france but if thou desire his daughter thou shall have her faith my father said aucassin tell where is the place so high in all the world that nicolette my sweet lady and love would not grace it well if she were empress of constantinople or of germany or queen of france or england it were little enough her so gentle is she and courteous and debonnaire and compact of all good qualities when count garin beaucaire knew that he would not avail to withdraw aucassin his son from the love of nicolette he went to

was right rich man so had he rich palace with garden in face of it in an upper chamber thereof he had nicolette placed with one old woman to keep her company and in that chamber put bread and meat and wine and such things were needful then he had the door sealed that none might come in or go forth save that there was one window over against the garden and quite strait through which came to them

nicolette of her part was in the chamber now it was summer the month of may when days are warm and long and clear and the nights still and serene nicolette lay one night on her bed and saw the moon shine clear through window and heard the nightingale sing in the garden and she minded her of aucassin her friend whom she loved so well then fell she to thoughts of count garin of beaucaire that he hated her to death and therefore deemed she that there she would longer abide that if she were told of and the count knew where she lay an ill death he would make her die she saw that the old woman was sleeping who held her company then she arose and clad her in mantle of silk she had by her very goodly and took sheets of the bed and towels and knotted one to the other and made therewith cord long she might and knotted it to pillar in the window and let herself slip down into the garden then caught up her raiment in both hands behind and before and kilted up her kirtle because of the dew that she saw lying deep on the grass and so went on her way down through the garden her locks were yellow and curled her eyes and smiling her face featly fashioned the nose high and fairly set the lips more red than cherry or rose in time of summer her teeth white and small and her breasts so ﬁrm that they bore up the folds of her bodice they had been two walnuts so slim was she in the waist that your two hands might have clipt her and the daisy ﬂowers that brake beneath her she went tiptoe and that bent above her instep seemed black against her feet and ankles so white was the maiden she came to the poster and unbarred it and went out through the streets of beaucaire keeping always on the shadowy side the moon was shining right clear and so wandered she till she came to the tower where her lover lay the tower was ﬂanked with pillars and she cowered under one of them wrapt in her mantle then thrust she her head through crevice of the tower that was old and worn and heard aucassin who was weeping within and making dole and lament the sweet friend he loved so well and when she had listened to him some time she began to speak when aucassin heard nicolette say that she would pass into far country he was all in wrath fair sweet friend quoth he thou shalt not go then wouldst thou be my death and the ﬁrst man that saw thee and had the might withal would take thee straightway into his bed to be his leman and once thou camest into man bed and that bed not mine wit ye well that i would not tarry till i had found knife to pierce my heart and slay myself nay verily wait so long i would not but would hurl myself so far i might see wall or black stone and i would dash my head against it so mightily that the eyes would start and my brain burst rather would i die even such death than know that thou hadst lain in man bed and that bed not mine aucassin she said i trow thou lovest not much thou sayest but i love thee more than thou lovest ah fair sweet friend said aucassin it may not be that thou shouldest love even i love thee woman may not love man man loves woman woman love lies in her eye and the bud of her breast and her foot tiptoe but the love of man is in his heart planted whence it can never issue forth and pass away now when aucassin and nicolette were holding this parley together the town watchmen were coming down street with swords drawn beneath their cloaks count garin had charged them that if they could take her they should slay her but the sentinel that was on the tower saw them comin g and heard them speaking of nicolette they went and threatening to slay her god quoth he this were great pity to slay so fair maid right great charity it were if i could say aught to her and they perceive it not and she should be on her guard

follow on the track of his blood in the grass but so much he went in thoughts of nicolette his lady sweet that he felt pain nor torment and all the day hurled through the forest in this fashion nor heard word of her and when he saw vespers draw nigh he began to weep that he found her not all down an old road and he fared when anon looking along the way before him he saw such an one i shall tell you tall was he and great of growth ugly and hideous his head huge and blacker than charcoal and more than the breadth of hand between his two eyes and he had great cheeks and big nose and ﬂat big nostrils and wide and thick lips redder than steak and great teeth yellow and ugly and he was shod with hosen and shoon of bound with cords of bark up over the knee and all about him great cloak and he leaned upon grievous cudgel and aucassin came unto him and was afraid when he beheld him so they parted from each other and aucassin rode on the night was fair and still and so long he went that he came to the lodge of boughs that nicolette had builded and woven within and without over and under with ﬂowers and it was the fairest lodge that might be seen when aucassin was ware of it he stopt suddenly and the light of the moon fell therein forsooth quoth aucassin here was nicolette my sweet lady and this lodge builded she with her fair hands the sweetne ss of it and love of her will i now

stone and drave his shoulder out of its place then knew he that he was hurt sore nathless he bore him with that force he might and fastened his horse with the other hand to thorn then turned he on his side and crept backwise into the lodge of boughs and he looked through gap in the lodge and saw the stars in heaven and one that was brighter than the rest so began he to speak when nicolette heard aucassin she came to him she was not far away she passed within the lodge and threw her arms about his neck clipt him and kissed him fair sweet friend welcome be thou and thou fair sweet love be thou

northampton and the earl of arundel with the second battle were on wing in good order ready to comfort the prince battle if need were the lords and knights of france came not to the assembly together in good order some came before and some came after in such haste and evil order that one of them did trouble another when the french king saw the englishmen his blood changed and said to his marshals make the genoways go on before and begin the battle in the name of god and st denis there were of the genoways about ﬁfteen thousand but they were so weary of going afoot that day six leagues armed with their that they said to their constables we be not well ordered to ﬁght this day we be not in the case to any great deed of arms we have more need of rest these words came to the earl of alençon who said man is well at ease to be charged with such sort of rascals to be faint and fail now at most need also the same season there fell great rain and clipse with terrible thunder and before the rain there came ﬂying over both battles great number of crows fear of the tempest coming then anon the air began to wax clear and the sun to shine fair and bright the which was right in the frenchmen eyen and on the englishmen backs when the genoways were assembled together and began to approa ch they made great leap and cry to abash the englishmen but they stood still and stirred not all that then the genoways again the second time made another leap and fell cry and stept forward little and the englishmen removed not one foot thirdly again they leapt and cried and went forth till they came within shot then they shot ﬁercely with their then the english archers stept forth one pace and let ﬂy their arrows so wholly and so thick that it seemed snow when the genoways felt the arrows piercing through heads arms and breasts many of them cast down their and did cut their strings and returned discomﬁted when the french king saw them ﬂy away he said slay these rascals they shall let and trouble us without reason 39 40 41 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics restricted to prose vol vii of x continental europe i by various https ye should have seen the men of arms dash in among them and killed great number of them and ever still the englishmen shot whereas they saw thickest press the sharp arrows ran into the men of arms and into their horses and many fell horse and men among the genoways and when they were down they could not relieve again the press was so thick that one overthrew another and also among the englishmen there were certain rascals that went afoot with great knives and they went in among the men of arms and slew and murdered many they lay on the ground both earls barons knights and squires whereof the king of england was after displeased he had rather they had been taken prisoners the valiant king of bohemia called charles of luxembour g son to the noble emperor henry of luxembour g all that he was nigh blind when he understood the order of the battle he said to them about him where is the lord charles my son his men said sir we can not tell we think he be ﬁghting then he said sirs ye are my men my companions and friends in this journey i require you bring so far forward that i may strike one stroke with my sword they said they would his commandment and to the intent that they should not lose him in the press they tied all their reins of their bridles each to other and set the king before to accomplish his desire and so they went on their enemies the lord charles of bohemia his son who wrote himself king of almaine and bare the arms he came in good order to the battle but when he saw that the matter went awry on their party he departed i can not tell you which way the king his father was so far forward that he strake stroke with his sword yea and more than four and fought valiantly and so did his company and they adventured themselves so forward that they were there all slain and the next day they were found in the place about the king and all their horses tied each to other the earl of alençon came to the battle right ordinately and fought with the englishmen and the earl of flanders also on his part these two lords with their companies coasted the english archers and came to the prince battle and there fought valiantly long the french king would fain have come thither when he saw their banners but there was great hedge of archers before him the same day the french king had given great black courser to sir john of hainault and he made the lord thierry of senzeille to ride on him and to bear his banner the same horse took the bridle in the teeth and brought him through all the currours of the englishmen and he would have returned again he fell in great dike and was sore hurt and had been there dead and his page had not been who followed him through all the battles and saw where his master lay in the dike and had none other let but his horse the englishmen would not issue out of their battle taking of any prisoner then the page alighted and relieved his master then he went not back again the same way that they came there was too many in his way this battle between broye and crécy this saturday was right cruel and fell and many feat of arms done that came not to my knowledge in the night divers knights and squires lost their masters and sometime came on the englishmen who received them in such wise that they were ever nigh slain there was none taken to mercy nor to ransom so the englishmen were determined in the morning the day of the battle certain frenchmen and almains perforce opened the archers of the prince battle and came and fought with the men of arms hand to hand then the second battle of the englishmen came to succor the prince battle the which was time they had then much ado and they with the prince sent messenger to the king who was on little windmill hill then the knight said to the king sir the earl of warwick and the earl of oxford sir raynold cobham and other such be about the prince your son are ﬁercely fought withal and are sore handled wherefore they desire you that you and your battle will come and aid them if the frenchmen increase they doubt they will your son and they shall have much ado then the king said is my son dead or hurt or on the earth felled sir quoth the knight but he is hardly matched wherefore he hath need of your aid well said the king return to him and to them that sent you hither and say to them that they send more to any adventure that falleth long my son is alive and also say to them

in the ﬁeld on the french party but sir godfrey could not come to him betimes he was slain or he could come at him and so was also the earl of aumale his nephew in another place the earl of alençon and the earl of flanders fought valiantly every lord under his own banner but ﬁnally they could not resist against the puissance of the englishmen and so there they were also slain and divers other knights and squires also the earl louis of blois nephew to the french king and the duke of lorraine fought under their banners but at last they were closed in among company of englishmen and welshmen and there were slain all their prowess also there was slain the earl of auxerre the earl of and many other in the evening the french king who had left about him more than threescore persons one and

loss at this time ye shall recover it again another season and so he took the king horse by the bridle and led him away in manner perforce then the king rode till he came to the castle of broye the gate was closed because it was by that time dark then the king called the captain who came to the walls and said who is that calleth there this time of night then the king said open your gate quickly

this world especially in servants toward their masters and i have always found that proud and stately princes who will hear but few are more liable to be imposed upon than those who are open and accessible but of all the princes that i ever knew the wisest and most dexterous to extricate himself out of any danger or difﬁculty in time of adversity was our master king louis xi he was the humblest in his conversation and habit and the most painful and indefatigable to win over any man to his side that he thought capable of doing him either mischief or service tho he was often refused he would never give over man that he wished to gain but still prest and continued his insinuations promising him largely and presenting him with such sums and honors he knew would gratify his ambition and such he had discarded in time of peace and prosperity he paid dear when he had occasion them to recover them again but when he had once reconciled them he retained enmity toward them what has passed but employed them freely the future he was naturally kind and indulgent to persons of mean estate and hostile to all great men who had need of him never prince was so conversable nor so inquisitive he his desire was to know everybody he could and indeed he knew all persons of any authority or worth in england spain portugal and italy in the territories of the dukes of burgundy and bretagne and among his own subjects and by those qualities he preserved the crown upon his head which was in much danger by the enemies he had created to himself upon his accession to the throne but above all his great bounty and liberality did him the greatest service and yet he behaved himself wisely in time of distress so when he thought himself little out of danger tho it were but by truce he would disoblige the servants and ofﬁcers of his court by mean and petty ways which were little to his advantage and peace he could hardly endure the thoughts of it he spoke slightingly of most people and rather before their faces than behind their backs unless he was afraid of them and of that sort there were great many he was naturally somewhat timorous when he had done himself any prejudice by his talk or was apprehensive he should so and wished to make amends he would say to the person whom he had disobliged i am sensible my tongue has done good deal of mischief but on the other hand it has sometimes done much good however it is but reason i should make some reparation the injury and he never used this kind of apologies to any person but he granted some favor to the person to whom he made it and it was always of considerable amount it is certainly great blessing from god upon any prince to have experienced adversity well prosperity good well evil and especially if the good outweighs the evil it did in the king our master i am of opinion that the troubles he was involved in in his youth when he ﬂed from his father and resided six years together with philip duke of burgundy were of great service to him there he learned to be complaisant to such he had occasion to use which was slight advantage of adversity soon he found himself powerful and crowned king his mind was wholly bent upon revenge but he quickly found the inconvenience of this repented by degrees of his indiscretion and made sufﬁcient reparation his folly and error by regaining those he had injured besides i am very conﬁdent that if his education had not been different from the usual education of such nobles i have seen in france he could not so easily have worked himself out of his troubles

always in their youth and this is to be attributed to the method of their education or some particular blessing of god of all diversions he loved hunting and hawking in their seasons but his chief delight was in dogs in hunting his eagerness and pain were equal to his pleasure his chase was the stag which he always ran down he rose very early in the morning rode sometimes great distance and would not leave his sport let the weather be never so bad and when he came home at night he was often very weary and generally in violent passion with some of his courtiers or huntsmen hunting is sport not always to be managed according to the master direction yet in the opinion of most people he understood it well any prince of his time he was continually at these sports lodging in the country villages to which his recreations led him till he was interrupted by business during the most part of the summer there was constantly war between him and charles duke of burgundy and in the winter they made truces so that he had but little time during the whole year to spend in pleasure and even then the fatigues he underwent were excessive when his body was at rest his mind was at work

kingdom embroiled in war with his father charles vii which lasted not long and was called the praguer ie when he was arrived at man estate he was married much against his inclination to the king of scotland daughter and he regretted her existence during the whole course of her life afterward by reason of the broils and factions in his father court he retired into dauphiny which was his own whither many persons of quality followed him and indeed more than he could entertain during his residence in dauphiny he married the duke of savoy daughter and not long after he had great disputes with his father and terrible war was begun between them his father king charles vii seeing his son attended by so many good ofﬁcers and raising men at his pleasure resolved to go in person against him with considerable body of forces in order to disperse them while he was upon his march he put out proclamations requiring them all his subjects under great penalties to repair to him and many obeyed to the great displeasure of the dauphin who ﬁnding his father incensed tho he was strong enough to resist resolved to retire and leave that country to him and accordingly he removed with but slender retinue into burgundy to duke philip court who received him honorably furnished him nobly and maintained him and his principal servants by way of pensions and to the rest he gave presents he saw occasion during the whole time of their residence there however the dauphin entertained so many at his own expense that his money often failed to his great disgust and mortiﬁcation he was forced to borrow or his people would have forsa ken him which is certainly great afﬂiction to prince who was utterly unaccustomed to those straits so that during his residence at the court of burgundy he had his anxieties he 50 51 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics restricted to prose vol vii of x continental europe i by various https constrained to cajole the duke and his ministers lest they should think he was too burdensome and had laid too long upon their hands he had been with them six years and his father king charles was constantly pressing and soliciting the duke of burgundy by his ambassadors either to deliver him up to him or to banish him out of his dominions and this you may believe gave the dauphin some uneasy thoughts and would not suffer him to be idle in which season of his life then was it that he may be said to have enjoyed himself i believe from his infancy and innocence to his death his whole life was nothing but one continued scene of troubles and fatigues and i am of opinion that if all the days of his life were computed in which his joys and pleasures outweighed his pain and trouble they would be found so few that there would be

which man may change his way of thinking and woman should deem herself happier to have won her husband by patience and long effort than if fortune and her parents had given her more perfect one yes said oisille this is an example all married women let her follo w this example who will said parlamente but it would not be possible to have such long patience however true it may be that in all estates patience is ﬁne virtue it my opinion that in marriage it brings about at last unfriendliness because suffering unkindness from fellow being one is forced to separate from him far possible and from this separation arises contempt the fault of the disloyal one and in this contempt little by little love diminishes it is what is valued that is loved but there is danger said ennarsuite that the impatient wife may ﬁnd furious husband who would give her pain in lieu of patience but what could husband said parlamente save what has been recounted in this story what could he said ennarsuite he could beat his i think said parlamente that good woman would not be so grieved in being beaten out of anger in being contemptuously treated by man who does not care her and after having endured the suffering of the loss of his friendship nothing the husband might would cause her much concern and besides the story says that the trouble she took to draw him back to her was because of her love her children and i believe it and you think it was so very patient of her said nomerﬁde to set ﬁre to the bed in which her husband was sleeping y es said longarine when she saw the smoke she awoke him and that was just the thing where she was most in fault of such husbands those the ashes are good to make lye the washtub y are cruel longarine said oisille and you did not live in such fashion with your husband said longarine god be thanked he never gave such occasion but reason to regret him all my life instead of to complain of him and if he had treated you in this way said nomerﬁde what would you have done i loved him so much said longarine that i think i should have killed him and then killed myself to die after such vengeance would be pleasanter to than to live faithfully with faithless husband far i see said hircan you love your husbands only yourselves if they are good after your own heart you love them well if they commit toward you the least fault in the world they have lost their week work by saturday the long and the short is that you want to be mistresses my part i am of your mind provided all the husbands also agree to it it is reasonable said parlamente that the man rule us our head but not that he desert us or us god said oisille has set in such due order the man and the woman that if the marriage estate is not abused i hold it to be one of the most beautiful

gargantua kept was that he fell to crying like cow and cast down his face hiding it with his cap nor could they possibly draw one word from him whereat his father was so grievously vexed that he would have killed maître jobelin but the said des marays withheld him from it by fair persuasions so that at length he paciﬁed his wrath the grangousier commanded he should be paid his wages that they

vital spirits and appareled himself according to the season but willingly he would wear great long gown of thick frieze lined with fox fur afterward he combed his head with the german comb which is the four ﬁngers and the thumb his preceptors said that to comb himself otherwise to wash and make himself neat was to lose time in this world then to suppress the dew and bad air he breakfasted on fair fried tripe fair grilled meats fair hams fair hashed capon and store of sipped brewis ponocrates showed him that he ought not to eat so soon after rising out of his bed unless he had performed some exercise beforehand gargantua answered what have not i sufﬁciently well exercised myself i rolled myself six or seven turns in my bed before i rose is not that enough pope alexander did so by the advice of jew his physician and lived till his dying day in despite of the envious my ﬁrst masters have used to it saying that breakfast makes good memory wherefore they drank ﬁrst i am very well

was naturally phlegmatic he began his meal with some dozens of hams dried meats tongu es mullet roe chitterlings and such other forerunners of wine in the meanwhile four of his folks did cast into his mouth one after another continually mustard by whole shovelfuls immediately after that he drank horriﬁc draft of white wine the ease of his kidneys when that was done he ate according to the season meat agreeable to his appetite and then left off eating when he was like to crack fulness his drinking he had neither end nor rule he was wont to say that the limits and bounds of drinking were when

that was eleven goblets the man and immediately after making good cheer again he would stretch himself upon fair bench or good large bed and there sleep two or three hours together without thinking or speaking any hurt after he was awakened he would shake his ears little in the mean time they brought him fresh wine then he drank better than ever ponocrates showed him that it was an ill diet to drink so after sleeping it is answered gargantua the very life of the fathers naturally i sleep salt and my sleep hath been to instead of so much ham then began he to study little and the paternosters

were brought in upon the place the fair wooden is to say many pairs of tables and little small banquets intermined with collations and then did he sleep without unbridling until eight in the next morning when ponocrates knew gargantua vicious manner of living he resolved to bring him up in another kind but while he bore with him considering that nature does not endure sudden changes without great violence therefore to begin his work the better he requested learned physician of that time called maître theodorus seriously to perpend if it were possible how to bring gargantua unto better course the said physician purged him canonically with anticyran hellebore by which medicine he cleans ed all the alteration and perverse habitude of his brain by this means also ponocrates made him forget all that he had learned under his ancient preceptors to this better they brought him into the company of learned men who were there in emulation of whom great desire and affection came to him to study otherwise and to improve his parts afterward he put himself into such train of study that he lost not any hour in the day but employed all his time in learning and honest know ledge gargantua

appointed young page born in basché named anagnostes according to the purpose and argument of that lesson he oftentimes gave himself to revere adore pray and send up his supplications to what good god whose word did show his majesty and marvelous judgments then his master repeated what had been read expounding unto him the most obscure and difﬁcult points they then considered the face of the sky if it was such they had observed it the night before and into what signs the sun was entering also the moon that day this done he was appareled combed curled trimmed and perfumed during which time they

recite some sentences that they had retained of the lecture in the mean time master appetite came and then very orderly sat they down at table at the beginning of the meal there was read some pleasant history of ancient prowess until he had taken his wine then if they thought good they continued reading or began to discourse merrily together speaking ﬁrst of the virtue propriety efﬁcacy and nature of all that was served in at that table of bread of wine of water of salt of ﬂesh ﬁsh fruits herbs roots and of their dressing by means whereof he learned in little time all the passages that on these

certain they caused the very books to be brought to the table and so well and perfectly did he in his memory retain the things above said that in that time there was not physician that knew half so much he did afterward they conferred of the lessons read in the morning and ending their repast with some conserve of quince he washed his hands and eyes with fair fresh water and gave thanks unto god

gargantua would have made abbot of seuillé but he refused it he would have given him the abbey of bour gueil or of sanct florent which was better or both if it pleased him but the monk gave him very peremptory answer that he would never take upon him the charge nor government of monks how shall i be able said he to rule over others that have not full power and command of myself if you think i have done you or may hereafter you any acceptable service give leave to found an abbey after my own mind and fancy the motion pleased gargantua very well who thereupon offered him all the country of thelema by the river loire till within two leagues of the great forest of the monk then requested gar gantua to institute his religious order contrary to all others first then said gargantua you must not build wall about your convent all other abbeys are strongly walled and mured about moreover seeing there are certain convents in the world whereof the custom is if any women come mean honorable and honest immediately sweep the ground which they have trod upon therefore was it ordained that if any man or woman entered into religious orders should by chance come within this new abbey all the rooms should be thoroughly washed and cleansed through which they had passed and because in other monasteries all is compassed limited and regulated by hours it was decreed that in this new structure there should be neither clock nor dial but that according to the opportunities and incident occasions all their works should be disposed of said gargantua the greatest loss of time that i know is to count the hours what good comes of it nor can there be any greater folly in the world than one to guide and direct his courses by the sound of bell and not by his own judgment and discretion item

should be admitted women that were not fair and of sweet disposition nor men that were not comely personable and also of sweet disposition item because in the convents of women men come not but underhand privily and by stealth it was therefore enacted that in this house there shall be women in case there be not men nor men in case there be not women item because both men and women that are received into religious orders after the year of their novitiates were constrained and forced perpetually to stay there all the days of their life it was ordered that all of whatever kind men or women admitted within this abbey should have full leave to depart with peace and contentment whensoever it should seem good to them so to item that the religious men and wome n did ordinarily make three wit

in this upright state man possest freedom of will by which if he chose he was able to obtain eternal life it were here unseasonable to introduce the question concerning the secret predestination of god because we are not considering what might or might not happen but what the nature of man truly was adam therefore might have stood if he chose since it was only by his own will that he fell but it was because his will was pliable in either direction and he had not received constancy to persevere that he so easily fell still he had free choice of good and evil and not only so but in the mind and will there was the highest rectitude and all the organic parts were duly framed to obedience until man corrupted its good properties and destroyed himself hence the great darkness of philosophers who have looked complete building in ruin and ﬁt arrangement in disorder the principle they set out with was that man could not be rational animal unless he had free choice of good and evil they also imagined that the distinction between virtue and vice was destroyed if man did not of his own counsel arrange his life so far well had there been change in man this being unknown to them it is not

been so negligent of the culture of their language when ﬁrst they began to develop it it is certain that they could not have become so great in so short time but they in the guise of good agriculturists ﬁrst of all transplanted it from wild locality to cultivated one and then in order that it might bear fruit earlier and better cut away several useless shoots and substituted exotic and domestic ones mostly drawn from the greek language which have grafted so well on to the trunk that they appear longer adopted but natural out of these have sprung from the latin tongue ﬂowers and colored fruits in great number and of much eloquence all of which things not so much from its own nature but artiﬁcially every tongue is wont to produce and if the greeks and romans more diligent in the culture of their tongue than we are in ours found an eloquence in their language only after much labor and industry are we this reason even if our vernacular is not rich it might be to condemn it

the world classics restricted to prose vol vii of x continental europe i by various https questions remain consideration respecting the attributes of god and my own nature or mind i will however on some other occasion perhaps resume the investigation of these meanwhile i have discovered what must be done and what avoided to arrive at the knowledge of truth what i have chieﬂy to is to essay to emer ge from the state of doubt in which i have some time been and to discover whether anything can be known with certainty regarding material objects but before considering whether such objects i conceive exist without i must examine their ideas in so far these are to be found in my consciousness and discover which of them are distinct and which confused in the ﬁrst place i distinctly imagine that quantity which the philosophers commonly call continuous or the extension in length breadth and depth that is in this quantity or rather in the object to which it is attributed further i can enumerate in it many diverse parts and attribute to each of these all sorts of sizes ﬁgures situations and local motions and in ﬁne i can assign to each of these motions all degrees of duration and i not only distinctly know these things when i thus consider them in general but besides by little attention i discover innumerable particulars respecting ﬁgures numbers motion and the like which are so evidently true and so accordant with my nature that when i now discover them i not so much appear to learn anything new to call to remembrance what i before knew or the ﬁrst time to remark what was before in my mind but to which i had not hitherto directed my attention and what i here ﬁnd of most importance is that i discover in my mind innume rable ideas of certain objects which can not be esteemed pure negations altho perhaps they possess reality beyond my thought and which are not framed by tho it may be in my power to think or not to think them but possess true and immutable natures of their own example when i imagine triangle altho there is not perhaps and never was in any place in the universe apart from my thought one such ﬁgure it remains true nevertheless that this ﬁgure possesses certain determinate nature form or essence which is immutable and eternal and not framed by nor in any degree depe ndent on my thought appears from the circumstance that diverse properties of the triangle may be demonstrated that its three angles are equal to two right that its greatest side is subtended by its greatest angle and the like which whether i will or not i now clearly discern to belong to it altho before i did not at all think of them when the ﬁrst time i imagined triangle and which accordingly can not be said to have been invented by nor is it valid objection to allege that perhaps this idea of triangle came into my mind by the medium of the senses through my having seen bodies of triangular ﬁgure i am able to form in thought an innumerable variety of ﬁgures with regard to which it can not be supposed that they were ever objects of sense and i can nevertheless demonstrate diverse properties of their nature less than of the triangle all of which are assuredly true since i clearly conceive them and they are therefore something and not mere negations it is highly evident that all that is true is something truth being identical with existence and i have already fully shown the truth of the principle that whatever is clearly and distinctly known is true and altho this had not been demonstrated yet the nature of my mind is such to compel to assent to what i clearly conceive while i so conceive it and i recollect that even when i still strongly adhered to the objects of sense i reckoned among the number of the most certain truths those i clearly conceive d relating to ﬁgures numbers and other matters that pertain to arithmetic and geometry and in general to the pure mathematics but now if because i can draw from my thought the idea of an object it follows that all i clearly and distinctly apprehend to pertain to this object does in truth belong to it may i not from this derive an argument the existence of god it is certain that i less ﬁnd the idea of god in my consciousness that is the idea of being supremely perfect than that of any ﬁgure or number whatever and i know with not less clear ness and distinctness that an actual and eternal existence pertains to his nature than that all which is demonstrable of any ﬁgure or number really belongs to the nature of that ﬁgure or 108 109 110 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of

pass with truth at least certain i ever judged any truth of mathematics to be altho indeed such doctrine may at ﬁrst sight appear to contain more sophistry than truth i have been accustomed in every other matter to distinguish between existence and essence i easily believe that the existence can be separated from the essence of god and that thus god may be conceived not actually existing but nevertheless when i think of it more attentively it appears that the existence can more be separated from the essence of god than the idea of mountain from that of valley or the equality of its three angles to two right angles from the essence of rectilineal triangle so that it is not less impossible to conceive god that is being supremely perfect to whom existence is wanting or who is devoid of certain perfection than to conceive mountain without valley but tho in truth i can not conceive god unless existing any more than i can mountain without valley yet just it does not follow that there is any mountain in the world merely because i conceive mountain with valley so likewise tho i conceive god existing it does not seem to follow on that account that god exists my thought imposes necessity on things and i may imagine winged horse tho there be none such so i could perhaps attribute existence to god tho god existed but the cases are not analogous and fallacy lurks under the semblance of this objection because i can not conceive mountain without valley it does not follow that there is any mountain or valley in existence but simply that the mountain or valley whether they or not exist are inseparable from each other whereas on the other hand because i can not conceive god unless existing it follows that existence is inseparable from him and therefore that he really exists not that this is brought about by my thought or that it imposes any necessity on things but on the contrary the necessity which lies in the thing itself that is the necessity of the existence of god determines to think in this way it is not in my power to conceive god without existence that is being supremely perfect and yet devoid of an absolute perfection i am free to imagine horse with

virtues disgrace them we are never so happy or so unhappy we suppose our enemies come nearer the truth in the opinions they form of us than we in our opinion of ourselves most people judge men only by success or by fortune love of glory fear of shame greed of fortune the desire to make life agreeable and comfortable and the wish to depreciate others are often causes of that bravery so vaunted among men the fame of great men ought always to be estimated by the means used to acquire it if we never ﬂattered ourselves the ﬂattery of others would not hurt us when great men permit themselves to be

bore us we can not give those whom we bore to praise good actions heartily is in some measure to take part in them there is kind of greatness which does not depend upon fortune it is certain manner that distinguishes us and which seems to destine us great things it is the value we insensibly set upon ourselves it is by this quality that we gain the deference of other men and it is this which commonly raises us more above them than birth rank or even merit itself the cause why the majority of women are so little given to friendship is that it is insipid after having felt love women can not be completely severe unless they hate the praise we give to new comers into the world arises from the envy we bear to those who are established little minds are too much wounded by little things great

his looks constrained ﬁxt and with something wild about them with the change of his looks and with the marks there livid rather than red that i observed in good number and lar ge marks observed by the others also the dauphin was standing in few moments he was apprized that the king had awaked the tears that he had restrained now rolled from his eyes he turned round at the news but said nothing remaining stock still his three attendants proposed to him once or twice that he should go to the king he neither spoke nor stirred i approached and made signs to him to go then softly spoke to the

king passed into the apartment of madame maintenon and the dauphin was left with attendants and his doctors he spent the day in prayers and holy reading on the morrow sunday the uneasiness felt on account of the dauphin augmented he himself did not conceal his belief that he would never rise again and that the plot pondin had warned him of had been executed he explained himself to this effect more than once and always with disdain of earthly grandeur and an incomparable submission and love of god it is impossible to describe the general consternation on monday the 15th the king was bled the dauphin was better than before the king and madame maintenon saw him separately several times during the day which was passed in prayers and reading on tuesday the 16th the dauphin was worse he felt himself devoured by consuming ﬁre which the external fever did not seem to justify but the pulse was very extraordinary and exceedingly menacing this was deceptive day the marks in the dauphin face extended all over the body they were regarded the marks of measles hope arose thereon but the doctors and the most clear of the court could not forget that these same marks had shown themselves

permission to receive the communion early the next morning and without display at the mass performed in his chamber nobody heard of this that evening it was not known until the following morning i was in extreme desolation i scarcely saw the king once day i did nothing but go in quest of news several times day and to the house of chevreuse where i was completely free calm always endeavored to prove to us by his medical reasonings that there was more reason to hope than to fear but he did so with tranquillity that roused my impatience i returned home to pass cruel night on thursday morning the 18th february i learned that the dauphin who had waited midnight with impatience had heard mass immediately after the communion had passed two hours in devout communication with god and that his reason then became embarrassed madame told afterward that he had received extreme unction in ﬁne that he had died at eight these memoirs are not written to describe my private sentiments but in

senate kept watchful eye over the conduct of the generals and did not give them an opportunity of machinating anything to the prejudice of their country but after the legions had passed the alps and crossed the sea the soldiers whom the romans had been obliged to leave during several campaigns in the countries they were subduing lost insensibly that genius and turn of mind which characterized roman citizen and the generals having armies and kingdoms at their disposal were sensible of their own strength and would longer obey the soldiers therefore began to acknowl edge superior but their general to found their hopes on him only and to view the city from great distance they were longer the soldiers of the republic but of sulla of marius of pompey and of cæsar the romans could longer tell whether the person who headed an army in province was their general or their enemy so long the people of rome were corrupted by their tribunes only on whom they could bestow nothing but their power the senate could easily defend themselves because they acted consistently and with one regular tenor whereas the common people were continually shifting from the extremes of fury to the extremes of cowardice but when they were enabled to invest their favorites with formidable exterior authority the whole wisdom of the senate was bafﬂed and the commonwealth was undone the reason why free states are not so permanent other forms of government is because the misfortunes and successes which happen to them generally occasion the loss of liberty whereas the successes and misfortunes of an arbitrary government contribute equally to the enslaving of the people wise republic ought not to run any hazard which may expose it to good or ill fortune the only happiness the several individuals of it should aspire after is to give perpetuity to their state if the unbounded extent of the roman empire proved the ruin of the republic the vast compass of the city was less fatal to it the romans had subdued the whole universe by the assistance of the nations of italy on whom they had bestowed various privil eges at different times most of those nations did not at ﬁrst set any great value on the freedom of the city of rome and some chose rather to preserve their ancient usages but when this privilege became that of universal man who was not roman citizen was considered nothing and with

dissensions were not to be preve nted and those martial spirits which were so ﬁerce and formidable abroad could not be habituated to any considerable moderation at home those who expect in free state to see the people undaunted in war and pusill animous in peace are certainly desirous of impossibilities and it may be advanced general rule that whenever perfect calm is visible in state that calls

and the grandee have other conjunction than what arises from the ability of the one to oppress the other without resistance and if at any time union happens to be introduced citizens are not then united but dead bodies are laid in the grave contiguous to each other it must be acknowledged that the roman laws were too weak to govern the republic but experience has proved it to be an invariable

must therefore acknowledge relations of justice antecedent to the positiv law by which they are established instance that if human societies existed it would be right to conform to their laws if there were intelligent beings that had received beneﬁt of another being they ought to show their gratitude if one intelligent being had created another intelligent being the latter ought to continue in its original state of dependence if one intelligent being injures another it deserves retaliation and so on but the intelligent world is far from being so well governed the physical tho the former has also its laws which of their own nature are invariable it does not conform to them so exactly the physical world this is because on the one hand particular intelligent beings are of ﬁnite nature and consequently liable to error and on the other their nature requires them to be free agents hence they not steadily conform to their primitive laws and even those of their own instituting they frequently infringe whether brutes be governed by the general laws of motion or by particular movement we can not determine be that it may they have not more intimate relation to god than the rest of the material world and sensation is of other use to them than in the relation they have either to other particular beings or to themselves by the allurements of pleasure they preserve the individual and by the same allurements they preserve their species they have natural laws because they are united by sensation positive laws they have none because they are not connected by knowledge and yet they not invariably conform to their natural laws these are better observed by vegetables that have neither understanding nor sense brutes are deprived of the high advantages which we have but they have some which we have not they have not our hopes but they are without our fears they are subject like us to death but without knowing it even most of them are more attentive than we to preservation and not make so bad use of their passions man physical being is like other bodies governed by invariable laws an intelligent being he incessantly transgresses the laws established by god and changes those of his own instituting he is left to his private direction tho limited being and subject like all ﬁnite intelligences to ignorance and error even his imperfect knowledge he loses and sensible creature he is hurried away by thousand impetuous passions such being might every instant forget his creator god has therefore reminded him of his duty by the laws of religion such being is liable

least read i mean his novum scientiarum organum this is the scaffold with which the new philosophy was raised and when the ediﬁce was built part of it at least the scaf fold was longer of service lord bacon was not yet acquainted with nature but then he knew and pointed out the several paths that lead to it he had despised in his younger years the thing called philosophy in the universities and did all that lay in his power to prevent those societies of men instituted to improve human reason from depraving it by their quiddities their horrors of the vacuum their substantial forms and all those

printing or the sea compass and yet these arts were invented by uncultivated savage men what prodigious use the greeks and romans made afterward of mechanics nevertheless they believed that there were crystal heavens that the stars were small lamps which sometimes fell into the sea and one of their greatest philosophers after long researches found that the stars were so many ﬂints which had been detached from the earth in word one before lord bacon was acquainted with experimental philosophy nor with the several physical experiments which have been made since his time scarce one of them but is hinted at in his work and he himself had made several he made kind of pneumatic engine by which he guessed the elasticity of the air he approached on all sides it were to the discovery of its weight and had very near attained it but some time after torricelli seized upon this truth in little time experimental philosophy began to be cultivated on sudden in most parts of europe it was hidden treasure which lord bacon had some notion of and which all the philosophers encouraged by his promises endeavored to dig up but that which surprized most was to read in his work in express terms the new attraction the invention of which is ascribed to sir isaac newton we must search says lord bacon whether there may not be kind of magnetic power which operates between the earth and heavy bodies between the moon and the ocean between the planets etc in another place he says either heavy bodies must be carried toward the center of the earth or must be reciprocally attracted by it and in the latter case it is evident that the nearer bodies in their falling draw toward the earth the stronger they will attract one another we must says he make an experiment to see whether the same clock will go faster on the top of mountain or at the bottom of mine whether the strength of the weights decreases on the mountain and increases in the mine it is probable that the earth has true attractive power this forerunner in philosophy was also an elegant writer historian and wit his moral essays are greatly esteemed but they were drawn up in the view of instructing rather than of pleasing and

education of children and which is seldom regarded in the best families is to make them sensible of their inability weakness and dependence and my husband called it the heavy yoke of that necessity which nature has imposed upon our species and that not only in order to show them how much is done to alleviate the burden of that yoke but especially to instruct them betimes in what rank providence has placed them that they may not presume too far above themselves or be ignorant of the reciprocal duties of humanity young people who from their cradle have been brought up in ease and effemin acy who have been caressed by every one indulged in all their caprices and have been used to obtain easily everything they desired enter upon the world with many impertinent prejudices of which they are generally cured by frequent mortiﬁcations affronts and chagrin now i would willingly spare my children this kind of education by giving them at ﬁrst just notion of things i had indeed once resolved to indulge my eldest son in everything he wanted from persuasio n that the ﬁrst impulses of nature must be good and salutary but i was not long in discovering that children conceiving from such treatment that they have right to be obeyed depart from state of nature almost soon our vices from our example and theirs by our indiscretion i saw that if i indulged him in all his humors they would only increase by such indulgence that it was necessary to stop at some point and that contradiction would be but the more mortifying he should be less accustomed to it but that it might be less painful to him i began to use it upon him by degrees and in order to prevent his tears and lamentations i made every denial irrevocable it is true i contradict him little possible and never without due consideration whatever is given or permitted him is done unconditionally and at the ﬁrst instance and in this we are indulgent enough but he never gets anything by importunity neither his tears nor entreaties being of any effect of this he is now so well convinced that he makes use of them he goes his way on the ﬁrst word and frets himself more at seeing box of sweetmeats taken away from him than at seeing bird ﬂy away which he would be glad to catch there appearing to him the same impossibility of having the one the 172 173 174 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world

displeases him he feels the weight of necessity the ef fect of his own weakness the great cause of the ill humor of children is the care which is taken either to quiet or to aggravate them they will sometimes cry an hour other reason in the world than because they perceive we would not have them so long we take notice of their crying so long have they reason continuing to cry but they will soon give over of themselves when they see notice is taken of them old or young nobody loves to throw away his trouble this is exactly the case with my eldest boy who was once the most peevish little bawler stunning the whole house with his cries whereas now you can hardly hear there is child in the house he cries indeed when he is in pain but then it is the voice of nature which should never be restrained and he is again hushed soon ever the pain is over this reason i pay great attention to his tears i am certain he never sheds them nothing and hence i have gained the advantage of being certain when he is in pain and when not when he is well and when sick an advantage which is lost with those who cry out of mere humor and only in order to be appeased i must confess however that this management is not to be expected from nurses and governesses nothing is more tiresome than to hear child cry and these good women think of nothing but the time present they not foresee that by quieting it day it will cry the more but what is still worse this indulgence produces an obstinacy which is of more consequen ce the child grows up the very cause that makes it squaller at three years of age will make it stubborn and refractory at twelve quarrelsome at twenty imperious and insolent at thirty and insupportable all its life in every indulgence granted to children they can easily see our desire to please them and therefore they should be taught to suppose we have reason refusing or compl ying with their requests this is another advantag gained by making use of authority rather than persuasion on every necessary occasion it is impossible they can be always blind to our motives it is natural them to imagine that we have some reason contradicting them of which they are ignorant on the contrary when we have once submitted to their judgment they will pretend to judge of everything and thus become cunning deceitful fruitful in shifts and chicanery endeavoring to silence those who are weak enough to argue with them when one is obliged to give them an account of things above their comprehension they attribute the most prudent conduct to caprice because they are incapable of understanding it in word the only way to render children docile and capable of reasoning is not to reason with them at all but to convince them that it is above their childish capacities they will always suppose the argument in their favor unless you can give them good cause to think otherwise they know very well that we are unwilling to displease them when they are certain of our affection and children are seldom mistaken in this particular therefore if i deny anything to my children i never reason with them i never tell them why i so and so but i endeavor much possible that they should ﬁnd it out and that even after the affair is over by these means they are accustomed to think that i never deny them anything without sufﬁcient reason tho they can not always see it on the same principle it is that i never suffer my children to join in the conversation of grown people or foolishly imagine themselves on an equality with them because they are permitted to prattle i would have them give short and modest answer when they are spoken to but never to speak of their own head or ask impertinent questions of persons so much older than themselves to whom they ought to show more respect what can child think of himself when he sees circle of sensible people listening to admiring and waiting impatiently his wit and breaking out in raptures at every impertinent expression such false applause is enough to turn the head of grown person judge then what effect it must have upon that of child it is with the prattle of children with the prediction in the almanac it would be

stakes torn off some bark to cover our palace and performed some other public ofﬁces each of us attended to his own affairs i brought my saddle which served well pillow all through my travels the

virtues of conventional life the soul of tho man in his natural state is above that of the man in society it was moonlight feverish with thinking i got up and seated myself at little distance on root which ran along the edge of the streamlet it was one of those american nights which the pencil of man can never represent and the remembrance of which i have hundred times recalled with delight the moon was at the highest point of the heavens here and there at wide clear intervals twinkled thousand stars sometimes the moon rested on group of clouds which looked like the summit of high mountains crowned with snow little by little these clouds grew longer and rolled out into transparent and waving zones of white satin or transformed themselves into light ﬂakes of froth into innumerable wandering ﬂocks in the blue plains of the ﬁrmament another time the arch of heaven seemed changed into shore on which one could discover horizontal rows parallel lines such are made by the regular ebb and ﬂow of the sea gust of wind tore this veil again and everywhere appeared in the sky great banks of dazzlingly white down so soft to the eye that one seemed to feel their softness and elasticity the scene on the earth was not less delightful the silvery and velvety light of the moon ﬂoated silently over the top of the forests and at intervals went down among the trees casting rays of light even through the deepest shadows the narrow brook which ﬂowed at my feet burying itself from time to time among the thickets of and sugar and reappearing little farther off in the glades all sparkling with the constellations of the night seemed like ribbon of azure silk spotted with diamond stars and striped with black bands on the other side of the river in wide natural meadow the moonlight rested quietly on the pastures where it was spread out like sheet some scattered here and there over the savannas sometimes blending according to the caprice of the winds with the background seemed to

wind the rare and interrupted whooping of the gray owl but in the distance at intervals one heard the solemn rolling of the cataract of niagara which in the calm of the night echoed from desert to desert and died away in solitary forests the grandeur the astonishing melancholy of this picture can not be exprest in human language the most beautiful nights in europe can give idea of it in the midst of our cultivated ﬁelds the imagination vainly seeks to expand itself everywhere it meets with the dwellings of man but in these desert countries the soul delights in penetrating and losing itself in these eternal forests it loves to wander by the light of the moon on the borders of immense lakes to hover over the roaring gulf of terrible cataracts to fall with the masses of water and so to speak mix and blend itself with sublime and savage nature these enjoyments are too keen such is our weakness that exquisite pleasures become griefs if nature feared that we should forget that we are men absorbed in my existence or rather drawn quite out of myself having neither feeling nor distinct thought but an indescribable i know not what which was like that happiness which they say we

person in france who spoke of shakespeare genius 50 and altho he spoke of him merely barbarian genius the french public were of opinion that voltaire had said too much in his favor indeed they thought it nothing less than profanation to apply the words genius and glory to dramas which they considered crude they were coarse at the present day all controversy regarding shakespeare genius and glory has come to an end one ventures any longer to dispute them but greater question has namely whether shakespeare dramatic system is not far superior to that of voltaire this question i not presume to decide i merely say that it is now open discussion 188 48 189 190 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics restricted to prose vol vii of x continental europe i by various https have been led to it by the onward progress of ideas i shall endeavor to point out the causes which have brought it about but at present i insist merely upon the fact itself and deduce from it one simple consequence that literary criticism has changed its ground and can longer remain restricted to the limits within which it was formerly conﬁned literature does not escape from the revolutions of the human mind it is compelled to follow it in its course to transport itself beneath the horizon under which it is conveyed to gain elevation and extension with the ideas which occupy its notice and to consider the questions which it discusses under the new aspects and novel circumstances in which they are placed by the new state of thought and of society when we embrace human destiny in all its aspects and human nature in all the conditions of man upon earth we enter into possession of an exhaustless treasure it is the peculiar advantage of such system that it escapes by its extent from the dominion of any particular genius we may discover its principles in shakespeare works but he was not fully acquainted with them nor did he always respect them he should serve an example not model some men even of superior talent have attempted to write plays according to shakespeare taste without perceiving that they were deﬁcient in one important qualiﬁcation the task and that was to write he did to write them our age just shakespeare plays were written the age in which he lived this is an enterprise the difﬁculties of which have hitherto perhaps been maturely considered by one we have seen how much art and effort were employed by shakespeare to surmo unt those which are inherent in his system they are still greater in our times and would unveil themselves much more completely to the spirit of criticism which now accompanies the boldest essays of genius it is not only with spectators of more fastidious taste and of more idle and inattentive imagination that the poet would have to who should venture to follow in shakespeare footsteps he would be called upon to give movement to personages embarrassed in much more complicated interests preoccupied with much more various feelings and subject to less simple habits of mind and to less decided tendencies neither science nor reﬂection nor the scruples of conscience nor the uncertainties of thought frequently encumber shakespeare heroes doubt is of little use among them and the violence of their passions speedily transfers their belief to the side of the desires or sets their actions above their belief hamlet alone presents the confused spectacle of mind formed by the enlightenment of society in conﬂict with position contrary to its laws and he needs supernatural apparition to determine him to act and fortuitous event to accomplish his project if incessantly placed in an analogous position the personages of tragedy conceived at the present day according to the romantic system would offer us the same picture of indecision ideas now crowd and intersect each other in the mind of man duties multiply in his conscience and obstacles and bonds around his life instead of those electric brains prompt to communicate the spark which they have received instead of those ardent and men whose projects like macbeth will to hand world now presents to the poet minds like hamlet deep in the observation of those inward conﬂicts which our classical system has derived from state of society more advanced than that of the time in which shakespeare lived so many feelings interests and ideas the necessary consequences of modern civilizati on might become even in their simplest form of expression troublesome burden which it would be difﬁcult to carry through the rapid evolutions and bold advances of the romantic system we must however satisfy every demand success itself requires it the reason must be contented at the same time that the imagination is occupied the progress of taste of enlightenment of society and of mankind must serve not to diminish or disturb our enjoyment but to render them worthy of ourselves and capable of supplying the new wants which we have contracted adva nce without rule and art in the romantic system and you will produce melodramas calculated to excite passing emotion in the multitude but in the multitude alone and few days just by dragging along without originality in the classical system you will satisfy only that cold literary class who are 191 192 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics restricted to prose vol vii of x continental europe i by

destined glory he acts upon grander scale and can address the superior intellects well the general and simple faculties of all men it is doubtless necessary that the crowd should throng to behold those dramatic works of which you desire to make national spectacle but not hope to become national if you not unite in your festivities all those classes of persons and minds whose arranged hierarchy raises nation to its loftiest dignity genius is bound to follow human nature in all its developments its strength consists in ﬁnding within itself the means constantly satisfying the whole of the public the same task is now imposed upon government and upon poetry both shou ld exist all and sufﬁce at once the wants of the masses and the requirements of the most exalted minds doubtless stopt in its course by these conditions the full severity of which will only be revealed to the talent that can comply with them dramatic art even in england where under the protection of shakespeare it would have liberty to attempt anything scarcely ventures at the present day even to try timidly to follow him meanwhile england france and the whole of europe demand of the drama pleasures and emotions that can longer be supplied by the inanimate representation of world that has ceased to exist the classical system had its origin in the life of its time that time has passed its image subsists in brilliant colors in its works but can more be reproduced near the monuments of past ages the monuments of another age are now beginning to arise what will be their form i can not tell but the ground upon which their foundations may rest is already perceptible this ground is not the ground of cornei lle and racine nor is it that of shakespeare it is our own but shakespeare system it appears to may furnish the plans according to which genius ought now to work this system alone includes all those social conditions and all those general or diverse feelings the simultaneous conjunction and activity of which constitute us at the present day the spectacle of human things witnesses during thirty years of the greatest revolutions of society we shall longer willingly conﬁne the movement of our mind within the narrow space of some family event or the agitations of purely individual passion the nature and destiny of man have appeared to us under their most striking and their simplest aspect in all

the blood of machiavelli and the earthquake genius of the italian republics were characteristics of all the individuals of this race the proportions of their souls exceed the height of their destiny vices passions virtues are all in excess the women are all angelic or perverse the men sublime or depraved and their language even is emphatic and lofty their aspirations there is in their most

perceive the great men descending to triﬂing matters mirabeau inspired this domestic majesty and virility in his very cradle i dwell on these details which may seem foreign to this history but they explain it the source of genius is often in ancestry and the blood of descent is sometimes the prophecy of destiny mirabeau education was rough and rude the hand of his father who was styled the friend of man but whose restless spirit and selﬁsh vanity rendered him the persecutor of his wife and the tyrant of all his family the only virtue he was taught was honor by that name in those days they digniﬁed that ceremonious demeanor which was too frequently only the show of probity and the elegance of vice entering the army at an early age he acquired nothing of military habits except love of licentiousness and play the hand of his father was constantly extended not to aid him in rising but to depress him still lower under the consequences of his errors his youth was passed in the

one in convent and the other in the dungeon of vincennes love which like ﬁre in the veins of the earth is always detected in some crevice of man destiny lighted up in single and ardent blaze all the

entering his cell an obscure man he quitted it writer orator statesman but anything even ready to sell himself in order to buy fortune and celebrity the drama of life had been conceived in his head he wanted only the stage and that was being prepared him by time during the few short years which elapsed between his leaving the keep of vincennes and the tribune of the national assembly he employed

having two bridges the one on the north the other on the south the two which were at once its gates and its grand chatelet on the right bank and the petit chatelet on the left in process of time under

carved themselves gardens out of the ﬁelds so early 1367 the suburbs of the city had spread so far to need fresh enclosure especially on the right bank this was built it by charles but place like

century it was overtaken passed and the suburbs kept traveling onward in the sixteenth it seemed very visibly receding more and more into the ancient city so rapidly did the new town thicken on the other side of it thus so far back the ﬁfteenth centu ry to come down further paris had already worn out the three concentric circles of walls which from the time of julian the apostate lay in embryo if i may be allowed the expression in the grand and petit chatelets the mighty city had successively burst its four mural belts like growing boy bursting the garments made him year ago under louis xi there were still to be seen ruined towers of the ancient enclosures rising at intervals above the sea of houses like the tops of hills from amid an inundation like the archipelagos of old paris submer ged beneath the new each of these great divisions of paris was we have observed city but city too special to be complete city which could not without the two others thus they had three totally different aspects the city properly so called abounded in churches the ville contained the palaces and the university the colleges setting aside secondary jurisdictions we may assume generally that the island was under the bishop the right bank under the provost of the merchants the left under the rector of the university and the whole under the provost of paris royal and not municipal ofﬁcer the city had the cathedral of notre dame the ville the louvre and the hotel ville and the university the sorbonne the ville contained the halles the city the hotel dieu and the university the pré aux

ﬁnding the university strong and the king weak chose to interfere it was privilege of the scholars to be hung in their own quarter most of these privileges be it remarked by the way and some of them were more valuable than that just mentioned had been extorted from different sovereign s by riots and insurrections this is the invariable king never grants any boon but what is wrung from him by the people in the ﬁfteenth century that part of the seine comprehended within the enclosure of paris contained ﬁve islands the ile louviers then covered with trees and now with timber the ile aux vaches and the ile notre dame both uninhabited and belonging to the bishop in the seventeenth century these two islands were converted into one which has been built 236 237 238 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics restricted to prose vol vii of x continental europe i by various https and is now called the isle of louis lastly the city and at its point the islet of the passeur aux vaches since buried under the platform of the pont neuf the city had at that time ﬁve bridges three on the bridge of notre dame and the pont au change of stone and the pont aux meuniers of wood two on the petit pont of stone and the pont michel of wood all of them covered with houses the university had six gates built by philip augustus these were setting out from the tournelle the gate of victor the gate of bordelle the papal gate and the gates of jacques michel and germain the ville had six gates built by charles v that is to say beginning from the tower of billy the gates of antoine the temple martin denis montmartre and honoré all these gates were strong and handsom too circumstance which does not detract from strength wide deep ditch suppli ed by the seine with water which was swollen by the ﬂoods of winter to running stream encircled the foot of the wall all round paris at night the gates were closed the river was barred at the two extremities of the city by stout iron chains and paris slept in quiet view of these three towns the city the university and the ville exhibited to the eye an inextricable knot of streets strangely jumbled together it was apparent however at ﬁrst sight that these three fragments of city formed but single body the spectator perceived immediately two long parallel streets without break or interruption crossing the three cities nearly in right line from one end to the other from south to north perpendicularly to the seine incessantly pouring the people of the one into the other connecting blending them together and converting the three into one the ﬁrst of these streets ran from the gate of jacques to the gate of martin it was called in the university the street of jacques in the city rue la juiverie and in the ville the street of martin it crossed the river twice by the name of petit pont and pont notre dame the second named rue la harpe on the left bank rue la barillerie in the island rue denis on the right bank pont michel over one arm of the seine and pont au change over the other gate of martin it was called in the university to the gate of denis in the ville still tho they bore so many different names they formed in reality only two streets but the two mother the two great arteries of paris all the other veins of the triple city were fed by or dischar ged themselves into these what then was the aspect of this whole viewed from the summit of the towers of notre dame in 1482 that is what we shall now attempt to describe the spectator on arriving breathless at that elevation was dazzled by the chaos of roofs chimneys streets bridges belfries towers and steeples all burst at once upon the carved gable the sharp roof the turret perched upon the angles of the walls the stone pyramids of the eleventh century the slated obelisk of the ﬁfteenth the round and naked keep of the castle the square and embroidered tower of the church the great and the small the massive and the light the eye was long bewildered amid this labyrinth of heights and depths in which there was nothing but had its originality its reason its genius its beauty nothing but issued from the hand of art from the humblest

four steps at time without looking where he was going when suddenly he was brought up short by knocking violently against the shou lder of musketeer who was leaving the apartments of treville the young man staggered backward from the shock uttering cry or rather yell excuse said trying to pass him but i am in great hurry he had hardly placed his foot on the next step when he was stopt by the grasp of an iron wrist on his sash you are in great hurry cried the musketeer whose face was the color of shroud and you think that is enough apology nearly knocking down not so fast my young man i suppose you imagine that because you heard treville speaking to us rather brusquely that everybody may treat us in the same way but you are mistaken and it is well you should learn that you are not treville upon my honor replied recognizing athos who was returning to his room after having his wound drest upon my honor it was an accident and therefore i begged your pardon i should have thought that was all that was necessary i repeat that i am in very great hurry and i should be much obliged if you would let go my way monsieur said athos loosening his hold you are sadly lacking in courtesy and one sees that you must have had rustic upbringing was by this time down another ﬂight but on hearing athos remark he stopt short my faith monsieur exclaimed he however rustic i may be i shall not come to you to teach manners i am not so sure of that replied athos oh if i was only not in such haste cried if only i was not pursuing monsieur you will ﬁnd without running after you understand and

but he had not reckoned on the gale that was blowing he passed sudden gust wrapt porthos mantle tight round him and tho the owner of the garment could easily have freed him had he so chosen reasons of his own he preferred to draw the folds still closer hearing the volley of oaths let fall by the musketeers feared he might have damaged the splendor of the belt and struggled to unwind himself but when he at length freed his head he found that like most things in this world the belt had two sides and while the front bristled with gold the back was mere leather which explains why porthos always had cold and could not part from his mantle confound you cried porthos struggling in his turn have you gone mad that you tumble over people like this excuse answered but i am in great hurry i am pursuing some one and i suppose that on such occasions you leave your eyes behind you asked porthos replied rather nettled and thanks to my eyes i often see things that other people possibly porthos might have understood this allusion but in any case he did not attempt to control his anger and said sharply monsieur we shall have to give you lesson if you take to tumbling against the musketeers like this lesson monsieur replied that is rather severe expression it is the expression of man who is always accustomed to look his enemies in the face oh if that is all there is fear of your turning your back on anybody and enchanted at his own wit the young man walked away in ﬁts of laughter porthos foamed with rage and rushed after by and by by and by cried the latter when you have not got your mantle on at one then behind the luxembour all right at one replied he vanished around the corner moreover he had gotten himself into two ﬁerce duels with two men each able to kill three in word with two he set so high that he placed them above all other men it was sad lookout to be sure the youth was certain to be killed by athos he was not much disturbed about porthos hope is the last thing to die in man heart however he ended by hoping that he might come out alive from both duels even if dreadfully injured and on that supposition he scored himself in this way his conduct what dunce i am thai brave and unfortunate athos was wounded right on that shoulder i ran against head foremost like ram the only thing that surprizes is that he did strike dead on the spot he had provocation enough i must have hurt him savagely to to funny af fair and the youth began to laugh aloud in spite of himself looking round carefully however to see if his laughing alone in public without apparent cause

profound bow accompanied by most gracious smile aramis bowed slightly but did not smile moreover all four immediately broke of f their conversation was not so dull not to see he was not wanted but he was not yet used enough to social customs to know how to extricate himself dextrously from his false position which his generally is who accosts people he is little acquainted with and mingles in conversation which does not concern him he was mentally casting about the least awkward manner of retreat when he noticed that aramis had let his handkerchief fall and doubtless by mistake put his foot on it this seemed favorable chance to repair his mistake of intrusion he stooped down and with the most gracious air he could assume drew the handkerchie f from under the foot in spite of the efforts made to detain it and holding it out to aramis said i believe sir this is handkerchief you would be sorry to lose the handkerchief was in truth richly embroidered and had cornet and coat of arms at one corner aramis blushed excessively and snatched rather than took the handkerchief ha ha exclaimed one of the guards will you go on saying now most discreet aramis that you are not on good terms with madame racy when that gracious lady does you the favor of lending you her handkerchief aramis darted at one of those looks which tell man that he has made mortal enemy then assuming his mild air he said you are mistaken gentlemen this handkerchief is not mine and i can not understand why this gentleman has taken it into his head to offer it to rather than to one of you and proof of what i say here is mine in my pocket so saying he pulled out his handkerchief which was also not only very dainty one and of ﬁne linen tho linen was then costly but was embroidered and without arms bearing only single cipher the owner this time saw his mistake but aramis friends were by means convinced and one of them addressing the young musketeer with pretended gravity said if things were you make out i should feel obliged my dear aramis to reclaim it myself you very well know is an intimate friend of mine and i can not allow one of his wife belongings to be exhibited trophy you make the demand clumsily replied aramis and while i acknowledge the justice of your reclamation i refuse it on account of the form the fact is put in hesitatingly i did not actually see the handkerchief fall from aramis pocket he had his foot on it that all and i thought it was his and you were deceived my dear sir replied aramis coldly very little obliged the explanation then turning to the guard who had profest himself racy friend besides he went on i have reﬂected my dear intimate friend of racy that i am not less devotedly his friend than you can possibly be so that this handkerchief is quite likely to have fallen from your pocket from mine on my honor you are about to swear on your hono r and i on my word and then it will be pretty evident that one of us will have lied now here montaran

the other two guardsmen the judgment of solomon aramis you are certainly full of wisdom they burst into loud laugh and may be supposed the incident bore other fruit in minute or two the conversation stopt and the three guards and the muske teer after heartily shaking hands separated the guards going one way and aramis another now is the time to make my peace with this gentleman said to himself having stood on one side during all the latter part of the conversation and in this good spirit drawing near to aramis who was going off without paying any attention to him he said you will excuse i hope ah interrupted aramis permit to observe to you sir that you have not acted in this af fair man of good breeding ought what cried you i suppose that you are not fool and that you knew very well even tho you come from gascony that people not stand on handkerchiefs nothing what the devil paris is not paved with linen sir you wrong in trying to humil iate said in whom his native pugnacity began to speak louder than his peaceful resolutions i come from gascony it is true and since you know it there is need to tell you that gascons are not very patient so that when they have asked pardon once even folly they think they have done at least much again they ought to have done sir what i say to you about this matter said aramis is not the sake of hunting quarrel thank heaven i am not buckler and being musketeer only while i only ﬁght when i am forced to so and always with great reluctance but this time the af fair is serious here is lady compromised by you by us you mean cried why did you give back the handkerchief so awkwardly why did you let it fall so awkwardly i have said that the handkerchief did not fall from my pocket well by saying that you have told two lies sir i saw it fall oh ho you take it up that way you master gascon well i will teach you how to behave yourself and i will send you back to your pulpit master priest draw if you please and instantly prudence is virtue useless enough to musketeers i know but indispensable to churchmen and i am only temporary musketeer i hold it best to be prudent at two i shall have the honor of expecting you at treville there i
