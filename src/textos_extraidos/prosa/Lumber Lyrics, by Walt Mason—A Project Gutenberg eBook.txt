it he is read by more people than any other living writer his prose rhymes are published in 200 daily newspapers with an aggregate circulation of about 12 millions walt says his only claim on the nation s gratitude is that he does not go about the country readin g from his indeed he doesn t have to his writings are read with avidity by hosts of people walt mason lives in emporia kansas most of the time but spends his summers in park colorado he does nothing but write prose rhymes and at this job he is one of the hardest working men living he is probably the only poet who makes his living solely by the sweat of his brow many people have wondered what walt mason gets his contributions to curtis service this is rather personal question but it is sufﬁcient to say that he gets enough money from work of this kind so that his monthly income has totalled high at any rate this was the ﬁgure he gave out in an interview in kansas city paper in 1914 and like everything else prose rhymes weren t high then they are now mason himself explains he was never lumber dealer though he has tried to sell everything from hardware to hogs how then can he write lumber lyrics that hit such responsive chord in every lumber dealer s mind the lord knows he was born that way his prose rhymes get under your hide and under every other lumber dealer s hide because walt mason has an interest in you and your fellow human beings walt mason was born in columbus ontario may 4th he was the ﬁfth of six sons of poor parents when walt was four years old his father was accidentally killed after his mother died when he was ﬁfteen he went to port hope ontario and worked in hardware store week boarding himself he soon forsook the hardware business in 1880 and crossed lake ontario into new york state where he hoed beans until he decided that there wasn t any sense in hoeing beans arm in arm with the star of empire he took his course westward stopping in ohio and in illinois and then in louis there he wrote some stuff humorous weekly called the hornet which obtained him position at per week doing everything from writing gems of thought to sweeping the ﬂoors when the hornet went broke mason continued westward and worked three years hired man in kansas he became disgusted with the work and managed to get position with the leavenworth times from there he ﬂoated to the atchison globe and was off and on connected with newspapers in dozen cities at last william allen white publisher of the emporia gazette offered him position the gazette always printed on its ﬁrst page an item of local interest with border around it called star one day the city editor was shy the necessary item and asked walt to write something to ﬁll the space he wrote little prose rhym asking people to go to church next day which was sunday the rhyme attracted attention and on monday he wrote another one and little later on walt and the star head became feature of the gazette this was the origin of the prose poem and that was when walt mason came to the age of the rhymes of walt mason have had marked inﬂuence on american literature their unusual character have made the highbrows wonder how to class them his rhymes seem to be neither prose nor poetry though it must be remembered that the poems of the classics were written in lineless form and therefore that mason s stuff can t be condemned simply because it isn t printed like verse pg 6 pg 7 lumber lyrics by walt project gutenberg ebook https used to write great many house organs but today curtis s ervice which he has been writing since the third issue of the publication in september 1913 is one of the few on his list walt mason believes that poets are born and not made at any rate he says that they must have an ear rhyme the manner in which he sends in his contributions to curtis service shows that he doesn t chew up many pencils paring down his rhymes and changing them about so that their feet will toe the mark though he is poet he has but one eccentricity he is fat he tried out large number of eccentricities because he knew all poets had to have some but ﬁnally decided upon being fat the one with fewest drawbacks and the least inconvenient who s who says he married ella foss of wooster ohio in 1893 and that he is republican in politics and unitarian in religion his twelve million readers all acclaim him regular guy lumber lyrics by walt project gutenberg ebook https l yrics the prose poems appearing in this little book have been written by the curtis companies during the past few years and judging from the many letters i have received from lumber dealers all over the country they took kindly to the little effusions and often these correspondents have asked where and when i had experience in the lumber business i have had experience in that line except customer at the lumber yards i have bought lot of boards and such things in my time and when i was buying them or waiting my change i looked around anybody who looks around and who doesn t wear blinders observes many things in the course of lifetime i have always been interested in the things around and close to i have an insatiable curiosity i want to know all the facts about anything i am interested in when i go to lumber yard to buy the materials cupboard or cofﬁn i ask million questions i want to know where the boards grew and who harvested them and how they were prepared the consumer and all about them and rule lumber men know their own trade and can give any reaso nable amount of information i have been asking questions all my days and having good memory very few facts get away from and so i am prepared to write rhyme about anything at an hour s notice if i am to write about steam engine or whale or the north pole i usually it without consulting any books at various times i have questioned people about steam engines and whales and north poles and the things they told are on ﬁle in my memory so with these poems they have been suggested by things i have heard lumber men say perhaps day before yesterday perhaps twenty years ago there are many people who will tell you i am not poet and i am not going to quarrel with them about it the true poet in the estimation of the highbrows is one who can so befuddle subject with words that an ordinary citizen can t tell what he is driving at i have never had an ambition to be that kind of poet really i can be cryptic any of them and can write things that would give you sick headache trying to understand them but few people enjoy sick headaches i have never been interested in greek gods or lethean rivers or things remote either in time or distance most of my life i have been associated with people who worked hard living and i have done all kinds of manual labor myself it is with such people and such varieties of labor that my verses deal the lumber yard on the corner is of more enduring interest to than the field of the cloth of gold on which sundry kings played to the gallery long ago every time the lumberman sells wagonload of his goods he is contributing to the general welfare well to his own and this fact seems more important to than any story treating of the doings of ulysses or any other fabled gent so i write of lumber and let the gods slide pg 8 pg 9 lumber lyrics by walt project gutenberg ebook https most every tree is made of wood the best ones are remote from cities and in their cheerful neighborhood the birds keep singing ragtime ditties beneath their limbs the children play and swing within their leafy border upon the long bright summer day when picnic parties are in order and now and then the poets come to eulogize the forest spirit and you can hear their thought works hum like auto wheels or pretty near it and it may chance upon day that farmers from adjacent ranches will bring rope along this way and hang an agent from the branches now comes the woodman with his ax and he selects some forest beauty then through its noble trunk he is to him thing of duty he has to feed his eighteen kids he has to clothe his wife and auntie he has to buy them pies and lids and put new paint upon his shanty and thus the forest giant falls there s none to shield it or deliver now other men in overalls will ﬂoat it down some rushing river and then through loud and busy mills the good old tree in fragment s dashes and makes its bow doors and sills scantling joists and window sashes it s strange to labor at desk and think that it all carved and oaken one time was standing picturesque amid solitude unbroken once in the forest dark and dim these pigeonholes and doodads rested this drawer was once swaying limb on which the robin sang and nested i sit upon my swivel chair and meditate upon its hist ry these rungs and legs once waved in air in all the strange primeval myst ry this stool on which i milk my cow this club with which i swat the heifers though they are quite prosaic now once rustled in the morning zephyrs once they had leaves and in the dawn they sang the song of wonder and in the dusk when day was gone they saw the smiling lovers under this maple slat with which i soak my willie when he gets too funny and on his daddy plays joke came from some woodland sweet and sunny and thus in every lumber yard there s food pleasant meditation plank inspires the modern bard and tunes him up to beat creation pg 11 lumber lyrics by walt project gutenberg ebook https coming winter winds were round us snorting weary while now that spring s this way cavorting we should wear smile tempests storms and kindred friskers lashed us with whip froze our noses and our whiskers gave us all the grip nights were cold and days were freezing cheerless was the sky we were coughing whooping sneezing till we wished to die now the winter s quit its prancing it s an also ran and the gentle spring advancing should encourage man when the north winds blood congealers ripped along the earth tisn t strange if lumber dealers strangers were to mirth there was rush or clamor in the building trade and the rusty saw and hammer on the shelf were laid but since balmy spring is coming and old winter s canned sounds of building will be humming over all the land when the skies are blue and sunny and the birdlets sing people will be spending money they each spring they ll be building gorgeous houses all along the pike shelter their steeds and cowses fences and the like so let glee and mellow laughter ﬁll your lumber store you hand out joist and rafter scantling sash and door pg 12 lumber lyrics by walt project gutenberg ebook https is power when i go into someone s store to buy nickel s worth or more some questions i may spring i have an inquiring mind all kinds of facts i like to ﬁnd and place them on string i ask the grocer if his tea was grown beside the zuyder zee or down along the po and i m disgusted when he sighs and claws his whiskers and replies i really not know i hold that every business man should follow up the good old plan and know his stock in trade the wise old grocer always knew just where his shredded codﬁsh grew and where his prunes were made the wise old clothier knows that wool is never gathered from bull and tells his patrons so that merchant wearies by his acts who answers when you ask facts i m sure i not know we have lumber man named chee i asked him on

i m always glad to tell the history of things i sell regardless of expense the shingle trees i hear him say are only found at hudson s bay and they have stately shapes the shingles which are long and slim profus ely grow on every limb in bunches much like grapes the natives harvest them in march when they are ﬁrm and stiff with starch and dry them in the sun then they remove the outer has gentle smell of thrash them every one then they re sandpapered piece by piece and boiled six weeks in walrus grease and smoked like any ham and if there s any more you d know about the way the shingles grow just ask here i i ve admiration and respect one whose knowledge is correct so i am strong dumm matter what you ask that guy he always has prompt he makes business hum men should be ready with spiel about the goods in which they deal excuses won t sufﬁce our estimate is always low of men who never seem to know thing except the price pg 13 lumber lyrics by walt project gutenberg ebook https

drive home again their heavy wagons loaded down with boards and joists why then it is sign that things are well the goose is hanging high and you may safely dance and yell better times are nigh all farmers who are safe and sane like handsome cribs and barns and old shacks that let in rain they not give three darns but when the hogs are dying off of cholera or mumps the farmer with afﬂiction ﬁlled looks on the old shacks near and says i can t afford to build until some other year but when the hogs are feeling gay and everything serene and all the oats and corn and hay present healthy green he hitches up old kate and dick and journeys off to town and then comes homeward pretty quick with lumber loaded down and when i see the wagons drill along the country road each one loud and shrill beneath its lumber load i know the country s on the boom and things will hum once more and any man who talks of gloom is just misﬁt bore some people read the wall street news to see which way we head and some keep tab on henry clews to see if we are dead some follow up what congress does and think therein they ll ﬁnd the signs that business will buzz or maybe fall behind and some are making frequent notes upon the tariff law to see if it will get our goats and dislocate our jaw but when i want to know the truth about our future fate i pass up all such things forsooth and sit on my front gate and watch the farmers going by upon their way from town and if with lumber piled up high their carts are loaded down i know prosperity s on top good times are here you bet and i go forth and whip cop and chase suffragette oh when the farmers spend their hoards lumber we enthuse the granger s wagonload of boards tells more than henry clews pg 15 lumber lyrics by walt project gutenberg ebook https tising tell not in mournful numbers with the air of critics wise that the retail lumber dealer s not the one to advertise let the shoe and grindstone dealers ﬁll the papers with their ads let the pharmacists be spielers their pills and liver pads let the dry goods merchant merry sing in print his cheerful tunes let the boatman boom his wherry let the grocer boost his prunes but when men are buying shingles they will seek you in your lair and will need prose or jingles to induce their going thus i heard the mossback speaking he sadly wagged his ears and his jaws and lungs were squeaking with the rust of many years but i knew his talk was twaddle that would fool modern guys it s true that all men waddle to the stores that advertise why should men who deal in lumber make bid larger trade why should they sit round and slumber slumber sweetly in the shade if an ad will bring new patrons to the gas works or the bank if it sells new gowns to matrons why won t it sell plank if an ad will bring new buyers to the corner ginseng store to the man who deals in plyers why won t it sell door in our town there is dealer selling lumber all the year and he is the boss appealer to the public s grateful ear every day his little sermon in the paper shows its face when on building folks determine they go chasing to his place keep your name before the public keep your business house in view and when men would build steeple they will surely think of you advertising pays you bet you they who say are absurd never let your town forget your name household lumber lyrics by walt project

that there s streak of yellow in any gloomy lad who spends his time complaining against the breeching straining and says that trade is bad my trade is what i make it and i could blamed soon break it if i had doleful dumps but when i ﬁnd things dragging i set my brains and some fancy humps today i heard john abel intends to build stable about eight miles from town there was nothing doing and excitement brewing to hold this village down i thought i d go and meet him and to some language treat him and sell little bill and right there i enrolled him customer and sold him the and the sill keep busy is my motto i have small tin auto that scoots along with vim and when i hear some granger intends to build manger i burn the road to him the peop le see scooting they see mile after breezy mile they say he is so busy he fairly makes us kind like his and when they want some and want the best of good work which is the curtis joists or lath or siding to they come s business ye mind you never see him slouching you never see him grouching or talking of despair he always keeps things humming he s always up his hind feet in the air pg 16 lumber lyrics by walt project gutenberg ebook https some merchants are so dumb you wonder how they ever come to sell the stuff they have in store and keep the sherif f from the door old binkson is lot that way he seldom has word to say i ask him pound of lime he wraps it up and all the time he wears tragic air of doom and sheds an atmosphere of gloom he never chats he never spiels nor jumps up high and cracks his heels he isn t grouchy or unstrung he never learned to wag his tongue oh silence is golden thing when tisn t worked too hard by jing but none of us will stand up strong men who gabble all day long and elocute thousand miles in seven varied styles the dealer who is prone to talk until you hear him round block is worse than t other kind of bird who s never known to spring word but if you ve scantling you would sell you ought to boost it wisely well and if gent should buy plank to build himself dipping tank you might suggest ere home he speeds that you have other things he needs i called on lumber dealer gaff to buy shingle and half he put my purchase in sack and wrapped string around and back and he toiled in manner gay he talked to pass the time away the farmers now in busy troops are building stately chicken coops the winter soon will hit the road and hens must have warm abode or they won t lay their luscious eggs but stand around on frozen and that recalled the fact to that i had hens some and ere i left that lumber store i bought wagon load or more of stuff to build chicken shed it s standing now all painted red and that s the way big sales are made and that is how men build up trade talk corn cribs at the proper time or prove silo is sublime but in an incidental strain and not though you gladly sprain your conscienc i hope is eagerness to get the kale suggestion is noble art the wise man gets it down by heart pg 17 lumber lyrics by walt project gutenberg ebook https pioneers our fathers in the bygone years were bold and hardy pioneers they cleared the country of their foes and made it blossom the rose on prairies vast by lonely lakes they scrapped with injuns and with snakes and whipped the large fat grizzly bear and chased the groundhog to its lair when ﬁrst they cleared their patch of ground the pioneers felt they were bound to build thereon some sort of shacks so they got busy with the ax how dire and gloomy was their plight there was lumber yard in sight they could not take bunch of cash and buy their windows doors and sash they could not seek the haunts of trade and buy house already made the modern man who plans to build house with children to be ﬁlled can to the lumber palace go and spend little roll of dough and get his boards all planed and grooved so slick they couldn t be improved and in very little while he builds house that s quite in style but it was different my dears with those old hardy pioneers they humped themselves like busy bees and with their axes chopped down trees and of the branches made them bare and chopped and chopped and made them square and they toiled around the boles the injuns shot them full of holes how would you like to build shack and have an arrow in your back but still they toiled on tireless shanks and fashioned doors of planks and made their windows high and broad all out of plumb and wapperjawed oh did they sing or did they swear when interrupted by bear which sized them up juicy food and chased them through the lonely wood oh did they laugh or did they wail when wildcats got upon their trail once an hour their labors ceased they had to scrap with man or beast it s hard to work neath such strain it frets the heart and jars the brain just ponder er those early shacks all built with rusty saw and ax they once were viewed with lofty pride in them our fathers lived and died how would you like it if you had to

ebook https the time this is the burden of my rhyme be nice and pleasant all the time some men are only sweet and nice when they desire to get the price the lumber men at bungtown hear that i intend some time this year to build handsome gothic shed all up to date and painted red at ordinary times these gents don t smile at worth twenty cents they pass by and not say how is your liver or good day but since they ve heard that i expect to build shed that s all correct modern shed with wooden doors and handsome knotholes in the ﬂoors they re so polite and smooth and sweet they give fantods in my feet they not win with their grins such work is coarse and seldom wins if men would sell their laths and lime they should be pleasant all the time and not like some cheap candidate just when they think twill pay the freight i ll buy the lumber my shed when i have got the coin ahead from dealers who are pleasant lads en when they are not after scads there are such dealers in our town and sane man would turn them down i meet them nearly every day and talk with them of hogs and hay and bats and cats and curleycues and ships and synagogues and shoes they not seem to care red who sells the lumber my shed they re always pleasant and polite they hand smiles and treat right so when i wish to buy plank i take some pennies from the bank and cheerfully i blow the price with men who can t help being nice and when the bungtown fellows know what i have done they ll droop in woe they ll look on with moody scorn and wish i never had been born their souls can t reach the heights sublime they can t be pleasant all the time pg 24 lumber lyrics by walt project gutenberg ebook https scarce oft i hear discordant slogans hear the loud and sad lament men are wearing out their brogans hunting houses

the catawampus brow ses and the dingbat s song is sweet every time they d build dwelling crowds would come and still increase crying clamo ring and yelling begging lease there s better proposition than this thing of building homes and the fact should ﬁnd position in the plutocratic domes and the man with modest bundle should be renting nevermore he should take his wad and trundle to the lumber dealer s store there should be boom in building such we have never seen palaces with ornate gilding modest homes all painted lumber lyrics by walt project gutenberg ebook https the eskimo has ﬂoors of ice and probably he thinks them nice and strictly up to date but if there ever came thaw they d be the worst you ever saw and that s sure fate the arab has his ﬂoor of sand i have doubt he thinks it grand ﬂoor beyond compare but sand is full of bugs and ants and they climb up fellow s pants when he sits in chair the mexican has ﬂoors of dirt and ﬂoors of that sort will not hurt so long weather s dry but when there comes season wet such ﬂoors are not the one best bet which one can deny in olden times men built their homes with battlements and towers and domes and ornaments of gold but all the ﬂoors were made of stone and they made people sigh and groan they were so hard and cold and then with rushes they were strewn to make them warmer to the shoon and also to the feet and those stale rushes would decay their scent would drive the folks away in agonized retreat it took uncounted years of toil and planning by the midnight oil to dope out modern ﬂoors the ﬂoors on which we dance and walk and sing and cuss and wildly talk of hoarders and such bores the ﬂoors on which we spend our lives and train our kids and beat our wives are surely handsome things be they of color light or dark we proudly view them and remark they re good enough your mansion might have jasper walls the ﬁnest painting in its halls that artists can produce and onyx stairs and marble doors but if it had modern ﬂoors twould be poor excuse good hardwood ﬂoors make life pome they beautify your happy home nothing else can your lumber dealer has the best the years have given it the test that means so much to you

i sell the works of poe you ope the door an inch or so and cry go chase yourself gadzooks we not want your tinhorn books oh doors are good many things they re used by peasants and by kings the humblest hut has three or two and palaces have quite few and i recall bitter day when i climbed on dappled gray horse that wasn t brought up right it liked to kick and buck and bite it threw off in wanton style then sat on quite while i was so crippled bruised and sore men took home upon door it shows how useful doors can be i always carry two or three we re always viewing doors you know they face us everywhere we go on doors we knock at doors we wait and if they re handsome smooth and straight they strike us work of art they re soothing to the mind and heart but if they re warped and out of plumb and cracked and cheap and on the bum we think the owner doesn t heed how much his dwelling runs to i size up people by their doors not by the rugs upon their ﬂoors there s nothing looks so punk some cheap door that s warped and shrunk the curtis hardwood doors are great they re always true and ﬁne and straight their beauty gladdens every eye and years don t make that beauty ﬂy they re built by experts and each door is planned to sell hundred more each one s an ad all the rest and every curtis door s the best oh i could write whole lot more but some one s rapping at the door pg 26

long are out of date remarked old jabez black and one but fossil skate would build him such i see your shingles are of wood said johnsing with grin you ought to know they are should be made of tin your house is sure the bummest job man could ﬁnd in town i ve half mind to raise mob and come and tear it down the porch roof has too steep drop it makes wretched show the basement should be built on top the garret down below you surely must have lost your head exclaimed old captain bean to go and paint your mansion red with trimmings of pea green person s eyes it fairly slams the man who sees that paint will think he has the james jams and he ll be apt to faint if you had made it pink and blue it would have hit the spot but you have chosen such hue makes the neighbors i see your chimney is of brick said colonel sassafras and such bungle makes should be built of glass glass chimneys now are all the rage in paris and in rome but you re away behind the age when you put up upon pivot said judge ace it should be built just so then you could turn it round to face most all the winds that blow they all agreed that such shack was never built before it all was wrong and out of whack from roof to cellar door except the was grand and beautiful and slick they saw it had the curtis brand and so they could not kick pg 27 lumber lyrics by walt project gutenberg ebook https gladsome spiel all spring it rained to beat the band and er the saturated land the water stood in pools old pluvius who runs the rain it seemed had water on the brain and busted all the rules the farmers had to sail in boats when they went forth to feed their shote s their ostriches and cows and when they went to sow their beans they had to go in submarines they couldn t use their plows and in the cities things were worse and gloomy country hearse was nearly every face men stood around in dripping crowds and viewed the stretch of leaking clouds and called them disgrace contractors when they called on hoar who runs the corner lumber store would make an awful fuss this is the blinkest blankest spring we can not doggone thing it s getting wuss and wuss it keeps on raining all day long the mud goes through to old hong kong it will not dry till fall unless the gods give us show out to the poorfarm we must go our families and all but hoar the cheerful lumberman is one who always ties can to every gloomy thing his optimism then he voiced he wrapped up big oak joist and tied it with string the rain he said is coming yet and i admit it s pretty wet in fact it s almost damp but you should hail it with delight and shoo your troubles out of sight and bid your griefs decamp the ground is soaked clear through you say down to the center of cathay and that is joyous news it means good crops sundry years so it s sin to sprinkle tears or languish in the blues the moisture stored in yonder soil will make our divers kettles boil and bring us coin galore you ll have more palaces to build because the air with rain is ﬁlled so please cut out the roar the man who sees the good in things who chirps around and smiles and sings and chortles by the year not only boosts his private trade but sees the ghosts of others the ghosts of doubt and fear pg 28 lumber lyrics by walt project gutenberg ebook https one dealer can not understand why people needing planks or sand go past his door to spend their mon with t other dealers dadd son his stock is just good dadd s he gives much patron s scads why then people pass his door and pass him up forevermore perhaps he lacks the sort of charm that will all prejudice disarm that makes his gladsome patrons shout i like to deal with that old man may study all the tricks of commerce trade or politics may know his biz from to zed and yet still fail to get ahead if he has not that winning way that makes new hit every day one doctor s good at making friends from door to door he blithe ly wends and ﬁlls his patients up with pills and cheerfully they pay his bills this doctor s soon in easy street his motor choos along the street he wears large diamonds on his tie his life is one long piece of pie another sawbones knows full well all lore the physics books can tell he studied medicine in rome and studied it some more at home he knows all corners of his game all ailments of the human frame and he could cure the hopeless guy that other docs give up to die but people say we d rather croak than have that sour doctor bloke and thus it is in every line the man who deals in coal or pine the man who sells churn or farm should have that asset men call with that on tap the world goes slick and people say you are brick they buy your hats they buy your gourds they buy your beeswax beans or boards and if you lack it they will trot to one whose manner hits the lumber lyrics by walt project gutenberg ebook https tree on arbor day i took spade and then large round hole i made and planted there tree and in that tree in coming days the birds will sing their roundelays and twitter in their glee i am an ancient i am an old and feeble man i soon must hit the ﬂume but it s pleasant thing to know that there will be that tree to show when i am in the tomb beneath its boughs the kids will play and veterans all bent and gray will in its shade recline and peradventure one will sigh i well recall the dippy guy who planted here this pine the swath he cut was very small while he was on this mundane ball but when life neared its end this tree he planted with his spade and here we re resting in its shade and bless him and the long slow years go by perchance that stately tree will die there s death all it seems and men to earn the needed plunk will separate its mighty trunk and fashion boards and beams and one who plans to build shack will to the lumber dealer track and purchase beam and board and carpenters will straightway go and build ﬁne bungalow mister can afford the walls and roof of my good tree will shelter human grief and glee maybe untold years will echo to both sob and song the laughter of the bridal throng the plash of old wives tears i like to speculate this way but now my boy comes in to say ere he departs school that tree you planted by the fence now looks like s dead cæsar s pg 29 lumber lyrics by walt project gutenberg ebook https shoppers when people their christmas shopping and blow in all their ore to keep the christmas spirit popping they don t call at the lumber store you not see the christmas spieler with purse ajar and eyes say to the cheerful lumber dealer just wrap up that beam i have an aunt

ten yards of basswood shoppers tighten their surcingles in lumber yards at christmas time and buy their girls lot of shingles or sundry pecks of unslacked lime man might think the lumber dealer was off the map and in the shade without tendril or feeler upon the blooming christmas trade but all the year they re building houses with stuff the lumber dealer sells in which the christmas crowd carouses and good old santa whoops and yells beneath yon roof there s joyous laughter that indicates good will to men and every and rafter came from the lumber dealer s den the walls on which you see the holly were furnished by the lumber man who is like claus serene and jolly and does his stunt the best he can the door at which the guest is greeted with kindness which should hit him hard and everything that s nailed or cleated comes from the modest lumber yard you can not have christmas frolic with joy and laughter in the air and nuts and that the lumber man is there pg 30 lumber lyrics

business every day while i sit here and mope there is some reason sure that i ll ﬁnd it too or eat my hat thus muses david dope and so he rustles round to ﬁnd why trade is falling far behind that s better far old scout than quoting pretty new year rhymes and harking to the clangin g chimes that ring the old year out you bet says david and he grins this year i ll guard against the sins that put in the hole i m bound this year will treat well so watch your uncle david sell his lumber lime and and thus the year is good or bad according to the sort of lad who has it by the horns if you are
