the most part in differentiation in the resolution of an obscure and complex object into its component aspects it is surely the stupidest of losses to confuse things which right reason has put asunder to lose the sense of achieved distinctions the distinction between poetry and prose instance or to speak more exactly between the laws and characteristic excellences of verse and prose composition on the other hand those who have dwelt most emphatically on the distinction between prose and verse prose and poetry may sometimes have been tempted to limit the proper functions of prose too narrowly and this again is at least false economy being in effect the renunciation of certain means or faculty in world where after all we must needs make the most of things critical efforts to limit art priori by anticipations regarding the natural incapacity of the material with which this or that artist works the sculptor with solid form or the with the ordinary 6 language of men are always liable to be discredited by the facts of artistic production and while prose is actually found to be coloured thing with bacon picturesque with livy and carlyle musical with cicero and newman mystical and intimate with plato and michelet and sir thomas browne exalted or florid it may be with milton and taylor it will be useless to protest that it can be nothing at all except something very tamely and narrowly confined to mainly practical kind of good useless the protest that poetry might not touch prosaic subjects with wordsworth or an abstruse matter with browning or treat contemporary life nobly with tennyson in subordination to one essential beauty in all good literary style in all literature the project gutenberg of appreciations with an essay on style by walter horatio pater https there are many beauties of poetr y so the beauties of prose are many and it is the business of criticism to estimate them such it is good in the criticism of verse to look those hard logical and excellences which that too has or needs to find in the poem amid the flowers the allusions the mixed perspectives of lycidas instance the thought the logical structure wholesome how delight ful to identify in prose what we call the poetry the imaginative power not treating it out of place and kind of vagrant intruder but by way of an estimate of its rights that is of its achieved powers there 7 dryden with the characteristic instinct of his age loved to emphasise the distinction between poetry and prose the protest against their confusion with each other coming with somewhat diminished effect from one whose poetry was so prosaic in truth his sense of prosaic excellence affected his verse rather than his prose which is not only fervid richly figured poetic we say but vitiated all unconsciously by many scanning line setting up correctness that humble merit of prose the central literary excellence he is really less correct writer than he may seem still with an imperfect mastery of the relative pronoun it might have been foreseen that in the rotations of mind the province of poetry in prose would find its assertor and century after dryden amid very different intellectual needs and with the need therefore of great modifications in literary form the range of the poetic force in literature was effectively enlarged by wordsworth the true distinction between prose and poetry he regarded the almost technical or accidental one of the absence or presence of metrical beauty or say metrical restraint and him the opposition came to be between verse and prose of course but the essential dichotomy in this matter between imaginative and unimaginative writing parallel to quincey distinction betw een the literature of power and the literature of knowledge in the former of which the composer gives us 8 not fact but his peculiar sense of fact whether past or present dismissing then under sanction of wordsworth that harsher opposition of poetry to prose savouring in fact of the arbitrary psychology of the last century and with it the prejudice that there can be but one only beauty of prose style i propose here to point out certain qualities of all literature fine art which if they apply to the literature of fact apply still more to the literature of the imaginative sense of fact while they apply indifferently to verse and prose so far either is really conditions of true art in both alike which conditions may also contain in them the secret of the proper discrimination and guardianship of the peculiar excellences of either the line between fact and something quite different from external fact is indeed hard to draw in pascal instance in the persuasive writers generally how difficult to define the point where from time to time argument which if it is to be worth anything at all must consist of facts or groups of facts becomes theorem longer but essentially an appeal to the reader to catch the writer spirit to think with him if one can or expression longer of fact but of his sense of it his peculiar intuition of world prospective or discerned below the faulty conditions of the present in either case changed somewhat from the actual 9 world in science on the other hand in history so far it conforms to scientific rule we have literary domain where the imagina tion may be thought to be always an intruder and in all science the functions of literature reduce themselves eventually to the transcribing of fact so all the excellences of literary form in regard to science are reducible to various kinds of this good quality being involved in all skilled work whatever in the drafting of an act of parliament in sewing yet here again the writer sense of fact in history especially and in all those complex subjects which but lie on the borders of science will still take the place of fact in various degrees your historian instance with absolutely truthful intention amid the multitude of facts presented to him must needs select and in selecting assert something of his own humour something that comes not of the world without but of vision within so gibbon moulds his unwieldy material to preconceived view livy tacitus michelet moving full of poignant sensibility amid the records of the past each after his own sense can tell where and to what degree the project gutenberg of appreciations with an essay on style by walter horatio pater https else than transcriber each he thus modifies passing into the domain of art proper just in proportion the writer aim consciously or unconsciously comes to be the transcribing not of the world not of mere fact but of his sense 10 of it he becomes an artist his work fine art and good art i hope ultimately to show in proportion to the truth of his presentment of that sense in those humbler or plainer functions of literature also to bare fact the essence of such artistic quality they may have truth there can be merit craft at all without that and further all beauty is in the long run only fineness of truth or what we call expression the finer accommodation of speech to that vision within transcript of his sense of fact rather than the fact being preferable pleasanter more beautiful to the writer himself in literature in every other product of human skill in the moulding of bell or platter instance wherever this sense asserts itself wherever the producer so modifie s his work over and above its primary use or intention to make it pleasing to himself of course in the first instance there fine opposed to merely serviceable art exists literary art that is like all art which is in any way imitative or reproductive of or colour or the representation of such fact connected with soul of specific personality in its preferences its volition and power such is the matter of imaginative or artistic transcript not of mere fact but of fact in its infinite variety modified by human preference in all its infinitely varied 11 forms it will be good literar y art not because it is brilliant or sober or rich or impulsive or severe but just in proportion its representation of that sense that fact is true verse being only one department of such literature and imaginative prose it may be thought being the special art of the modern world that imaginative prose should be the special and opportune art of the modern world results from two important facts about the latter first the chaotic variety and complexity of its interests making the intellectual issue the really master curre nts of the present time condition of mind little susceptible of the restraint proper to verse form so that the most characteristic verse of the nineteenth century has been lawless verse and secondly an pervading naturalism curiosity about everything whatever it really is involving certain humility of attitude cognate to what must after all be the less ambitious form of literature and prose thus asserting itself the special and privileged artistic faculty of the present day will be however critics may try to narrow its scope varied in its excellence humanity itself reflecting on the facts of its latest instrument of many stops meditative observant descriptive eloquent analytic plaintive fervid its beauties will be not exclusively pedestrian it will exert in due measure all the varied charms of poetry down to the rhythm which in cicero 12 or michelet or newman at their best gives its musical value to every syllable the literary artist is of necessity scholar and in what he proposes to will have in mind first of all the scholar and the scholarly male conscience in this matter we must think it under system of education which still to so large an extent limits real scholarship to men in his he supposes always that sort of reader who will go full of eyes warily considerately though without consideration him over the ground which the female conscience traverses so lightly so amiably the material in which he works is more creation of his own than the sculptor marble product of myriad various minds and contending tongues compact of obscure and minute association language has its own abundant and often recondite laws in the habitual and summary recognition of which scholarship consists writer full of matter he is before all things anxious to express may think of those laws the limitations of vocabulary structure and the like restriction but if 13 real artist will find in them an opportunity his punctilious observance of the proprieties of his medium will diffuse through all he writes general air of sensibility of refined usage exclusiones exclusions or rejections which nature know how large part these play according to bacon in the science of nature in somewhat chang ed sense we might say that the art of the scholar is summed up in the observance of the project gutenberg of appreciations with an essay on style by walter horatio pater https demanded by the nature of his medium the material he must use alive to the value of an atmosphere in which every term finds its utmost degree of expression and with all the jealousy of lover of words he will resist constant tendency on the part of the majority of those who use them to efface the distinctions of language the facility of writers often reinforcing in this respect the work of the vulgar he will feel the obligation not of the laws only but of those affinities avoidances those mere preferences of his language which through the associations of literary history have become part of its nature prescribing the rejection of many neology many license many gipsy phrase which might present itself actually expressive his appeal again is to the scholar who has great experience in literature and will show favour to or hackneyed illustration or an affectation of learning designed the unlearned hence contention sense 14 of and renunciation having the susceptible reader the effect of challenge minute consideration the attention of the writer in every minutest detail being pledge that it is worth the reader while to be attentive too that the writer is dealing scrupulously with his instrument and therefore indirectly with the reader himself also that he has the science of the instrument he plays on perhaps after all with freedom which in such case will be the freedom of master meanwhile braced only by those restraints he is really vindicating his liberty in the making of vocabulary an entire system of composition himself his own true manner and when we speak of the manner of true master we mean what is essential in his art pedantry being only the scholarship of le cuistre we have english equivalent he is pedant and does but show his intelligence of the rules of language in his freedoms with it addition or expansion which like the spontaneities of manner in bred person will still further illustrate good right vocabulary translators have not invariably seen how that is in the work of translation driving the most part at idiom or construction whereas if the original be one first care should be with its elementary particles plato instance being often reproducible by an exact following with variation in structure of word after word 15 the pencil follows drawing under so only each word or syllable be not of false colour to change my illustration little well that is because any writer worth translating at all has winnowed and searched through his vocabulary is conscious of the words he would select in systematic reading of dictionary and still more of the words he would reject were the dictionary other than johnson and doing this with his peculiar sense of the world ever in view in search of an instrument the adequate expressi on of that he begets vocabulary faithful to the colouring of his own spirit and in the strictest sense original that living authority which language needs lies in truth in its scholars who recognising always that every language possesses genius very fastidious genius of its own expand at once and purify its very elements which must needs change along with the changing thoughts of living people ninety years ago instance great mental force certainly was needed by wordsworth to break through the consecrated poetic associations of century and speak the language that was his that was to become in measure the language of the next generation but he did it with the tact of scholar also english quarter of century past has been assimilating the phrase ology of pictorial art half century the phraseology of the great german metaphysical movement of eighty years ago in part also the 16 language of mystical theology and none but pedants will regret great consequent increase of its resources many years to come its enterprise may well lie in the naturalisation of the vocabulary of science so only it be under the eye of sensitive liberal naturalisation of the ideas of science too after all the chief stimulus of good style is to possess full rich complex matter to grapple with the literary artist therefore will be well aware of physical science science also attaining in its turn its true literary ideal and then the scholar is nothing without the historic sense he will be apt to restore not really obsolete or really words but the finer edge of words still in use ascertain communicate like these it has been part of our business to misuse and still language was made man he will be authority correctnesses which limiting freedom of utterance were yet the project gutenberg of appreciations with an essay on style by walter horatio pater https in their origin if one vowed not to say its which ought to have been in shakespeare his hers inanimate objects being but barbarous and really inexpressive survival yet we have known many things like this racy saxon monosyllables close to us touch and sight he will intermix readily with those long savoursome latin words rich in secon d intention in this late day certainly critical process can be conducted reasonably without eclecticism of 17 such eclect icism we have justifying example in one of the first poets of our time how illustrative of monosyllabic effect of sonorous latin of the phraseology of science of metaphysic of colloquialism even are the writings of tennyson yet with what fine fastidious scholarship throughout scholar writing the scholarly he will of course leave something to the willing intelligence of his reader to go preach to the first passer says montaigne to become tutor to the ignorance of the first i meet is thing i abhor thing in fact naturally distressing to the scholar who will therefore ever be shy of offering uncomplimentary assistance to the reader wit to really strenuous minds there is pleasurable stimulus in the challenge continuous effort on their part to be rewarded by securer and more intimate grasp of the author sense skilful economy of means ascêsis that too has beauty of its own and the reader supposed there will be an aesthetic satisfaction in that frugal closeness of style which makes the most of word in the exaction from every sentence of precise relief in the just spacing out of word to thought in the logically filled space connected always with the delightful sense of dif ficulty overcome different classes of persons at different times make of course very various demands upon literature still scholars i suppose and not 18 only scholars but all disinterested lovers of books will always look to it to all other fine art refuge sort of cloistral refuge from certain vulgarity in the actual world perfect poem like lycidas perfect fiction like esmond the perfect handling of theory like newman idea of university has them something of the uses of religious retreat here then with view to the central need of select few those men of finer thread who have formed and maintain the literary ideal everything every component element will have under gone exact trial and above all there will be uncharacteristic or tarnished or vulgar decoration permissible ornament being the most part structural or necessary the painter in his picture so the artist in his book aims at the production by honourable artifice of peculiar atmosphere the artist says schiller may be known rather by what he omits and in literature too the true artist may be best recognised by his tact of omission to the grave reader words too are grave and the ornamental word the figure the accessory form or colour or reference is rarely content to die to thought precisely at the right moment but will inevitably linger awhile stirring long behind it of perhaps quite alien associations just there it may be is the detrimental tendency of the sort of scholarly attentiveness 19 of mind i am recommending but the true artist allows it he will remember that the very word ornament indicates what is in itself so the one beauty of all literary style is of its very essence and independent in prose and verse alike of all removable decoration that it may exist in its fullest lustre in flaubert madame bovary instance or in stendhal le rouge et le noir in compositio n utterly unadorned with hardly single suggestion of visibly beautiful things parallel allusion the allusive way generally the flowers in the garden knows the narcotic force of these upon the negligent intelligence to which any diversion literally is welcome any vagrant intruder because one can go wandering away with it from the immediate subject jealous if he have really quickening motive within of all that does not hold directly to that of the facile the otiose he will never depart from the strictly pedestrian process unless he gains ponderable something thereby even assured of its congruity he will still question its serviceableness is it worth while can we afford to attend to just that to just that figure or literary reference just then he will dread that the runner on his muscles in truth all art does but consist in the removal of the project gutenberg of appreciations with an

according to michelangelo fancy in the block of stone and what applies to figure or flower must be understood of all other accidental or removable ornaments of writing whatever and not of specific ornament only but of all that latent colour and imagery which language such carries in it lover of words their own sake to whom nothing about them is unimportant minute and constant observer of their physiognomy he will be on the alert not only obviously mixed metaphors of course but the metaphor that is mixed in all our speech though rapid use may involve cognition of it currently recognising the

use it carelessly he will not treat coloured glass if it were clear and while half the world is using figure unconsciously will be fully aware not only of all that latent figurative texture in speech but of the vague lazy personification rhetoric depressing and worse than nothing 21 because it has really rhetorical plays so large part there and in the case of more ostentatious ornament scrupulously exact of it from syllable to syllable its precise value so far i have been speaking of certain conditions of the literary art arising out of the medium or material in or upon which it works the essential qualities of langua ge and its aptitudes contingent ornamentation matters which define scholarship science and good taste respectively they are both subservient to more intimate quality of good style more intimate coming nearer to the artist himself the otiose the facile surplusage why are these abhorrent to the true literary artist except because in literary in all other art structure is felt or painfully missed everywhere architectural conception of work which foresees the end in the beginning and never loses sight of it and in every part is conscious of all the rest till the last sentence does but with undiminished vigour unfold and justify the condition of literary art which in contradistinction to another quality of the artist himself to be spoken of later i shall call the necessity of mind in style an acute philosophical writer the late dean mansel writer whose works illustrate the literary beauty there may be in closeness and with obvious repression or economy of fine 22 rhetorical gift wrote book of fascinating precision in very obscure subject to show that all the technical laws of logic are but means of securing in each and all of its apprehensions the unity the strict identity with itself of the apprehending mind all the laws of good writing aim at similar unity or identity of the mind in all the processes by which the word is associated to its import the term is right and has its essential beauty when it becomes in manner what it signifies with the names of simple sensations to give the phrase the sentence the structural member the entire composition song or essay similar unity with its subject and with itself is in the right way when it tends towards that all depends upon the original unity the vital wholeness and identity of the initiatory apprehension or view so much is true of all art which therefore requires always its logic its comprehensive foresight retrospect in simultaneous most of all of the literary art being of all the arts most closely cognate to the abstract intelligence such logical coherency may be evidenced not merely in the lines of composition whole but in the choice of single word while it by means interferes with but may even prescribe much variety in the building of the sentence instance or in the manner argumentative descriptive discursive of this or that 23 part or member of the entire design the blithe crisp sentence decisive child express ion of its needs may alternate with the contending victoriously intricate sentence the sentence born with the integ rity of single word

essay on style by walter horatio pater https view the literary architecture if it is to be rich and expressive involves not only foresight of the end in the beginning but also development or growth of design in the process of execution with many irregularities surprises and afterthoughts the contingent well the necessary being subsumed under the unity of the whole truly to the lack of such architectural design of single almost visual image vigorously informing an entire perhaps very intricate composition which shall be austere ornate argumentative fanciful yet true from first to last to that vision within may be attributed those weaknesses of conscious or unconscious repetition of word phrase motive or member of the whole matter indicating flaubert was aware an original structure in thought not organically complete with such foresight the actual conclusion will most often get itself written out of hand before in the more obvious sense the work is finished with some strong and leading sense of the world the 24 tight hold of which secures true composition and not mere loose accretion the literary artist i suppose goes on considerately setting joint to joint sustained by yet restraining the productive ardour retracing the negligences of his first sketch repeating his steps only that he may give the reader sense of secure and restful progress readjusting mere assonances even that they may soothe the reader or at least not interrupt him on his way and then somewhere before the end comes is burdened inspired with his conclusion and betimes delivered of it leaving off not in weariness and because he finds himself at an end but in all the freshness of volition his work now structurally complete with all the accumulating effect of secondary shades of meaning he finishes the whole up to the just proportion of that conclusion and all becomes expressive the house he has built is rather body he has informed and so it happens to its greater credit that the better interest even of narrative to be recounted story to be told will often be in its second reading and though there are instances of great writers who have been artists an unconscious tact sometimes directing work in which we may detect very pleasurably many of the effects of conscious art yet one of the greatest pleasures of really good prose literature is in the critical tracing out of that conscious artistic structure and the pervading sense of it 25 we read yet of poetic literature too in truth the kind of constructive intelligence here supposed is one of the forms of the imagination that is the special function of mind in style mind and soul to ascertain philosophically the distinction is real enough practically they often interfere are sometimes in conflict with each other blake in the last century is an instance of preponderating soul embarrassed at loss in an of preponderating mind quality of style at all events soul is fact in certain way they have of absorbing language of attracting it into the peculiar spirit they are of with subtlety which makes the actual result seem like some inexplicable inspiration by mind the literary artist reaches us through static and objective indications of design in his work legible to all by soul he reaches us somewhat capriciously perhaps one and not another through vagrant sympathy and kind of immediate contact mind we can not choose but approve where we recog nise it soul may repel us not because we misunderstand it the way in which theological interests sometimes avail them selves of language is perhaps the best illustratio n of the force i mean to indicate generally in literature by the word soul ardent religious persuasion may exist may make its way without finding any equivalent heat in language or again it may enkindle 26 words to various degrees and when it really takes hold of them doubles its force religious history presents many remarkable instances in which through mere an unconscious literary

writers of quite other than theological literature on behalf of some wholly personal and peculiar sense of theirs most easily illustrated by theological literature this quality lends to profane writers kind of religious influence at their best these writers become we say sometimes prophets such character depending on the effect not merely of their matter but of their matter allied to in electric affinity the project gutenberg of appreciations with an essay on style by walter horatio pater https form and working in all cases by an immediate sympathetic contact on which account it is

perfume might 27 we say mind secures form the latter being essentially finite the former vague or infinite the influence of living person is practically infinite there are some to whom nothing has any real interest or real meaning except operative in given person and it is they who best appreciate the quality of soul in literary art they seem to know person in book and make way by intuition yet although they thus enjoy the completeness of personal information it is still characteristic of soul in this sense of the word that it does but suggest what can never be uttered not being different from or more obscure than what actually gets said but containing that plenary substance of which there is only one phase or facet in what is there expressed if all high things have their martyrs gustave flaubert might perhaps rank the martyr of literary style in his printed correspondence curious series of letters written in his year records what seems to have been his one other series of letters which with its fine casuistries its firmly repressed anguish its tone of harmonious grey and the sense of disillusion in which the whole matter ends might have been few slight changes supposed one of his own fictions writing to madame certainly he does display by taking thought mainly by constant and delicate pondering in his love literature heart really moved but 28 still more and the

it is the pains and pleasures of art he insists on its solaces he communicates secrets reproves encourages with view to that whether the lady was dissatisfied with such divided or indirect service the

were not before all else the the project gutenberg of appreciations with an essay on style by walter horatio pater https then did flaubert understand by beauty in the art he pursued with so much fervour with so much let us hear sympathetic commentator possessed of an absolute belief that there exists but one way of expressing one thing one word to call it by one adjective to qualify one verb to animate it he gave himself to superhuman labour the discovery in every phrase of that word that verb that epithet in this way he believed in some myst erious harmony of expression and when true word seemed to him to lack euphony still went on seeking another with invincible patience certain that he had not yet got hold of the unique word thousand preoccupations would beset him at the same moment always with this desperate certitude fixed in his spirit among all the expressions in the world all forms and turns of expression there is but form one express what i want to say the one word

mental presentation or vision within 30 in that perfect justice over and above the many contingent and removable beauties with which beautiful style may charm us but which it can exist without independent of them yet dexterously availing itself of them omnipresent in good work in function at every point from single epithets to the rhythm of whole book lay the specific indispensable very intellectual beauty of literature the possibility of which constitutes it fine art one seems to detect the influence of philosophic idea there the idea of natural economy of some adaptation between relative somewhere in the world of thought and its correlative somewhere in the world of alike rather somewhere in the mind of the artist desiderative expectant each other with the readiness of soul and body reunited in blake rapturous design and in fact flaubert was fond of giving his theory philosophical there are beautiful thoughts he would say without beautiful forms and conversely it is impossible to extract from physical body the qualities which really constitute extension and the reducing it to hollow abstraction in word without destroyi ng it just so it is impossible to detach the form from the idea the idea only exists by virtue of the form all the recognised flowers the removable ornaments of literature including harmony and ease in reading aloud very carefully considered 31 by him counted certainly these too are part of the actual value of what one says but still after all with flaubert the search the unwearied research was not the smooth or winsome or forcible word such with false ciceronians but quite simply and honestly the word adjustment to its meaning the first condition of this must be of course to know yourself to have ascertained your own sense exactly then if we suppose an artist he says to the reader want you to see precisely what i see into the mind sensitive to form flood of random sounds colours incidents is ever penetrating from the world without to become by sympathetic selection part of its very structure and in turn the visible vesture and expression of that other world it sees so steadily within nay already with partial conformity thereto

than another at one time than another according also to the kind of matter in question quickness and slowness ease and closeness alike have nothing to with the artistic character of the true word found at last there is charm of ease so there is also special charm in the signs of discovery of effort and contention towards due end so often with flaubert in the style which has 32 been pliant only obstinate durable metal can be to the inherent perplexities and recusancy of certain dif ficult the project gutenberg of appreciations with an essay on style by walter horatio pater https flaubert had not told us perhaps we should never have guessed how tardy and painful his own procedure really was and after reading his confession may think that his almost endless hesitation had much to with diseased nerves often perhaps the felicity supposed will be the product of happier more exuberant nature than flaubert aggravated certainly by morbid physical condition that anxiety in seeking the phrase which gathered all the other small ennuis of really quiet existence into kind of battle was connected with his lifelong contention against facile poetry facile art facile and flimsy and what constitutes the true artist is not the slowness or quickness of the process but the absolute success of the result with those labourers in the parable the prize is independent of the mere length of the actual day work you talk he writes odd trying lover to madame you talk of the exclusiveness of my literary tastes that might have enabled you to divine what kind of person i am in the matter of love i grow so hard to please literary artist that i am driven to despair i shall end by not writing another line happy he cries in moment of discouragement at that patient labour which him certainly was the condition of great 33 happy those who have doubts of themselves who lengthen out the pen runs on all that flows forth from their brains i hesitate i disappoint myself turn round upon myself in

falls from his hand coming slowly or quickly when it comes it came with so much labour of mind but also with so much lustre to gustave flaubert this discovery of the word will be like all artistic

importance they thought in the true estimate of poetry between the fancy and another more powerful imagination this metaphysical distinction borrowed originally from the writings of german philosophers and perhaps not always clearly apprehended by those who talked of it involved far deeper and more vital distinction with which indeed all true criticism more or less directly has to the distinction namely between higher and lower degrees of intensity in the poet perception of his subject and in his concentration of himself upon his work of those who dwelt upon the metaphysical distinction between the fancy and the imagination it was wordsworth who made the most of it assuming it the basis the final classification of his poetical writin gs and it is in these writings that the deeper and more vital distinction which i have said underlies the metaphysical 40 distinction is most needed and may best be the project gutenberg of appreciations with an essay on style by walter horatio pater https nowhere is there so perplexed mixture in wordsworth own poetry of work touched with intense and individual power with work of almost character at all he has much conventional sentiment and some of that insincere poetic diction against which his most serious critical efforts were directed the reaction in his political ideas consequent on the excesses of 1795 makes him at times mere declaimer on moral and social topics and he seems sometimes to force an unwilling pen and write by rule by making the most of these blemishes it is possible to obscure the true aesthetic value of his work just his life also life of much quiet delicacy and independence might easily be placed in false focus and made to appear somewhat tame theme in illustration of the more obvious

quality in his writings he was ever tending to become and the mixture in his work it actually stand s is so perplexed that one fears to miss the least promising composition even lest some precious morsel should be lying hidden the few perfect lines the phrase the single word perhaps to which he often works up mechanically through poem almost the whole of which may be tame enough he who thought that in all creative work the larger part was given passively to the recipi ent mind who waited so dutifully upon the gift to whom so large measure was sometim es given had his times also of desertion and relapse and he has permitted the impress of these too to remain in his work and this duality fitfulness with which the higher qualities manifest themselves in it gives the effect in his poetry of power not altogether his own or under his control which comes and goes when it will lifting or lowering matter poor in itself so that that old fancy which made the poet art an enthusiasm form of divine possession seems almost literally true of him this constant suggestion of an absolute duality between higher and lower moods and the work done in them stimulating one always to look below the

traceable even in 44 the graver writings of historians it makes much difference between ancient and modern landscape art there is between the rough masks of an early mosaic and portrait by reynolds or gainsborough of this new sense the writings of wordsworth are the central and elementary expression he is more simply and entirely occupied with it than any other poet though there are fine expressions of precisely the same thing in so different poet shelley there was in his own character certain contentment sort of inborn religious placidity seldom found united with sensibility so mobile his which was favourable to the quiet habitual observation of inanimate or imperfectly animate existence his life of eighty years is divided by very profoundly felt incidents its changes are almost wholly inward and it falls into broad untroubled perhaps somewhat monotonous spaces what it most resembles is the life of one of those early italian or flemish painters who just because their minds were full of heavenly visions passed some of them the better part of sixty years in quiet systematic industry this placid life matured quite unusual sensibility really innate in him to the

the leave without much count of costs of the world of business of action and ambition also of all that the majority of mankind counts sensuous enjoyment the project gutenberg of appreciations with an essay on style by walter horatio pater https so it came about that this sense of life in natural objects which in most poetry is but rhetorical artifice is with wordsworth the assertion of what him is almost literal fact to him every natural object seemed to possess more or less of moral or spiritual life to be 47 capable of companionship with man full of expression of inexplicable affinities and delicacies of intercourse an emanation particu lar spirit belonged not to the moving leaves or water only but to the distant peak of the hills arising suddenly by some change of perspective above the nearer horizon to the passing space of light across the plain to the lichened druidic stone even certain weird fellowship in it with the moods of men it was like survival in the peculiar intellectual temperament of man of letters at the end of the eighteenth century of that primitive condition which some philosophers have traced in the general history of human culture wherein all outward objects 48 alike including even the works of men hands were believed to be endowed with animation and the world was full of souls that mood in which the old greek gods were first begotten and which had many strange aftergrowths in the early ages this belief delightful its effects on poetry often are was but the result of crude intelligence but in wordsworth such power of seeing life such perception of soul in inanimate things came of an exceptional susceptibility to the impressions of eye and ear and was in its essence kind of sensuousness at least it is only in temperament exceptionally susceptible on the sensuous side that this sense of the expressiveness of outward things comes to be so large part of life that he awakened sort of thought in sense is shelley just estimate of this element in wordsworth poetry and it was through nature thus ennobled by semblance of passion and thought that he approached the spectacle of human life human life indeed is him at first only an additional accidental grace on an expressive landscape when he thought of man it was of man in the presence and under the influence of these effective natural objects and linked to them by many associations the close connexion of man with natural objects the habitual association of his thoughts and feelings with particular spot of earth has sometimes seemed to 49 degrade those who are subject to its influe nce if it did but reinforce that physical connexion of our nature with the actual lime and clay of the soil which is always drawing us nearer to our end but wordswo rth these influences tended to the dignity of human nature because they tended to tranquillise it by raising nature to the level of huma n thought he gives it power and expre ssion he subdues man to the level

english lake country has of course its grandeurs but the peculiar function of wordsworth genius carrying in it power to open out the soul of apparently little or familiar things would have found its true test had he becom the poet of surrey say and the prophet of its life the glories of italy and switzerland though he did write little about them had too potent material life of their own to serve

corruption has always had much to with localities with the thoughts which attach themselves to actual scenes and places now what is true of it everywhere is truest of it in those secluded valleys where one generation after another maintains the same and it was on this side that wordsworth apprehended religion most strongly consisting it did so much in the recognition of local sanctities in the habit of connecting the stones and trees of particular spot of earth with the great events of life till the low walls the green mounds the epitaphs seemed full of voices and sort of natural oracles the very religion of these people of the the project gutenberg of appreciations with an essay on style by walter horatio pater https but another link between them and the earth and was literally religion of nature it tranquillised them by bringin g them under the placid rule of traditional and narrowly localised observances grave livers they seemed to him under this aspect with stately speech and something of that natural dignity of manners which underlies the highest courtesy and seeing man thus part of nature elevated and solemnised in proportion his daily life and occupations brought him into companionship with permanent natural objects his very religion forming new links him with the narrow limits of the valley the low vaults of his church the rough stones of his 51 home made intense him now with profound sentiment wordsworth was able to appreciate passion in the lowly he chooses to depict people from humble life because being nearer to nature than others they are on the whole more impassioned certainly more direct in their expression of passion than other men it is this direct expression of passion that he values their humble words in much that he said in exaltation of rural life he was but pleading indirectly that sincerity that perfect fidelity to one own inward presentations to the precise features of the picture within without which any profound poetry is impossible it was not their tameness but this passionate sincerity that he chose incidents and situations from common life related in selection of language really used by men he constantly endeavours to bring his language near to the real language of men to the real language of men however not on the dead level of their ordinary intercourse but in select moments of vivid sensation when this language is winnowed and ennobled by excitement there are poets who have chosen rural life their subject the sake of its passionless repose and times when wordsworth himself extols the mere calm and dispassionate survey of things the highest aim of poetical culture but it was not such passionless calm that he preferred the scenes of pastoral life and the meditative poet sheltering 52 himself it might seem from the agitations of the outward world is in reality only clearing the scene the great exhibitions of emotion and what he values most is the almost elementary expression of elementary feelings and so he has much those who value highly the concentrated presentment of passion who appraise men and women by their susceptibility to it and art and poetry they afford the spectacle of it breaking from time to time into the pensive spectacle of their daily toil their occupations near to nature come those great elementary feelings lifting and solemnising their language and giving it natural music the great distinguishing passion came to michael by the sheepfold to ruth by the wayside adding these humble children of the furrow to the true aristocracy of passionate souls in this respect wordsworth work resembles most that of geor ge sand in those of her novels which depict country life with penetrative pathos which puts him in the same rank with the masters of the sentiment of pity in literature with meinhold and victor hugo he collects all the traces of vivid excitement which were to be found in that pastora l the girl who rung her father knell the unborn infant feeling

at times to have passed the borders of world of strange speculations inconsistent enough had he cared to note such inconsistencies with those traditional beliefs which 54 were otherwise the object of his devout acceptance thinking of the high value he set upon customariness upon all that is habitual local rooted in the ground in matters of religious sentiment you might sometimes regard him one tethered down to world refined and peaceful indeed but with broad outlook world protected but somewhat narrowed by the influence of received ideas but he is at times also something very different from this and something much bolder chance expression is overheard and placed in new connexion the sudden memory of thing long past occurs to him distant object is relieved while by random gleam of turning up moment what lies below the surface of our immediate he passes from the humble graves and lowly arches of the little like pile of westmoreland church on bold trains of speculative thought and comes from point to point into strange contact with thoughts which have visited from time to time far more venturesome perhaps errant spirits he had pondered deeply insta nce on those strange reminiscences and forebodings which seem to make our lives stretch before and behind us beyond where we can see or touch anything or trace the lines of connexion following the soul backwards and forwards on these endless ways his sense of man dim potential powers became pledge to him indeed of future life 55 but carried him back also to that mysterious notion of an earlier state of fancy of the old heresy of origen it was in this mood that he conceived those regrets childhood when the relics of paradise still clung about the childhood it seemed full of the fruits of old age lost all in degree in the passing away of the youth of the world lost each one over again in the passing away of actual youth it is this ideal childhood which he celebrates in his famous ode on the recollections of childhood and some other poems which may be grouped around it such the lines on tintern abbey and something like what he describes was actually truer of himself than he seems to have understood his own most delightful poems were really the instinctive productions of earlier life and most surely him the first diviner influence of this world passed away more and more completely in his contact with experience sometimes he dwelt upon those moments of profound imaginative power in which the outward object appears to take colour and expression new nature almost from the prompting of the observant mind the actual world would it were dissolve and detach itself flake by flake and he himself seemed to be the creator and when he would the destroyer of the world in which he old isolating thought of many mystic of ancient and modern times 56 at other times again in those periods of intense susceptibility in which he appeared to himself but the passive recipient of external influences he was attracted by the thought of spirit of life in outward things single mind in them of which man and even the poet imaginative energy are but old dream of the anima mundi the mother of all things and their grave in which some had desired to lose themselves and others had become indifferent to the distinctions of good and evil it would come sometimes like the sign of the macrocosm to faust in his cell the network of man and nature was seen to be pervaded by common universal life new bold thought lifted him above the furrow above the green turf of the westmoreland churchyard to world altogether different in its vagueness and vastness and the narrow glen was full of the brooding power of one universal spirit and so he has something also those who feel the fascination of bold speculative ideas who are really capable of rising upon them to conditions of poetical thought he uses them indeed always with very fine apprehension of the limits within which alone philosophical imaginings have any place in true poetry and using them only poetical purposes is not too careful even to make them consistent with each other to the project gutenberg of appreciations with an essay on style by walter horatio pater https which other men 57 bring world of technical diction brought perfect form and expression in those two lofty books of the prelude which describe the decay and the restoration of imagination and taste skirting the borders of this world of bewildering heights and depths he got but the first exciting influence of it that joyful enthusiasm which great imaginative theories prompt when the mind first comes to have an understanding of them and it is not under the influence of these thoughts that his poetry becomes tedious or loses its blitheness he keeps them too always within certain ethical bounds so that word of his could offend the simplest of those simple souls which are always the largest portion of mankind but it is nevertheless the contact of these thoughts the speculative boldness in them which constitutes at least some minds the secret attraction of much of his best sudden passage from lowly thoughts and places to the majestic forms of philosophical imagination the play of these forms over world so different enlar ging so strangely the bounds of its humble churchy ards and breaking such wild light on the graves of christened children and these moods always brought with them faultless expression in regard to expression with feeling and thought the duality of the higher and lower moods was absolute it belonged to the higher the imaginative mood and was the pledge of its reality to bring the 58 appropriate language with it in him when the really poetical motive worked at all it united with absolute justice the word and the idea each in the imaginative flame becoming inseparabl y one with the other by that fusion of matter and form which is the characteristic of the highest poetical expression his words are themselves thought and feeling not eloquent or musical words merely but that sort of creative language which carries the reality of what it depicts directly to the consciousness the music of mere metre performs but limited yet very peculiar and subtly ascertained function in wordsworth poetry with him metre is but an additional grace accessory to that deeper music of words and sounds that moving power which they exercise in the nobler prose less than in formal poetry it is sedative to that excitement an excitement sometimes almost painful under which the language alike of poetry and prose attains rhythmical power independent of metrical combina tion and dependent rather on some subtle adjustment of the elementary sounds of words themselves to the image or feeling they convey yet some of his pieces pieces prompted by sort of mysticism like the daffodils and the two april mornings are distinguished by certain quaint gaiety of metre and rival by their perfect execution in this respect similar pieces among our own elizabethan or contemporary french poetry 59 and those who take up these poems after an interval of months or years perhaps may be surprised at finding how well old favourites wear how their strange inventive turns of diction or thought still send through them the old feeling of surprise those who lived about wordsworth were all great lovers of the older english literature and oftentimes there came out in him noticeable likeness to our earlier poets he quotes unconsciously but with new power of meaning clause from one of shakespeare sonnets and with some other men most famous work the ode on the recollections of childhood had its anticipator he drew something too from the unconscious mysticism of the old english language itself drawing out the inward significance of its racy idiom and the not wholly unconscious poetry of the language used by the simplest people under strong therefore at its origin the office of the poet is not that of the moralist and the first aim of wordsworth poetry is to give the reader peculiar kind of pleasure but through his poetry and through this pleasure in it he does actually convey to the reader an extraordinar y wisdom in the things of practice one lesson if men must have lessons he conveys more clearly than all the supreme importance of contemplation in the conduct of life 60 is with wordsworth the the perfect end we see the majority of mankind going most often to the project gutenberg of appreciations with an essay on style by walter horatio pater https lower or higher ends their own instincts may determine but the end may never be attained and the means not be quite the right means great ends and little ones alike being the most part distant and the ways to them in this dim world somewhat vague meantime to higher or lower ends they move too often with something of sad countenance with hurried and ignoble gait becoming unconsciously something like thorns in their anxiety to bear grapes it being possible people in the pursuit of even great ends to become themselves thin and impoverished in spirit and temper thus diminishing the sum of perfection in the world at its very sources we understand this when it is question of mean or of intensely selfish grandet or javert we think it bad morality to say that the end justifies the means and we know how false to all higher conceptions of the religious life is the type of one who is ready to evil that good may come we contrast with such dark mistaken eagerness type like that of saint catherine of siena who made the means to her ends so attractive that she has won herself an undying place in the house beautiful not by her rectitude of soul only but by its fairness those quite different qualities 61 which commend themselves to the poet and the artist yet most of us the conception of means and ends covers the whole of life and is the exclusive type or figure under which we represent our lives to ourselves such figure reducing all things to machinery though it has on its side the authority of that old greek moralist who has fixed succeeding generations the outline of the theory of right living is too like mere picture or description of men lives we actually find them to be the basis of the higher ethics it covers the meanness of men daily lives and much of the dexterity with which they pursue what may seem to them the good of them selves or of others but not the intangible perfection of those whose ideal is rather in being than in those manners which are in the deepest in the simplest sense morals and without which one can not so much offer cup of water to poor man without offence the part of antique rachel sitting in the company of beatrice and even the moralist might well endeavour rather to withdraw men from the too exclusive consideration of means and ends in life against this predominance of machinery in our existence wordsworth poetry like all great art and poetry is continual protest justify rather the end by the means it seems to say whatever may become of the fruit make sure of 62 the flowers and the leaves it was justly said therefore by one who had meditated very profoundly on the true relation of means to ends in life and on the distinction between what is desirable in itself and what is desirable only machinery that when the battle which he and his friends were waging had been won the world would need more than ever those qualities which wordsworth was keeping alive and nourishing that the end of life is not action but distinct from certain disposition of the mind is in some shape or other the principle of all the higher morality in poetry in art if you enter into their true spirit at all you touch this principle in measure these by their very sterility are type of beholding the mere joy of beholding to treat life in the spirit of art is to make life thing in which means and ends are identified to encourage such treatm ent the true moral significance of art and poetry wordsworth and other poets who have been like him in ancient or more recent times are the masters the experts in this art of impassioned contemplation their work is not to teach lessons or enforce rules or even to stimulate us to noble ends but to withdraw the thoughts little while from the mere machinery of life to fix 63 them with appropriate emotions on the spectacle of those great facts in man existence which machinery affects on the great and universal passions of men the most general and interesting of their occupations and the entire world of nature the operations of the elements and the appearances of the visible universe on storm and sunshine on the revolutions of the seasons on cold and heat on loss of friends and kindred on injuries and resentments on gratitude and hope on fear and sorrow to witness this spectacle with appropriate emotions is the aim of all culture and of these emotions poetry like wordsworth is great nourisher and stimulant he sees nature full of sentiment the project gutenberg of appreciations with an essay on style by walter horatio pater https he sees men and women parts of nature passionate excited in strange grouping and connexion with the grand eur and beauty of the natural world in his own words of man suf fering amid awful forms and powers such is the figure of the more powerful and original poet hidden away in part under those weaker elements in wordsworth poetry which some minds determine their entire character poet somewhat bolder and more passionate than might at first sight be supposed but not too bold true poetical taste an unimpassioned writer you might sometimes fancy yet thinking the chief aim in life and art alike to be certain deep emotion seeking most often the great 64 elementary passions in lowly places having at least this condition of all impassioned work that he aims always at an absolute sincerity of feeling and diction so that he is the true forerunner of the deepest and most passionate poetry of our own day yet going back also with something of protest against the conventional fervour of much of the poetry popular in his own time to those older english poets whose unconscious likeness often comes out in him notes 43 since this essay was written such selections have been made with excellent taste by matthew arnold and professor knight in wordsworth prefatory advertisement to the first edition of the prelude published in 1850 it is stated that that work was intended to be introductory to the recluse and that the recluse if completed would have consisted of three parts the

and spiritual culture sometimes exercise their subtlest and most artful charm when life is already passing from them searching and irresistible are the changes of the human spirit on its way to

and contention communicating in this way to the passing stage of culture the charm of what is chastened athletic they yet detach the highest minds from the past by pressing home its difficulties and finally proving it impossible such has been the charm of many leaders of lost causes in philosophy and in religion it is the special charm of coleridge in connexion with those older methods of philosophic inquiry over which the empirical philosophy of our day has triumphed modern thought is distinguished from ancient by its cultivation of the relative spirit in place of the absolute ancient philosophy sought to arrest every object in an eternal outline to fix thought in necessary formula and the varieties of life in classification by kinds or genera to the modern spirit nothing is or can be rightly known except relatively and under conditions the philosophical conception of the relative has been developed in modern times through the influence of the sciences of observatio those sciences reveal types of life evanescing into each other by inexpressible refinements of change things pass into their opposites by accumulation of undefinable quantities the growth of those sciences consists in continual analysis of facts of rough and general observation into groups of facts more precise and minute 67 the faculty truth is recognised power of distinguishing and fixing delicate and fugitive detail the moral world is ever in contact with the physica l and the relative spirit has invaded moral philosophy from the ground of the inductive sciences there it has started new analysis

his life is unique changed altogether by stray word or glance or touch it is the truth of these relations that experience 68 gives us not the truth of eternal the project gutenberg of appreciations with an essay on style by walter horatio pater https once all but world of fine gradations and subtly linked conditions shifting intricately we ourselves bids us by constant clearing of the organs of observation and perfecting of analysis to make what we can of these to the intellect the critical spirit just these subtleties of effect are more precious than anything else what is lost in precision of form is gained in intricacy of expression it is vague scholastic abstraction that will satisfy the speculative instinct in our modern minds who would change the colour or curve of that ousia akhrômatos askhêmatistos colourless formless intangible put so high the true illustration of the speculative temper is not the hindoo mystic lost to sense understanding individuality but one such goethe to whom every moment of life brought its contribution of experimental individual knowledge by whom touch of the world of form colour and passion was disregarded now the literary life of coleridge was disinterested struggle against the relative spirit with strong native bent towards the tracking of all questions critical or practical to first principles he is ever restlessly scheming to apprehend the absolute to affirm it effectively to get it acknowledged it was an effort surely an effort of sickly thought that saddened his 69 mind and limited the operation of his unique poetic gift so what the reader of our own generatio n will least find in coleridge prose writings is the excitement of the literary sense and yet in those grey volumes we have the larger part of the production of one who made way ever by charm the charm of voice of aspect of language above all by the intellectual charm of new moving luminous ideas perhaps the chief offence in coleridge is an excess of seriousness seriousness arising not from any moral principle but from misconception of the perfect manner there is certain shade of unconcern the perfect manner of the eighteenth century which may be thought to mark complete culture in the handling of abstract questions the humanist the possessor of that complete culture does not weep over the failure of theory of the quantification of the predicate nor shriek over the fall of philosophical formula kind of humour is in truth one of the conditions of the just mental attitude in the criticism of stages of thought humanity can not afford to be too serious about them any more than man of good sense can afford to be too serious in looking back upon his own childhood plato whom coleridge claims the first of his spiritual ancestors plato we remember him true humanist holds his theories lightly glances with somewhat blithe and naive inconsequence from 70 one view to another not anticipating the burden of importance views will one day have men in reading him one feels how lately it was that croesus thought it paradox to say that external prosperity was not necessarily happiness but on coleridge lies the whole weight of the sad reflection that has since come into the world with which us the air is full which the children in the repea t to each other his very language is forced and broken lest some saving formula should be enucleation pentad of operative christianity he has whole armoury of these terms and expects to turn the tide of human thought by fixing the sense of such expressions reason understanding idea again he lacks the jealousy of true artist in excluding all associations that have colour or charm or gladness in them and everywhere allows the impress of somewhat inferior theological literature i was driven from life in motion to life in thought and sensation so coleridge sums up his childhood with its delicacy its sensitiveness and passion but at he was exercising wonderful charm and had already defined himself his peculiar line of intellectual activity he had an odd attractive gift of conversation or rather of monologue madame staël observed of him full of bizarreries with the rapid alternations of dream and here or there an unexpected summons into world 71 strange to the hearer abounding in images drawn from sort of divided imperfect life the consciousness of the of one to whom the external world penetrated only in part and blent with all this passages of deep obscurity precious if at all only their musical cadence echoes in coleridge of the eloquence of those older english writers of whom he was so ardent lover and all through this brilliant early the project gutenberg of appreciations with an essay on style by walter horatio pater https may discern the power of the asiatic temperament of that voluptuousness which is connected perhaps with his appreciation of the intimacy the almost mystical communion of touch between nature and man i am much better he writes and

countrymen what an opportunity one reared on the colourless analytic english philosophies of the last century but who feels an irresistible the project gutenberg of appreciations with an essay on style by walter horatio pater https bold metaphysical synthesis how rare are such occasions of intellectual contentment this transcendental philosophy chiefly systematised by the mystic schelling coleridge applied with an eager unwearied subtlety to the questions of theology and poetic or artistic criticism it is in his theory of poetry of art that he comes nearest to principles of permanent truth and importance that is the least fugitive part of his prose work what then is the essence of his philosophy of imaginative production generally it may be described an attempt to reclaim the world of art world of fixed laws to show that the creative activity of genius and the simplest act of thought are but higher and lower products of the laws of universal logic criticism feeling its own inadequacy in dealing with the greater works of art is sometimes tempted to make too much of those dark and capricious suggestions of genius which even 75 the intellect possessed by them is unable to explain or recall it has seemed due to the character of those works to ignore all analogy between the productive process by which they had their birth and the simpler processes of mind coleridge on the other hand assumes that the highest phases of thought must be more not less than the lower subject to law with this interest in the biographia literaria he refines schelling philosophy of nature into theory of art there can be plagiarism in philosophy says heine giebt kein plagiat in der philosophie in reference to the charge brought against schelling of unacknowledged borrowing from bruno and certainly that which is common to coleridge and schelling and bruno alike is of far earlier origin than any of them schellingism the philosophy of nature is indeed constant tradition in the history of thought it embodies permanent type of the speculative temper that mode of conceiving nature mirror or reflex of the intelligence of man may be traced up to the first beginnings of greek speculation there are two ways of envisaging those aspects of nature which seem to bear the impress of reason or intelligence there is the deist way which regards them merely marks of design which separates the informing mind from its result in nature the mechanist from the machine and there is the pantheistic way which identifies the two which 76 regards nature itself the living energy of an intelligence of the same kind though vaster in scope than the human partly through the influence of mythology the greek mind became early possessed with the conception of nature living thinking almost speaking to the mind of man this unfixed poetical prepossession reduced to an abstract form petrified into an idea is the force which gives unity of aim to greek philosophy little by little it works out the substance of the hegelian formula whatever is is according to reason whatever is according to reason that is experience which has gradually saddened the earth colours us stiffened its motions withdrawn from it some blithe and debonair presence has quite changed the character of the science of nature we understand it the positive method in truth makes very little account of marks of intelligence in nature in its wider view of phenomena it sees that those instan ces are minority and may rank happy coincidences it absorbs them in the larger conception of universal mechanical law but the suspicion of mind latent in nature struggling release and intercourse with the intellect of man through true ideas has never ceased to haunt certain class of minds started again and again in successive periods by enthusiasts on the antique pattern in each case the thought may have seemed paler and more fantastic amid the growing 77 consistency and sharpness of outline of other and more positive forms of knowledge still wherever the speculative instinct has been united with certain poetic inwardness of temperament in bruno in schelling there that old greek conception like some seed floating in the air has taken root and sprung up anew coleridge thrust inward upon himself driven from life in thought and sensation to life in thought only feels already in his dark london school thread of the greek mind on this matter vibrating strongly in him at fifteen he is discoursing on plotinus in later years he reflects from schelling that flitting intellectual tradition he supposes subtle sympathetic between the ideas of the human reason and the laws of the natural world science the real knowledge of that natural world is to be attained not by observation the project gutenberg of appreciations with an essay on style by walter horatio pater https patient generalisation but by the evolution or recovery of those ideas directly from within by sort of platonic recol lection every group of observed facts remaining an enigma until the appropriate idea is struck upon them from the mind of newton or cuvier the genius in whom sympathy with the universal reason becomes entire in the next place he conceives that this reason or intelligence in nature becomes reflective or he fancies he can trace through all the simpler forms of life fragments of an eloquent prophecy about the 78 human mind the whole of nature he regards development of higher forms out of the lower through shade after shade of systematic change the dim stir of chemical atoms towards the axis of crystal form the life of plants the animal troubled by strange irritabilities are stages which anticipate consciousness all through the movement of life that was shaping itself every successive phase of life in its unsatisfied susceptibilities seeming to be drawn out of its own limits by the more pronounced current of life on its confines the shadow of approaching humanity gradually deepening the latent intelligence winning way to the surface and at this point the law of development does not lose itself in caprice rather it becomes more constraining and incisive from the lowest to the very highest acts of the conscious intelligence there is another series of refining shades gradually the mind concentrates itself frees itself from the limitations of the particular the individual attains strange power of modifying and centralising what it receives from without according to the pattern of an inward ideal at last in imaginative genius ideas become effective the intelligence of nature all its discursive elements now connected and justified is clearly reflected the interpretation of its latent purposes being embodied in the great central products of creative art the secret of creative 79 genius would be an exquisitely purged sympathy with nature with the reaso nable soul antecedent there those associative conceptions of the imagination those eternally fixed types of action and passio n would come not so much from the conscious invention of the artist from his to the suggestions of an abstract reason or ideality in things they would be evolved by the stir of nature itself realising the highest reach of its dormant reason they would have kind of prevenient necessity to rise at some time to the surface of the human mind it is natural that shakespeare should be the favourite illustration of such criticism whether in england or germany the first suggestion in shakespeare is that of capricious detail of waywardness that plays with the parts careless of the impression of the whole what supervenes is the constraining unity of effect the ineffaceable impression of hamlet or macbeth his hand moving freely is curved round if by some law of gravitation from within an energetic unity or identity makes itself visible amid an abounding variety this unity or identit y coleridge exaggerates into something like the identity of natural organism and the associative act which effected it into something closely akin to the primitive power of nature itself in the shakespearian drama he says there is vitality which grows and evolves itself from within 80 he too worked in the spirit of nature by evolving the germ from within by the imaginative power according to the idea the power of seeing is to light so is an idea in mind to law in nature they are correlatives which suppose each other the organic form is innate it shapes it develops itself from within and the fulness of its development is one and the same with the perfection of its outw ard form such the life is such is the form nature the prime genial artist inexhaustible in diverse powers is equally inexhaustible in forms each exterior is the physiognomy of the being within and even such is the appropriate excellence of shakespeare himself nature humanised genial understanding directing power and an implicit wisdom deeper even than our the project gutenberg of appreciations with an essay on style by walter horatio pater https this late age we are become so familiarised with the greater works of art to be little sensitive of the act of creation in them they not impress us new presence in the world only sometimes in productions which realise immediately profound influence and enforce change in taste we are actual witnesses of the moulding of an unforeseen type by some new principle of association and to that phenomenon coleridge wisely recalls our attention what makes his view one is that in it the artist has become almost mechanical agent instead of the most luminous and phase of consciousness the associative act in art or poetry is made to look like some blindly organic process of assimilation the work of art is likened to living organism that expresses 81 truly the sense of independent life which the finished work of art gives us it hardly figures the process by which such work was produced here there is blind ferment of lifeless elements towards the realisation of type by exquisite analysis the artist attains clearness of idea then through many stages of refining clearness of expression he moves slowly over his work calculating the tenderest tone and restraining the subtlest curve never letting hand or fancy move at large gradually enforcing flaccid spaces to the higher degree of expressiveness the philosophic critic at least will value even in works of

concrete visible finite work of art of the dim unseen comparatively infinite soul or power of the artist may well be 82 remembered part of the long pleading of german culture the things behind the veil to introduce that spiritual philosophy represented by the more transcendental parts of kant and by schelling into all subjects system of reason in them one and ever identical with itself however various the matter through which it was diffused became with him the motive of an unflagging enthusiasm which seems to have been the one thread of continuity in life otherwise singularly wanting in unity of purpose and in which he was certainly far from uniformly at his best fragmentary and obscure but often eloquent and always at once earnest and ingenious those writings supplementing his

coleridge placed it the pains of sleep to illustrate that retarding physical burden in his temperament that unimpassioned grief the source of which lay so near the source of those pleasures connected

of the prelude it is like some exotic plant just managing to blossom little in the somewhat air of coleridge own birthplace but never quite well there in 1798 he joined wordsworth in the composition of volume of lyrical ballads what wordsworth then wrote already vibrates with that blithe impulse which carried him to final happiness and in coleridge we feel already that faintness and obscure

intellectual cast of genius what with wordsworth was sentiment or instinct became philosophical idea or philosophical formula developed much possible after the abstract and metaphysical fashion of the transcendental schools of germany the period of coleridge residence at nether stowey was him the annus mirabilis nearly all the chief works by which his poetic fame will live were then composed or planned what shapes itself criticism the main phenomenon of coleridge poetic life is not with most true poets the gradual development of poetic gift determined enriched retarded by the actual circumstances of the poet life but the sudden blossoming through one short season of such gift already perfect in its kind which thereafter deteriorates suddenly with something like premature old age

lines to joseph cottle have the same philosophically imaginative character the ode to dejection being coleridge most sustained ef fort of this kind it is in highly sensitive apprehension of the aspects of external nature that coleridge identifies himself most closely with one of the main tendencies of the lake school tendency instinctive and mere matte r of theory in him in wordsworth that record of the green light which lingers in the west and again of the western sky and its peculiar tint of yellow green which byron found ludicrously untrue but which surely needs defence is characteristic example of singular watchfulness the minute fact and expression of natural scenery pervading all he closeness to the exact physiognomy of nature having something to with that idealistic

with that revival of ballad literature of which percy relics and in another 96 way macpherson ossian are monuments and which afterwards so powerfully affected poesy all deftly masked hoar antiquity the ancient mariner also in its measure christabel is romantic poem impressing us by bold invention and appealing to that taste the supernatural that longing le frisson shudder to which the romantic school in germany and its derivations in england and france directly ministered in coleridge personally this taste had been encouraged by his odd and reading in the literature of the like purchas pilgrims early voyages like hakluyt old naturalists and visionary moralists like thomas burnet from whom he quotes the motto of the ancient mariner facile credo plures naturas invisibiles quam visibiles in rerum universitate etc fancies of the strange things which may very well happen even in broad daylight to men shut up alone in ships far off on the sea seem to have occurred to the human mind in all ages with peculiar readiness and often have about them from the story of the stealing of dionysus downwards the fascination of certain dreamy grace which distinguishes them from other kinds of marvellous inventions this sort of fascination the ancient mariner brings to its highest degree it is the delicacy the dreamy 97 grace in his presentation of the marvellous which makes coleridge work so remarkable the too palpable intruders from spiritual world in almost all ghost literature in scott and shakespeare even have kind of crudity or coarseness coleridge power is in the very fineness with which by some really ghostly finger he brings home to our inmost sense his inventions daring they skeleton ship the polar spirit the inspiriting of the dead corpses of the ship crew

experience in our dreams doubtless the mere experience of the eater the habit he must almost necessarily fall into of noting the more elusive phenomena of dreams had something to with that in its essence however it is connected with more purely intellectual circumstance in the development of coleridge poetic gift some one once asked william blake to whom coleridge has many resemblances when either is at his best that whole episode of the of the ship crew in the ancient mariner being comparable to blake design of the morning stars singing together whether he had ever seen ghost and was surprised when the famous seer who ought one might think to have seen so many answered frankly only 98 once his spirits at once more delicate and so much more real than any burden they were the privilege of his tempe it were an integral element in his everyday life and the difference of mood expressed in that question and its answer is indicative of change of temper in regard to the supernatural which has passed over the whole modern mind and of which the true measure is the influence of the writings of swedenbor what that change is we may see if we compare the vision by which swedenbor g was called he thought to his work with the ghost which called hamlet or the spells of marlowe faust with those of goethe the modern mind so minutely if it is to be affected at all by sense of the supernatural needs to be more finely touched than was possible in the older romantic presentment of it the spectral object so crude so impossible has become plausible the blot upon the brain that will show itself without the project gutenberg of appreciations with an essay on style by walter horatio pater https is understood to be but condition of one own mind which according to the scepticism latent at least in so much of our modern philosophy the real things themselves are but spectra after all it is this finer more delicately marvellous supernaturalism fruit of his more delicate 99 psychology that coleridge infuses into romantic adventure itself also then new or revived thing in english literature and with fineness of weird effect in the ancient mariner unknown in those older more simple romantic legends and ballad it is flower of medieval or later german romance growing up in the peculiarly compounded atmosphere of modern psychological speculation and putting forth in it wholly new qualities the quaint prose commentary which runs side by side with the verse of the ancient mariner illustrates composition of quite different shade of beauty and merit from that of the verse which it accompanies connecting this the chief poem of coleridge with his philosophy and emphasising therein that psychological interest of which i have spoken its curious completeness the perfectly rounded wholeness and unity of the impression it leaves on the mind of reader who fairly gives himself to too is one of the characteristics of really excellent work in the poetic in every other kind of art and by this completeness the ancient mariner certainly gains upon completeness entire that of wordsworth or keats saint agnes eve each typical in its way of such wholeness or entirety of effect on careful reader it is coleridge one great complete work the one really finished thing in life of many beginnings christabel remained fragment in the ancient mariner 100 this unity is secured in part by the skill with which the incidents of the are made to break in dreamily from time to time upon the main story and then how pleasa ntly how reassuringly the whole nightmare story itself is made to end among the clear fresh sounds and lights of the bay where it began with the steeped in silentness the steady weather so different from the rhyme of the ancient mariner in regard to this completeness of effect christabel illustrates the same complexion of motives like intellectual situation here too the work is of kind peculiar to one who touches the characteristic motives of the old romantic ballad with spirit made subtle and fine by modern reflectio n we feel i think in such passages but though my slumber had gone by this dream it would not pass it seems to live upon mine eye she belike hath drunken deep of all the blessedness of sleep and with such perplexity of mind dreams too lively leave behind and that gift of handling the finer passages

answers that the dominant tendency of life is to turn ascertained truth into dead letter to make us all the phlegmatic servants of routine the relative spirit by its constant dwelling on the more fugitive conditions or circumstances of things breaking through thousand rough and brutal classifications and giving elasticity to inflexible principles begets an intellectual finesse of which the ethical result is delicate and tender justice in the criticism of human life who would gain more than coleridge by criticism in such spirit we know how his life has appeared when judged by absolute standards we see him trying to apprehend the absolute to stereotype forms of faith and philosophy to attain he says fixed principles in politics morals and religion to fix one mode of life the essence of life refusing to see the parts parts only and all the time his own pathetic history pleads more 104 elastic moral philosophy than his and cries out against every formula less living and flexible than life itself from his childhood he hungered eternity there after all is the incontestable claim of coleridge the perfect flower of any elementary type of life must always be precious to humanity

which both tears and laughter are alike genuine and contagious this distinction between wit and humou r coleridge and other kindred critics applied with much effect in their studies of some of our older english writers and the distinction between imagination and fancy made popular by wordsworth 106 found its best justification in certain essential differences of stuff in wordsworth own writings so this other critical distinction between wit and humour finds sort of visible interpretation and instance in the character and writings of charles lamb one who lived more consistently than most writers among subtle literary theories and whose remains are still full of curious interest the student of literature fine art the author of the english humourists of the eighteenth century coming to the humourists of the nineteenth would have found is true preeminently of thackeray himself the springs of pity in them deepened by the deeper subjectivity the intenser and closer living with itself which is characteristic of the temper of the later genera tion and therewith the mirth also from the amalgam of which with pity humour proceeds has become in charles dickens example freer and more boisterous to this more feeling since predominant in our literature the writings of charles lamb whose life occupies the last quarter of the eighteenth century and the first quarter of the nineteenth are transition and such union of grave of terrible even with gay we may note in the circumstances of his life reflected thence into his work we catch the aroma of singular homely sweetness about his first years spent on thames side amid the red 107 bricks and terraced gardens with their rich historical memories of legal london just above the poorer class deprived he says of the sweet food of

mirth cheaply bought yet we know that beneath this blithe surface there was something of the fateful domestic horror of the beautiful heroism and devotedness too of old greek tragedy his sister mary ten years his senior in sudden paroxysm of madness caused the death of her mother and was brought to trial what an overstrained justice might have construed the greatest of crimes she was 108 released

regarded others very important thing availing to give them little pleasure and inform them little chiefly in retrospective manner but in way concerned with the turni ng of the tides of the great world and yet this very modesty this unambitious 109 way of conceiving his work has impressed upon it certain exceptional enduringness of the remarkable english writers contemporary with lamb many were greatly preoccupied with ideas of moral which have since in some sense or other entered permanently into the general consciousness and these having longer any stimulus generation provided with different stock of ideas the writings of those who spent so much of themselves in their propagation have lost with posterity something of what they gained by them in immediate influence coleridge

have seemed to exercise themselves hardly at all in great matters to have been little serious or little indif ferent regarding them of this number of the disinterested servants of literature smaller

details great or small of actual things books persons and with part of them blurred to his vision by the intervention of mere abstract theories he has reached an enduring moral effect 110 also in sort of boundless sympathy unoccupied he might seem with great matters he is in immediate contact with what is real especially in its caressing littleness that littleness in which there is much of the whole woeful heart of things and meets it more than with perfect understanding of it wha t sudden unexpected touches of pathos in him bearing witness how the sorrow of humanity the weltschmerz the constant aching of its wounds is ever present with him but what gift also the enjoyment of life in its subtleties of enjoyment actually refined by the need of some thoughtful economies and making the

praise of william blake has written with so much natural pathos the song valuing carefully their white teeth and fine enjoyment of white sheets in stolen sleep at arundel castle he tells the story

may be described the religion of men of letters sir thomas browne has his religion of the physician religion understood by the soberer men of letters in the last century addison gray and johnson by jane austen and thackeray later high way of feeling developed largely by constant intercourse with the great things of literature and extended in its turn to those matters greater still this religion lives in the main retrospectively in system of received sentiments and beliefs received like those great things of literature and art in the first instance on the authority of long tradition in the course of which they have linked themselves in thousand complex ways to the conditions of human life and more questioned now than the feeling one keeps by one of the of shakespeare charles lamb such

the deeper soul of things in his writing in his 122 life that quiet is not the flying of one from the first drowsy by choice and needing the prick of some strong passion or worldly ambition to stimulat him into all the energy of which he is capable but rather the reaction of nature after an escape from fate dark and insane in old greek tragedy following upon which the sense of mere relief becomes kind of passion with one who having narrowly escaped earthquake or shipwreck finds thing grateful tears in just sitting quiet at home under the wall till the end of days he felt the genius of

date matter of design and skilled practice highly conscious of itself an art and above all correct up to that time it had been on the whole singularly informal and unprofessional and by means the literature of the man of letters we understand him certain great instances there had been of literary structure or ecclesiastical polity the the most part that earlier prose literature is eminently occasional closely determined by the eager practical aims of contemporary politics and theology or else due to man own native instinct to speak because he can not help speaking hardly aware of the habit he likes talking to himself and when he writes still in undress he does but take the friendly reader into his confide nce the type of this literature obviously is not locke or gibbon but above all others sir thomas 125 browne jean paul is good instance of it in german literature always in its developments so much later than the english and the best instance of it in french literature in the century precedi ng browne is montaigne from whom indeed in great measure all those tentative writers or essayists derive it was result perhaps of the individualism and liberty of personal development which even roman catholic were effects of the reformation that there was so much in montaigne of the subjective people say of the singularities of personal character browne too bookish he really is claims to give his readers matter not picked from the leaves of any author but bred amongst the weeds and tares of his own brain the faults of such literature are what we all recognise in it unevenness alike in thought and style lack of design and lack of authority after the full play of which there is so much to refresh one in the reasonable transparency of hooker the project gutenberg of appreciations with an essay on style by walter horatio pater https thus early the tradition of classical clearness in english literature anticipated by latimer and more and to be fulfilled afterwards in butler and hume but then in recompense that looseness and whim in sir thomas browne instance we have in those quaint writers they themselves understood the term coint adorned but adorned with all the curious ornaments of their own predilection provincial 126 or archaic certainly unfamiliar and selected without reference to the taste or usages of other people the charm of an absolute sincerity with all the ingenuous and racy effect of what is circumstantial and peculiar in their growth the whole creation is mystery and particularly that of man at the blast of his mouth were the rest of the creatures made and at his bare word they started out of nothing but in the frame of man he played the sensible operator and seemed not so much to create to make him when he had separated the materials of other creatures there consequently resulted form and soul but having raised the walls of man he was driven to second and harder substance like himself an incorruptible and immortal soul there we have the manner of sir thom browne in exact expression of his mind and curious in its thinking but with an effect on the sudden of real sublimity or depth his style is certainly an unequal one it has the monumental aim which charmed and perhaps influenced dignity that can be attained only in such mental calm follows long and learned pondering on the high subjects browne loves to deal with it has its garrulity its various levels of painstaking its mannerism pleasant of its kind or tolerable together with much to us intolerable but of which he was capable on lazy summer afternoon down at norwich and all is so oddly mixed showing in its entire ignorance of self how much he and the sort of literature he represents really stood in need of technique 127 of formed taste in literature of literary architecture and yet perhaps we could hardly wish the result different in him any more than in the books of burton and fuller or some other similar writers of that l abodes we might liken after their own manner to the little old private houses of some historic town grouped about its grand public structures which when they have survived at all posterity is loth to part with in their absolute sincerity not only these authors clearly exhibit themselves the unique peculiarity of the writer mind being johnson says of browne faithfully reflected in the form and matter of his work but even more than mere professionally instructed writers they belong to and reflect the age they lived in in essentials of course even browne is by means so unique among his contemporaries and so singular he looks and then the very condition of their work there is an entire absence of personal restraint in dealing with the public whose humours they come at last in great measure to reproduce to speak more properly they have sense of public to deal with at full confidence in the friendly reader they love to call him hence their amazing pleasantry their indulgence in their own conceits but hence also those unpremeditated wildflowers of speech we should 128 never have the good luck to find in any more formal kind of literature it is in truth to the literary purpose of the humourist in the sense of the term that this method of writing naturally allies the humourist to whom all the world is but spectacle in which nothing is really alien from himself who has hardly sense of the distinction between great and little among things that are at all and whose sympathy is called out especially by the seemingly small interests and traits of character in the things or the people around him certainly in an age stirred by great causes like the age of browne in england of montaigne in france that is not type to which one would wish to reduce all men of letters still in an age apt also to become severe or even cruel its eager interest in those great causes turning sour on occasion the character of the humourist may well find its proper influence through that serene power and the leisure it has conceiving second thoughts on the tendencies conscious or unconscious of the fierce wills around it something of such humourist was callous to men and their fortunes certainly not the project gutenberg of appreciations with an essay on style by walter horatio pater https of his own about them and yet undisturbed by the civil war by the fall and then the restoration of the monarchy through that long quiet life ending at last on the day 129 himself had predicted if at the moment he had willed in which all existence he says had been but food contemplation johnson in beginning his life of browne remarks that browne seems to have had the fortune common among men of letters of raising little curiosity after their private life whether or not with the example of johnson himself before us we can think just that it is certain that browne works are of kind to directly stimulate curiosity about himself being manifestly so large part of those works and matter of fact we know great deal about his life uneventful in truth it was to himself indeed his life at norwich he gives us to understand seemed wonderful enough of these wonders says johnson the view that can now be taken of his life offers appearance but we carry with us browne writes the wonders we seek without us and we may note on the other hand circumstance which his daug hter lyttleton tells us of his childhood his father used to open his breast when he was asleep and kiss it in prayers over him is said of origen father that the holy ghost would take possession there it was perhaps because the son inherited an aptitude like profound kindling of sentiment in the taking of his life that uneventful it was 130 commonplace it seemed to johnson to browne himself it was so full of wonders and so stimulates the curiosi ty of his more careful reader of what influence says johnson again learning has had on its possessors may be doubtful well the influence of his great learning of his constant research on browne was its imaginative it complete d his outfit poetic visionary stirri ng all the strange conceit of his nature to its depths browne himself dwells in

wonderful genius exquisitely impassioned speech over all those ugly anatomical preparations though over miraculous saintly relics there was the perpetual flicker of surviving spiritual ardency one day to reassert far than any fancied odylic gravelights 135 when browne settled at norwich being then about years old he had already completed the religio medici desultory collection of observations designed himself only and few friends at all events with purpose of immediate publication it had been lying by him seven years circulating privately in his own extraordinarily perplexed manuscript or in manuscript copies when in 1642 an incorrect printed version from one of those copies much corrupted by transcription at variou s hands appeared anonymously browne decided royalist he was in spite of the project gutenberg of appreciations with an essay on style by walter horatio pater https connects this circumstance with the unscrupulous use of the press political purposes and especially against the king at that time just here romantic figure comes on the scene son of the unfortunate young everard digby who perished on the scaffold some participation in the gunpowder plot kenel m digby brought up in the reformed religion had returned in manhood to the religion of his father in his intellectual composition he had in common with browne scientific interest oddly tinged with both poetry and scepticism he had also strong sympathy with religious reaction and more than sentimental love seemingly vanishing age of faith which he one would not think of vanishing copy of that surreptitious edition of the religio medici found him prisoner on suspicion of too active 136 royalism and with much time on his hands the roman catholic although secure in his definite orthodoxy he finds himself indifferent on many points on the reality of witchcraft instance concerning which browne more timid personally grounded faith might indulge scepticism forced himself nevertheless to detect vein of rationalism in book which on the whole much attracted him and hastily put forth his animadversions upon it browne with all his distaste controversy thus found himself committed to dispute and his reply came with the correct edition of the religio medici published at last with his name there have been many efforts to formulate the religion of the layman which might be rightly understood perhaps something more than what is called natural yet less than ecclesiastical or professional religi on though its habitual mode of conceiving experience is on different plane yet it would recognise the legitimacy of the traditional religious interpretation of that experience generally and by implication only with marked reserve to religious particulars both of thought and language out of real reverence or awe proper only special place such is the lay religion we may find it in addison in gray in thackeray and there is something of concession on second it browne religio medici is designed the expression of mind 137 more difficult of belief than that of the mere layman above described it is meant the religion of the man of science actually it is something less to the point in any balancing of the religious against the worldl y view of things than the religion of the layman just now defined browne in spite of his profession of boisterous doubt has real difficulties and his religion certainly nothing of the character of concession he holds that there has never existed an atheist not that he is credulous but that his religion is only the correlative of himself his peculiar character and education religion of manifold association him the wonders of religion its supernatural events or agencies are almost natural facts or processes even in this material fabric the spirits walk freely exempt from the affection of time place and motion beyond the extremest circumference had not divine interference designed to raise the dead nature herself is in act to lead out the incinerated soul from the retreats of her dark laboratory certainly browne has not like pascal made the great resolution by the apprehension that it is just in the contrast of the moral world to the world with which science deals that religion finds its proper basis it is from the homelessness of the world which science analyses so victoriously its dark unspirituality wherein the soul he is conscious of seems such 138 stranger that pascal turns again to his rest in the conception of world of wholly reasonable and moral agencies browne on the contrary the light is full design everywhere obvious its conclusion easy to draw all small and great things marked clearly with the signature of the word the adhesion the difficult adhesion of men such pascal is an immense contribution to religious controversy the concession again of man like addison of great significance there but in the adhesion of browne in spite of his crusade against vulgar errors there is real significance the religio medici is contribution not to faith but to piety refinement and correction such piety often stands in need of help not so much to religious belief in world of doubt to the maintenance of the religious mood amid the interests of secular calling from about this time browne letters afford pretty clear view of his life it passed in the house at norwich many of these letters represent him in correspondence with the project gutenberg of appreciations with an essay on style by walter horatio pater https men who shared his own half poetic half scientific turn of mind with that impressibility towards what one might call the thaumatur gic elements in nature which has often made men dupes and which is certainly an element in the somewhat atrabiliar mental complexion of that age in england he corresponds seriously with william lily the astrologer is acquainted 139 with dee who had some connexion with norwich and has often heard him affirm sometimes with oaths that he had seen transmutation of pewter dishes and flagons into silver at least which the goldsmiths at prague bought of him browne is certainly an honest investigator but it is still with faint hope of something like that upon fitting occasio n and on the alert always surprises in nature if nature had rhetoric at times to deliver to us like those sudden and surprising flowers of his own poetic style that he listens to her everyday talk so atten tively of strange animals strange cures and the like his correspondence is full the very errors he combats are of course the curiosities of fascinating irresistible popular errors which various kinds of people have insisted on gliding into because they like them even his heresies were old very fossils of capricious opinion it is an industrious local naturalist that browne comes before us first full of the fantastic minute life in the fens and broads around norwich its various sea and marsh birds he is something of vivisectionist also and we may not be surprised at it perhaps in an age which the propagation of truth was ready to cut off men ears he finds one day scarabaus capricornus odoratus which he takes to be mentioned by monfetus folio he saith moschatam et cinnamomum vere 140 but to it smelt like roses santalum and amber gris musca tuliparum moschata again is small fly of an excellent fragrant odour which i have often found at the bottom of the flowers of tulips is this within the experience of modern entomologists the garden of cyrus though it ends indeed with passage of wonderful felicity certainly emphasises to say the least the defects of browne literary good qualities his chimeric fancy carries him here into kind of frivolousness if he felt almost too safe with his public and were himself not quite serious or dealing fairly with it and in writer such browne levity must of necessity be little ponderous still like one of those stiff gardens between the medieval garden and the true englis h garden of temple or walpole actually to be seen in the background of some of the conventional portraits of that day the fantasies of this indescribable exposition of the mysteries of the quincunx form part of the complete portrait of browne himself and it is in connexion with it that once or twice the quaintly delightful pen of evelyn comes into the connexion with the hortulane pleasure norwich he writes to browne is place i understand much addicted to the flowery part professing himself believer in the operation of the air and genius of gardens upon human spirits towards virtue and sanctity he is all 141 natural gardens against those which appear like gardens of and and smell more of paint than of flowers and verdure browne is in communication also with ashmole and dugdale the famous antiquaries to the latter of whom who had written work on the history of the embanking of fens he communicates the discovery of certain coins on piece of ground in the nature of an island in the fens far more interesting certainly than those

till after his death while in the circumstances of the issue of every one of them there is something accidental if the world might have missed it altogether even the discourse of vulgar errors the longest and most elaborate of his works is entirely discursive and occasional coming to an end with natural concl usion but only because the writer chose to leave off just there and few probably have been the readers of the book consecutive whole at times indeed we seem to have in it observations only or notes preliminary to some more orderly composition dip into it read 145 instance the chapter of the or the chapters of the long life of the deer and on the pictures of mermaids unicorns and some others and the part will certainly seem more than the whole try to read it through and you will soon feel cloyed very likely its real worth to the fancy the literary fancy which finds its pleasure in inventive word and phrase and become dull to the really vivid beauties of book so lengthy but with real evolution though there are words phrases constructions innumerable which remind one how much the work initiated in france by madame done england we may think perhaps imperfe ctly in the next century by johnson and was really needed yet the capacities of browne manner of writing coming it did so directly from the man are felt even in his treatment of matters of science with buffon his full

purpose of the naturalist the observer but only one half observation its other half consisting of very this work displays browne still in the character of the antiquary that age understood him he is kind of elias ashmole but dealing with natural objects which are him in the first 146 place and apart from the remote religious hints and intimations they carry with them curiosities he seems to have true sense of natural law bacon understood it nor even of that immanent reason in the natural world which the platonic traditio n supposes things are really true he says they correspond unto god conception and have so much verity they hold of conformity unto that intellect in whose idea they had their first determinatio ns but actually what he is busy in the record of are matters more or less of the nature of caprices if things after all were significant of their higher verity only at random and in sort of surprises like music in old instruments suddenly touched into sound by wandering finger among the lumber of people houses nature the art of god he says varying little phrase used also by hobbes in work printed ature he seems to protest is only little less magical its processes only little less in the way of alchemy than you had supposed we feel that with that disturbed age in england generally and it is here that he with it is so interesting curious and unlike ourselves his supposed experience might at any moment be broken in upon by hundred forms of natural magic only not quite so marvellous that older sort of magic or alchemy he is at so much pains to expose and the large promises of which its large words too he still regretfully enjoys 147 and yet the discourse of vulgar errors seeming it often does to be serious refutation of fairy guing instance against the

the atmosphere of the time that there was any actual connexion between browne work and bacon is but surmise yet we almost seem to hear bacon when browne discourses on the use of doubts and the advantages which might be derived from drawing up calendar of doubts falsehoods and popular errors and from bacon one gets the impression that men really have been very much the prisoners of their own crude or pedantic terms notions associations that they have been very indolent in testing very simple with wonderful kind of supinity he calls it in browne chapter on the sources of error again we may trace much resemblance to bacon striking doctrine of the idola the shams men fall down and worship taking source respectively from the common infirmity of human nature from the erroneous disposition of the people from conf ident adherence to authority the errors which browne chooses to deal with may be registered identical with bacon idola tribus fori theatri the idols of our common human nature of the vulgar when they get together and of the learned when they get together 149 but of the fourth species of error noted by bacon the idola specus the idols of the cave that whole tribe of illusions which are bred amongst the weeds and tares of one own brain browne tells us nothing by way of criticism was himself rather lively example of their operation thro w those illusions those

resultant from the general unsettlement of men 151 minds at the reformation which may be summed up in the famous question of the method of observation and experiment was creeping but slowly over the

kind of prelude or strikes the keynote he is writing in very complex friend upon occasion of the death of common friend the deceased apparently had been little known to browne himself till his recent visits while the intimate friend to whom he is writing had been absent at the time and the leading motive of browne letter is the deep impression he has received during those visits of sort of 153 physical beauty in the coming of death with which he still surprises and moves his reader there had been in this case tardiness and reluctancy in the circums tances of dissolution which had permitted him in the character of physician it were to assist at the spiritualising of the bodily frame by natural process wonderful new type of kind of mortified grace being evolved by the way the spiritual body had antici pated the formal moment of death the alert soul in that tardy decay changing its vesture gradually and if piece by piece the infinite future had invaded this life perceptibly to the

or britons romanised which had learned roman customs the composition of that wonderful book the hydriotaphia he had drawn up short account of the circumstance at the moment but it was after ten years brooding that he put forth the finished treatise dedicated to an eminent collector of ancient coins and other rarities with congratulations that he can daily command the view of so many imperial faces and by way of frontispiece with one of the urns drawn with coal taken out of it and found among the burnt bones the discovery had resusci tated him whole world of latent observation from life from

concerts of thought and expression this connexion of love labours lost with shakespeare poems is further enforc ed by the actual insertion in it of three sonnets and faultless song which in accordance with his practice in other plays are inwoven into the argument of the piece and like the golden ornaments of fair woman give it peculiar air of distinction there is merriment in it also with choice illustrations of both wit and humour laughter often exquisite ringing if faintly yet genuine laughter still though sometimes sinking into mere burlesque which has not lasted quite so well and shakespeare 162 brings serious effect out of the trifling of his characters dainty is interchanged with the more cumbrous play below the many artifices of biron amorous speeches we may trace sometimes

awakened by those strange words actually said in jest the sweet hector of troy is dead and rotten sweet chucks beat not the bones of the buried when he breathed he was man which may remind us of

contrast with the more usual forms of kingship like frivolity or play some of the figures are grotesque merely and all the male ones at least little fantastic certain objects reappearing from scene to crammed with verses to the margin and lovers obscurely at some story of intrigue between these groups on smaller scale come the slighter and more homely episodes with sir nathaniel the curate the jaquenetta moth or mote the with hiems and ver who recite the dialogue that the two learned men have compiled in praise of the owl and the cuckoo the ladies are 164 lodged in tents because the king like the princess of the modern poet fancy has taken vow to make his court little academe and three years space woman may come within mile of it and the play shows how this artificial attempt was broken through the king and his three are of course soon forsworn and turn to writing sonnets each to his chosen lady these of the quaint votaries of science at first afterwards affection youthful knights gallant amorous chivalrous but also little affected sporting always curious foppery of language are throughout the leading figures in the foreground one of them in particular being more carefully depicted than the others and in himself very portrait with somewhat puzzling manner and expression which at once catches the eye irresistibly and keeps it fixed play is often that about which people are most serious and the humourist may observe how under all love of playthings there is almost always hidden an appreciation of something really engaging and deligh tful this is true always of the toys of children it is often true of the playthings of grow people their vanities their fopperies even their lighter loves the cynic would add their pursuit of fame certainly this is true without exception 165 of the playthings of past age which to those who succeed it are always full of pensive manners old dresses old houses what is called fashion in these matters occupies in each age much of the care of many of the most discerning people furnishing them with kind of mirror of their real inward refinements and their capacity selection such modes or fashions are at their best an example of the artistic predominance of form over matter of the manner of the doing of it over the thing done and have beauty of their own it is so with that old euphuis m of the elizabethan pride of dainty language and curious expression which it is very easy to ridicule which often made itself ridiculous but which had below it real sense of fitness and nicety and which we see in this very play and still more clearly in the sonnets had some fascination the young shakespeare himself it is this foppery of delicate language this fashionable plaything of his time with which shakespeare is occupied in love labours lost he shows us the manner in all its stages passing from the grotesque and vulgar pedantry of holofernes through the extravagant but polished caricature of armado to become the peculiar characteristic of real though still quaint poetry in biron himself who is still chargeable even at his best with just little affectation shakespeare laughs broadly at it in holofernes or armado so he 166 is the analyst of its curious charm in biron and this analysis involves delicate raillery by shakespeare himself at his own chosen manner this foppery of shakespeare day had then its really delightful side quality in sense affected by which it satisfies real instinct in our fancy so many of us have an exquisite and curious skill in the use of words biron is the perfect flower of this manner man of words fashion own the project gutenberg of appreciations with an essay on style by walter horatio pater https he describes armado in terms which are really applicable to himself in him this manner blends with true gallantry of nature and an affectionate complaisance and grace he has at times some of its extravagance or caricature also but the shades of expression by which he passes from this to the golden cadence of shakespeare own most characteristic verse are so fine that it is sometimes difficult to trace them what is vulgarity in holofernes and caricature in armado refines itself with him into the expression of nature truly and inwardly bent upon form of delicate perfection and is accompanied by real insight into the laws which determine what is exquisite in language and their root in the nature of things he can appreciate quite the oppo site style in russet yeas and honest kersey noes he knows the first law of pathos that honest plain words best suit the ear of grief 167 he delights in his own rapidity of intuition and in harmony with the sensuous philosophy of the sonnets exalts little scornfully in many memorable expressions the judgment of the senses above all slower more toilsome means of knowledge scorning some who fail to see things only because they are so clear so here you find where light in darkness lies your light grows dark by losing of your eyes with some german commentators on shakespeare appealing always to actual sensation from men affected theories he might seem to despise learning indeed he has taken up his deep studies partly in sport and demands always the profit of learning in renewed enjoyment yet he surprises us from time to time by intuitions which could come only from deep experience and power of observation and men listen to him old and young in spite of themselves he is quickly impressible to the slightest clouding of the spirits in social intercourse and has his moments of extreme seriousness his may well be rosaline puts to enforce the pained impotent to smile but still through all he is true to his chosen manner that gloss of dainty language is second nature with him even at his best he is not without certain artifice the trick of playing on words never deserts him and 168 shakespeare in whose own genius there is an element of this very quality shows us in this graceful and it seems studied portrait his enjoyment of it happens with every true dramatist shakespeare is the most part hidden behind the persons of his creation yet there are certain of his characters in which we feel that there is something of and it is not so much in his grander more subtle and ingenious creations that we feel hamlet and king in those slighter and more spontaneously developed figures who while far from playing princi pal parts are yet distinguished by peculiar happiness and delicate ease in the drawing of them figures which possess above all that winning attractiveness which there is man but would willingly exercise and which resemble those works of art which though not meant to be very great or imposing are yet wrought of the choicest material mercutio in romeo and juliet belongs to this group of shakespeare mercurial people such make good actors and in whom the nimble spirits of the arteries the finer but still merely animal elements of great wit predominate careful delineation of minor yet expressive traits seems to mark them out the characters of his predilection 169 and it is hard not to identify him with these more than with others biron in love labours lost is perhaps the most striking member of this group in the project gutenberg of appreciations with an essay on style by walter horatio pater https which is never quite in touch never quite on perfect level of understanding with the other persons of the play we see perhaps reflex of shakespeare hims elf when he has just become able to stand aside from and estimate the first period of his poetry notes 162 act scene ii return m easure m easure 170 in measure measure in some other of his plays shakespeare has remodelled an earlier and somewhat rough composition to finer issues suffering much to remain it had come from the less skilful hand and not raising the whole of his work to an equal degree of intensity hence perhaps some of that depth and weightiness which make this play so impressive with the true seal of experience like fragment of life itself rough and disjointed indeed but forced to yield in places its profounder meaning in measure measure in contrast with the flawless execution of romeo and juliet shakespeare has spent his art in just enough modification of the scheme of the older play to make it exponent of this purpose adapting its terrible essential incidents so that coleridge found it the only painful work among shakespeare dramas and leaving the reader of more than the usual number of difficult expressions but infusing lavish colour and profound significan ce into it so that under his 171 touch certain select portions of it rise far above the level of all but his own best poetry and working out of it morality so characteristic that the play might well pass the central expression of his moral judgments it remains comedy indeed is congruous with the bland equity which informs the whole composition sinking from the heights of sorrow and terror into the rough scheme of the earlier piece yet it is hardly less full of what is really tragic in man existence than if claudio had indeed stooped to death even the humorous concluding scenes have traits of special grace retaining in less emphatic passages stray lire or word of power it seems so that we watch to the end the traces where the nobler hand has glanced along leaving its vestiges if accidentally or wastefully in the rising of the style the interest of measure measure therefore is partly that of an old story told over again we measure with curiosity that variety of resources which has enabled shakespeare to refashion the original material with higher motive addin g to the intricacy of the piece yet so modifying its structure to

contemporary english writer that shakespeare derived the outline of cinthio rare history of promos and cassandra one of that numerous class of italian stories like boccaccio tancred of salerno in which the mere energy of southern passion has everything its own way and which though they may repel many northern reader by certain crudity in their colouring seem to have been full of fascination the elizabethan age this story it appears in whetstone endless comedy is almost rough the roughest episode of actual criminal life but the play seems never to have been acted and some time after its

diction or sentiment the whole strung up to an effective brevity and with the fragrance of the project gutenberg of appreciations with an essay on style by walter horatio pater https age of literature all about it here then there is something of the original italian colour in this narrative shakespeare may well have caught the first glimpse of composition with nobler proportions and some artless sketch from his own hand perhaps putting together his first impressions insinuated itself between whetstone work and the play we actually read it out 173 of these insignificant sources shakespeare play rises full of solemn expression and with profoundly designed beauty the new body of higher though sometimes remote and difficult poetry escaping from the imperfect relics of the old story yet not wholly transformed and even it stands but the preparation only we might think of still more imposing design once we have in it real example of that sort of writing which is sometimes described suggestive and which by the help of certain subtly calculated hints only brings into distinct shape the reader own eloped imaginings often the quality is attributed to writing merely vague and unrealise d but in measure measure quite certainly shakespeare has directed the attention of sympathetic readers along certain channels of meditation beyond the immediate scope of his work measure measure therefore by the quality of these higher designs woven by his strange magic on texture of poorer quality is hardly less indicative than ham let even of shakespeare reason of his power of moral

and reduced to the mood of more dreamy scene 177 of angelo we may feel at first sight inclined to say only guarda passa or to ask whether he is indeed psychologica lly possible in the old story he figures an embodiment of pure and unmodified evil like hyliogabalus of rome or denis of sicyll but the embodiment of pure evil is proper subject of art and shakespeare in the spirit of philosophy which dwells much on the complications of outward circumstance with men inclinations turns into subtle study in casuistry this incident of the austere judge fallen suddenly into utmost corruption by momentary contact with supreme purity but the main interest in measure measure is not in promos and cassandra in the relation of isabella and angelo but rather in the relation of claudio and isabella greek tragedy in some of its noblest products has taken its theme the love of sister sentiment unimpassioned indeed purifying by the very spectac le of its passionlessness but capable of fierce and almost animal strength if informed moment by pity and regret at first isabella comes upon the scene tranquillising influence in it but shakespeare in the development of the action brings quite different and unexpected qualities out of her it is his characteristic poetry to expose this cold chastened personality respected even by the worldly lucio something ensky and sainted and almost an immortal spirit to two 178 sharp shameful trials and wring out of her fiery revealing eloquence thrown into the terrible dilemma of the piece called upon to sacrifice that cloistral whitenes s to

of all convention she stands before us clear detached columnar among the tender frailties of the piece cassandra the original of isabella in whetstone tale with the purpose of the roman lucretia in her mind yields gracefully enough to the conditions of her brother safety and to the lighter reader of shakespeare there may seem something harshly conceived or psychologically impossible even in the suddenness of the change wrought in her claudio welcomes moment the chance of life through her compliance with angelo will and he may have sense here of flagging skill in words less finely handled than in the preceding scene the play though still not without traces of nobler handiwork sinks down we know at last into almost homely comedy and it might be supposed that just here the grander manner 179 deserted it but the skill with which isabella plays upon claudio sense of honour and endeavours by means of that to insure him beforehand from the project gutenberg of appreciations with an essay on style by walter horatio pater https of life on baser terms indicates coming laxity of hand just in this place it was rather that there rose in shakespeare conception there may the reader there certainly would in any good acting of the part something of that terror the seeking which is one of the notes of romanticism in shakespeare and his circle the stream of ardent natural affection poured sudden hatred upon the youth condemned to die adds an additional note of expression to the horror of the prison where so much of the scene takes place it is not here only that shakespeare has conceived of such extreme anger and pity putting sort of genius into simple women so that their lips drop eloquence and their intuitions interpret that which is often too hard or fine manlier reason and it is isabella with her grand imaginative diction and that poetry laid upon the prone and speechless dialect there is in mere youth itself who gives utterance to the equity the finer judgments of the piece on men and things from behind this group with its subtle lights and shades its poetry its impressive contrasts shakespeare i said conveys to us strong sense of the tyranny of nature and 180

coherence of time with place and place with wishing to annul its long and patient discipline and become in moment the very opposite of that which under ordinary conditions it seemed to be even to itself the mere resolute of the blood brings to others special temptations temptations which defects or lie in the very qualities which make them otherwise imposing or attractive the very advanta ge

complex ion of the heavens the skyey influences shifting the stars shift something also to the mere caprice of men exercised over each other in the dispensations of social or political order to the chance which makes the life or death of claudio dependent on angelo will the many veins of thought which render the poetry of this play so weighty and impressive unite in the image of claudio flowerlike young man whom prompted by few hints from shakespeare the imagination easily clothes with all the bravery of youth he crosses the stage before us on his way to death coming so 181 hastily to the end of his pilgrimage set in the horrible blackness of the prison with its various forms of unsightly death this flower seems the braver fallen by prompture of the blood the victim of suddenly revived law against the common fault of youth like his he finds his life forfeited if by the chance of lottery with that instinctive clinging to life which breaks through the subtlest casuistries of monk or sage apologising an early death he welcomes moment the chance of life through his sister shame though he revolts hardly less from the notion of perpetual imprisonment so repulsive to the buoyant energy of youth familiarised by the words alike of friends and the indifferent to the thought of death he becomes gentle and subdued indeed yet more perhaps through pride than real resignation

truths of human feeling the sincere concentrated expression of the recoiling flesh thoughts profound and poetical hamlet arise in him and but the accidental arrest of sentence he would descend into the dust mere gilded idle flower of youth indeed but with what are perhaps the most eloquent of all shakespeare words upon his lips shakespeare in measure measure has 182 refashioned after nobler pattern materials already at hand so that the relics of other men poetry are incorporate d into his perfect work so traces of the old morality that early form of dramatic composition which had its function the inculcating of some moral theme survive in it also and give it peculiar ethical interest this ethical interest though it can escape attentive reader yet in accordance with that artistic law which demands the predominance of form everywhere over the mere matter or subject handled is not to be wholly separated from the special circumstances necessities embarrassments of these particular the project gutenberg of appreciations with an essay on style by walter horatio pater https the old moralities exemplified most often some lesson here the very intricacy and subtlety of the moral world itself the difficulty of seizin g the true relations of so complex material the difficulty of just judgment of judgment that shall not be unjust are the lessons conveyed even in whetstone old story this peculiar vein of moralising comes to the surface even there we notice the tendency to dwell on mixed motives the contending issues of action the presence of virtues and vices alike in unexpected places on the hard choice of two evils on the imprisoning of men real intents measure measure is full of expressions drawn from profound experience of these casuistries and that ethical interest becomes predominant in it it is longer promos and 183 cassandra but measure measure its new name expressly suggesting the subject of poetical justice the action of the play like the action of life itself the keener observer develops in us the conception of this poetical justice and the yearning to realise it the true justice of which angelo knows nothing because it lies the most part beyond the limits of any acknowledged law the idea of justice involves the idea of rights but at bottom rights are equivalent to that which really is to facts and the recognition of his rights therefore the justice he requires of our hands or our thoughts is the recognition of that which the person in his inmost nature really is and sympathy alone can discover that which really is in matters of feeling and thought true justice is in its essence finer knowledge through love is very pregnant the jewel that we find we stoop and take it because we see it but what we not see we tread upon and never think of it it is this finer justice justice based on more delicate appreciation of the true conditions of men and things true respect of persons in our estimate of actions that the people in measure measure cry out they pass before us and the poetry of this play is full of the peculiarities of shake speare poetry so in its ethics it is an epitome of shakespeare moral judgments they are the moral judgments of 184 an observer of one who sits spectator and knows how the threads in the design before him hold together under the surface they are the judgments of the humourist also who follows with but always pitiful sympathy the various ways of human disposition and sees less distance than ordinary men between what are called respectively great and little things it is not always that poetr y can be the exponent of morality but it is this aspect of morals which it represents most naturally this true justice is dependent on just those finer appreciations which poetry

circumstances and had he chosen from english history to deal with coeur or edward the first the innate quality of his subject would doubtless have called into play something of that profound and sombre power which in julius caesar and macbeth has sounded the depths of mighty character true on the whole to fact it is another side of kingship which he has made prominent in his english histories

those who play their parts there conspicuously unfortunate the utterance of common humanity straight from the heart but refined like other common things kingly uses by shakespeare unfailing eloquence such unconsciously the most part though palpably enough to the careful reader is the conception under which shakespeare has arranged the lights and shadows of the story of the english kings emphasising merely the light and shadow inherent in it and keeping very close to the original authorities not simply in the general outline of these dramatic histories but sometimes in their very expression certainly the history itself he found it in hall holinshed and stowe those somewhat picturesque old chroniclers who had themselves an eye the dramatic effects of human life has much of this

the popularity the showy heroism of henry the fifth is used to give emphatic point to the old earthy commonplace about wild oats the wealth of homely humour in these plays the fun coming straight home to all the world of fluellen especially in his unconscious interview with the king the boisterous earthiness of falstaf f and his companions contribute to the same effect the keynote of 190

the king is but man i am the violet smells to him it doth to all his senses have but human conditions and though his affections be higher mounte d than ours yet when they stoop they stoop with like

that perfect symphony symphony of three independent poetic forms set in grander one which it is the merit of german 203 criticism to have detected it belongs to small group of plays where by happy birth and consistent evolution dramatic form approaches to something like the unity of lyrical ballad lyric song single strain of music which sort of poetry we are to account the highest is perhaps barren question yet if in art generally unity of impression is note of what is perfect then lyric poetry which in spite of complex structure often preserves the unity of single passionate ejaculation would rank higher than dramatic poetry where especially to the reader distinguished from the spect ator assisting at theatrical performan ce there must always be sense of the effort necessary to keep the various parts from flying asunder sense of imperfect continuity such the older criticism vainly sought to obviate by the rule of the dramatic unities it follows that play attains artistic

isolation and will still appeal perhaps though with name it may seem now established in english literature to special and limited audience that some of his poems had won kind of exquisite fame before they were in the full sense published the blessed damozel although actually printed twice before the year 1870 was eagerly circulated in manuscript and the volume which it now opens came at last to satisfy curiosity to the poet whose pictures also had become an object of the same peculiar kind of interest those poems were the work of painter understood to belong to and to be indeed the leader of new school then rising into note and the reader of may observe already in the blessed damozel written at the age of eighteen prefigurement of the chief characteristics of that school he will recognise in it also in proportion he really knows rossetti many of the characteristics which are most markedly personal and his own common 206 to that school and to him and in both alike of primary significance was the quality of sincerity already felt one of the charms of that earliest perfect sincerity taking effect in the deliberate use of the most direct and unconventional expression the conveyance of poetic sense which recognised conventional standard of what poetry was called upon to be at time when poetic originality in england might seem to have had its utmost play here was certainly one new poet more with structure and music of verse vocabulary an accent unmistakably novel yet felt to be mere tricks of manner adopted with view to forcing accent which might rather count the very seal of reality on one man own proper speech that speech itself was the wholly natural expression of certain wonderful things he really felt and saw here was one who had matter to present to

which he alone knew precisely he knew it one of the peculiarities of the blessed damozel was definiteness of sensible imagery which seemed almost grotesque to some and was strange above all in theme so profoundly visionary the gold bar of heaven from which she leaned her hair yellow like ripe corn are but examples of general treatment naively detailed the pictures of those early painters contemporary with dante who has shown similar care minute and definite imagery in his verse there too in the very midst of profoundly mystic vision such definition of outline is indeed one among many points in which rossetti resembles the great italian poet of whom led to him at first by family circumstances he was ever servant and singer faithful dante of florence and of beatrice some close inward conformities of genius also independent of any mere circumstances of education it was said by critic of the last century not wisely though agreeably to the practice of his time 208 that poetry rejoices in abstractions rossetti dante without question on his part the first condition of the poetic way of seeing and present ing things is particularisation tell now he writes villon où quel pays est flora la belle tell now in what hidden way is lady flora the lovely roman way in which one might actually chance to meet her the unmistakably poetic effect of the couplet in english being dependent on the definiteness of that single word though actually lighted on in the search after difficult double rhyme which every one else would have written like villon himself more general one just equivalent to place or region and this delight in concrete definition is allied with another of his conformities to dante the really imaginative vividness namely of his hold upon them or rather their hold upon him with the force of frankenstein when once they have taken life from him not death only and sleep instance and the winged spirit of love but certain particular aspects of them whole populace of special hours and places the hour even which might have been yet might not be are living creatures with hands and eyes and articulate voices 209 stands it not by the love she and i shall

stand in the one what delight in all the natural beauty of water all its details the eye of painter in the other how subtle and fine the imaginative hold upon all the secret ways of sleep and dreams in both of them with much the same attitude and tone and doubtful ould fain inquire of what lies below the surface of sleep and below the water stream or dream being forced to speak by love powerful control and the poet would have it foretell the fortune issue and event of his wasting passion such artifices indeed were not unknown in the old provençal poetry of which dante had learned something only in rossetti at least they are redeemed by serious purpose by that sincerity of his which allies itself readily to serious beauty sort of grandeur of literary workman ship to great style one seems to hear there really new kind of poetic utterance with effects which have nothing else like them there is nothing else instance like the narrative of jacob dream in genesis or blake design of the singing of the morning stars or addison nineteenth psalm with him indeed in some revival of the old mythopoeic age common dawn 211 noon full of human or personal expression full of sentiment the lovely little sceneries scattered up and down his poems glimpses of landscape not indeed of broad effects but rather that of painter concentrated upon the picturesque effect of one or two selected objects at hollow brimmed with mist or the ruined weir he sees it from one of the windows or reflected in one of the mirrors of his house of life the vignettes instance seen by rose mary in the magic beryl attest by their very freshness and simplicity to pictorial or descriptive power in dealing with the inanimate world which is certainly also one half of the charm in that other more remote and mystic use of it with rossetti this sense of lifeless nature after all is translated to higher service in which it does but incorporate itself with some phase of strong emotion every one understands how this may happen at critical moments of life what weirdly expressive soul may have crept even in full noonday into the elder when godiva saw it gleam through the gothic archways in the wall at the end of her terrible ride to rossetti it is so always because to him life is crisis at every moment sustained impressibility towards the mysterious conditions of man everyday life towards the very mystery itself in it gives singular gravity to all his work those matters never became trite 212 to him but throughout it is the ideal intensity of love based upon perfect yet peculiar type of physical or material ich is enthroned in the midst of those mysterious powers youth and death destiny and fortune fame poetic fame memory oblivion and the like rossetti is one of those who in the words of mérimée passionnent pour la passion one of love lovers and yet again with dante to speak of his ideal type of beauty material is partly misleading spirit and matter indeed have been the most part opposed with false contrast or antagonism by schoolmen whose artificial creation those abstractio ns really are in our actual concrete experience the two trains of phenomena which the words matter and spirit but roughly distinguish play inextricably into each other practically the church of the middle age by its aesthetic worship its sacramentalism its real faith in the resurrection of the flesh had set itself against that manichean opposition of spirit the project gutenberg of appreciations with an essay on style by walter horatio pater https and its results in men way of taking life and in this dante is the central representative of its spirit to him in the vehement and impassioned heat of his conceptions the material and the spiritu al are fused and blent if the spiritual attains the definite visibility of crystal what is material loses its earthiness and impurity and here again by force of instinct rossetti 213 is one with him his chosen type of beauty is one whose speech truth knows not from her thought nor love her body from her soul like dante he knows region of spirit which shall not be sensuous also or material the shadowy world which he realises so powerfully has still the ways and houses the land and water the light and darkness the fire and flowers that had so much to in the moulding of those bodily powers and aspects which counted so large part of the soul here rossetti then the great affections of persons to each other swayed and determined in the case of his highly pictorial genius mainly by that material loveliness formed the great undeniable reality in things the solid resisting substance in world where all beside might be but shadow the fortunes of those the great love so determined its casuistries its languor sometimes above all its sorrows its fortunate or unfortunate collisions with those other great matters how it looks the long day of life goes round in the light and shadow of them all this conceived with an abundant imagination and deep philosophic reflectiveness is the matter of his verse and especially of what he designed his chief poetic work work to be called the house of life towards which the majority of his sonnets and songs were contributions 214 the in which one finds oneself by chance or destiny yet can partly fashion oneself never properly one own at all if it be changed too lightly in which every object has its dim mirrors the portraits the lamps the books the of the dead and visionary magic crystals in the secret drawers the names and words scratched on the windows windows open upon prospects the saddest or the sweetest the house one must quit yet taking perhaps how much of its quietly active light and colour along with us now to be kind of raiment to one body the body according to swedenbor g is but the raiment of the that image the whole of rossetti work might count house of life of which he is but the interpreter and it is haunted house sense of power in love defying distance and those barriers which are so much more than physical distance of unutterable desire penetrating into the world of sleep however was one of those anticipative notes obscurely struck in the blessed damozel and in his later work makes him speak sometimes almost like believer in mesmerism we said with its phantoms of the body deftly coming and going on love service is to him in mere fancy or figure of speech real country veritable expansion of or additio n to our waking life and he did well perhaps to wait carefully upon sleep the lack 215 of it became mortal disease with him one may even recognise sort of morbid and hasty death itself which increases on him thoughts concern ing it its imageries coming with frequency and importunity in excess one might think of even the very saddest quite wholesome wisdom and indeed the publication of his second volume of ballads and sonnets preceded his death by scarcely twelvemonth that volume bears witness to the reverse of any failure of power or f from his early standard of literary perfection in every one of his then accustomed forms of song the sonnet and the ballad the newly printed sonnets now completing the house of life certainly advanced beyond those earlier ones in clearness his dramatic power in the ballad was here at its height while one monumental gnomic piece soothsay testifies more clearly even than the nineveh of his first volume to the reflective force the dry reason always at work behind his imaginative creations which at time dispensed with genuine intellectual structure in matters of pure reflection also rossetti maintained the painter sensuous the project gutenberg of appreciations with an essay on style by walter horatio pater https conception and this has something to with the capacity largely illustrated by his ballads of telling some story of impassioned action with ef fect have there in very deed been ages in which 216 the external conditions of poetry such rossetti were of more spontaneous growth than in our own the archaic side of rossetti work his preferences in regard to earlier poetry connect him with those who have certainly thought so who fancied they could have breathed more largely in the age of chaucer or of ronsard in one of those ages in the words of siècles passions où les âmes pouvaient livrer franchement la plus haute exaltation quand les passions qui font la possibilité we may think perhaps that such old time that has never really existed except in the fancy of poets but it was to find it that rossetti turned so often from modern life to the chronicle of the past old scotch history perhaps beyond any other is strong in the matter of heroic and vehement hatreds and love the tragic mary herself being but the perfect blossom of them and it is from that history that rossetti has taken the subjects of the two longer ballads of his second volum of the three admirable ballads in it the king tragedy in which rossetti has dexterously interwoven some relics of james own exquisite early verse reaching the highest level of dramatic success and marking perfection perhaps in this kind of poetry which in the earlier volume gave us among other pieces troy town sister helen and eden bower like those earlier pieces the ballads of the 217 second volume bring with them the question of the poetic value of the refrain eden bower in flower and the bower and the hour the like two of those roy town and eden bower are terrible in theme and the refrain serves perhaps to relieve their bold aim at the sentiment of terror in sister helen again the refrain has real and sustained purpose being here duly varied also and performs the part of chorus the story proceeds yet even in these cases whatever its effect may be in actual recitation it may fairly be questioned whether to the mere reader their actual effect is not that of positive interruption and drawback at least in pieces so lengthy and rossetti himself it would seem came to think so in the shortest of his later ballads the white old true history of the generosity with which youth worthless in life flung himself upon was contented with single utterance of the refrain given out like the keynote or tune of chant in the king tragedy rossetti has worked upon motive broadly human to adopt the phrase of popular criticism such one and all may realise rossetti indeed with all his upon his own peculiar aim by means ignored those general interests which are external to poetry he conceived it he has 218 shown here and there in this poetic also in pictorial work it was but that in life to be shorter even than the average he found enough to occupy him in the fulfilment of task plainly given him to perhaps if one had to name single composition of his to readers desiring to make acquaintance with him the first time one would select the king poem so moving so popularly dramatic and lifelike notwithstanding this his work it must be conceded certainly through narrowness or egotism but in the faithfulness of true workman to vocation so emphatic was mainly of the esoteric order but poetry at all times exercises two distinct functions it may reveal it may unveil to every eye the ideal aspects of common things after gray way though gray too it is well to remember seemed in his own day seemed even to johnson obscure or it may actually add to the number of motives poetic and uncommon in themselves by the imaginative creation of things that are ideal from their very birth rossetti did something something excellent of the former kind but his characteristic his really

him it has blown over his contemporaries and left empty space there still when he saw his childish religious faith departing from him he thinks it must necessarily depart from all intelligent male parisians he wept the project gutenberg of appreciations with an essay on style by walter horatio pater https moment however gaiety serene and imperturbable has been the mainstay of his happily constituted character the girl to whom his uncle desires to see him quixotic intelligent with sort of pathetic and delicate grace and herself very religious to an devout family resident at varaville near by feuillet with half dozen fine touches of his admirable pencil makes us see the place and the enterprise has at least sufficient interest to keep bernard in the country which the young parisian detests this piquant episode of my life he writes seems to to be really deserving of study to be worth etching off day by day by an observer well informed on the subject recognising in himself though his one real fault that he can take nothing seriously in heaven or earth bernard vaudricourt like all feuillet favourite young men so often erring or corrupt is man of scrupulous honour he has already shown disinterestedness in wishing his rich uncle to marry again his friends at varaville think so young man more of christian than he really is and at all events he will never owe his happiness to falsehood if he has great faults 223 hypocrisy at least is part of them in oblique paths he finds himself ill at ease decidedly he thinks he was born straight ways loyalty in all his enterprises and he congratulates himself upon the fact in truth bernard has merits which he ignores at least in this first part of his journal merits which are necessary to explain the influence he is able to exercise from the first over such character mademoiselle courteheuse his charm in fact is in the union of that gay and apparently wanton nature with genuine power of appreciating devotion in others which becomes devotion in himself with all the elegance and worldly glitter of his personality he is capable of apprehending of understanding and being touched by the presence of great matters in spite of that happy lightness of heart so jealously fenced about he is to be wholly caught at last he is worthy to be by the serious the generous influence of things in proportion to his immense worldly strength is his capacity the immense pity which breaks his heart in few touches feuillet brings out if it were indeed thing of ordinary existence the simple yet delica life of french the ideal

224 courteheuse with her hair of that strange colour of fine ashes conducted her visitor to see the library one day she took to see the library rich in works of the seventeenth century and in memoirs relating to that time i remarked there also curious collection of engravings of the same period your father i observed had strong predilection the age of louis the fourteenth my father lived in that age she answered gravely and i looked at her with surprise and little embarrassed she added he made live there too in his company and then the eyes of this singular girl filled with tears she turned away took few steps to suppress her emotion and returning pointed to chair then seating herself on the step of the she said i must explain my father to you she was half minute collecting her thoughts then speaking with an expansion of manner not habitual with her hesitating and blushing deeply whenever she was about to utter word that might seem shade too serious lips so youthful my father she proceeded died of the consequences of wound he had received at patay that may show you that he loved his country but he was lover of his own age he possessed in the highest degree the love of order and order was thing nowhere to be seen he had horror of disorder and he saw it everywhere in those last years especially his reverence his beliefs his tastes all alike were ruffled to the point of actual suffering the project gutenberg of appreciations with an essay on style by walter horatio pater https was done and said and written around him deeply saddened by the conditions of the present time he habituated himself to find refuge in the past and the seventeenth century more particularly offered him the kind of society in which he would have wished to society polished lettered believing more and more he loved to shut himself up in it more and more also he loved to make the moral discipline and the literary tastes of that favourite age prevail in his own household you may even have remarked that he carried his predilection into minute matters of arrangement and decoration you can see from this window the straight paths the box in 225 patterns the yew trees and clipped alleys of our garden you may notice that in our we have none but flowers of the lilies immortelles in short what people call parsonage flowe fleurs curé our old silvan tapestries similarly are of that age you see too that all our furniture from presses and sideboards down to our little tables and our is in the severest style of louis the fourteenth my father did not apprecia the dainty research of our modern luxury he maintained that our excessive care the comforts of life weakened mind well body that added the girl with laugh that is why you find your chair so hard when you come to see us then with resumed it was thus that my father endeavoured by the very aspect and arrangement of outward things to promote in himself the imaginary presence of the epoch in which his thoughts delighted i tell you that i was the confidant of that father so confidant touched by his sorrows full of indignation at his disappointments charmed by his consolations here surrounded by those books which we read together and which he taught to is here that i have passed the pleasantest hours of my youth in common we indulged our enthusiasm those days of faith of the quiet life its blissful hours of leisure secured the french language in its beauty and purity the delicate the noble urbanity which was then the honour and the special mark of our country but has ceased to be so she paused with little confusion i thought at the warmth of her last words and then just to break the silence you have explained i said an impression which i have experienced again and again in my visits here and which has sometimes reached the intensity of an actual illusion though very agreeable one the look of your house its style its tone and keeping carried two centuries back so completely that i should hardly have been surprised to hear monsieur le prince madame la fayette or madame sévigné herself announced at your door would it might be said mademoiselle courteheuse 226 ah monsieur how i love those people what good company what pleasure they took in high things how much more worthy they were than the people who live now i tried to calm little this retrospective enthusiasm so much to the prejudice of my contemporaries and of myself most truly mademoiselle i said the age which you regret had its rare which i appreciate you but then need one say that that society so regular so choice in appearance had like our own below the surface its troubles its disorders i see here many of the memoirs of that time i ca tell exactly which of them you may or may not have read and so i feel certain dif ficulty in speaking she interrupted ah she said with entire simplicity i understand you i have not read all you see here but i have read enough of it to know that my friends in that past age had like those who live now their passions their weaknesses their mistakes but my father used to say to all that did but pass over ground of what was solid and serious which always discovered itself again anew there were great faults then but there were also great repentances there was certain higher region to which everything what evil she blushed deeply then rising little suddenly long speech she said forgive i

raise and lower alternately bernard hopes feuillet has more than once tried his hand with striking success in the portraiture of french ecclesiastics he has drawn none better than the bishop of méen uncle of mademoiselle courteheuse to whose interests he is devoted bernard feels that to gain the influence of this prelate 227 would be to gain his cause and the opportunity an interview comes monseigneur courteheuse would seem to be little over fifty years of age he is rather tall and very thin the eyes black and full of life are encircled by ring of deep brown his speech and gesture are animated and at times if carried away he adopts frequently sort of furious manner which on sudden melts into the smile of an honest man he has beautiful silvery hair flying in vagrant locks over his forehead and beautiful bishop hands he becomes calm he has an imposing way of gently resettling himself in his sacerdotal dignity to sum up his is physiognomy full of passion consumed with zeal yet still frank and sincere i was hardly seated when with motion of the hand he invited to speak monseigneur i said i come to you you understand to my last resource what i am now doing is almost an act of despair it might seem at first sight that member of the family of mademoiselle courteheuse must show himself more pitiless than yourself towards the faults with which i am reproached i am an unbeliever you are an apostle and yet monseigneur it is often at the hands of saintly priests such yourself that the guilty find most indulgence and then i am not indeed guilty i have but wandered i am refused the hand of your niece because i not share her own faith but monseigneur unbelief is not crime it is misfortune i know people often say man denies god when by his own conduct he has brought himself into condition in which he may well desire that god does not exist in this way he is made guilty or in sense responsible his incredulity myself monseigneur i have consulted my conscience with an entire sincerity and although my youth has been amiss i am certain that my atheism proceeds from sentiment of personal interest on the contrary i may tell you with truth that the day on which i perceived my faith come to nought the day on which i lost hope in god i shed the bitterest tears of my life in spite of appearances i am not so light spirit people think i am not one of those whom god when he disappears 228 leaves sense of void place believe man may love sport his club his worldly habits and yet have his hours of thought of recollection you suppose that in those hours one does not feel the frightful discomfort of an existence with moral basis without principles with outlook beyond this world and yet what can one you would tell forthwith in the goodness the compassion which i read in your eyes confide to your objections to religion and i will try to solve them monseigneur i should hardly know how to answer you my objections are they are without number like the stars in the sky they come to us on all sides from every quarter of the horizon if on the wings of the wind and they leave in us they pass ruins only and darkness such has been my experience and that of many others and it has been involuntary it is irreparable and said the bishop suddenly casting on one of his august looks you suppose that i am but in my cathedral church monseigneur yes listening to you one would suppose that we were come to period of the world in which one must needs be either an atheist or hypocrite personally i claim to be neither one nor the other need i defend myself on that point monseigneur need i say that i did not come here to give you of fence the project gutenberg of appreciations with an essay on style by walter horatio pater https doubtless doubtless well monsieur i admit not without great reserves mind one is always more or less responsible the atmosphere in which he lives the influences to which he is subject the habitual turn he gives to his thoughts still i admit that you are the victim of the incredulity of the age that you are altogether guiltless in your scepticism your atheism since you have fear of hard words is it therefore any the less certain that the union of fervent believer such my niece with man like yourself would be moral disorder of which the consequences might be disastrous you think it could be my duty relative of mademoiselle courteheuse her spiritual father prelate of the church to lend my hands to such disorder to preside over the shocking union of two souls separated by the whole width of heaven 229 the bishop in proposing that question kept his eyes fixed ardently on mine monseigneur i answered after moment embarrassment you know well and better than i the condition of the world and of our country at this time you know that unhappily i am not an exception that men of faith are rare in it and permit to tell you my whole mind if i must needs suffer the inconsolable misfortune of renouncing the happiness i had hoped are you quite sure that the man to whom one of these days you will give your niece may not be something more than sceptic or even an atheist what monsieur hypocrite monseigneur mademoiselle courteheuse is beautiful enough rich enough to excite the ambition of those who may be less scrupulous than if you now know that i am sceptic you know also that i am man of honour and there is something in that man of honour the bishop muttered to himself with little petulance and hesitation man of honour yes i believe it then after an interval come monsieur he said gently your case is not desperate you suppose my aliette is one of those young enthusiasts through whom heaven sometimes works miracles and bernard refusing any encouragement of that hope the very roots of faith are dead in him ever since you think that the bishop answers it is honest to say so but god has his ways soon after the journal comes to an end with that peculiar crisis in bernard life which had suggested the writing of it aliette with the approval of her family has given him her hand bernard accepts it with the full purpose of doing all he can to make his wife happy she is charming and

he returned to paris after few days absence he 231 ran straight to the lady he loved madame montbazon i think he went up little staircase of which he had the key and the first thing he saw on the table in the middle of the room was the head of his mistress of which the doctors were about to make examination if i were sure said aliette that my head could have such power i would love to die she said it in low voice but with such an accent of loving sincerity that her husband had sensation of sort of painful disquiet he smiled however and tapping her cheek softly folly he said head charming yours has need to be dead that it may work miracles certainly feuillet has some weighty charges to bring against the parisian society of our day when aliette revolts from world of gossip which reduces all minds alike to the same level of vulgar mediocrity bernard on his side can perceive there deterioration of moral tone which shocks his sense of honour man of honour he can hardly trust his wife to the gaieties of society which welcomes all the world to amuse itself in undress it happened that at this perplexed period in the youthful household one and the same person became the recipient both of the tearful confidences of madame vaudricourt and those of her husband it was the duchess of she is anoth er of feuillet admirable minor sketches an old friend of the vaudricourt family and the only woman with whom aliette since her arrival in paris had formed kind of intim acy the duchess was far from sharing on points of morality and above all of religion the severe and impassioned orthodoxy of her young friend she had lived it is true an irreproachable life but less in consequ ence of defined principles than by instinct and natural taste she admitted to herself that she was an honest woman result of her birth and had further merit in the matter she was old very careful of 232 herself and pleasant aroma floated about her below her silvery hair people loved her her grace of another time than her wit and her worldly wisdom which she placed freely at the disposal of the public now and then she made match but her special gift lay rather in the way in which she came to the rescue when marriage turned out and she had sinecure the result was that she passed the best part of her time in repairing family rents that might last its time she would say and then we know that what has been well mended sometimes lasts better than what is new little later bernard in the interest of aliette has chivalrously determined to quit paris at valmoutiers fine old place in the neighbourhood of fontainebl eau they established themselves country life here aliette tastes the happiest days since her marriage bernard of course after little time is greatly bored but so far they have never seriously doubted of their great love each other it is here that feuillet brings on the scene kind of character new in his books perhaps hardly worthy of the other company there sort of female monsieur camors but without his grace and tenderness and who actually commits crime how would the morbid charms of camors have vanished if his wife once suspected of him he had ever contemplated crime and surely the showy insolent charms of sabine tallevaut beautiful intellectually gifted supremely amazonian yet withal not drawn with feuillet usual fineness scarcely hold out the reader any more than 233 bernard himself in the long run against the vulgarising touch of her cold wickedness living in the neighbourhood of valmoutiers in somewhat melancholy abode the mystery of which in the eyes of bernard adds to her poetic charm with her guardian an old rich freethinking doctor devoted to research she comes to valmoutiers one night in his company on the occasion of the alarming illness of

object out of his sight aliette has divined their secret in the fatal illness which follows soon after bernard watches over her with tender solicitude hoping against hope that the disease may take favourable turn my child he said to her one day taking the hand which she abandoned to him i have just been scolding old victoire she is losing her head in spite of the repeated assurances of the doctors she is alarmed at seeing you little worse than usual and has had the curé sent you wish to see him pray let see him 234 she sighed heavily and fixed upon her husband her large blue eyes full of anguish so sharp and so singular that he felt frozen to the marrow he could not help saying with deep emotion you love longer aliette ever murmured the poor child he leaned over her with long kiss upon the forehead she saw tears stealing from the eyes of her husband and seemed if surprised soon afterwards aliette is dead to the profound sorrow of bernard less than two years later he has become the husband of mademoiselle tallevaut it was about two years after his marriage with sabine that bernard resumed the journal with which we began in the pages which he now adds he seems at first unchanged how then to that story of rancé the reformer of la trappe finding the head of his dead mistress an incident which the reader of la morte will surely have taken presentiment aliette had so

reality shall i write this yes i will write it it is my duty to so from this moment the journ al begun in so much gaiety of heart is but my last will and testament if i should disappear from the world the secret must not die with it must be bequeathed to the natural protectors of my child her interests if not her life are concerned therein here then is what passed i had not arrived in time to render my last duty to madame courteheuse the family was already dispersed i found here only aliette brother to him i communicated my plan concerning the child and he could but approve my intention was to bring away with jeanne her nurse victoire who had brought her up she brought up her mother but she is old and in feeble health and i feared some difficulties on her part the more her attitude towards myself since the death of my first wife has been marked by an ill grace approaching to hostility i took her aside while jeanne was playing in the garden my good victoire i said while madame courteheuse was living i considered it duty to leave her granddaughter in her keeping besides one was better fitted to watch over her education at present my duty is to watch over it myself i propose therefore to take jeanne with to paris and i hope that you may be willing to accompany her and remain in her service when she understood my intention the old woman in whose hands i had noticed faint trembling became suddenly very pale she fixed her firm grey eyes upon monsieur le comte will not that pardon my good victoire that i shall i appreciate your good qualities of fidelity and devotion i shall be very grateful if you will continue to take care of my daughter you have done so excellently but the rest i intend to be the only master in my own house and the only master of my child she laid hand upon my arm i implore you monsieur this her fixed look did not leave my face and seemed to be questioning to the very bottom of my soul i have never believed it she murmured i 237 never could believe it but if you take the child away i shall believe what wretched woman believe what her voice sank lower still believe that you knew how her mother came by her death and that you mean the daughter to die she did die her mother did yes by the same hand the sweat came on my forehead i felt it were breathing of death upon but still i thrust away from that terrible light on things victoire

walked up and down the room awhile to collect my senses then returning to the old woman yet how can i believe you i asked if you had had the shadow of proof of what you give to understand how could you have kept silence so long how could you have allowed to contract that hateful marriage she seemed more confident and her voice grew gentler monsieur it is because madame before she went to god made take oath on the crucifix to keep that secret ever yet not with in fact with and i in turn questioned her my eyes upon hers she hesitated then stammered out true not with you because she believed poor little soul that what did she believe that i knew it that i was an accomplice tell her eyes fell and she made answer is it possible my god is it possible but come sit by here and tell all you know all you saw at what time was it you noticed the precise moment in truth she had been suf fering long time past victoire tells the miserable story of sabine 238 must pardon what we think not quite worthy addition to the imaginary world feuillet has called up round about him the sake of fully knowing bernard and aliette the old nurse had surprised her in the very act and did not credit her explanation when i surprised her she goes on it may already have been too sure it was not the first time she had been first thought was to give you information but i had not the courage then i told madame i thought i saw plainly that i had nothing to tell she was not already aware of nevertheless she chided almost harshly know very well she said my husband is always there when mademoiselle prepares the medicines so that he too would be guilty rather than believe that i would accept death at his hands hundred times over and i remember monsieur how at the very moment when she told that you came out from the little boudoir and brought her glass of valerian she cast on terrible look and drank few minutes afterwards she was so ill that she thought the end was come she begged to give her her crucifix and made swear never to utter word concerning our suspicions it was then i sent the priest i have told you monsieur what i know what i have seen with my own eyes i swear that i have said nothing but what is absolutely true she paused i could not answer her i seized her old wrinkled and trembling hands and pressed them to my forehead and wept like child may died believing guilty the thought is terrible to i know not what to creature so frail so delicate so sweet yes she said to herself my husband is murderer what he is givin g is poison and he knows it she died with that thought in her last thought and she will never never know that it was not so that i am innocent that the thought is torment to that i am the most unhappy of men ah god if you indeed exist you see what i suffer have pity on ah how i wish i could believe that all is not over between 239 her and that she sees and hears that she knew the truth but i find it impossible impossible i was criminal was her

postscript ainei palaion men oinon anthea d hymnon 241 the words classical and romantic although like many other critical expressions sometimes abused by those who have understood them too vaguely or too absolutely yet define two real tendenci es in the history of art and literature used in an exaggerated sense to express greater opposition between those tendencies than really exists they have at times tended to divide people of taste into opposite camps but in that house beautiful which the creative minds of all artists and those who have treated life in the spirit of always building together the refres hment of the human spirit these oppositions cease and the interpreter of the house beautiful the true aesthetic critic uses these divisions only so far they enable him to enter into the peculiarities of the objects with which he has to the term classical fixed it is to literature and group in art is clear indeed but then it has often been used in hard and merely scholastic 242 sense by the praisers of what is old and accustomed at the expense of what is new by critics who would never have discovered themselves the charm of any work whether new or old who value what is old in art or literature its accessorie s and chiefly the conventional authority that has gathered about who would never really have been made glad by any venus from the sea and who praise the venus of old greece and rome only because they fancy her grown now into something staid and tame and the term classical has been used in too absolute and therefore in misleading sense so the term romantic has been used much too vaguely in various accidental senses the sense in which scott is called romantic writer is chiefly this that in opposition to the literary tradition of the last century he loved strange adventure and sought it in the middle age much later in yorkshire village the spirit of romanticism bore more really characteristic fruit in the work of young girl emily brontë the romance of

spirit is shown less in tieck its professional representative than in meinhold the author of sidonia the sorceress and the amber in germany and france within the last hundred years the term has been used to describe particular school of writers and consequently when heine criticises the romantic school in movement which culminated in goethe goetz von berlichingen or when théophile gautier criticises the romantic movement in france where indeed it bore its most characteristic fruits and its play is hardly yet over where by certain audacity or bizarrerie of motive united with faultless literary execution it still shows itself in imaginative literature they use the word with an exact sense of speci al artistic qualities indeed but use it nevertheless with limited application to the manifestation of those qualities at particular period but the romantic spirit is in reality an present an enduring principle in the artistic temperament and the qualities of thought and style which that and other similar uses of the word romantic really indicate are indeed but symptoms of very continuous and widely working influence though the words classical and romantic then have acquired an almost technical meaning in application to certain developments of german and french taste yet this is but one variation of an old opposition which may be traced from the 244 very beginning of the formation of european art and literature from the first formation of anything like standard of taste in these things the restless curiosity of their more eager lovers necessarily made itself felt in the craving new motives new subjects of interest new modifications of style hence the opposition between the classicists and the the adherents in the culture of beauty of the principles of liberty and authority strength and order or what the greeks called in the third volume of the causeries du lundi has discusse d the question what is meant by classic it was question he was well fitted to answer having himself lived through many phases of taste and having been in earlier life an enthusiastic member of the romantic school he was also great master of that sort of philosophy of literature which delights in tracing traditions in it and the way in which various phases of thought and sentiment maintain themselves through successive modifications from epoch to epoch his aim then is to give the word classic wider and he says more generous sense than it commonly bears to make it expressly grandiose et flottant and in doing this he develops in masterly manner those qualities of measure purity temperance of whic h it is the especial function of classical art 245 and literature whatever meaning narrower or wider we attach to the term to take care the charm therefore of what is classical in art or literature is that of the known tale to which we can nevertheless listen over and over again because it is told so well to the absolute beauty of its artistic form is added the accidental tranquil charm of familiarity there are times indeed at which these charms fail to work on our spirits at all because they fail to excite us romanticism says stendhal is the art of presenting to people the literary works which in the actual state of their habits and beliefs are capable of giving them the greatest possible pleasure classicism on the contrary of presenting them with that which gave the greatest possible pleasur to their grandfathers but then beneath all changes of habits and beliefs our love of that mere abstract what is classical in literature possesses still maintains itself in the best of us and what pleased our grandparents may at least tranquillise us the classic comes to us out of the cool and quiet of other times the measure of what long experience has shown will at least never displease us and in the classical literature of greece and rom in the classics of the last century the essentially classical element is that quali ty of order in beauty which they possess indeed 246 in degree and which impresses some minds to the exclusion of everything else in the project gutenberg of appreciations with an essay on style by walter horatio pater https is the addition of strangeness to beauty that constitutes the romantic character in art and the desire of beauty being fixed element in every artistic organisation it is the addition of curiosity to this desire of beauty that constitutes the romantic temper curiosity and the desire of beauty have each their place in art in all true criticism when one curiosity is deficient when one is not eager enough new impressions and new pleasures one is liable to value mere academical proprieties too highly to be satisfied with or conventional types with the insipid ornament of racine or the prettiness of that later greek sculpture which passed so long true hellenic work to miss those places where the handiwork of nature or of the artist has been most cunning to find the most stimulating products of art mere irritation and when one curiosity is in excess when it overbalances the desire of beauty then one is liable to value in works of art what is inartistic in them to be satisfied with what is exaggerated in art with productions like some of those of the romantic school in germany not to distinguish jealously enough between what is admi rably done and what is done not quite so well in the writings instance of jean paul and if i had to give 247 instances of these defects then i should say that pope in common with the age of literature to which he belonged had too little curiosity so that there is always certain insipidity in the effect of his work exquisite it is and coming down to our own time that balza c had an excess of not duly tempered with the desire of beauty but however falsely those two tendencies may be opposed by critics or exaggerated by artists themselves they are tendenci es really at work at all times in art moulding it with the balance sometimes little on one side sometimes little on the other generating respectively the balance inclines on this side or that two principles two traditions in art and in literature so far it partakes of the spirit of art if there is great overbalance of curiosity then we have the grotesque in art if the union of strangeness and beauty under very difficult and complex conditions be successful one if the union be entire then the resultant beauty is very exquisite very attractive with passionate care beauty the romantic spirit refuses to have it unless the condition of strangeness be first fulfilled its desire is beauty born of unlikely elements by profound alchemy by difficult initiation by the charm which wrings it even out of terrib le things and trace of distortion of the grotesqu may perhaps linger an additional element of expression about its 248 ultimate grace its eager excited spirit will have strength the grotesque first of trees shriekin g you tear off the leaves jean valjean the long years of convict life redgauntlet the quicksands of solway moss then incorporate with this strangeness and intensified by restraint much swee tness much beauty is compatible with that énergique frais et according to are the characteristics of genuine ouvrages anciens ne sont pas classiques parce sont vieux parce sont énergiques frais et dispos energy freshness intelligent and masterly disposition are characteristics of victor hugo when his alchemy is complete in certain figures like marius and cosette in certain scenes like that in the opening of les travailleurs la mer where déruchette writes the name of gilliatt in the snow on christmas morning but always there is certain note of strangeness discernible there well the essential elements then of the romantic spirit are curiosity and the love of beauty and it is only an illustration of these qualities that it seeks the middle age because in the ged atmosphere of the middle age there are unworke d sources of romantic effect of strange beauty to be won by strong imagination out of things unlikely or remote few probably now read madame staël 249 though it has its interest the interest which never quite fades out of work really touched with the enthusiasm of the spiritual adventurer the pioneer in culture it was published in 1810 to introduce to french readers new school of romantic school from beyond the rhine and it was followed years later by heine romantische schule at once supplement and correction both these books then connect romanticism with germany with the names especia lly of goethe and tieck and to many the project gutenberg of appreciations with an essay on style by walter horatio pater https the idea of romanticism is still inseparably connected with germany which in its quaint old towns under the spire of strasbur g or the towers of heidelber g was always listening in rapt inaction to the melodious fascinating voices of the middle age and which now that it has got strasbur g back again has i suppose almost ceased to exist but neither germany with its goethe and tieck nor england with its byron and scott is nearly so representative of the romantic temper france with murger and gautier and victor hugo it is in french literature that its most characteristic expression is to be found and that most closely derivative historically from such peculiar conditions ever reinforce it to the utmost although temperament has much to with the generation of the romantic spirit and 250 although this spirit with its curiosity its thirst curious beauty may be always traceable in excellent art traceable even in sophocles yet still in limited sense it may be said to be product of special epochs outbreaks of this spirit that is come naturally with particular when in men approaches towards art and poetry curiosity may be noticed to take the lead when men come to art and poetry with deep thirst intellectual excitement after long ennui or in reaction against the strain of outward practical things in the later middle age instance so that medieval poetry centering in dante is often opposed to greek and roman poetry romantic poetry to the classical what the romanticism of dante is may be estimated if we compare the lines in which virgil describes the from whose broken twigs flows the blood of polydorus not without the expression of real shudder at the ghastly incident with the whole canto of the inferno into which dante has expanded them beautifying and softening it meanwhile by sentiment of profound pity and it is especially in that period of intellectual disturbance immediately preceding dante amid which the romance languages define themselves at last that this temper is manifested here in the literature of provence the very name of romanticism is stamped with its true signification here we have indeed romantic world grotesque 251 even in the strength of its passions almost insane in its curious expression of them drawing all things into its sphere making the birds nay lifeless things its voices and messengers yet so penetrated with the desire beauty and sweetness that it begets wholly new species of poetry in which the renaissance may be said to begin the last century was classical age an age in which art and literature the elem ent of comely order was in the ascendant which passing away left hard battle to be fought between the classical and the romantic schools yet it is in the heart of this century of goldsmith and stothard of watteau and the siècle louis one of its central if not most characteristic figures in the modern or french romanticism really originates but what in the eighteenth century is but an exceptional phenomenon breaking through its fair reserve and discretion only at rare intervals is the habitual guise of the nineteenth breaking through it perpetually with feverishness an incomprehensible straining and excitem ent which all experience to some degree but yearning also in the genuine children of the romantic school to be énergique frais et those qualities of energy freshness comely order and often in murger in gautier in victor hugo instance with singular felicity attaining them it is in the terrible tragedy of rousseau in 252 fact that french romanticism with much else begins reading his confessions we seem actually to assist at the birth of this new strong spirit in the french mind the wildness which has shocked so many and the fascination which has influenced almost every one in the squalid yet eloquent figure we see and hear so clearly in that book wandering under the and among the vines of neuchâtel or vevey actually give it the quality of very successful romantic invention his strangeness or distortion his profound subjectivity his the cor makes all men in love with these je ne suis fait comme aucun ceux sus si je ne vaux pas mieux au moins je suis autre i am not made like any one else i have ever known yet if i am not better at least i am different these words from the first page of the confessions anticipate all the werthers renés obermanns of the last hundred years rousseau did but anticipate trouble in the spirit of the whole world and thirty years afterwards what in him was peculiarity the project gutenberg of appreciations with an essay on style by walter horatio pater https part of the general consciousness storm was coming rousseau with others felt it in the air and they helped to bring it down they introduced disturbing element into french literature then so trim and formal like our own literature of the age of queen anne in 1815 the storm had come and gone but had left in the spirit of young france the 253 ennui of an immense disillusion in the last chapter of edgar quinet revolution française work itself full of irony of disillusion he distingui shes two books senancour obermann and chateaubriand génie du christianisme characteristic of the first decade of the present century in those two books we detect already the disease and the obermann the irony refined into plaintive philosophy of indif ference chateaubriand génie du christianisme the refuge from tarnished actual present present of disillusion into world of strength and beauty in the middle age at an earlier rené and the free play of them in savage life it is to minds in this spiritual situation weary of the present but yearning the spectacle of beauty and strength that the works of french romanticism appeal they set positive value on the intense the exceptional and certain distortion is sometimes noticeable in them in conceptions like victor hugo quasimodo or gwynplaine something of terrible grotesque of the macabre the french themselves call it though always combined with perfect literary execution in gautier la morte amoureuse or the scene of the maimed of the player dead of the frost in his capitaine flowers of the yew it becomes grim humour in victor hugo combat of gilliatt with the or the incident with all its ghastly comedy drawn 254 out at length of the great gun detached from its fastenings on shipboard in rieze perhaps the most terrible of all the accidents that can happen by sea and in the entire episode in that book of the convention not less surely does it reach genuine pathos the habit of noting and distinguishing one own most intimate passages of sentiment makes one sympathetic begetting it must the power of entering by all sorts of finer ways into the intimate recesses of other minds so that pity is another quality of romanticism both victor hugo and gautier being great lovers of animals and charming writers about them and murger being unrivalled in the pathos of his scènes la vie jeunesse penetrating so finely into all situations which appeal to pity above all into the special or exceptional phases of such feeling the romantic humour is not afraid of the quaintness or singularity of its circumstances or expression pity indeed being of the essence of humour so that victor hugo does but turn his romanticism into practice in his hunger and thirst after practical justice justice which shall longer wrong children or animals instance by ignoring in stupid mere breadth of view minute facts about them yet the romanticists are antinomian too sometimes because the love of energy and beauty of distinction in passion tended naturally to become little bizarre plunging into the 255 middle age into the secrets of old italian story are we in the inferno are tempted to ask wondering at something malign in so much beauty over all care the refreshment of the human spirit by fine art manifests itself predominant sense of literary charm so that in their search the secret of exquisite expression the romantic school went back to the forgotten world of early french poetry and literature itself became the most delicate of the goldsmith work says of bertrand gaspard la and that peculiarly french gift the gift of exquisite speech argute loqui attained in them perfection which it had never seen before stendhal writer whom i have already quoted and of whom english readers might well know much more than they stands between the earlier and later growths of the romantic spirit his novels are rich in romantic quality and his other criticism partly personal are very curious and interesting illustration of the needs out of which romanticism arose in his book on racine and shakespeare stendhal argues that all good art was romantic in its day and this is perhaps true in stendhal sense that little treatise full of dry light and fertile ideas was published in the year 1823 and its object is to defend an entire independence and liberty in the choice and treatment of subject both in 256 art and literature against those who upheld the project gutenberg of appreciations with an essay on style by walter horatio pater https authority of precedent in pleading the cause of romanticism therefore it is the novelty both of form and of motive in writings like the hernani of victor hugo which soon followed it raising storm of criticism that he is chiefly concerned to justify to be interesting and really stimulating to keep us from yawning even art and literature must follow the subtle movements of that or understood by french not less than by german criticism which is always modifying men taste it modifies their manners and their pleasures this he contends is what all great workmen had always understood dante shakespeare molière had exercised an absolute independence in their choice of subject and treatment to turn always with that spirit yet to retain the flavour of what was admirably done in past generations in the classics we the problem of true romanticism dante he observes was the romantic poet he adored virgil yet he wrote the divine comedy with the episode of ugolino which is unlike the aeneid can possibly be and those who thus obey the fundamental principle of romanticism one by one become classical and are joined to that common league formed by men of all countries to approach nearer and nearer to perfection romanticism then although it has its epochs 257 is in its essential characteristics rather spirit which shows itself at all times in various degrees in individual workmen and their work and the amount of which criticism has to estimate in them taken one by one than the peculiarity of time or school depending on the varying proportion of curiosity and the desire of beauty natural tendencies of the artistic spirit at all times it must always be partly matter of individual temperament the eighteenth century in england has been regarded almost exclusively classical period yet william blake type of so much which breaks through what are conventionally thought the influences of that century is still noticeable phenomenon in it and the reaction in favour of naturalism in poetry begins in that century early there are thus the born romanticists and the born classicists there are the born classicists who start with form to whose minds the comeliness of the old immemorial types in art and literature have revealed themselves impressively who will entertain matter which will not go easily and flexibly into them whose work aspires only to be variation upon or study from the older masters is art decline my son they are always saying to the progressive element in their own generation to those who care that which in fifty years time every one will be caring on the other hand there are the born romanticists who start with an original 258 untried matter still in fusion who conceive this vividly and hold by it the essence of their work who by the very vividness and heat of their conceptio n purge away sooner or later all that is not organically appropriate to it till the whole effect adjusts itself in clear orderly proportionate form which form after very little time becomes classical in its turn the romantic or classical character of picture poem literary work depends then on the balance of certain qualities in it and in this sense very real distinction may be drawn between good classical and good romantic work but all critical terms are relative and there is at least valuable suggestion in that theory of stendhal that all good art was romantic in its day in the beauties of homer and pheidias quiet they now seem there must have been those who confronted them the first time excitement and surprise the sudden unforeseen satisfaction of the desire of beauty yet the odyssey with its marvellous adventure is more romantic than the iliad which nevertheless contains among many other romantic episodes that of the immortal horses of achilles who weep at the death of patroclus aeschylus is more romantic than sophocles whose philoctetes were it written now might figure the strangeness of its motive and the perfectness of its execution typically romantic while of euripides it may be said that his method in 259 writing his plays is to sacrifice readily almost everything else so that he may attain the fulness of single romantic effect these two tendencies indeed might be applied measure or standard all through greek and roman art and poetry with very illuminating results and an analyst of the romantic principle in art exercise would be more profitable than to walk through the collection of classical antiquities at the louvre or the british museum or to examine the project gutenberg of appreciations with an essay on style by walter horatio pater https collection of greek coins and note how the element of curiosity of the love of strangeness insinuates itself into classical design and record the effects of the romantic spirit there the traces of struggle of the grotesque even though here by sweetness in the sculpture of chartres and rheims the real sweetnes s of mind in the sculptor is often overbalanced by the grotesque by the rudeness of his strength classicism then means stendhal that younger enthusiastic band of french writers whose unconscious method he formulated into principles the reign of what is pedantic conventional and narrowly academical in art him all good art is romantic to who understands the term in more liberal sense it is the characteristic of certain epochs of certain spirits in every epoch not given to the exercise of original imagination but rather to the working out of refinements of manner on some 260 authorised matter and who bring to their perfection in this way the elements of sanity of order and beauty in manner in general criticism again it means the spirit of greece and rome of some phases in literature and art that may seem of equal autho rity with greece and rome the age of louis the fourteenth the age of johnson though this is at best an uncritical use of the term because in greek and roman work there are typical examples of the romantic spirit but explain the terms we may in application to particular epochs there are these two elements always recognisable united in perfect art sophocles in dante in the highest work of goethe though not always absolutely balanced there and these two elements may be not inappropriately termed the classical and romantic tendencies material the artist motives of inspiration are not yet exhausted our curious complex aspiring age still abounds in subjects aesthetic manipulation by the literary well by other forms of art the literary art at all events the problem just now is to induce order upon the contorted proportionless accumulation of our knowl edge and experience our science and history our hopes and disillusion and in effecting this to consciously what has been done hitherto the most part too unconsciously to write our english language the latins wrote theirs the 261 french write scholars should write appealing he may to precedent in this matter the scholar will still remember that if the style is the man it is also the age that the nineteenth century too will be found to have had its style justified by style very different alike from the baldness of an impossible queen anne revival and an incorrect incondite exuberance after the mode of elizabeth that we can only return to either at the price of an impoverishment of form or matter or both although an intellectually rich age such ours being necessarily an eclectic one we may well cultivate some of the excellences of literary types so different those that in literature in other matters it is well to unite many diverse elements may be that the individual writer or artist certainly is to be estimated by the number of graces he combines and his power of interpenetrating them in given work to discriminate schools of art of literature is of course part of the obvious business of literary criticism but in the work of literary production it is easy to be overmuch occupied concerning them in truth the legitimate contention is not of one age or school of literary art again st another but of all successive schools alike against the stupidity which is dead to the substance and the vulgarity which is dead to form notes 241 ainei palaion men oinon anthea d hymnon neôterôn translation praise wine its age but the song in first bloom pindar odes book
