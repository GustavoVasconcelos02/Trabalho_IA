know how to travel by ludicrous scene first single to baku i requested when my turn came at the window of the ticket ofﬁce at victoria station baku is that queried the ticket man in southern russia oh i see well we can not book further than warsaw russia warsaw will how much thank you my baggage having next been duly registered direct the capital of poland off i set to queenborough crossed over by the night boat to flushing and continued the following morning by express to berlin once in the russian train from the german capital one hears great deal of the terrors of the approaching russian and here i may relate rather an amusing incident which will prove what these terrors amount to in my sleeping car there happened to be some french merchants on their way to the fair of on perceiving my two riﬂes ammunition case and two cameras one of the gentlemen gratuitously informed that if i intended to proceed to russia i had better leave all these things behind or they would all be conﬁscated at the frontier i begged to differ and the frenchmen laughed boisterously at my ignorance and at what would happen presently in their imaginative minds they perceived my valued ﬁrearms being lost ever and predicted my being detained at the police station till it pleased les terribles cossacques to let proceed evidently shouted one of the frenchmen at the top of his voice this is your ﬁrst journey abroad we he added are great travellers we have been once before in russia you are great travellers i exclaimed with the emphasis very strong on the are and pretending intense admiration naturally the alliance was dragged into the conversation were i frenchman i might fare less badly the russians and the french were brothers but british subject hated englishman bringing into russia two riﬂes two revolvers six hundred cartrid ges twelve hundred photographic plates two cameras large case of scientiﬁc instruments all of which i would duly declare why russia was not england i should soon experience how englishmen were treated in some countries russians he exclaimed have not polished manner like the french ah non they are yet they respect and fear the french but not the english par exemple the frontier station of alexandrovo was reached and horde of terror passengers alighted from the carriages preceded and followed by bags portmanteaux and bundles of umbrellas which were hastily conveyed to the long tables of the huge inspection the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https two frenchmen had their belongings next to mine on the long counter and presently an ofﬁcer came they were french subjects and they had nothing to declare their elaborately decorated bags were instantly ordered open and turned upside down while the ofﬁcer searched with some gusto among the contents now spread on the table there was small pocket camera two packets of photographic plates some soiled handkerchiefs collars and cuffs box of fancy bottle of scent pair of embroidered pantouﬂes and lot of patent brass studs and cuf f links with the exception of the soiled linen everything was seized all were liable to duty and some sharp words of reprimand were used by the ofﬁcer to my now subdued french neighbours attempting to smuggle the ofﬁcer moved on to monsieur mournfully remarked the frenchman now you will be done i declared everything and produced special permit which had been very courteously given by the russian ambassador and handed it to the ofﬁcer having eagerly read it he stood with his heels together and gave military salute with profound bow he begged to point out to him all my luggage so that he could have it stamped without giving further trouble he politely declined to use the keys i handed him and thinking that i might feel uncomfortable in the hustling crowd of people he conveyed to chair in order that i might sit down i turned round to look at the frenchmen they had altogether collapsed i thought you said that englishmen were hated in russia and that they would conﬁscate all my things you see they have conﬁscated nothing i meekly remarked to the frenchmen when they returned to the sleeping car i not think that i have met with more polite customs ofﬁcials anywhere oui oui muttered the stouter frenchman who was evidently in mood to enter into further conversation et nous autres bêtes he soliloquized qui avons fait avec ces sauvages là on m tout pris même le papier lettr es he removed his coat and waistcoat and the many interesting patent appliances holding his tie in the correct it never he threw himself violent ly on the berth face towards the wall and grumbled the greater part of the night on the stupid mistake of the russian alliance on his return to france he would write letter to the ministre des affaires étrangères after long and tedious soliloquy he fortunately fell asleep warsaw on the vistula the old capital of poland was reached in the morning the quickest way to baku would have been to proceed to moscow and then by the petroleum express which leaves once week every tuesday baku unluckily i could not reach moscow in time and therefore decided to travel across russia by the next best route via kiev rostof f and the caspian the few hours i remained in warsaw were pleasantly spent in going about seeing the usual sights the palace and lovely lazienski gardens laid out in the old bed of the vistula the theatre on small island the auditorium being separated by water from the stage the lakes the saski ogrod and the krasinski public gardens the jewish quarter of the town the museums of ancient and modern art there are few cities in europe that are prettier cleaner and more animated than warsaw and few women in the world that have better claim to good looks than the warsaw fair sex the majority of women one sees in the streets are handsome and carry themselves well and their dress is in good taste never over it is in paris instance the whole city has ﬂourishing appearance with its tramways gay omnibuses electric light telephones and every modern convenience the streets are broad and cheerful in the newer parts of the city there are beautiful residences several of which i was told belong to british subjects settled there the russian military element is very strong poland love russia is not yet very great we walk along the main thoroughfares long string of cossacks in their long black felt cloaks and astrakan caps canter along they are remarkably picturesque and lot of soldiers poles are civility itself that is of course if one is civil to them historically the place is of extreme interest and the battleﬁelds of novogeor gievsk which played such an important part in the polish insurrection of 1831 and of grochowo where the poles were defeated are well worth visit at maciejowice too some ﬁfty miles up the vistula kosciuzko was made prisoner by the conquering russians warsaw is the third largest city in the russian empire and its favourable geographical position makes it one of the great pivots of eastern europe with navigable river and the great main railway lines to important centres such berlin vienna moscow petersbur g dantzig kiev and odessa with good climatic conditions and fertile soil with the pick of natural talent in art and science and the love enterprise that is innate in the polish character warsaw can not help being prosperous place the city has very extensive suburbs the best known to foreigners praga on the opposite bank of the vistula is connected with warsaw by two iron bridges warsaw itself is built on terraces one above another along the bank of the river but the main portion of the city stands on high undulating plain above there are over hundred catholic several greek churches and number of synagogues university schools of art academies fourteen monasteries and two nunneries there are few places in the world where the artisan or the common workman is more intelligent and artistic and where the upper classes are more reﬁned and soundly cultured than in warsaw with certain reﬂex of the neighbouring german commercial inﬂuence the place has become thriving manufacturing and trading centre machinery excellent pianos and other musical instruments carriages silver and boots and leather goods are manufactured and exported on large scale the tanneries of warsaw are renowned the world over and the warsaw boots are much sought after all over the russian empire their softness lightness and durability then there are great exports of wheat ﬂax sugar beer spirits and tobacco but time is short and we must drive to the station say what you will about the russian there is thing that he certainly knows how to he knows how to travel by rail one has great the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https ideas of the russian and his ways one is always reminded that he is barbarian that he is ignorant that he is dirty he is possibly barbarian in one way that he can differentiate good from bad real comfort from optical illusions or illusions of any other kind thing highly civilised people seem generally unable to this is particularly noticeable in russian railway travelling probably the best and cheapest in the world to begin with when you take ticket it entitles you to seat numbered and reserved that nobody can appropriate more tickets are sold than correspond with the accommodation provided in the train this does away entirely with the leaving one umbrella business to secure seat or scattering one belongings all over the carriage to ensure the whole compartment to one self to the inconvenience of other travellers then ﬁrst second and passenger s are provided with sleeping accommodation the sleepin g accommodation especially ﬁrst and passengers consists of wide and long berth wherein they can turn round at their will if they please not of short narrow bunk in which even lean person has to lie edgewise or roll out in the continental sleeping car which discomfort rather than accommodation preposterous extra charges have to be paid above the fare then too in the latter the compartments are so small so ridiculously ventilated that after one night spent boxed in especially if another passenger shares the same cabin one feels sick some hours and in the one has room to turn round nor space to put one legs the lighting the less said the better these faults exist in our own and the continental compartments but the barbarian russian knows and does better the line being of very broad gauge his class carriages are extremely spacious and very high with large windows and efﬁcacious ventilators and there is plenty of room everywhere to spread one limbs in every direction there is probably less gilding about the ceiling fewer catches about the doors not so much polished wood nor ghastly coloured paper nor but very convenient are found instead the seats are ample and serviceable of plain handsome red velvet devoid of the innumerable striking feature of british and continental decoration movable cushions are provided one back and head there are bright electric lights burning overhead and adjustable reading lights in the corners of the carriage corridor runs along the whole train and few kopeks passengers can at any moment procure excellent tea caviare sandwiches or other light refreshments from attendants now the bedding itself the russian who is ever practical man carries his own couple of sheets blankets and small pillow custom inﬁnitely cleaner and more sensible than sleeping in dubious smelly blankets of which one does not know who has used them before nor when they were washed last but if passengers wish by paying rouble two shillings night to the guard bedding is provided by the railway there is ﬁne lavabo at the end of each carriage with shampoo hot and cold water etc here too by asking the guard towels are handed over to those passengers who have not brought their own here i may relate another amusing incident unable to get at my towels packed in my registered baggage and ignorant of the russian language i inquired of polyglot what was the russian word towel so that i could ask the guard one palatiensi said he and i repeated palatiensi palatiensi palatiensi so to impress the word well upon my memory having enjoyed good wash and shampoo and dripping all over with water i rang the guard and sure enough when the man came i could not recollect the word at last it dawned upon that it was palatinski and palatinski i asked of the guard to my surprise the guard smiled graciously and putting on modest air replied palatinski niet paruski i not speak latin i speak only russian and the more i repeated palatinski putting the inﬂection now on one syllable then on the other to make him understand the more ﬂattered the man seemed to be and modestly gave the same answer this was incomprehensible to until my polyglot came to my assistance you know what you are asking the guard he said in convulsions of laughter yes i am asking towel you are not and he positively went into hysterics palatinski means you speak latin how can you expect russian to speak latin look how incensed the poor man is at being mistaken latin scholar ask him palatiensi and he will run towel the man did run on the magic word being pronounced and duly returned with nice clean palatiensi which however was little use to i had by this time nearly got dry by the natural processes of dripping and evaporation one or two other similar incidents and the extreme civility one meets from every one while travelling in russia passed the time away pleasantly until kiev one of the oldest cities of russia was reached chapter ii protecting and and wherein lies the strength of famous catacombs of theodosius and eneration of the dnieper luminous otka and good tradition tells us that kiev was founded before the christian and its vicissitudes have since been many and varied it has at all times been considered one of the most important ecclesiastical centres of russia not indeed the most particularly since vladimir the protecting saint of the city preached christianity there in 988 this being the ﬁrst time that the religion of christ had been expounded in russia century and half before that time in 822 kiev was the capital city of the state and remained such till in 1240 it was captured by the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https held it 81 years the lithuanian s came next and remained in possession 249 years until 1569 then poland possessed it until the year 1654 when it became part of the russian empire kiev has the name of being very intellectual city somehow or other intellectuality and trade not seem to go together and although the place boasts of military school and arsenal theological colleges university school of sacred picture painters and great many scientiﬁc and learned societies we ﬁnd that none of these are locally put to any marked practical use except the picture painting the images being disposed of very rapidly and comparatively high prices all over the country hardly any religious resorts are great commercial centres the people of these places being generally conservative and bigoted and the ruling priestly classes devoting too much attention to idealism to embark in commercial enterprise which leaves little time praying agriculture and horticulture are encouraged and give good results the priests make of their religion and they probably know that there is nothing more disastrous to religion in laymen than rapid by trade or otherwise with money comes education and with education too powerful light thrown upon superstition and idolatry it is nevertheless possible even probable that in the ignorance of the masses in the fervent and unshaken conﬁdence which they possess in god the czar and their leaders may yet lie the greatest strength of russia it must not be forgotten that or half uneducated masses are probably the weakness of most other civilised nations some business on small scale however is transacted at the various fairs held in kiev such the great fair at the beginning of the russian year there are many sugar reﬁneries the staple industry of the country and next come leather tanneries worked leather machinery spirits grain and tobacco wax candles are manufactured in huge quantities and in the monastery there is very ancient religious books peter the great erected fortress here in most commanding spot it is said to contain guns special pass has to be obtained from the military authorities to be allowed to enter it not so much because it is used an arsenal but because from the high tower most excellent panoramic view is obtained of the city the neighbourhood and the course of the river down below but kiev is famous above all its monastery the near which the two catacombs of theodosius and antony attract over three hundred thousand pilgrims every year the ﬁrst catacomb contains bodies of saints the other eighty and the revered remains are stored in plain wood or silver cofﬁns duly labelled with adequate inscriptions the huge monastery itself bears the appearance of great wealth and has special accommodation pilgrims many pilgrims are said to receive board and lodging yearly in the monastery these are naturally pilgrims of the lower classes enormous riches in solid gold silver and jewellery are stored in the monastery and are daily increased by devout gifts but let us visit the catacombs the and bearded priests at the entrance of the catacomb present to each pilgrim memento useful and much valued wax candle which one lights and carries in one hand down the steep and slippery steps of the subterranean passages all along the procession halts before mummiﬁed and most unattractive bodies buzzing of prayers being raised by the pilgrims when the identity of each saint is explained by the priest conducting the party the more devout people stoop over the bodies and kiss them fervently all over voluntarily and gladly disbursing in return the privilege all such small cash may lie idle in their pockets down and down the crowd goes through the long winding cold damp passages devoid of the remotest gleam of ventilation and where one breathes air so thick and foul that it sticks to one clothes and furs one tongue throat and lungs several hours after one has emer ged from the catacombs into fresh air again yet there are hermit monks who spend their lives under ground without ever coming up to the light and in doing so become bony discoloured ghastly creatures with staring inspired eyes and hollow cheeks half demented to all appearance but much revered and respected by the crowds their further on the pilgrims drink holy water out of small cup made in the shape of cross with which the liquid is served out from larger vessel the expression of beatitude on their faces they sip of the holy water and their amazing reverence all they see and are told to are quite extraordinary to watch and are quite refreshing in these dying days of idealism supplanted by growing and less poetic atheistic notions the scowl i received from the priest when my turn came and he lifted the tin cross to my lips is still well impressed upon my mind i drew back and politely declined to drink there was murmur of strong disapproval from all the people present and the priest grumbled something but really what with the fetid smell of smoke the air and the high scent of religious people ever have pungent odour peculiar to whether holy or otherwise was about the very beverage that would have ﬁnished up at that particular moment glad i was to be out in the open air again driving through the pretty gardens of kiev and to enjoy the extensive view from the high cliffs overlooking the winding dnieper river handsome suspension bridge joins the two banks the river is navigable and during the spring ﬂoods the water has been known to rise much twenty feet the city of kiev is situated on high undulating ground some 350 feet above the river and up to 1837 consisted of the old town podol and petchersk to which years later were added shulyavka solomenka kurenevka and lukyanovka the city being divided into eight districts the more modern part of the town is very handsome with wide streets and ﬁne stone houses of good architecture whereas the poorer abodes are mostly constructed of wood in all the other cities of russia there are in kiev great many churches over seventy in all the oldest of which is the cathedral of sophia in the centre of the town built early 1037 on the spot where the petchenegs were defea ted the previous year by yaroslof it is renowned its superb altar its valuable mosaics and the tombs of russian next in importance is the church of the assumption containing the bodies of seven saints conveyed here from constantinople at night the cross borne by the statue of vladimir erect ed on high the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https the dnieper is lighted up by electricity this luminous cross can be seen miles and miles all over the country and the ef fect is most impressive and weird from kiev i had to strike across countr y and the trains were naturally not quite so luxurious the express trains on the main line but still the carriages were of the same type extremely comfortable and spacious and all the trains corridor trains the next important city where i halted few hours was kharkof f in the ukraine an agricultural centre where was raised in huge quantities and sugar manufactured from it wheat was plentiful and good cattle sheep and horses were bred the population was mostly of cossacks of the don and little russians the industries of the place were closely akin to farming agricultural implements were manufactured there were yards soap and candle factories mills brandy distilleries leather tanneries cloth manufactories and brick kilns the horse fairs at kharkof f are patronised by buyers from all parts of russia but to outsiders the city is probably better known the early cradle of nihilistic notions although quite handsome city with ﬁne streets and remarkably good shops kharkof f has nothing special to attract the casual visitor and in ordinary times few hours are more than sufﬁcient to get fair idea of the place with railway ticket punched so often that there is very little left of it we proceed to rostof f where we shall strike the main line from moscow to the caucasus here is comparatively new unlike the shambling lesser western cities of the united states of america with plenty of down fences and empty tin cans lying everywhere the streets are unpaved and the consequent dust blinding the drinking saloons in undue proportion to the number of houses and people in undue proportion to the population differs from the intoxication of other liquors in one particular instead of dead drunk it leaves the individuals you see disgusting number of these folks lying about the streets and motionless spread ﬂat on their faces or backs by everybody some sleep it off and if not run over by droshki eventually go home some sleep it on and are eventually conveyed to the graveyard and nobody seems any the wiser except of course the people who not drink bad votka to excess rostof f stands at the head of the delta of the don position of great strategical importance where of course the russians have not failed to build strong fortiﬁcations these were begun early now very active yards are found here and extensive caviare factories leather wool corn soap ropes and tobacco are also exported and the place apart from its military importance is steadily growing commercially the majority of shops seem to deal chieﬂy in american and german made agricultural implements machinery and tools and in ﬁrearms and knives of all sizes and shapes the place is not particularly clean and certainly hot dusty and most unattractive one is glad to get into the train again and steam away from it we get further south towards the caucasus the country grows more barren and hot the dust is appalling but the types of inhabitants at the little stations become very picturesque the geor gians are very ﬁne people and the armenians too in appearance at least the station sheds along the dusty steppes are guarded by soldiers presumably to prevent attacks on the trains and one gets near the caspian one begins to see the wooden pyramids over oil wells and long freight trains of petroleum carried in iron cylindrical tanks the wells get more numerous we go along the stations more crowded with petroleum tanks we are nearing the great naphtha wells of baku where at last we arrive having travelled from tuesday to sunday afternoon or ﬁve days except few hours halt in kiev kharkof f and rostof the b aku il w ells the railway fare from warsaw the whole journey was fully covered by note and mind you could have been done cheaper if one chose to travel by slower trains on less direct route chapter iii the wells are native baku maiden tower and amir of mail service to persia on the mercury and caucasus boundary steamers so many accounts are heard of how one registered baggage in russia generally arrives with locks smashed and minus one most valuabl property and how unpunctual in arriving luggage is and how few passengers escape without having their pockets picked before reaching their by the way had his pockets picked at the station of mineralnya i was somewhat anxious to see my belongings again and fully expected to ﬁnd that something had gone wrong with them much to my surprise on producing the receipt at the very handsome railway terminus all my portmanteaux and cases were instantly delivered in excellent the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https caspian sea steamers persia leave baku on sunday and tuesday at midnight there was ﬁerce sand storm raging at the time and the steamer had returned without being able to land her passengers at their destination i decide d to wait till the tuesday there is plenty to interest one in baku i will not describe the eternal ﬁres described so often by other visitors nor tell how naphtha was tapped the ﬁrst time at this place and how in 1886 one particular well spouted oil with such tremendous force that it was impossible to check it and it deluged good portion of the neighbourhood year later in 1887 another fountain rose to height of 350 there are myriads of other lesser fountains and wells each covered by wooden shed like slende r pyramid and it is common occurrence to see big spout of naphtha rising outside and high above the top of the wooden shed now from one well now from another the process of bringing naphtha to the surface under ordinary circumstances is simple and effective metal cylinder is employed that has valve at the lower end allowing the tube to ﬁll while it descends and closing automatically when the tube is full and is being raised above ground and emptied into pits provided the purpose the naphtha then under goes the process of reﬁnement there are at the present moment hundreds of reﬁneries in baku the residue and waste of naphtha are used fuel being very much cheaper than coal or wood the greater number of wells are found few miles out of the town on the balakhani peninsula and the naphtha is carried into the baku reﬁneries by numerous pipe lines the whole country round is however impregnated with oil and even the sea in one or two bays near baku is coated with inﬂammable stuff and can be ignited by throwing lighted match upon it at night this has weird effect apart from the oil the european nothing to fascinate the traveller in the native city persian in type with ﬂat roofs one above the other and the hill top crowned by castle and the mosque of shah abbas constant murders occur the native population consists mostly of armenians and persians cotton saffron opium silk and salt are exported in comparatively small quantities machinery grain and dried fruit constitute the chief imports the baku bay protected it is by small island in front of it affords safe anchorage shipping it has good and is the principal station of the russian ﬂeet in the caspian since baku became part of the russian empire in 1806 the harbour has been very strongly fortiﬁed the most striking architectural sight in baku is the round maiden tower by the water edge from the top of which the lovely daughter of the khan of baku precipitated herself on to the rocks below because she could not marry the man she loved the most depressing sight in baku is the vegetation or rather the strenuous efforts of the lover of plants to procure verdure at all costs in the gardens it is seldom one lot to see trees and plants look more pitiable notwithstanding the unbounded care that is taken of them the terriﬁc heat of baku the hot winds and are deadly enemies to vegetation nothing will grow one does not see blade of grass nor shrub anywhere except those few that are artiﬁcially brought up the sand is most trying it is so ﬁne that the wind forces it through anything and one tables one chairs one bed are with it the tablecloth at the hotel specklessly white when you begin to dine gets gradually yellower at sight and by the time you are half through your dinner the waiter has to come with brush to remove the thick coating of dust on the table these are the drawbacks but there is an air of prosperity about the place and people that is distinctly pleasing even although one may not share in it there is quite fair foreign community of business people and their activity is very praiseworthy the people are very hospita hospitable when they not talk of naphtha they drink sweet champagne in unlimited quantities but what else could they everything is naphtha here everything smells of naphtha the steamers the railway engines are run with naphtha the streets are greasy with naphtha of monotony of the place is broken by ﬁres of gigantic proportions on the premises of the destruc tion to property on such occasions is immense the ﬁres spreading with incalculable rapidity over an enormous area and the difﬁculty of extinguishing them being considerable when i was in baku the amir of bokhara was being entertained in the city guest of the government his suite was quartered in the grand hotel he had taken his usual tour through russia and trouble had been spared to impr ess the amir with the greatness of the russian empire he had been given very good time and i was much impressed with the pomp and cordiality with which he was treated neither the governor nor any of the other ofﬁcials showed him the usual f manner which in india instance would have been used towards an asiatic potentate whether conquered by us or otherwise they dealt with him if he had been european which the amir seemed much ﬂattered he had striking face with black beard and moustache and dark tired eyes that clearly testiﬁed to russian hospitality i went to see him off on the steamer which he kept waiting several hours after the advertised time of departure he dolefully strode on board over grand display of oriental rugs while the military brass band provided the occasion played russian selections every body ofﬁcial wore decorations even the captain of the merchant ship who proudly bore upon his chest brilliant star bokhara distinction received from the amir on his outward journey navigating him safely across the the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https mir of b okhara leaving b aku to return to his c ountr y the amir suite was very picturesqu some of the men wearing long crimson velvet gowns embroidered in gold others garments all had white turbans the snapshot reproduced in the illustration shows the amir accompanied by the governor of baku just stepping on board there is regular mail service twice week in summer from april to the end of october and once week in winter on the caspian between baku and enzeli in persia the russian government paying subsidy to the kavkas and mercury steam navigation company the purpose of conveying passengers mails and in the event of war troops into persia and back there are also number of coasting steamers constantly plying between the various ports on the caspian both on the russian and persian coast the hurricane having abated there was prospect of fair voyage and the probability of landing at enzeli in persia so when the tuesday came i went on board the old rickety less than years old which was to convey to that port she was one of the caucasus ﬂeet and very dirty she was too it is perhaps right to mention that the ﬁrst time in russia purposeless rudeness and insolence came to my notice on the part of the ticket ofﬁcials of the mercury line they behaved like stupid children and were absolutely incompetent to the work which had been entrusted to them they were somewhat surprised when i took them to task and made them sit up having found that they had played the fool with the wrong man they instantly became very meek and obliging it is nevertheless great pity that the mercury company should employ men of this kind who some aim of their own annoy passengers both foreign and russian and are disgrace to the company and their country on board ship the captain ofﬁcers and stewards were extremely civil nearly all the captains of the caspian steamers were norwegian or from finland and were jolly fellows the cabins were very much inhabited so much so that it was difﬁcult to sleep in them at all insects so voracious and in such quantities and variety were in full possession of the berths that they gave one lively night it is possible mortals to have fortunately the journey was not long one and having duly departed at midnight from baku i reached lenkoran the next day with its picturesque background of mountains and country this spot is renowned tiger our next halt was at astara where there were number of wooden sheds and drinking saloons dreadful place important only because on the boundary line formed by the river of the same name we landed here numb er of police ofﬁcers who were met by deputation of some ﬁfty men who threw their arms round their necks and in turn lustily kissed them on both cheeks it was funny sight when we got on board again after couple of hours on shore the wind rose and we tossed about considerably another sleepless night on the living mattress in the bunk and early in the morning we reached the persian port of enzeli chapter iv the port of roublesome special permit of the golden our stock came drive to native shops and foreign increase in and russian british governor salare swiss one calls enzeli port pour façon parler persia has harbours at all on the caspian sea enzeli or astrabad the three principal landing places on the persian coast have shelter ships which have to lie good distance out at sea while passe ngers and cargo are transhipped by the company steam launch rough rowing boats in very rough weather it is impossible to effect landing at all is most frequen t occurrence on the treacherous reaching one journey end one has to go all the way back to the starting point and begin afresh there are people who have been compelled to take the journey four or ﬁve times before they could land until the violent storms which often rage along the persian coast had completely subsided and allowed the ﬂimsy at enzeli to come out to meet the steamers lying about mile outside we had passengers on board who had been unable to land on the previous journey and were now on their second attempt to set foot in persia we were rolling good deal when we cast anchor and after waiting some hours we were informed that it was too rough the steam to come out the captain feared that he must put to sea again the wind was rising and he was afraid to remain so near the coast two rowing boats eventually came out and with some considerable exertion of the rowers succeeded in getting near the steamer i immediately chartered one and after good deal of and banging and knocking and crackling of wood alongside the steamer my baggage and the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https transhipped into the boat off we rowed towards the shore getting drenched each time that the boat dipped her nose into the sea the narrow entrance of the enzeli bay is blocked by the water is here very shallow only about six feet deep riding on the top of the breakers was quite an experience and we occasionally shipped good deal of water we however landed safely and had to pay pretty dearly the convenience the boatmen not run the risk of going out nothing and when they take every advantage of passengers who employ them i was fortunate to get off by giving backshish of few tomans dollars but there are people who have been known to pay three four and even ﬁve pounds sterling to be conveyed on shore here too thanks to the civility of the persian ambassador in london i had special permit my ﬁrearms instruments and met with the greatest courtesy from the belgian and persian ofﬁcers in the customs it is necessary to have one passport in order duly visé by the persian consul in london or else delay might occur at enzeli there is lighthouse at enzeli the customs buildings and small hotel from this point lagoon the has to be crossed either by the small or by rowing boat there seemed to be some uncertainty about the departure of the launch and i had good deal of luggage i preferred the latter way eight powerful men rowed with all their might at the prospect of good backshish and we sped along at good pace on the placid waters of the lagoon in big stretches of open water now skirting small islands occasionally through narrow canals the banks of which were covered with high reeds and heavy tropical confused untidy vegetation the air was still and unmoved screened it was on all sides by vegetation the sailors sang monotonous cadence and the boat glided along some three hours until we arrived at the mouth of the piri river hardly wide enough couple of boats to go through simultaneously and so shallow that rowing was longer practicable the men jumped off tied the towing rope that hung from the mast to their belts and ran along the banks of the piri river the water of which was almost stagnant an hour or so later we suddenly came upon number of boats jammed together in the miniature harbour of piri pool of putrid water few feet in circumference the boat gradually approached path still separated from you by thick wide layer of ﬁlthy mud wound its way to the few miserable the above few trays of grapes some persian bread some earthenware pottery of the cheapest kind are displayed in the shop that is all of the on landing at enzeli one hears so much of that one gets to imagine it big important place it is moreover practically the ﬁrst really typical persian place at which one touches the expectations are high upon arrival there one heart sinks into one boots and one boots sink deep into black stinking mud one takes very yet much too from the boat on to what one presumes to be terra ﬁrma with boots clogged and heavy with ﬁlth hundred people like ravenous birds of prey yelling in your ears and picking your pockets if they have chance with your luggage being mercilessly dragged in the mud with everybody demanding backshish on all sides tapping you on the shoulder or pulling your coat one lands in real persia in the country of iran one does not travel pleasure nor is there any pleasure in travelling study and interest yes there is plenty of both everywhere personally i invariably make up my mind when i start the east that matter what happens i will on account get out of temper and this must never in all my travels tried to the tantalising extent that it was in the country of the shah the persian lower in places where they have come in contact with intolerable there is nothing that they will not to annoy you in every possible way to extort backshish from you in only one way persians in this respect differ from other orientals the others usually try to obtain money by pleasing you and being useful and polite whereas the persian adopts the quicker if not safer method of bothering you and giving you trouble to such an unlimited degree that you are compelled to give something in order to get rid of him and in country where redress can be obtained from the police where laws not count and where the lower classes are corrupt and unscrupulous they are in the more civilised parts of persia these remarks not apply to the parts where few or europeans have been the only way to save one self from constant worry and repressed bad one to make up one mind at once to what extent one is prepared to be imposed upon and leave the country after that is to say if one does not wish to adopt the only other and more attractive alternative of inﬂicting summary justice on of the natives one meets great an exertion to be sure in so hot climate they say that persia is the country that our stock came from it is quite possible and if so we are indeed to be congratulated upon havin g morally improved so much since or the persians to be condoled with on their sad degeneration the better classes however are very different we shall see later personally i adopted the ﬁrst method suggested above the easier of the two and i deliberately put by what i thought was fair sum to be devoted exclusively to extortion on leaving the country several months later much to my astonishment i found that i had not been imposed upon half much i expected although i had stayed in persia double the time i had inten ded maybe this can be accounted by my having spent most of my time in parts not so much frequented by europeans indeed if the persian is the perﬁdious individual he is we have to great extent only ourselves to blame making him so keeping my temper under control and an eye on my belongings i next hired carriage to convey to the town of resht seven miles distant in damp heat that made one clothes moist and unpleasant upon road muddy to such an extent that the wheels sank several inches in it and splashed the passenger all over we galloped through thick vegetation and patche s of agriculture and entered the city of resht through the narrow winding streets of the bazaar we slowed down somewhat in some places the carriage almost touching the walls of the street on both sides the better houses possess verandahs with banisters painted blue while the walls of the buildings are generally white one is struck by the great number of shoe shops in the bazaar displaying true persian shoes with pointed toes by the brass and copper vessel shops the ancient and extremely graceful shapes of the vessels and amphoras being to this date faithfully preserved and the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https pleasing still to the eye are the fruit shops with huge trays of water cucumbers ﬁgs and heaps of grapes the latter are nevertheless not so very tasty to the palate and not compare with the delicate ﬂavour of the italian or spanish grapes somewhat incongruous and yet more numerous than truly persian shops are the european stores with cheap glass windows displaying inside highly dangero kerosene lamps badly put together tin goods soiled enamel tumblers and plates silvered glass balls ceiling decoration and the vilest oleographs that the human mind can devise only matched by the vileness of the frames small lookin play an important part in these displays and occasionally hand tinned provisions wine and liquor shops are numerous but unfortunate is the man who may have to depend upon them his food the goods are the remnants of the oldest stocks that have gradually drifted unsold down to baku and have eventually been shipped over the persian market where people not know any better resht is the chief city in the ghilan province ghilan trade in is about in the hands of russia while or even less is still retained by england goods this can not well be helped there is direct route from great britain to resht and all british goods must come through bagdad tabriz or baku the two ﬁrst routes carry most of the trade which consists principally of shirtings prints cambrics mulls nainsooks and which are usually put down of turkish origin whereas in reality they come from manchester and are merely mainly from constantinople by native ﬁrms either in direct trafﬁc or in exchange goods received one has heard great deal of the enormous increase in trade in persia during the last couple of years or so the increase has not been in the trade itself but in the collection of customs dues which is now done in regular and business like fashion by competent belgian ofﬁcials instead of by natives to whom the various collecting stations were formerly farmed out it will not be very easy the british trader to compete successfully with the russian in northern persia that country being geograp hically in such close proximity can transport her cheaply made goods at very low cost into iran also the russian government allows enormous advantages to her own traders with persia in order to secure the persian market and to develop her increasing industrial progress which british traders not enjoy still considering all the difﬁculties british trade has to contend with in order to penetrate particularly into ghilan it is extraordinary how some articles like white manchester shirtings enjoy practically monopoly being of better quality than similar goods sent by russia austria hungary germany italy or holland loaf sugar which came at one time almost entirely from france has been cut out by russian sugar which is imported in large quantities and eventually ﬁnds its way all over persia it is of inferior quality but very much cheaper than sugar of french manufacture and is the chief russian import into ghilan tobacco comes principally from turkey and russia in going on with our drive through the bazaar we see it sold in the tiny tobacco shops where it is tastily arranged in heaps on square pieces of blue paper by the side of russian and turkish cigarettes persian w restling and now the resht hotels here is an armenian style from the balcony signs and gesticulations and shouts in english french and russian endeavour to attract the passer youth even rushes to the horses and stops them in order to induce the traveller to alight and put up at the hostelry but after long discussion on we go and slowly wind our way through the intricate streets crowded with men and women and grumbling and making some remark one goes by at one point circle of people squatting in the middle of road round pile of water melons at huge slices of which they each bit lustily kept us waiting some time till they moved themselves and their melons out of the way the carriage to pass further on soldier or two in rags lay sleeping ﬂat on the shady side of the road with his pipe kalian and his sword lying by his side boys were riding wildly on donkeys and frightened women scramble d away or ﬂattened themselves against the side walls of the street while the hubs of the wheels shaved and greased their ample black silk or cotton trousers made in the shape of sacks and the horses hoofs splashed them all over with mud the women faces were covered with white cloth reaching down to the waist here too in china the double basket arrangement on long pole swung across the shoulders was much used conveying loads of fruit and vegetables on men shoulders t least picturesque of all were the people of the strong sex in short pleated all over in the skirt one gets glimpse of picturesque roof with cylindrical column upon it and at last we emer ge into lar ge quadrangular square with european buildings to the west side little further the british ﬂag ﬂies gaily in the wind above consulate then we come upon larger building the palace of the governor who to save himself the trouble and expense of having sentries at the entrances had representations of soldiers with drawn swords painted on the wall they are not all represented wearing the same uniform one would expect with guard of that kind but variety sake some have red coats with plenty of gold braiding on them and blue trousers the others blue coats and red trousers one could not honestly call the building the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https but in its unrestored condition it is quite picturesque and quaint it possesses spacious verandah painted bright blue and two windows at each side with elaborate ornamentations similarly coloured red and blue white ﬂag with the national lion in the centre ﬂoats over the palace and an elaborate castellated archway with repetition of the persian lion on either side stands in front of the main entrance in the square of the palace so also four useful kerosene the telegraph ofﬁce is to the right of the palace with pretty garden in front of it the most important political personage living in resht is his excellency salare afkham called mirza fathollah khan one of the richest men in persia who has yearly income of some twenty thousand pounds sterling he owns huge house and great deal of land round resht and is much respected his talent and kindly manner he was formerly minister of the customs and posts of all persia and his chest is blaze of russian turkish and persian decorations of the highest class bestowed upon him by the various sovereigns in recognition of his good work he has private secretary abal kassem khan the son of the best known of modern persian poets and himself very able man who has travelled all over asia turkestan and europe persia is country of disappointments there is general belief that the swiss are splendid keepers let give you my experience of the hotel at resht kept by swiss can this be the swiss hotel i queried to myself the driver pulled up in front of an appallingly dirty ﬂight of steps there seemed to be one about and after going through the greater part of the building i eventually came across persian servant who assured that it was the proprietor when found received with an air of condescension that was entertaining he led to room which he said was the best in the house on inspection the others i agreed with him were decidedly not better the hotel had twelve bedrooms and they were all disgustingly ﬁlthy true enough each bedroom had more beds in it than one really needed two or even three in each bedroom but was sufﬁcient to assure one self that it was out of the question to make use of any of them i counted four different coloured hairs of disproportionate lengths and texture on one in my room leaving little doubt that less than four people had laid their heads on that pillow before and the pillow of the other bed was so black with dirt that i should imagine at least dozen consecutive occupants of that couch would be low estimate indeed the sheets blankets and towels we had better draw veil i therefore preferred to spread my own bedding on the ﬂoor and slept there the hotel boasted of three large in which few stuffed birds and case or two of mutilated butterﬂies couple of german oleographs which set one teeth on edge and dusty stamped cotton hangings formed the entire decoration to give one an one never lost long one stayed was informed before dinner that the proprietor was formerly the shah cook after dinner one felt very very sorry the poor shah and more so one self having put up at the hotel but there was other place in resht and i stuck to my decision that i would never get angry so i stood all patiently the next day i would start teheran one talks of persian extortion but it is nothing to the example offered to the natives by euro peans in persia the charges at the hotel were exorbitant one paid much per day one would at the very ﬁrst hotel in london new york or paris such the carlton the waldorf or ritz only here one got absolutely nothing it except very likely an infectious disease i did in walking on the ﬁlthy matting while taking my bath some invisible germ bored its way into the sole of my right foot and caused good deal of trouble several weeks after animal life in all its varieties was plentiful in all the rooms previous to starting on the long drive to the capital i had to get some meat cooked use on the road but it was so putrid that even when i ﬂung it to famished pariah dog he refused to eat it and all this mind you was inexcusable because excellent meat chickens eggs vegetables and fruit can be purchased in resht mere song the average price of good chicken instance being about 5d to whole sheep costing some eight or ten shillings i think it is only right that this man should be exposed so to put other travellers on their guard not so much his overchar ges when travelling one does not mind if one is properly treated but his impudence in furnishing provisions that even dog would not eat had it not been that i had other provisions with i should have fared very badly on the long drive to teheran it may interest future travellers to know that the building where the hotel was at the time of my visit august 1901 has now been taken over ﬁve years by the russian bank in order to open branch of their business in resht and that the hotel itself i believe has now shifted to even less palatial quarters the imperial bank of persia has some years had branch in resht and until 1901 was the only banking establishment in the town chapter v visit to the head ts the drive to russian concession of the teheran stormy caspian and unsafe great menzil detour in the capital employed in the construction of the english notions of and speculator offer of the road resht is an odious place in every way it is it were the port said of persia here the scum of armenia of southern russia and of turkestan stagnates unable to proceed on the long and expensive journey to teheran one can not go out walk without being accosted by any number of impostors often in european clothes who cling like leeches and proceed to try to interest you in more or less plausible swindles one meets great many people too who are on the look out lift in one carriage to the persian capital i paid quite an interesting visit to near relation of the shah who was the guest of the local head mullah the approach to the mullah palace was not attractive i was conveyed through narrow passages much out of repair until we arrived in front of staircase at the foot of which lay in the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https in pairs shoes of all sizes prices and ages patiently waiting their respective owners inside the house great many people were outside in the courtyard some squatting down and smoking kalian which was passed round after puff or two from one person to the other care being taken by the last smoker to wipe the mouthpiece with the palm of his hand before handin g it to his neighbour others loitered about and conversed in low tone of voice mullah received at the bottom of the staircase and led up stairs to large room with glass windows cane chairs and austrian glass candelabras ther were number of mullahs in their long black robes white or green sashes and large turbans sitting round the room in semicircle and in the centre sat the high mullah with the young prince by his side they all rose when i entered and i was greeted in digniﬁed yet very friendly manner chair was given next to the high mullah and the usual questions about one family the vicissitudes of one journey one age one plans the accounts of what one had seen in other countries were duly gone through it was rather curious to notice the interest displayed by the high mullah in our south african war he seemed anxious to know whether it was over yet or when it would be over also how was it that big nation like great britain could not conquer small nation like the boers it is easier an elephant to kill another elephant i replied than him to squash mosquito you not think said the mullah that england is now an old nation tired and old to ﬁght nations are like individuals they can ﬁght in must rest in old age she has lived in glory and luxury too long glory and luxury make nations weak persia is an example yes there is much truth in your sayin gs we are tired and worn we have been and are still fast asleep in consequence but maybe the day will come when we shall wake up much refreshed we are old enough to learn but not to die yet he was sorry that england was in trouble tea or rather sugar with some drops of tea on it was passed in tiny little glasses with miniature perforated tin spoons then another you drink spirits and wine you smoke you would make good mussulman possibly but not probably in your travels you ﬁnd the people generally good or bad taking things all round in their badness i ﬁnd the people usually pretty good how much does your king give you to go about seeing foreign countries the king gives nothing i go at my own expense this statement seemed to take their breath away it was bad enough man to be his own government to strange land but to pay the journey one self why it seemed to them too preposterous words they had quite an excited discussion about it among themselves the persian idea being that every man must sponge upon the government to the utmost extent the young prince hoped that i would travel his guest in his carriage to teheran unfortunately however i had made other arrangements and was unable to accept his invitation my visit ended with renewed salaams and good wishes on their part my welfare on the long journey i was about to undertake i noticed that with the exception of the prince who shook my hand warmly the mullahs bowed over and over again but did not touch my hand now the business visit at the post station after good deal of talk and an unlimited consumption of tea it had been arranged that landau with four post horses to be changed every six farsakhs at each post station and large van without springs also with four horses luggage should convey to teheran so little luggage is allowed inside one carriage that an additional fourgon is nearly always required one is told that large packages can be forwarded at small cost by the postal service and that they will reach teheran soon after the passengers but unhappy is the person that tries the rash experiment there is nothing to guarantee him that he will ever see his luggage again in persia golden rule while travelling that may involve some loss of time but will avoid endless trouble and worry in the end is never to let one luggage go out of sight one is told that the new teheran road is russian enterprise and therefore quite reliable and so it is but not so the company of transportation which is in the hands of natives the ﬁrm of bagherof f brothers which is merely subsidized by the russian road company every one knows in 1893 the russians obtained concession to construct from via resht to kasvin an extension to hamadan and the purchase of the road from kasvin to teheran which was already in existence nominally the concession was not granted to the russian government is generally believed in to private compagnie et transport en perse which nevertheless is mere of government enterprise and is backed by the russian government to mean degree the company headquarters are in moscow and in persia the chief ofﬁce is at kasvin here it may be well to add that if this important concession slipped out of our hands we have only ourselves to blame we can in way accuse the russians of taking advantage of us but can only admire them knowing how to take advantage of good opportunity we had the opportunity ﬁrst it was offered us in the ﬁrst instance by persia which needed loan of paltry sixty million francs or little over two million pounds sterling the concession was offered guarantee the loan but we usual temporised and thought it over and the people who did not know what they were arguing eventually absolutely refused to have anything to the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https scheme the russians had the next offer and jumped at it was natural in people well versed in persian af fairs and well able to foresee the enormous possibilities of such an undertaking it was beyond doubt from the very to people absolutely ignorant and mentally the concession apart from its political importance was most excellent ﬁnancial investment not only would the road be most useful the transit of russian goods to the capital of persia and from there all over the country but military purposes it would prove invaluable maybe its use in the latter capacity will be shown sooner than we in england think of course to complete the scheme the landing at enzeli must still be improved so that small ships may enter in safety and land passengers and goods each journey without the unpleasant alternative which we have seen of having to return to one point of departure and begin again two or three or even four times one gentleman i met in persia told that on one occasion the journey from baku to him the space of days fourgons on the r ussian r oad between r esht and t eheran the caspian is stormy the greater part of the year the water shallow prote ction from the wind exists on any side and wrecks considering the small amount of navigati on on that sea are extremely frequent we have seen there are not more than six feet of water on the bar at enzeli but with jetty which could be built at very considerable expense it probably will be some day and dredger kept constantly at work enzeli could become quite possible harbour and the dangers of long delays and the present risks that await passengers and goods if not absolutely avoided would at least be minimised to an almost insigniﬁcant degree the navigation of the lagoon and stream presents difﬁculty and the russians have already obtained the right to widen the mouth of the at enzeli in conjunction with the concession of the road the road was very easy to make being mostly over ﬂat country and rising to great elevation feet being the highest point it follows the old caravan track nearly all the way the only important detour made by the new road being between paichinar and kasvin to avoid the high kharzan or kiajan which the old track went considering the nature of the country it crosses the new road is good one and is well kept three large bridges and small ones have been spanned across streams and ravines the longest being the bridge at menzil 142 yards long from resht via deschambe bazaar to kudum the road strikes due south across country from kudum altitude 292 feet to rudbar 665 feet the road is practically along the old track on the bank of the kizil uzen river which from its source ﬂows ﬁrst in direction and then turns at menzil almost at right angle towards the changing its name into seﬁd rud the white river some miles after passing rudbar the river has to be crossed by the great bridge to reach menzil which lies on the opposite side of the stream from menzil to kasvin the russian engineers had slightly more trouble in constructing the road good deal of blasting had to be done to make the road sufﬁciently broad wheeled trafﬁc then came the important detour we have seen from paichinar to kasvin so that practically the portion of the road from menzil to kasvin is new road altogether via mala ali and kuhim the old track being met again at the village of agha baba the width of the road averages feet in difﬁcult places such along ravines or where the road had to be cut into the rock it is naturally less wide but nowhere under fourteen feet the gradient averages to at very few points however it is steep 1 in if the hill portion of the road is excepted where being in it has very sharp angles light railway could be laid upon it in surprisingly short time and at considerable expens the ground having been made very hard nearly all along the road the capital of employed in the construction of the road was subscribed in the following manner shares of rubles each or rubles original capital subscribed in moscow rubles debentures taken by the russian government and further rubles on condition that rubles additional capital were subscribed which was at once done principally by the original shareholders the speculation had from the very beginning prospect of being very successful even merely considered trade prospect which the british government capitalist and merchant did not seem to grasp but which was fully appreciated by the quicker and more russian ofﬁcial and trader any person can not help admiring the russian government the insight enterprise and sound statesmanship with which it lost time in supporting the scheme discarded by us worthless and this it did not by pompous speeches and temporising promises to which we have so long been accustomed but by supplying capital in hard cash the double purpose of enhancing to its fullest extent russian trade and of gaining the strategic advantages of such an enterprise which are too palpable to be referred to again so it was that while we in england relied on the everlasting and notion that russia would never have the means to take up the loan we are bankrupt country with resources and government with credit and cash we found ourselves left and the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https having lost an opportunity which will never present itself again and which will eventually cost us the loss of northern persia if not of the whole of persia is only too once set her foot or even both feet on persian soil now tries to keep out other owing to her geographical position she can with effort and order to enhance her youthful but solid and industries and trade in the case of the teheran road the only one it must be remembered leading with any safety to the persian capital it is theoretically open to all nations practically russian goods alone have chance of being conveyed by this route owing to the prohibitive customs duties exacted in russia on foreign goods in transit persia russia is already indirectly reaping great proﬁts through this law especially on machinery and heavy goods that have option and must be transported by this road there is other way by which they can reach teheran on wheels but the chief and more direct proﬁt of the enterprise itself is derived from the high tolls which the russian company with the authorisation of the persian government has established on the road trafﬁc in order to reimburse the capital paid out and interest to shareholders the road tolls are paid at resht and at intermediate stations if travellers not start from resht and amount to 4 krans 1s 8d each pack animal whether it be camel horse mule or donkey with four horses the usual conveyance hired between resht and teheran pays toll of less than 17 2d carriage with 3 horses 12 6 2 84 1 horse 42 fourgon or luggage van 4 horses 0 10d passengers are charged extra and above these tolls so that landau or victoria instance actually pays 8s the right of using the road and fourgon with one servants

carriages and this weight must be in small packages one is compelled to hire second conveyance fourgon which can carry 650 lbs every pound exceeding these weights is charged at the rate of two shillings every 13½ lbs of luggage the luggage is weighed with great accuracy before starting from resht and on arrival in teheran care is taken to exact every to which the company is entitled on luggage fares and much inconvenience and delay is caused by the persian ofﬁcials at the scales it is advisable the traveller to be present when the luggage is weighed to prevent fraud it may be noticed that to travel the 200 miles the distance from resht to teheran the cost without counting incidental expenses tips amounting to some or more landau 11167plus toll 180 13 47 fourgon 10010plus toll 1132 1114 0 total 18 7 which is somewhat high journey of only 72 to 80 hours this strikes one all the more when one compares it with the journey of several thousand miles in the greatest of luxury from london across holland germany russia and the caspian to enzeli which can be covered easily by three notes every one knows the road from to kasvin and teheran was opened wheel trafﬁc in january i am told that in the road was persian speculator offered the sum of day to be paid in cash every evening the contract of the tolls the offer was most emphatically refused the daily tolls even at that time amounted to between and in these last three years the road has developed in most astounding manner and the receipts besides being now considerably greater are constantly increasing the

industry of cultivation and export of governor and water coachman white halting places on the ef fects of abundant we have seen how the road was made now let us travel on it in the hired landau and four horses driven by coachman whose locks of hair protrude on either side of the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https neck and match in colour his black astrakan spherical brimless headgear like all good persians he has much pleated frockcoat that once was black and is now of various shades of green over it at the waist he displays most elaborate silver belt and yet another belt of leather with profusion of cartridges stuck in it and revolver why he did not run over people or more we galloped through the narrow streets of resht town is incomprehensible to the outside horses almost shaved the walls on both sides and the of the old landau ditto that he did not speaks volumes the ﬂexibility and suppleness of persian men women and children of whom stuck tight against the walls in order to escape being trampled upon or crushed to death one got mere glimpses at the speed one went the corners of the streets too bore ample testimony to the inaccuracy of drivers in gauging distances and so did the hubs and of the all twisted and staved in by repeated collisions it is with great gusto on the part of the drivers but with certain amount of alarm on the part of the passenger that one carriage chips off corner after corner of the road one turns them and one gets to thank providence making houses in persia of mud instead of solid stone or bricks one heart gets lighter when we emer ge into the more sparsely inhabited districts where ﬁelds and heavy vegetation line the road now very wide and more or less straight here the speed is greatly increased the coachman making ample use of long stock whip in persia one always travels full gallop after not very long we pull up to disburse the road toll at wayside collecting house there are great many caravans waiting camels mules donkeys horsemen fourgons whose owners are busy counting hard silver krans in little piles of 10 krans toman equivalent to dollar which payment they can not proceed post carriages have precedence over everybody and we are served at once receipt is duly given the money paid and we are off again the coachman is the cause of good deal of anxiety on the chance of handsome backshish he has indulged in copious advance libations of rum or votka or both the vapours of which are blown by the wind into my face each time that he turns round and breathes or speaks that this was case of the horses leading the coachman and not of man driving the horses i have personally not the shade of doubt the wretch instead of minding his horses hung backwards the whole way from the high box yelling i not know what at the top of his voice and making signiﬁcant gestures that he was still thirsty coachmen of all countries invariably are we ran full speed into caravans of donk eys scattering them all over the place we caused ﬂocks of frightened sheep to stampede in all directions and only strings of imperturbable camels succeeded in arresting our reckless ﬂight they simply would not move out of the way every now and then i snatched furtive glance at the scenery the moisture of the climate is so great and the heat so intense that the vegetation of the whole of ghilan province is luxuriant not picturesque mind you there is such superabundance of vegetation the plants so crammed together one on the top of the other it were all untidy fat with moisture and of such deep coarse tones that they give the scenery heavy leaden appearance instead of the charming beauty of more delicate tints of less tropical vegetation we go through deschambe bazaar place noted its fairs here you have high hedges of reeds and hopelessly entangled shrubs there your eyes are rested on big stretches of agriculture corn endless paddy ﬁelds of rice and cotton long rows of mulberry trees to feed silkworms upon their leaves silk is even one of the chief industries of ghilan its excellent quality was at one time the pride of the province the export trade of dried cocoons has been particularly ﬂourishing of late and although prices and the exchanges have ﬂuctuated the average price obtained them in resht when fresh was from 20½ krans to 22½ krans the kran being equivalent to about ﬁvepence the cocoon trade had until recently been almost entirely in the hands of armenian french and italian buyers in resht but now many persian merchants have begun to export bales of cocoons direct to marseilles and milan the two chief markets silk an export duty of 5 per cent on their value being imposed on them by the persian government the cocoons are made to travel by the shortest routes via the caspian baku batum and the black sea the year 1900 seems to have been an excep tionally good year the production and export of cocoons the eggs the production of silkworms are chieﬂy imported by levantines from asia minor gimlek and brussa and also in small quantities from france according to the report of churchill at resht the quantity of cocoons exported during that year showed an increase of some lbs above the quantity exported the previous year 1899 and comparison between the quantity exported in 1893 and 1900 will show at glance the enormous apparent increase in the export of dried cocoons from ghilan 1893 1900 it must however be remembered that the value given 1893 may be very incorrect large meadows with cattle grazing upon them wheat ﬁelds vegetables of all sorts vineyards all pass before my eyes in kaleidoscope ﬁne country indeed farmers plenty of too much of it in abundance within stone throw next to the silk worms rice must occupy our attention being the staple food of the natives of ghilan and constituting one of the principal articles of export from that province the cultivation and the export of rice from ghilan have in the last thirty years become very important and will doubt be more so in the near future when the mass of jungle and marshes will be cleared and converted into cultivable land the governor of resht is showing great energy in the right direction by cutting new roads and repairing old ones on all sides which ought to be of great beneﬁt to the country the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https persia remember it is not easy to learn anything accurately and persian statistics unwise is the man who attaches any importance to them much i would like to quote statistics i can not refrain from thinking that statistics are hundredfold better than haphazard inaccurate ones and this rule i must certainly apply to the export of rice from ghilan to europe principally russia during 1900 and will limit myself to general remarks extensive tracts of country have been cleared of reeds and useless vegetation and converted into paddy ﬁelds the natives irrigating the country in primitive fashion it is nature that is mostly responsible if the crops are not ruined year after year the thoughtless inhabitants with their natural laziness doing little more than praying allah to give them plenty of rain instead of employing the more practical if more laborious expedient of artiﬁcially irrigating their country in some efﬁcient manner which they could easily from the streams close at hand perhaps in addition to this the fact that ever to be purchased in persia may also account to certain extent the inability to afford paying it in 1899 instance rain failed to come and the crops were insufﬁcient even local consumption which caused the population good deal of suffering but 1900 fortunately surpassed all expectations and was an excellent year rice well cocoons we go through country then through handsome forest with wild boars feeding peacefully few yards from the road about every six horses of the carriage and those of the fourgon following closely behind are changed at the well the driver who leaves us after carefully removing his saddle from the box and the harness of the horses he has to ride back to his point of departure with his horses he expects present of two krans more if he can get so does the driver of the fourgon two krans is the recognised tip each driver and one gets some sixteen or seventeen each vehicle two or if you have two conv eyances resht and teheran one ﬁnds it quite sufﬁcient drain on one exchequer one gets towards kudum where one strikes the seﬁd river we begin to rise and the country gets more hilly and arid we gradually leave behind the oppressive dampness which suggests miasma and fever and begin to breathe air which though very hot is drier and purer we have risen 262 feet at kudum from 77 feet the altitude of resht and we travel now in direction following the stream upwards we keep getting higher the elevation at rustamabad being already 630 feet we leave behind the undulating ground covered with thick forests and come to barren hills that get more and more important we go on we might almost say that the country is becoming quite mountainous with few shrubs here and there and scenery of moderate beauty any one accustomed to greater mountains but quite wildly beautiful the ordinary traveller we then get to the region of the grey olive groves the trees with their contorted branches and pointed leaves what becomes of the olives they are exported to europe ﬂourishing trade i am told one bumps great deal in the carriage the springs are not of the best and are hidden in rope bandages to keep them from falling apart the road too is not yet like billiard table the doors of the landau rattle continuously the metal fastenings having long disappeared and being replaced by bits of string one travels incessantly baked in the sun by day and chilled by the cold winds at night trying to get little sleep with one head dangling over the side of the carriage one legs cramped and all one bones aching but this is preferable to stopping at any of the on the road whether russian or persian which are ﬁlthy beyond words and where one is mercilessly swindled should one however be compelled to stop anywhere it is preferable to go to thoroughly persian place where one meets at least with more courtesy and where one is imposed upon in more modest and less aggressive way than at the russian places it must however be stated that the russian places are usually in charge of persians or else in the hands of inferior russian subjects who try to make all they can out of their exile in the lonely stations i occasionally halted glass of tea at the persian and in one of them very amusing incident happened showing the serious effects that hallucination may produce on minded person i had got off the carriage and had carried into the my camera and also my revolver in its leather case which had been lying on the seat of the carriage at my previous halt having neglected this precaution my camera had been tampered with by the natives the lenses had been removed and the eighteen plates most of them already with pictures on were inside exposed to the light and thrown about with their slides in the sand so to avoid repetition of the occurrence and to prevent probable accident i brought all into the khana room and deposited the lot on the raised mud portion along the wall seating myself next to my property i ordered tea and the attendant with many salaams explained that his ﬁre had gone out but that if i would wait few minutes he would make some fresh chah i consented he inquired whether the revolver was loaded and i said it was he proceeded to the further end of the room where turning his back to he began to blow upon the ﬁre and i being very thirsty sent another man to my fourgon to bring bottle of the imprisoned gases of the soda which had been lying the whole day in the hot sun had so expanded that when i removed the wire the cork went off with loud report and unfortunately hit the man in the shoulder blade by association of ideas he made so certain in his mind that it was the revolver that had gone off that he absolutely collapsed in under the belief that he had been badly shot he moaned and groaned trying to reach with his hand what he thought was the wounded spot and called his son he felt he was about to die we supported him and gave him some water and reassured him but he had turned pale death what have i done to you that you kill he moaned pitifully but good man you have blood ﬂowing languid hopeless glance at the ground where he had fallen and sure enough he could ﬁnd blood he tried to see the wound but his head could not revolve to sufﬁciently wide arc of circle to see his shoulder so in due haste we removed his coat and waistcoat and shirt and after slow but careful keen examination he discovered that not only there were marks of ﬂowing blood but trace whatever of bullet hole in any of his garments even then he was not the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https two small mirrors were sent which by the aid of sympathising friend he got at proper angles minutely to survey his whole back he eventually recovered and was able to proceed with the brewing of tea which he served with terribly trembling hand on the rattling saucer under the tiny little glass it was very narrow escape from death sahib he said in wavering voice it might have been the revolver there is nothing like backshish in persia to heal all wounds whether real or otherwise and he duly received an extra handsome one in persia the traveller is particularly struck by the number of princes one encounters on the road this is to certain extent to be accounted by the fact that the word khan which follows great many persian names has been translated mainly by ﬂattering french authors into the majestic but incorrect word prince in many cases the sufﬁx of khan is an equivalent of lord but in most cases it is more than our nominal esquire i met on the road two fellows one old and very digniﬁed the other young and who spoke little french he informed that they were both princes he called his friend monsieur le prince mon ami and himself monsieur le prince moi which was rather amusing he informed that he was high customs ofﬁcial and displayed towards his fellow countrymen on the road great many qualities that revealed very mean native indeed the elder one wore carpet slippers to which he had not know an enormous pair of golden spurs he was now returning from russia he was extremely and seemed very much annoyed at the behaviour of his companion he begged to believe that not all men in persia were like his friend and i quite agreed with him we travelled great portion of the road together and the old fellow was extremely civil he was very well informed on nearly all subjects and had belonged to the army he pointed out to the important sights on the road such mount janja to the east after passing rudbar 665 the road is mostly in narrow gorges between mountains it is rocky and arid with hardly any vegetation the river has to be crossed by the new bridge handsome and solid structure and we arrive at the village of menjil or menzil the russian is the most prominent structure otherwise all is desert and barren grey and warm reddish tints abound in the landscape and only few stunted olive groves relieve the scenery with some vegetable life chapter vii menzil and the historical alamut low olcanic genuine case of sitting caravan of remains of volcanic old the city of misfortun governor palace and palatial rest and kanats the marvellous they are strategically perhaps menzil should be mentioned in connection with the terriﬁc winds which coming from the and from the south seem to meet here and blow with all their might at all times of the year the traveller is particularly exposed to them directly above the river course on crossing the bridge menzil is celebrated these winds which are supposed to be the worst in all persia but unpleasant they may be to any one who has not experienced worse they are merely gentle breezes compared instance with the wind storms of the tibetan plateau to the east there is very mountainous region the biwarzin yarak range or averaging from to further north peak of and of the janja the high salambar on the historical mt alamut the old state prisons were formerly to be found but were afterwards removed to ardebil from menzil we have left the seﬁd river altogether and we are now in very mountainous region with singular low plateau in the centre of an extensive alluvial plain traversed by the road we cross the shah rud or river of the king and at paichinar with its russian we have already reached an altitude of from this spot the road proceeds through narrow valley through country rugged and much broken up distinctly volcanic and quite pictu resque it is believed that coal is to be found here perhaps one of the prettiest places we had yet come to was lovely shady spot with veteran green trees all round while the horses were being changed i was asked by the man to go and inspect man who was the poor fellow was wrapped up in many blankets and seemed to be suffering greatly he had very high fever and his was genuine case of smallpox next to him quite unconcerned were number of persian travellers who had halted here refreshments they were squatting on their heels knees wide apart and arms balanced resting above the elbow on their characteristic sitting posture of all asiatics very comfortable it is too when you learn to balance yourself properly and it leaves the free use of one arms the kalian was being passed round usual and each had of sugared tea i was much attracted by large caravan of handsome mules the animals enjoying the refreshing shade of the trees they had huge saddles ornamented with silver pommels and rings and covered over with carpets variegated cloth or carpet or red and green leather hung on either side of the animals behind the saddles the bridle and bit were richly ornamented with shells and silver or iron knobs the few mud houses in the neighbourhood had ﬂat roofs and were not sufﬁciently typical nor inviting enough closer internal inspection we are now on tributary of the on the new road instead of the old caravan track which we have left since paichinar the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https country becomes more interesting and wild we go on in the undoubtedly volcanic formation of the mountains one notices large patches of sulphurous earth on the with dark red and black baked soil above it over that all along the range curious ﬂuted rocks lower down the soil is saturated with sulphurous matter which gives it rich dark blue tone with greenish tints in it and bright yellow patches the earth all round is of warm burnt sienna colour intensiﬁed when i saw it by the reddish soft rays of dying sun it has all the appearance of having been subjected to abnormal heat the characteristic shape of the peaks of the range is conical and great many channels and holes are noticeable in the rocky sides of these sugar mountains is frequently the case in mountains of volcanic formation we rise higher and higher in through rugged country and we then go across an intensely interesting large basin which must at previous date have been the interior of an exploded and now collapsed volcano this place forcibly reminded of similar sight on grander scale site of the mountain on the main island of nippon in japan after that enormous mountain was blown to atoms and disappeared some few years ago huge basin was left like the bottom part of gigantic cauldron the edges of which bore ample testimony to the terriﬁc heat that must have been inside before the explosion took place in the persian scene before us of much older date the basin corroded it evidently was by substances heated to very high temperature and by the action of forming gases had been to certain extent obliterated by the softening actions of time and exposure to air the impression was not so violent and marked the one received at bandaisan which i visited only few days after the explosion but the various characteristics were similar in the basin was solitary hut which rejoiced in the name of kort these great commotions of nature are interesting but to any one given to sound reﬂection they are almost too big the human mind to grasp they impress one they almost frighten one but give reposeful real pleasure in gazing upon them such less disturbed scenery does the contrasts in colour and shape are too violent too crude to please the eye the freaks too numerous to be comprehensible at glance here we have ditch with sides perfectly evidently by lava or some other hot substance which has ﬂowed through further on big splashes of violent red and great variety of warm browns the eye roams from one spot to the other trying to understand exactly what has taken job which occupies good deal of one time and attention one drives through and which would occupy longer time and study than gallop through in post landau can af ford at agha baba we were again on the old track quite ﬂat now and during the night we galloped easily on broad road through uninteresting country till we reached kasvin 185 versts from resht kasvin in the province of irak is very ancient city which has seen better days has gone through period of misfortune and will in future probably attain again certain amount of prosperity it is situated at an altitude of feet at the telegraph ofﬁce an elevation which gives it very hot but dry healthy climate with comparatively cool nights the town is handsome square in form enclosed in wall with towers the governor palace is quite impressive with ﬁne broad avenue of green trees leading from it to the spacious kasvin this is by far the best on the road to the persian capital with large rooms clean enough persia and with every convenience cooking one food above the doorway the persian lion with the sun rising above his back has been elaborately painted and picturesque pool of stagnant water at the bottom of the steps is doubt the breeding spot of mosquitoes and ﬂies of which there are swarms to make one life misery making kanat the palatial the governor palace mosque or two and the convenient mahommedans being barred there is nothing particular to detain the traveller in kasvin one hears that kasvin occupied at one time larger area than teheran the remains of this magnitude are certainly still there the destruction of the city they say has been due to many and varied misfortunes earthquakes and famines in particular have played an important part in the history of kasvin and they account the many streets and large buildings in ruins which one ﬁnds such the remains of the suﬁ palace and the domed mosque the city dates back to the fourth century but it was not till the sixteenth century that it became the seat of shah tamasp it prospered the royal city until the time of shah abbas whose wisdom made him foresee the dangers of maintaining capital too near the caspian sea isfahan was selected the future capital from which time kasvin began its decline in 1870 famine devastated the town to considerable extent but even previous to that great portion of the place had been left to decay so that one sees large stretches of ruined houses all round the neighbourhood and in kasvin itself the buildings are mostly very few indeed boasting of an upper ﬂoor the pleasant impression one receives on entering the city is mostly caused by the quantity of verdure and vegetation all round one of the principal things which strike the traveller in persia especially on nearing big city is the literal myriads of curious conical heaps with pit in the centre that one notice s running across the plains in long interminable rows generally towards the mountains these are the kanats the astounding aqueducts with which persia is bored in all directions under ground the canals that lead fresh water from the distant springs to the cities to the villages and to irrigate the ﬁelds the ancient process of making these kanats has descended unchanged to the modern persian who the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https marvellous he chooses to use his conveying water where nature has not provided it i watched some men making one of these kanats they had bored vertical hole about three feet in diameter over which wooden windlass had been erected one man was working at the bottom of the shaft by means of buckets the superﬂuous earth was gradu ally raised up to the surface and the hole bored further the earth removed in the excavation is then embanked all round the aperture of the shaft when the required depth is attained tunnel is pierced mostly with the hands and small shovel in horizontal direction and seldom less than four feet high two feet wide just big enough to let the workman through then another shaft has to be made ventilation sake and to raise to the surface the displaced earth miles of these kanats are thus bored with air shafts every ten to twenty feet distant in many places one sees thirty forty ﬁfty parallel long lines of these aqueducts with several thousand shafts dotting the surface of the ground near ancient towns and villages one ﬁnds great many of these kanats dry and disused at present and nearly everywhere one sees people at work making fresh ones how to get water is one of the great and serious questions in the land of iran near kasvin these kanats are innumerable and the water carried by them goes through the streets of the city with holes here and there in the middle of the road to draw it up these holes are serious danger to any one given to walking about without looking where he is placing his feet it is mainly due to these artiﬁcial water that the plain of kasvin otherwise arid and oppressively hot has been rendered extremely fertile there are great many gardens with plenty of vineyards abound producing excellent stoneless grapes which when dried are mostly exported to russia pomegra nates water cucumbers and cotton are also grown excellent horses and camels are bred here kasvin being the house it were between resht and teheran and an important city in itself is if only in reﬂected feel the good effects of having through communication to the caspian and the capital made so easy by the completion of the russian road the silk and rice export trade bagd ad has gone up during the last two years and in the fertile plain in which kasvin lies agriculture is beginning to look up again although not quite so much in the resht district which is naturally the ﬁrst to reap beneﬁt from the development of northern persia the chief manufactures of kasvin are carpets kind of coarse called kerbas velvet brocades and which are much appreciated by persians there is large bazaar in which many cheap european goods are sold besides the more picturesque articles of local manufacture from strategical point of view kasvin occupies position not to be overlooked guarding it does the principal entrance from the south into the ghilan province chapter viii four thousand feet above obnoxious luggage strange ﬁgure of an african he saved an englishman eheran of bachelors in teheran britisher in foreign servant question few hours rest to give one aching bones chance of returning into their normal condition and position and amidst the profound salaams of the servants we speed away towards teheran 130 versts more according to the russian road measurement about 108 miles we gallop on the old wide and ﬂat road on which the trafﬁc alone diverts one strings of donkeys of camels every now and then splendid horse with swaggering rider we are travelling on the top of the plateau and are keeping at an altitude slightly above feet distant mountains lie to the north otherwise there is absolutely nothing to see vegetation worth mentioning everything dry and barren now and then miles and miles apart comes quadrangular or rectangular castellated mud wall enclosing cluster of fruit trees and vege table gardens then miles and miles again of dreary barren country were it not the impudence of the to is nothing to warn the traveller that one is approaching the capital of the persian empire and one ﬁnds one self at the gate of the city without the usual excite ment of perceiving from distance high tower or dome or steeple or fortress or landmark of some sort or other to make one enjoy the approach of one journey end abdulabad feet kishslak feet sankarabad feet sulimaneh feet are the principal places and main elevations on the road but from the place the incline in the plateau tends to descend very gently teheran is at an altitude of feet six farsakhs from teheran where we had to change horses an individual connected with the transport company made himself very obnoxious and insisted on accompanying the carriage to teheran he was picturesquely attired in brown long coat and displayed revolver with leather belt of cartridges he was cruel to the horses and nuisance to the coachman he interfered considerably with the progress of the carriage and made himself unbearable in every possible way when i stopped at glass of tea he actually removed wheel of the carriage which we had considerable difﬁculty in putting right again and he pounded the coachman on the head with the butt of his revolver in order far i could understand that he should be induced to go with him in the backshish that the driver would receive at the end of the stage all this provided some entertainment until we reached the teheran gate only half mile more and i should be at the hotel but man proposes and the persian disposes the carriage and fourgon were driven into large courtyard the horses were unharnessed all the luggage removed from the fourgon and carriage and deposited in the dust primitive scale was produced and slung to the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https and each article weighed and weighed over again so to take up much of one time possible various expedients to impose upon having failed i was allowed to proceed new fourgon and fresh horses being provided the journey of half mile more the obnoxious man jumping ﬁrst on the box so to prevent being left behind at last the hotel was reached and here another row arose with profusion of blows among crowd of beggars who had at once collected and disputed among themselves the right of unloading my luggage strange ﬁgure appeared on the scene powerful african black coal and less than six foot two in height he sported huge wooden club in his hand which he whirled round in most dangerous manner occasionally landing it on people skulls and backs in sonorous fashion the crowd vanished and he now gently possible removed the luggage from the fourgon and conveyed it into the hotel the obnoxious man now hastily descended from his seat and demanded backshish what oh sir intervened persian gentleman present this man says he has annoyed you all the way but he could not make you angry he must have backshish he makes living by annoying travellers in contrast to this low depraved parasite the african black seemed quite striking ﬁgure scamp if you like yet full of character he was dervish with drunken habits and ﬁerce nature when under the inﬂuence of drink but with many good points when sober on one occasion an englishman was attacked by crowd of persians and was in danger of losin g his life when this man with considerable bravery not to speak of his inseparable mallet which he used freely went to the rescue of the sahib and succeeded in saving him this act of courage he has ever since been supported by the charity of foreigners in teheran he unfortunately spends all his earnings in drink and can be very coarse indeed in his songs and imitations which he delights in giving when under the inﬂuence of liquor he hangs round the hotel crying out yahu yahu when cry quite pathetic and weird especially in the stillness of night there are two hotels in teheran and several european and armenian restaurant the english hotel is the best dream of cleanliness nor luxury nor boasting of cuisine which would remain impressed upon one mind except its elaborate monotony quite comfortable place by comparison with the other european hotels of persia the beds are clean and the proprietress tries hard to make people comfortable more interesting than the hotel itself was the curious crowd of people whom one saw at the dinner table i remember sitting down one evening to dinner with nine other people and we represented less than ten different nationalities the tower of babel sank almost into insigniﬁcance compared with the variety of languages one heard spoken all round and one polyglot abilities were tested to mean extent in trying to carry on general conversation one pleasant feature of these dinners was the amount of talent and that prevailed in the company and the absolute lack of distinction of class or social position side by side one saw distinguished diplomat conversing with the shah automobile driver and noteworthy english member of parliament on friendly terms with an irish gentleman of the telegraphs burly jolly dutchman stood drinks all round to members of the russian and english banks alike and french just arrived discussed her prospects with the hotel proprietress the shah and favourite composer and pianist came frequently to enliven the evenings with some really magniﬁcent playing and by way of diversion some wild belgian employees of the derelict sugar used almost nightly to cover with insults notable chevalier whose thick skin was amazing then one met one was told had come out of jail mine prospectors and foreign generals of the persian army occasionally there was extra excitement when an engagement or wedding took place when the parties usually adjourned to the hotel and then there was unlimited consumption of beer nominally glycerine really let explain beer does not stand hot climate unless large percentage of glycerine is added to it and of highly champagne and french wines château this and château caspian origin being almost teetotaller myself this mixed not the mixed interesting to study and what particularly struck was the bonhomie the real and manly but thoughtful genial friendliness of men towards one another irrespective of class position or condition except of course in the cases of people with whom it was not possi ble to associate the hard mean almost brutal jealousy spite the petty rancour of the usual man instance does not exist at all in persia among foreigners or english people on the contrary it is impossible to ﬁnd more hospitable more gentlemanly polite folks than the britishers one meets in persia of course it must be remembered the type of britisher one ﬁnds in persia is specially talented enterprising and individual whose ideas have been greatly broadened by the study of several foreign languages which in many cases have taken him on the continent several years in his youth furthermore lacking entirely the ruling look down upon the native idea so prevalent in india he is thrown much in contact with the persians adopting from them the courteous manner and form of speech which is certainly more pleasant than the absurd rudeness of the notion which generally makes us hated by most orientals the britisher in persia with few exceptions is charming person simple and unaffected and ready to be of service if he can he is not aggressive and in fact surprisingly suave this abnormal feature in the british character is partly due to the climate hot but very healthy and to the exile to which the briton has to reconcile himself years to come indee d persia is an exile painful one bachelor particularly woman society which at all times helps to make life sweet and pleasant is absolutely lacking in persia european women are scarce and mostly married or about to get married the native women are kept in strict seclusion one never sees native woman except heavily veiled under her chudder much less can european talk to her the laws of persia are so severe that anything in the shape of ﬂirtation with persian lady may cost the life the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https or romeo or both and if life is spared blackmail is ever after levied by the police or by the girl parents or by servants in teheran all good citizens must be indoors by nine at night and any one found prowling in the streets after that hour has to deal with the police in the european quarter this rule is overlooked in the case of foreigners but in the native city even europeans found peacefully walking about later than that hour are taken into custody and conveyed before the magistrate who satisﬁes himself to the man identity and has him duly escorted home there are permanent amusements of any kind in teheran an occasional concert or dance but theatres there is comfortable club where people meet and drink and play cards but that is all social sets of course exist in the teheran foreign community there are the telegraph set the bank the legations there is an uncommon deal of social etiquette and people are most particular regarding calls dress and the number of cards left at each door it looks somewhat incongruous to see men in their black and silk tall hats prowling about the streets with mud up to their knees if wet or blinded with dust if dry among strings of camels mules or donkeys but that is the fashion and people have to abide by it there are missionaries in teheran american and english but fortunately they are not permitted to make converts the english russian and belgian communities are the most numerous then the french the dutch the austrian the italian the american taking things all round the europeans seem reconciled to their position in life devoid of any very great excitement and partaking rather of the nature of vegetation yet with certain charm in once people get accustomed to it but one has to get accustomed to it ﬁrst the usual servant question is very serious one in teheran and is one of the chief troubles that europeans have to contend with ther are armenian and persian servants and there is little to choose between the two servants accustomed to european ways are usually bad lot and most unreliable but in all fairness it must be admitted that to great extent these servants have been utterly spoilt by europeans themselves who did not know how to deal with them in suitable manner i repeatedly noticed in teheran and other parts of persia that people who really understood the persian character and treated subor dinates with consideration had most excellent my mind the most intelligent and in the spoke very highly of them chapter ix seat of the kajar family square of the top of the mullahs and destruction of and philosophy description of teheran is hardly necessary here the city being so but the help of people unfamiliar with its character rough sketch of the place may be given teheran it must be remembered has only been the capital of persia the last hundred years when the capital was removed from isfahan previous to that it was merely royal resort and nothing more in shape it was formerly almost to be strictly accurate polygonal the periphery of the polygon measuring farsakh four miles like all persian cities it was enclosed in mud wall and moat since then the city has so increased that an extension has been made to an outer boundary some ten miles in circumference and marked by an uneven ditch the excavated sand of which is thrown up to form sort of battlement twelve gates opened at sunrise and closed at night give access to the town the citadel the ancient part of the city contains the principal public buildings the private residences of high ofﬁcials and the shah palace to the south of this are found the extensive domed bazaars and the commercial portion of teheran to the north lies the european quarter with the legations banks and european shops we will not go far back the afghan invasion in 1728 when according to history teheran was looted and razed to the ground by the afghans but we will only mention the fact which is more interesting to us that it was not till about 1788 that the city was selected on account of its geographical position and of political necessities the seat of the kajar dynasty by agha mohammed who in 1796 became the ﬁrst king of his family the kajar everybody knows has remained the reigning dynasty of persia to this day the most interesting point of teheran in the very centre of the city is the old place du canon where on high platform is gigantic piece of ordnance enclosed by railing in the same square is large reservoir of more or less limpid water in which at all hours of the day dozens of people are to be seen bathing but the big gun attracts one attention principally curious custom which is slowly being done away with has made this spot sanctuary whoever remains within touch or even within the shadow of the an assassin thief bankrupt an incendiary traitor or highwayman fact criminal of any kind can not be touched by the police nor by persons seeking personal usual way of settling differences in persia number of distinctly criminal types can always be observed near the gun and are fed by relations friends or by charitable people persians of all classes are extremely charitable not so much the sake of helping their neighbours in distress increas ing their claims to seat in paradise according to the mussulman religion these sanctuaries are common in persia the mosques the principal shrines such meshed kum the houses of mullahs and in many cases the bazaars which are generally to be found adjoining places of pilgrimage afford most conve nient shelter to outlaws the mullahs are greatly responsible the protection of miscreants by exercising it they are able to show their power over the authorities of the fact which impresses the masses that is why in the neighbourhood of many mosques one sees great number of rufﬁanly faces unmistakable men and boys whose villainy is plainly stamped on their countenances long they remain inside the the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https they can if they like till they die of old can laugh at the law and at the world at lar ge but let them come out and they are done the shah stables are considered very safe sanctuary houses of europeans or europeans themselves were formerly considered sanctuaries but the habit the fallen into disuse i myself when driving one day in the environs of teheran saw horseman leading man whose neck was tied to substantial rope much to my surprise when near enough the prisoner jumped into my carriage and it was only after some persuasion on my side and few pulls at the rope from the rider at the other end that the unwelcome comp anion was made to dismount again the m urderer of n asr ed din s hah when in the company of high mullahs evil characters are also inviolable the largest square in teheran is the top meidan or cannon plain where several small and antiquated pieces of artillery are enclo sed in fence two parallel avenues with trees cross the rectangular square at its longest side from north to south in the centre is large covered reservoir the ofﬁces of both the persian and telegraphs are in this square and also the very handsome building of the bank of persia the square is quite imposing at ﬁrst sight having on two sides uniform buildings with long balconies the lunettes of the archways underneath have each picture of gun and on approaching the southern gates of the parallelogram smile is provoked by the gigantic but crude almost childish representations of modern soldiers on glazed tiles to the west is the extensive drill ground the persian troops another important artery of teheran runs from east to west across the same square one can not but be interested on perceiving along the main thoroughfares of teheran service of horse tramways working quite steadily but the rolling stock is not particularly inviting much less inwardly it is mostly the use of natives and armenians and the carriages are very dirty the horses however are good the tramway company in the hands of russian jews i believe but managed by an englishman and various doing pretty fair business and jointly with the tramways had established capital service of voitures remise which avoided all the trouble and unpleasantness of employing street cabs the carriages mostly victorias were quite good and clean among other foreign things teheran can also boast of mere steam tramway in reality very narrow gauge and extending some six miles south of the city to the shrine of shah abdul hazim the construction of even so short and unimportant line met with great deal of opposition especially from the priestly class when it was ﬁrst started in 1886 by belgian la société des chemins fer et des tramways perse the trains began to run two years later in 1888 and it was believed that the enormous crowds of pilgrims who daily visited the holy shrine would avail themselves of the convenience huge proﬁts were expected but unluckily the four or ﬁve engines that were imported at an excessive cost and the difﬁculties encountered in laying down the line which was continually being torn up by fanatics and most of all the difﬁculty experienced in inducing pilgrims to travel in sufﬁcient numbers by the line instead of on horses mules or donkeys were unexpected and insoluble problems which the managers had to face and which made the shareholders grumble the expenses far exceeded the proﬁts and the capital employed in the construction of the line was already vastly larger than had been anticipa ted one ﬁne day furthermore and respected pilgrim who had returned in holiness from the famous shrine of kerbalah was unhappily run over and killed by train the mullahs made capital of this accident and preached vengeance upon foreign importations the work of the devil and distasteful to allah the great the railway was mobbed and the engine and carriages became mass of débris there was nearly serious riot about this in teheran city the trains continued to run with the undamaged engines but one would travel by them result la compagnie des chemins fer et des tramways perse went bankrupt the whole concern was eventually bought up cheap by russian company and is now working again far regards the railway in more or less spasmodic manner the tramway service connects the three principal gates of the outer wall of teheran with the centre of the city the place des canons although there are great many mosques in teheran city there is not one of great importance or beauty the or the shah mosque is the most noteworthy and has very decorative glazed tiled façade then next in beauty is probably the mosque of the shah mother but neither the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https any way uncommon size or wealth architectural lines or sacredness several mosques have colleges attached to them is the usual custom in persia access to the interior of the mosques is not permitted to europeans unless they have embraced the mahommedan religion outwardly there are few native houses in teheran that impress one with any remarkable features of wealth or beauty in fact they are nearly all wretchedly miserable plastered mud or brick wall with modest little doorway being all one sees from the street of the dwelling s of even the richest and noblest of persians inside matters are different frequently miserable little gate gives access after going through similarly miserable narrow low passages to magniﬁcent palaces and astoundingly beautiful and luxurious courts and gardens i asked what was the reason of the poor outward appearance of these otherwise luxurious dwellings was it modesty it to deceive envious eyes there are few countries where blackm ail and extortion are carried on on more extensive and successful scale than in persia all classes and conditions of people are exposed to the danger and it is only by an assumed air of poverty that certain amount of security is obtained looking house it was explained by persian does not attract the covetous eye of the passer an unusually beautiful one does it is fatal mistake he added to let anybody eye rest on one possessions whether he be the shah minister or beggar he will want to rest his hands upon them next and then everything is gone besides he said it is the inside of house that gives pleasure and comfort to the occupier and his friends one does not build house to give pleasure and comfort to the people in the street that is only vainglory of persons who wish to make their neighbours jealous by outward show they usually have to repent it sooner or later there was more philosophy than european minds may conceive in the persian least persian householders chapter x to russia and england arthur hardinge british minister in talent tact and british of furniture late 1872 there were only four legations in teheran the english french russian and turkish but since then the governments of austria belgium holland and the united states have established legations in the persian capital by the persians themselves only four are considered of importance viz the british russian turkish and belgian legat ions being more closely allied with the interests of the country the austrian legation comes next to these in importance then the german american interests are so far almost negligible quantity in persia but germany is attempting to force her trade into persia in future if she can realise her railway schemes in asia minor germany will be very serious to england and russia supremacy both in north and southern persia germany representative in teheran is man of considerable skill and untiring energy doubt that when the opportune time comes and germany is ready to advance commercially in the persian market england in particular will be the chief sufferer the british manufacturer has already experienced great difﬁculty in contending with the cheap german goods even in india where transport is comparatively easy german goods swamp the bazaars in preference to english goods much more will this be the case in persia when the railway comes to the persian boundary the german minister is certainly sparing efforts to foster german interests in persia and the enterprising emperor william has shown every possible attention to the shah on his visit to berlin in order that the racial antipathy which some reason or other persians entertain towards germans may with all due speed be wiped out to us the british legation is more interesting at present we may well be proud of our present minister sir arthur hardinge man of whose like we have few in our diplom atic service i not think that man more ﬁt persia than sir arthur could be found anywhere in the british empire he possesses quite extraordinary talent with quick working brain marvellous aptitude few months residence in persia he had mastered the persian language and is able to converse in it is endowed with gift which few britishers possess reﬁned tact and certain amount of thoughtful consideration other people feelings nor is this all sir arthur seems to understand orientals thoroughly and persians in particular he is extremely digniﬁed in his demeanour towards the native ofﬁcials yet he is most affable and cheery with very taking charming manner that goes much longer way in persia than the other unfortunate manner by which many of our ofﬁcials think to show stiffness rudeness bluntness of fends of fends bitterly instead of impressing ﬂuent and most graceful speaker with strong touch of oriental ﬂowery forms of speech in his compliments to ofﬁcials with an eye that accurately gauges in persia very difﬁcult man full of resource and absolutely devoid of ridiculous insular man who studies hard and works harder man with unbounded energy and an enthusiast in his man who knows his subject well although he has been such short time in is our british minister at the shah court nor is this faint praise sir arthur hardi nge has done more in few months to save british prestige and to safeguard british interests in persia than the public know and this he has done merely by his own personal genius and charm rather than by instructions or help from the home government while in teheran i had much opportunity of meeting great many high persian ofﬁcials and all were unanimous in singing the praises of our new minister many of them seemed very bitter against some of his predecessors but whether the fault was in the predecessors themselves or in the home government it is not to say anyhow bygones are bygones and we must make the best of our present opportunities the staf f at our legation and consulate is also the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https is to be hoped now that the south african war is over that the government will be able to devote more attention to the persian question far more serious matter than we imagine and extreme ignorance prevails in this country about in circles where it should not would be well when we have such excellent men sir arthur hardinge at the helm in whose intelligence we may conﬁdently and absolutely trust to give him little more assistance and freedom of action so to allow him chance of safeguarding our interests properly and possibly of preventing further disasters it is not easy the uninitiated to realise the value of certain concessions obtained the british by sir arthur hardinge such instance the new land telegraph line via kerman beluchistan to india of the petroleum concessions of which one hears great deal of late i would prefer not to speak the legation grounds in teheran itself are extensive and beautiful with great many ﬁne trees and shady cool avenues the legation hous is handsomely furnished and dotted all over the gardens are the various other buildings secretaries attachés and interpreters all the structures are of european but solid in summer however all the legations shift their quarters to what is called in teheran la campagne golahek tejerish zargandeh which gracefully misleading and misapplied terms are indicated the suburban residences of the legations at the foot of the arid barren hot dusty shamran range of mountains golahek where the british legation is to be found does actually boast of few green trees in the legation grounds and cluster or two of nominally green whitish be seen at zargandeh where the russian and belgian legations are side by side and tejerish where the persian foreign ofﬁce and many persian ofﬁcials have their summer residences the drive from teheran to dusty beyond words there are looking trees here and there along the road so dried and white with dust to excite compassion to golahek the monotony of the journey is broken by sudden halt at into which the coachman rushes leaving the horses to take care of themselves while he sips refreshing glasses of tea when it suits his convenience he returns to splash buckets of water between the horses legs and under their tails this he told in all seriousness was to prevent sunstroke really the persian can be humorous without knowing it and was preventive imported with civilised ways from europe the ears and manes of the animals are then pulled violently after which the horses are considered able to proceed persian c ossacks t eheran d rilled by r ussian fficers the persian government gives each legation guard of soldiers the british legation is guarded by infantry untidy ragged undisciplined lot with cylindrical hats worn at all angles on the side of the head and with uniforms so dirty and torn that it is difﬁcult to discern what they should be like nearly all other legations are provided with soldiers of the persian cossack regiment who are inﬁnitely better drilled and clothe d than the infantry regiments they are quite military in appearance it was believed that these cossacks being drilled by russian military instructors would not be acceptable at the british legation hence the guard of infantry soldiers the russian legation has two additional russian cavalry soldiers the country residences of all the legations are quite comfortable pretty and unpretentious with the usual complement of furniture of folding pattern so convenient but so inartistic and superabundance of cane chairs really good furniture being very expensive in teheran good deal of the upholstery of the teheran legations is conveyed to the country residences the summer months perhaps nothing is more amusing to watch than one of these removals to or from the country chairs tables sofas and most private effects are tied to on ponies mules or donkeys with bundles of mattrasses blankets and linen piled anyhow upon them while the more brittle articles of the household are all amassed into high pyramid on gigantic tray and balanced on man head rows of these equilibrists with the most precious glass and crockery of the homestead can be noticed toddling along on the golahek road dodging carriages and cavaliers in most surprising manner they are said never to break even the smallest and most fragile articles but such is certainly not the case with the heavily laden donkeys and mules which often collide or collapse altogether with most disastrous results to the heavier pieces of furniture on my arrival in teheran i received most charming invitation to go and stay at the british legation but partly owing to the fact that i wished to remain in town and so be more in touch with the natives themselves partly because i wished to be unbiassed in any opinion that i might form i decided not to accept anybody hospitality while in teheran this i am very glad i did i feel i can now express an opinion which whether right or wrong is my own and has not been in any way inﬂuenced by any one chapter xi visits to high persian college foreign mushir the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https minister of foreign interest in the chinese war of reform necessary perhaps the description of one or two visits to high persian ofﬁcials may interest the reader through the kindness of the persian legation in london i had received letters of introduction which i forwarded to their addresses on my arrival in teheran the ﬁrst to answer few hours after i had reached teheran was davoud the highest person in the foreign ofﬁce after the minister who in most polite letter begged to go to tea with him at once he had just come to town from tejerish but would leave again the same evening the ftet ahié c ollege supported by escorted by the messenger i at once drove to meftah palace outwardly like other palaces of extremely modest appearance and entered by small doorway leading through very narrow passages led by my guide we suddenly passed through most quaint court beautifully clean and with pretty fountain in the centre time was given to rest and admire again we entered another dark passage this time to emer ge into most beautiful garden with rare plants and lovely ﬂowers with huge tank fountains playing and swans ﬂoating gracefully on the water most beautiful palace in european architecture of good taste faced the garden i was admitted into spacious furnished in good european style where rotund and jovial with effusion although he had never been out of persia he spoke french with most perfect accent ﬂuently frenchman what particularly struck in him and later in many other of the younger generation of the upper classes in persia was the happy mixture of the utmost charm of manner with keen business head delightful tact and mean sense of humour instance spoke most interestingly over an hour and i was agreeably surprised to ﬁnd what an excellent foreign education students can receive without leaving persia it is true that meftah is an exceptionally clever man who would make his mark anywhere still it was nevertheless remarkable how well informed he was on matters not concerning his country he comes from good stock his fathe r was minister member of the council of state very wealthy man who devoted much of his time and money to doing good to his country among the many praiseworthy institutions founded and entirely supported by him was the college orphans the dabetsane daneshe and the eftetahié school the colleges occupy beautiful premises and teachers are provided who instruct their pupils in sensible useful matters the boys are well fed and clothed and are made quite happy in every way meftah told that his excellency the minister of foreign affairs wished to see so it was arranged that i should drive to tejerish the next morning to the minister country residence early ﬁve the following day i was digging in my trunks in search of my the only masculine attire in persia that is considered decent and without which respectable man likes to be seen then the tall hat and with the temperature less than in the shade i started in an open victoria to drive the nine miles or so to the appointment not being persian myself and not quite sharing the same ideas of propriety i felt rather ridiculous in my driving across the sunny dusty and barren country until we reached the hills i had to keep my feet under the seat of the carriage when the sun rays thermometer above struck my best shoes the heat was intolerable at last after going slowly through winding lanes enclosed in mud walls and along dry ditches with desiccated trees on either side we arrived at the campagne tejerish and pulled up in front of big gate at the residence of the minister the trials of the long drive had been great with the black white with dust my feet absolutely broiled in the patent shoes and the perspiration streaming down my forehead and cheeks i really could not help laughing at the absurdity of civilised or fashions and at the purposeless suf fering inﬂicted by them there were number of soldiers at the gate with clothes were practical rusty muskets resting idle on rack is here i inquired yes he is waiting you answered soldier he sprang to his feet he hurriedly buttoned up his coat and hitched his belt and seizing riﬂe made military salute in the most approved style an attendant led along avenue to the house and here i was ushered into room where round tables covered with green cloth sat great many ofﬁcials all these men wore pleated of all tints and gradations of the colours of the rainbow one and all rose and politely saluted before i sat the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https the passage one could see another room in which number of other ofﬁcials similarly clad and with black astrakan caps were opening and sorting out correspondence suddenly there was hurried exit of all much like stampede up the avenue stately tall ﬁgure garbed in whitish over which long loose brown coat was donned walked slowly and ponderously with crowd of underlings ﬂitting mosquitoes round brilliant light it was mushir the minister of foreign affairs he turned round now to one then to another ofﬁcial smiling occasionally and bowing gracefully then glancing ﬁercely at another and sternly answering third m ushir ed oulet minister of foreign affairs i was rather impressed by the remarkable facility with which he could switch on extreme courteousness and severity kindliness and contempt his face was at time mind you subjected to very marked exaggerated changes or grimaces such those by which we generally expect emotions to show themselves among ourselves but the changes in his expression though slight were quite distinct and so expressive that there was mistake to their meaning soft look of compassion hard glance of offended dignity the veiled eyes deeply absorbed in reﬂection the sudden sparkle in them at news of success were plainly visible on his features clerk approached him bringing correspondence or asking his opinion or reporting on one matter or another considerable amount of the less important business was disposed of in this fashion the minister strode up the avenue to the foreign ofﬁce building and more still with two or three of the more important personages who escorted him to his tents some little way from the avenue who had disappeared with the minister hurriedly returned and requested to follow him on sofa under huge tent sat mushir the minister who instantly rose and greeted effusively i entered he asked to sit on his right on the sofa while meftah interpreted his excellency only spoke persian cigarettes cigars coffee and tea were immediately brought the minister had most intelligent head can be seen by the photograph here reproduced he might have passed european he was extremely digniﬁed and in his manner his words were few and much to the point our interview was pleasant one and i was able to learn much of interest about the country the minister seemed to lay particular stress on the friendly relations of russia and england and took particular care to avoid comments on the more direct relations between persia and russia one point in our conversation which his excellency seemed very anxious to clear up was what would be the future of china he seemed keenly interested in learning whether russia or england inﬂuence had the supremacy in the heavenly empire and whether either of these nations was actually feared by the chinese will the chinese ever be able to ﬁght england or russia with success were the chinese armed during the war of 1900 if proper ly armed and drilled what chances had the chinese army of winning against the allies would china be eventually absorbed and divided into two or more shares by european powers or would she be maintained an empire although the minister did not say so himself i could not help suspecting that in his mind the similarity and probably parallel futures of china and persia af forded ground reﬂection there is doubt that in many ways the two countries resemble one another politically although persia owing to her more important geographical position may have ﬁrst place in the race of european greed the interest displayed by persians of all classes in the chinese war of 1900 was intense and curiously enough the feeling seemed to prevail that china had actually won the war because the allies had retreated leaving the capital and the country in the hands of the chinese more than in our actual strength said persian ofﬁcial once to our safety lies in the rivalry of great britain and russia between which we are wedged let those two nations be friends and we are done after my visit to the minister of foreign affairs i had the pleasure of meeting the prime minister the minister of war and the minister of public works i found them all extremely interesting and courteous and well up in their work but although talent is not lacking in persia among statesmen the country itself it is does not give these men an opportunity of shining brightly they might the whole country is in such decayed condition that it needs thorough the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https only it might be converted into quite formidable country it possesses all the necessary requirements to be nation talent in exuberance physical strength convenient geographical position good climate considerable mineral and some agricultu ral resources are all to be found in persia all that is wanted at present is the development of the country on solid reliable basis instead of the insecure unsteady intrigues upon which business whether political or commercial is unfortunately carried on in the present state of af fairs one realises this better than the persian and nothing would be more welcome to him than radical reform on the part of the shah and the establishment of the land of iran on unshakable foundations with national debt so ridiculously small persia has at present there is reason why with less maladministration with her industries pushed with her army reorganised and placed on serviceable footing she should not rank one of the ﬁrst and most powerful among asiatic independent nations we have seen what young japan against all odds has been able to accomplish in few years all the more should talented race like the persians situated to begin with in far less remote position than japan and therefore more favourably the acquisition of foreign ways be able to emulate and even in short time surpass the marvellous success attained by the little islanders of the far east it is grit that is at present lacking in persia the country has wavering policy that is extremely injurious to her interests one can not fail to compare her to good old ship in dangerous sea the men at her helm are perplexed and cann ot quite see clear way of steering the waves run high and there are plenty of reefs and rocks about black gloomy sky closes the horizon forecasting an approaching cyclone the ship is leaking on all sides and the masts are unsteady yet when we look at the number of rocks and reefs and dangers which she has steered clear through already we can not fail to have some conﬁdence in her captain and crew maybe if she is able to resist the approaching and unavoidable clash of the wind and sea ﬁguratively england is the wind russia the sea may yet reach her destination swamped by the waves dismantled but not beyond repair her damage if one looks at her with the eye of an expert is after all not so great and with little present trouble and expense she will soon be good new not however if she is left to rot much longer such is persia at present the time has come when she must go back into the shelter of safe harbour or face the storm chapter xii the persian persian soldier he is and he might and how he is under of the army regiments drilled by russian of the head tribute of the position of gas it fulﬁlled its agreement painful sight is the persian army with the exception of the good cossack cavalry regiment properly fed dressed armed and drilled by foreign instructors such general kossackowski and russian ofﬁcers the infantry and artille ry are wretched lot there is excuse their being so wretched because there is hardly people in asia who would make better soldiers than the persians if they were properly trained the persian is careless devil who can live on next to nothing he is good marksman splendid walker and horseman he is fond of killing and cares little if he is he is master at taking cover these are all good qualities in soldier and if they were brought out and cultivated if the soldiers were punctually paid and fed and clothed and armed there is reason why persia should not have good an army any other nation the material is there and is unusually good it only remains to use it properly persian s oldiers he b and the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https l earning m usic i was most anxious to see the troops at drill and asked very high military ofﬁcer when i might see them we not drill in summer was the reply it is too hot you drill in winter it is too cold are the troops then only drilled in the autumn and spring sometimes they are principally drilled few days before the shah birthday so that they may look well on the parade before his majesty i suppose they are also only dressed and shod on the shah birthday yes what type and calibre riﬂe is used in the persian army make it plural plural you can they have every type under the sun but added the high military ofﬁcer we use of course riﬂes fusils balle not shot guns this highly technical explanation about ﬁnished up luck or would have it i had an accident which detained some four weeks in teheran while at the resht hotel it may be remembered how walking barefooted on the matting of my room an invisible germ bored its way into the sole of my foot and i could not get it out again one day in attempting to make its life lively the brute made my foot i proceeded to pour some drops of concentrated carbolic acid upon the home of my invisible tenan unluckily in the operation my arm caught in the blankets of my bed and in the jerk the whole contents of the bottle ﬂowed out severely burning all my toes and the lower and upper part of my foot upon which the acid had quickly dripped between the toes with the intense heat of teheran this became very bad sore and i was unable to stand up several days some ten days later having gone drive to get little air carriage coming full gallop from side street ran into mine turning it over and i was thrown injuring my leg very badly again so with all these accidents i was detained in teheran long enough to witness the shah birthday and with it few days previous the actual drilling of the troops i have heard it said but will not be responsible the statement that the troops are nearer their full complement on such an auspicious occasion than at any other time of the year so to make show before his majesty very likely this is true when i was in teheran great commotion took place which shows how things are occasionally done in the land of iran the of war who had previously been several times governor of teheran was arrested by order of the shah embezzling half year pay of the whole persian army soldiers were sent to his country residence and the old man tied on white mule was dragged into teheran his cap having been knocked is disgrace to be seen in public without relations asked that he should be given cap which concession was granted on payment of several hundred tomans meal of rice is said to have cost the prisoner few more hundred tomans and so much salt had purposely been mixed with it that the thirsty had to ask copious libations of water each tumbler at hundreds of tomans several other high ofﬁcials were arreste d in connection with these army frauds and would probably have lost their heads had it not been the special kindness of the shah who punished them by heavy ﬁnes repayment of the sums appropriated and exile it is fact in persia that whether the frauds begin high up or lower down in the scale of ofﬁcials the pay often does not reach the private soldier and if it does is generally reduced to minimum the food rations too if received by the men at all are most irregular which compels the soldiers to look out themselves at the expense of the general public this is very great pity with what the shah pays the maintenance of the army he could easily were the money not appropriated other purposes keep quite an efﬁcient little force properly instructed clothed and armed the drilling of the soldiers which i witnessed just before the shah birthday partook very much of the character of theatrical performance the drilling which hardly ever lasted more than couple of hours day was limited to teaching the soldiers how to keep time while marching and presenting arms the brass bands played fortissimo not benissimo the time and various evolutions were gone through in the spacious place before the italian general in persian employ and bevy of persian ofﬁcers there was great variety of ragged uniforms and gears from kolah caps to brass and tin helmets and the soldiers ages ranged from ten to sixty the soldiers seemed very and obedient and certainly when i saw them later before the shah in their new uniforms they looked quite different and had not the wretched the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https present in daily life but these infantry soldiers not bear comparison with the persian cossacks the jump is enormous and well shows what can be done with these men if metho d and discipline are used of course perfection could not be expected in such short time especially considering the difﬁculties and interference which foreign ofﬁcers have to bear from the persians but it is certainly to be regretted that such excellent material is now practically wasted and useless there were several other excitements before i left teheran the head mullah most important and the whole population of teheran turned out to him honour when his imposing funeral took place curiously enough the entire male jewish community marched in the funeral event unprecedented i am told in the annals of persian mussulman history the head mullah man of great wisdom and justice had it was said been very considerate towards the jews and had protected them against persecution hence this mark of respect and grief at his death the discovery of the of war frauds the death of the head mullah the reported secret attempts to poison the shah the prospects of drought the reported murder of two russians at resht and other minor sources of discontent all coming together gave rise to fears on the part of europeans that revolution might take place in teheran but such rumours are so very frequent in all eastern countries that generally one attaches any importance to them until it is too late europeans are rather tolerated than loved in persia and walk through the native streets or bazaars in teheran is quite sufﬁcient to convince one of the fact nor are the persians to be blamed there is hardly nation in asia that has suffered more often and in more shameful manner from european speculators and adventurers than the land of iran perhaps the country itself or rather the people with their vainglory and empty pomp are particularly adapted to be victimised by impostors and are easy preys to them some of the tricks that have been played upon them not lack humour take instance the pretty farce of the compagnie générale pour et le chauffage en perse which undertook to light the city of teheran with less than one thousand gas lights machinery was really imported at great expense from europe the manufacture of the of the heavier pieces of machinery are still lying on the roadside between resht and premises were built in teheran itself and an elaborate doorway with suitable inscription on it is still to be seen but the most important part of getting of the coal from which the gas was to be not been considered the lalun coal mines which offered gleam of hope to the shareholders were exploited and found practically useless the company and government came to loggerheads each accusing the other of false dealing and the result was that the persians insisted on the company lighting up teheran with the agreed lights if gas could not be manufactured oil lights would there was the signed agreement and the company must stick to it the company willingly agreed but the document did not specify the site where each should be situate nearly all were erected at distance of only few feet from one regular forest of the two main streets of the european settlement one single man is employed after dark to set the lamps alight and when he has got to the end of the two streets he proceeds on his return journey to blow them all out again by ten everything is in perfect darkness the company now claim that they have fulﬁlled their agreement the belgian company the manufacture of beetroot sugar was another example of how speculations sometimes go wrong and wonder in theory the venture seemed quite sound the consumption of sugar in persia is large and if it had been possible to produce cheap sugar in the country instead of importing it from russia france and india huge proﬁts would have been probable but here again the same mistake was made by the gas company the obtaining of the raw material was neglected the sugar reﬁnery was built at great cost in this case too machinery was imported to manufacture the three qualities of sugar most favoured by the sugar crystallised sugar and sugar candy all this was done before ascertaining whether it was possible to grow the right quality of beetroot in sufﬁcient quantities to make the concern pay theoretically it was proved that it would be possible to produce local sugar at price which while leaving the company huge proﬁt would easily beat russian sugar by which french and indian sugar have now been almost altogether supplanted model farm was actually started and is still in existence near azim where beetroot was to be grown in large quantities the experts declaring that the soil was bette r suited the crop than any to be found in europe someho w or other it did not answer well expected moreover the question of providing coal the engines in the case of the gas be another serious stumbling block an attempt to overcome this difﬁculty by joining with the gas company in working the lalun mines was made but alas proved an expensive failure moreover further difﬁculties were encountered in obtaining the right manure the beetroots in order that the acids which delay crystallisation might be eliminated and the inexperience carelessness and reluctance with which the natives took up the new it did not pay eventually declined to go on with it by means strange that the sugar factory too which was to make the fortunes of so many became derelict enterprise chapter xiii cash and understood by of conﬁdence of natives in ways of increasing persian ime money and to silver and on of of silver into ﬂuctuations of the the poorer classes are affected by old and coins shai and its the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https the persian does not understand the sound principles on which alone extensive business can be successful partly owing to prevailing circumstances he is under the misapprehe nsion that hard cash is synonymous with wealth and does not differentiate between treasure savings and savings transformed into capital this is probably the main cause of the present anaemic state of business in the shah empire thus when we are told there is in persia enormous capital to be invested we are not correctly informed there are enormous accumulations of wealth lying idle but there is capital in the true meaning of the word these huge sums in hard cash in jewe llery or bars of gold and silver have been hidden centuries in dark cellars and any good they are to the country and commerce at lar ge might well not exist at all partly owing to the covetousness of his neighbours partly owing to racial and not unreasonable difﬁdence of all around him and to the fact that an asiatic always feels great satisfaction in the knowledge that he has all his wealth within his own reach and protection rich men of persia take particular care to maintain the strictest secrecy about their possessions and to conceal from the view of their neighbours any signs which might lead them to suspect the accumulation of any such wealth we have already seen how even the houses of the wealthiest are purposely made humble outwardly so to escape the notice of rapacious ofﬁcials and it is indeed difﬁcult to distinguish from the outside between the house of millionaire and that of common merchant the persian it must be well understood does not hide his accumulated treasure from avaricious reasons on the contrary his inclinations are rather toward extravagance than otherwise which extravagance he can only satisfy under mask of endless lies and subterfuges honest ways of employing his wealth in and safe manner are open to the rich persian under the present public maladministration nor have the foreign speculations in the country offered sufﬁcient examples of success to induce natives to embark upon them again far from it these enterprises have even made persians more sceptical and close than before and have certainly not shown foreign ways of transacting business at the best that is why other way being open to him the persian who does wish to get rid of his wealth prefers to squander his money both capital and income the latter if he possesses land in luxurious jewellery and carpets and in unhealthy bribery and corruption or in satisfying caprices which his voluptuous nature may suggest the result the persian is driven to live mostly his vanity and qualities not tending to the promotion of commercial enterprise on large scale although it is true that in small way his failings give rise and life to certain industries instance even in remote poor and small centres where food is scarce and the buildings humble one invariably ﬁnds goldsmith ﬁligre and embroidery makers whereas the necessaries of life may be more difﬁcult to obtain of course persia contains comparatively small number of persians of more adventurous nature men who have travelled abroad and have been bitten with the western desire speculation to increase their money with speed if not always with safety but even these men have mostly retired within their shells since the colossal ﬁascos of the speculations started in persia by foreign company promoters considerable number of persians seduced by glowing prospectuses and misplaced faith in everything foreign were dreadfully taken in by the novel everything novel attracts the persian considerably readily unearthed solid gold and silver bars that had lain centuries in subterranean and now came out to be converted into shares in the various concerns hardly worth the paper on which they were printed but according to the bring the happy possessors fabulous incomes we have seen how the sugar reﬁnery the glass factory the gas more appropriate name could not have been the mining company have created suspicion of foreign ways of increasin g one capital nor can we with any fairness blame the persians returning to their old method of slow accumulation true enough fortune if discovered has fair possibility of being seized in the lump by greedy ofﬁcial but that is only possibility whereas when invested in some foreign speculations the loss becomes dead certainty more even than the actual loss of the money the persians who burned their ﬁngers by meddling with foreign schemes felt the scorn of their friends of whom they had become the laughing stock there is doubt that the conﬁdence of the natives towards foreigners has been very much shaken and excepting few men whom they well know trust and respect they regard most europeans adventurers or thieves the treasuring of capital instead of the investment of it is therefore one of the reasons why industries in persia seldom assume large proportions it is only the small merchant content to make humble proﬁt who can prosper in his own small way while more extensive concerns are distrusted but it must not be understood that persia ns not care money there is on the contrary hardly race of people on the face of the earth with whom the greed money is developed to such an abnormal extent in all classes in the land of iran but you will ask how can money be procured or increased fast and without trouble in country where there is commercial enterprise where labour is interfered with where capital can not have free outlet or investment an opening has to be found in illicit ways of procuring wealth and the most common form adopted is the loan of money at high interest on ample security much 50 per 80 per 100 per cent and even more is demanded and obtained interest on private loans 15 per cent being the very lowest and deemed most reasonable indeed this does not apply to foreign banks all this may seem strange in mussulman country where it is against all the laws of the koran to lend money at usury and it is more strange still to ﬁnd that the principal offenders are the mullahs themselves who reap large proﬁts from such illegal ﬁnancial operations the persian is dreamer by nature he can not be said to be absolutely lazy he is always absorbed in deep the thoughts are it does not to analyse too he devotes so much time to think ing that he seldom can anything else his the minds of all people unaccustomed to hard work and steady to the fantastic and he ever expects immense returns doing nothing the returns if any and matter how large they may be are ever too small to satisfy his expectations time there is country where it is worth less than to the natives of persia the mañana of the spaniards sinks into perfect insigni ﬁcance when compared with the habits of the land of iran punctuality is in payments persian must take time to reﬂect the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https he can not be hurried three months limit of even six outrageously short in the eyes of persians twelve months and eighteen twenty or months suit him better but even then he is never ready to pay unless under great pressure he does disburse the money in the end capital and interest but why people should worry over time and why it should matter whether payment occurs or are quite beyond him if he does transact business days are wasted in useless talk and compliments before the subject with which he intends to deal is incidentally approached in conversation and then more hours and days and weeks even months have to elapse before he can make up his mind what to our haste and what we consider smartness in business are looked upon by the persian quite an acute form of lunacy really when one is thrown much in contact with such delightful placidity almost torpor and looks back upon one hard race living and one struggle and competition in every department one almost begins to fancy that we are lunatics after all the rriv al of c ara van of s ilver at the i mperial b ank of p ersia the persian must have his hours praying his hours ablutions more hours meditation and the rest sleep and food whether you hasten or not he thinks you will only live the number of years that god wills you and you will live those years in the way that he has destined you each day will be longer and shorter your life sadder and happier why then hurry amid such philosophic views business in european fashion does not promise to prosper unable to attach true meaning to language is beautiful but its ﬂowery form conduces to endless to degree in fulﬁlling work he has stipulated to it such is the persian of whether the vicissitudes of his country the fearful wars the famines the climate the ofﬁcial oppression have made him so or whether he has always been so is not easy to tell but that is how he is now besides all this each man is endowed with maximum of ambition and conceit each individual fully believing himself the greatest man that ever lived and absolute perfection moreover the inﬂuence of mullahs is used to oppose reform and improvement so that altogether the economic development of production distri bution and circulation of capital is bound to be hampered to mean extent on examining things carefully it seems almost astonishing that the trade of persia should be well developed it is another difﬁculty in the way is the currency which offers some interesting lessons and i am indebted to the author of paper read before the statistical society the following details gold is not produced in persia bar gold is imported in very small quantities only gold coin is mere quite scarce and is mostly used presents and hoarding it is minted principally from russian imperials and turkish pounds which drift into persia in small quantities in the course of business goldsmiths too in their work make use of foreign coins although some gold and silver bullion is imported manufacturing purposes silver too is not obtainable in persia except in very small quantities and the imported silver comes from great britain via the gulf or via hambur g and russia in the year 1901 the persian government in connection with the russian loan imported some three million tomans worth of silver to be minted and the imperial bank of persia another million tomans while some tomans more were brought into the country by other importers but under normal circumstances the annual output hardly ever exceeds three to four million tomans in 1900 it was something between and tomans the all other institutions of in condition with an ancient plant 1877 so obsolete and worn to be almost useless partly owing to the insufﬁcient production of coin partly because of the export in great quantities of persian silver coin into transcaspia and last but not least owing to the persian custom of making corner by speculators the commercial centres of persia suffer from normal dearth of silver coins persian silver coin has the foregoing reasons purchasing power of sometim es 20 per cent beyond its intrinsic value in distant cities like yezd or kerman it is difﬁcult to obtain large sums in silver coin at face value it disappears into the villages almost soon it arrives by caravan or post new coin is generally in great demand and commands premium so the yearly drain of silver coin from teheran soon it is minted is very considerable especially to the north and provinces this coin does not circulate but is almost entirely absorbed and never reappears the people themselves holding it we have seen treasure and huge quantities ﬁnding their way into transcaspia and eventual ly into afghanistan where persian coin is current and at premium especially on the border land in transcaspia persian coin is cherished because the nominally equivalent persian coin contains much larger quantity of silver than the russian russian silver is mere token of currency or at best stands midway between token and standard or international currency and its difference when compared with the persian coin amounts to less than per cent in favour of the persian persian coin although defective and about 2 per cent below legal weight and ﬁneness is standard or international currency the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https appears that good deal of the silver exported into transcaspia ﬁnds its way to chinese turkestan where it is converted into bars and ingots and is used the inland trade to china the russian government have done all in their power to prevent the competition of persian and russian coins in their transcaspian provinces decree was issued some eleven years ago forbidding the importation and in 1897 second ukase further prohibited foreign silver from entering the country after the 13th of may 1st of may of our calendar and duty of about 20 per cent was imposed on silver crossing the frontier all this has resulted in silver entering the provinces by smuggling instead of openly but it ﬁnds its way there in lar ge quantities just the same before the government of persia does not issue which would be regarded with suspicion among the people but it is interesting to ﬁnd that the monopoly granted to the imperial bank of persia the issue of paper money has had excellent results in teheran particularly where the bank is held in high esteem and the notes have been highly appreciated in other cities of persia which i visited however the notes did not circulate and were only accepted at the bank agencies and in the bazaar by some of the lar ger merchants at small discount naturally with the methods adopted by persians and the insecurity which prevails everywhere the process of convincing the natives that piece of printed paper is equivalent to so many silver krans and that the silver krans will surely be produced in full on demand is rather slow one but the credit of the imperial bank and the popular personality of rabino the manager have done much towards dispelling the suspicions and since 1890 the notes have assumed considerable place in the circulation in september 1890 the circulation of them amounted to tomans in 1895 it had gradually increased to tomans and by leaps and bounds had reached the sum of in 1900 1 it is rather curious to note that in the previous year 1899 the note circula tion was tomans and became very nearly double in the following twelve months this only applies to teheran and the principal cities in the villages and in towns notes are out of the question and even silver coins are very scarce n piece of the newer type is seldom found and only pieces little irregular lumps of silver are occasionally to be seen copper is really the currency and is mere subsidiary or token coinage with value ﬂuctuating according to local dearth or other causes at almost every place one goes to the precarious system of farming accompanied by the corruption of ofﬁcials has given an opportunity most frequent and ﬂagrant abuses in the excessive of copper coin so that in many cities copper issued at the nominal value of 20 shais per kran was curre nt at 30 40 50 and even in eastern persia at 80 shais per kran i myself on travelling through persia never knew exactly what kran was worth in almost every province i received different exchange of shais my krans in birjand and sistan particularly the exchange dif fered very considerably this state of maladministration affects the poorer classes the copper currency forms their entire fortune on coming to the throne the present shah with praiseworthy thoughtf ulness endeavoured to put stop to this cause of misery in his people and ordered the government to withdraw some tomans worth of copper coins at 25 to 30 shais per kran this had good effect and although much of the depreciated coin is still in circulation particularly in places its circulation in the lar ger towns has been considerably diminished lately the government has adopted the measure of supplying the public with nickel coins and pieces which although looked at askance at ﬁrst are now found very handy by the natives and circulate freely principally in resht kasvin teheran and isfahan in other cities i did not see any nor would the natives accept mine in payment and in villages one would have anything to with them they were absolutely unknown but wherever it has been possible to commence the circulation of these nicke l were struck at the brussels mint and which are quite have been accepted with great pleasure the old gold coins in circulation in few and far the toman and piece the gold had legal ﬁneness of

most revered foreign er in road action of the stock exchange injurious to british and not of importing capital ideal banking key to proﬁtable banking in the exchange is the russian bank and grube an able of the russian government the banks of persia can be divided into three classes one containing the smaller native bankers who often combine the jeweller business with that of the money changer the larger and purely native banking businesses and then the foreign banks such the imperial bank of persia english bank the banque et prêts russian bank and the agency of the banque internationale commerce moscow banque poliakof f there are other foreign ﬁrms too such ziegler and hotz the persian gulf trading which transact banking to limited extent besides their usual and principal trading business but these are not banks proper the imperial bank of persia being purely british enterprise is the most interesting to us its main ofﬁces are in most impressive building in the principal square of teheran and it has branch ofﬁces at tabriz isfahan meshed yezd shiraz in the teheran bazaar at bushire and kermanshah it would be useless to go into the various vicissitudes through which the bank has passed since it was ﬁrst started and the difﬁculties which it encountered in meeting the unusual ways of doing business of persians and satisfying the desires of directors and shareholders in simple london town one thing is nevertheless certain and that is that if the imperial bank of persia maintains the prestige now belonging to it it owes this to rabino of egyptian fame the manager of the bank without exception the most revered foreigner in persia i will not touch on the sore question of the persian loans eventually secured by russia but curiously enough the capital of the ﬁrst loan at least was in great measure practically transferred from russia to persia by the imperial bank which had the greatest stock of money in teheran nor shall i go into the successful and unsuccessful ventures of the bank such the road concession and the mining corporation to the road concession it is beyond doubt that had the bank not become alarmed and had they held on little longer the venture might have eventually paid and paid well but naturally in slow count ry like persia nothing can be ﬁnancia l success unless it is given time to develop properly with regard to its relation with the banque et prêts the russian by some to be dangerous may to my mind be seen in two aspects i believe that the russian bank far from damaging the imperial bank has really been godsend to it it has relieved it by sharing advances to the government which in time might have proved somewhat of burden on one establishment it is mistake too to believe that in country like persia there is the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https two large concerns like the two banks and that one or the other is bound to go the rumoured enormous successes of the russian bank and its really prestige are indisputable but the secret of these things is well known to the local management of the imperial bank which could easily follow suit and quickly surpass the russians if more ofﬁcial and political support were forthcoming the action of the london stock exchange in depreciating everything persi an the sake of reprisal is also injurious to the bank and more so to the prestige of this countr y though we not seem to see that our attitude has done much more harm to ourselves than to the persians it is true that persia is maladministered country that there is corruption that there is intrigue and so forth but is there any other country may i ask where to greater or smaller extent the same accusation could not be made nor can we get away from the fact that although persia has been discredited on the london market it is one of the few countries in which the national debt is extremely small and can easily be met the obligations of the imperial government and of muzaf shah signature have never failed to be met nor has the payment of full interest on mortgages contracted ever been withheld delays may have occurred but everything has come right in the end our absurd attitude towards the persians when we are at the same time ready to back up enterprises that certainly not afford tenth of the security to be found in persia is therefore rather difﬁcult to understand there are few countries in which so much can be done with comparativel y small outlay in persia it is not enterprises on gigantic scale nor millions of pounds sterling that are needed moderate sums handled with judgment knowledge and patient perseverance would produce results large imported sums of capital in hard cash are not wanted and would involve considerable risk first of all stands the danger of the depreciation of capital by the fall in silver and the gradual rise in exchange due to the excess of imports over exports then comes the narrowness of the persian markets which renders the return of large sums in cash an extremely long and difﬁcult operation and last but not least the serio us fact that capital is generally imported at loss inasmuch the intrinsic value of the kran is much below its exchange value the ideal situation of an english bank trading with the east 2 is when its capital remains in gold whilst its operations are conducted in silver by means of its deposits this because of the instability in the price of silver compared with that of gold and the risks which follow upon holding metal ﬂuctuating in value almost daily the situation in persia partly owing to the constant appreciation of the persian currency due to the great dearth of silver produced by hoarding well by the export of coin to central asia is quite suitable to the system of banking indicated above the difference between the intrinsic and the exchange value of the kran notwithstanding the constant demand exchange is quite worthy of note political preoccupation is the principal cause of the hoarding system in government circles and in the masses the absence of banking organisations in which the natives have sufﬁcient conﬁdence to deposit their savings slowly but surely the persian is beginning to feel the good effects of depositing his money in managed bank offering sound guarantees and it is certain that in time all the money required trade purposes will be found in persia itself when better communication between the various commercial centres has been established the distribution of the funds required now matter of great difﬁculty and risk will be greatly facilitated when the despatching of sums from one city to another instead of taking minutes by telegraph or hours by post occupy under normal circumstances days weeks month or even more because the payments are made in solid silver which has to travel by caravan it is easy to understand how the dangerous system of hoarding comes to be practised with impunity and facility all over persia t ypical p ersian w indow rabino house teheran of course every precaution is taken to foresee abnormal scarcity of funds by sending specie to the places threatened in order to help trade during the summer months instance most of the ﬂoating capital is absorbed in the provinces by the opium crop in the yezd and isfahan markets when the silver krans ﬁnd their way en masse to the villages much to the inconvenience of the two cities in the autumn similar occurrence hampers trade during the export season of dried fruit and silk from azerbaijan and ghilan the exchange falling very low owing to scarcity of money very important item in the bank transactions in persia is the constant demand remittances of revenue to teheran government purposes such payments the army ofﬁcials and these remittances amount to very lar ge sums the key to proﬁtable banking in persia is the arbitration of foreign exchanges which being so intimately connected with internal exchange allows the latter to be worked at proﬁt advantage being taken of breaks in the level of prices but of course with the introduction of telegraphs and in future of railways these proﬁts will become more and more difﬁcult to make in persia the lack of quick communication still affords fair chance of good remuneration withou t speculation the important services rendered by bank to the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https exchange of persia upon london is specially affected by two inﬂuences in the north by the value of the ruble the more important and constant factor tabriz the persian centre of the russian exchange being the nearest approach in persia to regular market and in the south by the rupee exchange which dif fers from the ruble in its being dependent upon the price of silver in country like persia where the exchange is not always obtainable and money at times is not to be procured it is easy to conceive the difﬁculty of bank forecasts of movements based on general causes are of little or value in persia to this must be added the difﬁculti es of examining and counting is not practicable owing to the irregularity of each the transmission of funds to distant places and the general ignorance except in mercantile banking methods we understand them the imperial bank is established in persia not is believed by some persons to business england and english people but to business with everybody the spirit of free trade alone said rabino to must animate the management of such bank its services must be at the disposal of all its impartiality to english russian austrian persian or whatever nationality customer may belong to unquestioned all must have fair and generous treatment the interests of the imperial bank are ﬁrstly those of its shareholders secondly those of persia which gives the bank hospitality the bank has already rendered inestimable services to persia by diffusing sound business principles which the persians seem slowly but gladly to learn and accept that the future of bank on such true principles is bound to be crowned with success seems certainty but has often been pointed out it would be idle to fancy that couple of years or three will remove the prejudices and peculiar ways of thinking and of transacting business of an oriental race whose civilisation is so different from ours or that the natives will accept our ﬁnancial system with its exactitude and punctuality the result of ages of experience unhesitatingly and immediately the persian requires very careful handling he is obstinate and by mere long tedious passive resistance will often get the better in bargain by the employment of similar methods however it is not difﬁcult to obtain one way in the end good deal of patience is required and time ad libitum that is all there is need large stock of gold and rubles but what is mostly wanted is greater number of men who might be sent all over the country men with good business heads and polite manner and above all men well suited to the present requirements of the country the russian we ﬁnd to our popular ideas which ever depict him knut in hand fraternises with the asiatics and in any case treats them with due consideration if they had right to live at least in their own country hence his undoubted popularity but we the quintessence of christianity and charity towards our neighbours habitually treat natives with much needless harshness and reserve which far from impressing the natives with our we renders us ridiculous in their eyes number of younger englishmen are beginning to be alive to this fact and instruction on this point should form part of the commercial training of our youths whose lives are to be spent in the east the other important bank in persia upon which great hopes are built although worked on different lines is the russian bank the société prêts perse it was at ﬁrst called when founded by poliakof f in it was an experiment intended to discover exactly what was wanted in the country and what was the best way to attract business the monopoly of public auctions was obtained in conjunction with the scheme which did not work very well at ﬁrst the natives not being accustomed to sudden innovations the concern subsequentl y developed into the bank estekrasi bank of loans or banque prêts perse it styled itself but ﬁnancially it did not pay and at one moment was expected to liquidate it is said that it then threatened to amalgamate with the imperial bank witte of petersbur g fame was consulted in the matter and took exactly hours to make up his mind on what was the best course to pursue he bought the bank up the state bank of petersbur g making an advance on the shares the minister of finance has right to name all the ofﬁcials in the bank who appearance sake are not necessarily all of russian nationality and the business is transacted on the same lines at the state bank of petersbur most efﬁcient man was sent out manager grube gentleman of much tact and most attractive manner and like genius in his way at ﬁnance man with thorough knowledge of the natives and their ways in the short time he has been in teheran the bank has made enormous strides by mere sound business capability and manly straightforward enterprise grube has i think the advantage of the manager of the imperial bank in the fact that when the russians know they have good man at the helm they let him steer his ship without interference he is given absolute power to what he thinks right and is in way hampered by shareholders at home this freedom naturally gives him very notable advantage over the imperial bank which always has to wait instructions from london grube with whom i had long and most interesting conversation told how he spends his days in the bazaar branch of his bank where he studies the ways and future possibilities of the country and its natives and the best ways of transacting business compatible with european principles and in particular carefully analysing the best ways of pushing russian trade and industries in persia in all this he has the absolute conﬁdence and help of his government and it is really marvellous how much he has been able to to further russian inﬂuence in persia there is trickery intrigue humbug about it but it is mere frank open comp etition in which the stronger nation will come out ﬁrst it was most gratifying to hear in what glowing terms of respect the managers of the two rival banks spoke of each other they were ﬁghting ﬁnancial duel bravely fairly and in most gentlemanly manner on both sides there was not the slightest shade of false play on either side and this i specially mention because of the absurd articles which one often sees in english papers written by hasty or correspondents russia trade owing to its convenien t geographical position is bound to beat the english in northern persia but it should be good lesson to us to see nevertheless how the russian government comes forward the protection of the trade of the country and does everything in its power to further it russia will even go so far to sell rubles at loss to merchants in order the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https trade in persia doubt with the certainty in sight that trade develops the apparent temporary loss will amply be compensated in due time by big proﬁts it is to an englishman quite an to watch how far the russians will go the absolute beneﬁt of their own trade and this conduct pursued openly and blamelessly can only be admired by any fair person it is only pity that we are not yet wide awake enough to the same the russian bank has branches in the principal cities of northern persia her business being so far merely conﬁned to the north footnotes 2 see institute of bankers chapter xv illegitimate the bank grand ﬁasco of the tobacco behaviour of the mullahs and nation gives up of the ant of european commercial houses and their and british rade new persian they are represented to be and what they employment of foreigners in maclean incident the work of the imperial bank has at various times been hampered by speculators who tried to make money by misleading the public their speculations were always based on the prestige of the bank instance take the bushire company and the fars trading company limited companies started by native merchants they illegally issued which strangely enough owing to the security found in the imperial found difﬁculty in circulating at small discount especially in shiraz naturally the imperial bank having in its conventions with the persian government the exclusive right to issue payable at sight protested against this infringement of rights but long time got little redress and some of the fraudulent are to this day circulating in southern persia sooner or later this was bound to interfere with the bank the natives unaccustomed to notes confused the ones with the others moreover the enemies of the bank took advantage of this confusion to instigate the people again st the imperial bank making them believe that the word imperial on the meant that the issuing of was only new scheme of the government to supply people with worthless paper instead of currency of sound silver cash in the southern provinces this stupid belief spread very rapidly and was necessarily accentuated by the issue of the illegal of local private concerns which although bearing foreign names were merely persian undertakings necessarily the many foreign speculations to which we have already referred can not be said to have strengthened conﬁdence in anything of european importation but the grand successive abortions of the belgian and russian were to make gas sugar glass matches hardly to be compared in their disastrous results to the magniﬁcent english ﬁasco of the tobacco corporation which not only came to grief itself but nearly caused revolution in the country it is how concession was obtained by british capitalists in 1890 to establish tobacco monopoly in persia which involved the usual payment of large sum to the shah and presents to high ofﬁcials the company made start on very grand scale in february 1891 having the whole monopoly of purchase and sale of tobacco all over persia sooner had it begun its work than commission of injured native merchants presented petition to the shah to protest against it decree was however published establishing the monopoly of the corporation all over persia and upon this the discontent and signs of rebellion began yet this affair of the tobacco monopoly showed what ﬁne digniﬁed people the persians can be if they choose the want of tact the absolute mismanagement and the lack of knowledge in dealing with the natives the ridiculous notion that coercion would at once force the persians to accept the tobacco supplied by the corporation fast collected dense cloud of danger overhead teheran and the other larger cities were placarded with proclamations instigating the crowds to murder europeans and away with their work but the persians notwithstanding their threats showed themselves patient and conﬁdent that the shah would restore the nation to its form er happiness in the meantime the company agents played the devil all over the empire it seems incredible even in the annals of persian history that so little lack of judgment could have been shown towards the natives the mullahs saw an excellent opportun ity to undo in few days the work of europ eans of several scores of years allah they preached to the people forbids you to smoke or touch the impure tobacco sold you by europeans on given day the mugte halh or high priest of sacred kerbalah declared that the faithful throughout the country must touch tobacco more tobacco the most cherished of persian indulgences mirza hassan ashtiani mujtehed of teheran on whom the shah relied to pacify the crowds now in ﬂagrant rebellion openly preached against his sovereign and stood by the veto of his superior priest at kerbalah he went further and exhorted the people to cease smoking not because tobacco was impure but because the koran says that it is unlawful to make use of any article which is not fairly dealt in by all alike at given date all through the shah this shows good deal of foreigner and his tobacco were to be treated with contempt tobacco was given up by all in the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https in the caravanserais in the streets in the houses where under ordinary circumstances every man puffed away at kalian chibuk small or cigarette not single soul could be seen smoking days and days only the shah made point of smoking in public to encourage the people but even his wife and the risk of incurring fused to smoke and smashed the kalians before his eyes in where the weaker than women could after weeks of abstinence not resist the temptation in secrecy their wives destroyed the pipes several weeks not single individual touched most digniﬁed protest which quite terriﬁed the shah and everybody indeed it was apparent that people so were not to be triﬂed with in many places the natives broke out into rebellion and many lives were lost shah frightened and perplexed called the high mullah of teheran to the palace january 1892 by his advice the tobacco monopoly was there and then abolished by an imperial decree and the privileges granted the sale and export of tobacco revoked furthermore the mullah only undertook to pacify the people on condition that all foreign enterprises and innovations in persia should be suppressed that all people imprisoned during the riots should be freed and the families of those killed fully indemniﬁed the sudden end of the tobacco corporation necessarily led to much correspondence with the british minister sir frank lascelles on the question of compensation and damages to the company which depending on its monopoly had entere d into agreements and had already paid out large sums of money it was ﬁnally agreed that the shah should pay sterling compensation and take over the assets of the company supposed to be some subject to realisation with the assistance of the bank of persia six per cent loan was issued which was taken up principally by the shareholders of the tobacco corporation the interest and the sinking fund of this loan were punctually met until the year 1900 when it was repaid in full on the conclusion of the russian loan in england this failure seems to have been ascribed to russian intrigue but it must in all fairness be said that had the russians tried simila r scheme in similar manner they would have fared even worse than we did even persian concerns established on european principles have serious troubles to contend with but it was madness to believe that an entire eastern nation could at moment notice be forced to way most offensive to an article of primary use tobacco which furthermore was offered at higher price than their own tobaccos which they liked better there are in persia few important european commercial houses such ziegler and and hotz and son which have extensive dealings with persians ziegler and deal in english imports and in the exportation of carpets whereas hotz and son import russian articles which they ﬁnd cheaper and of easier sale both are eminently respectable ﬁrms and enjoy the esteem of everybody notwithstanding the swiss name ziegler and is an english ﬁrm although far i know it has not single english employee in its various branches in persia the reason we have seen is that foreigners are considered more capable it has in the various cities some very able swiss agents who work most sensibly and excellently and who certainly manage to make the best of whatever business there is to be done in the country over thirty years the house has been established in persia having begun its life at tabriz and then extended to teheran resht meshed isfahan the latter so far shiraz bushire bandar abbas and bagdad where it has correspondents working the ﬁrm the house imports large quantities of manchester goods and exports chieﬂy carpets cloths opium and dried fruit the carpets which are specially made the european market are manufactured chieﬂy at sultanabad where thousands of hands are employed at the looms scattered about in private houses of the people and not in large factory the ﬁrm takes special care to furnish good wool and cottons coloured with vegetable dyes and not with aniline ancient patterns are selected and copied in preference to new designs of course besides these other carpets are purchased in other parts of the country carpets may be divided into three classes the scarce and most expensive pure silk rugs the lamsavieh or good quality carpets and the mojodeh or cheaper kind there is good demand the two latter qualities all over europe and in america articles specially dealt in are the cotton and wool fabrics called ghilim the designs of which are most artistic and to certain extent other fabrics such the vividly coloured kashan velvets the watered silks of resht the kerman cloths resembling those of cashmir the silver and gold embroidered brocades of yezd and the silk handkerchiefs manufactured in the various silk districts principally tabriz resht kashan and yezd the stamped and kalamkars in stringent colours upon white cotton also ﬁnd their way in large quantities to europe but are more quaint than beautiful large and ﬁgures are frequently attempted in these designs when of truly persian manufacture the colours are said to be quite permanent under the action of both light and water the ﬁrm of hotz and son deals in everything and has made good headway of late years it has large establishments at isfahan shiraz and bushire and two agencies one at ahwaz on the karun river and one in teheran groeneweg dunlop and while it has correspondents in bagdad busrah hongkong and rotterdam the head ofﬁces being in london its carpet manufacturing business in sultanabad is now carried on by the persian manufacturing the exports are similar to those of ziegler and there are also smaller ﬁrms particularly in teheran such the toko virion and others who retail business in piece goods and articles of any kind and are entirely in the hands of foreigners belgians austrians and french without reference to statistics which are absolutely worthless in country like persia the yearly foreign trade of persia divided between the gulf ports and the north and and frontiers may be put down roughly at some nine or ten millions sterling the russian trade in the north may be considered about equal to the britis h in the south then there are the goods brought by the abriz trade route from turkey and the mediterranean and by the another very important the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https extravagant system of farming prevailing until quite lately in persia well the uncertainties of customs and revenue returns makes it difﬁcult to give trustworthy ﬁgures but in future probably this year we may expect some more reliable data from the new belgian customs ofﬁce really sensible and administration organised by monsieur naus who is indeed to be congratulated on the success with which his efforts at bringing about so radical reform in the system of collecting duties have in so short time been crowned we often hear in england that the customs of persia are absolutely in the hands of russia and are worked by russian ofﬁcials even serious papers like the times publish misleading statements of this kind but nothing could be more erroneous naus at the head of the customs is belgian and so are nearly all the foreign employees there are one or two french i believe in persian employ but not single russian is to be found among their number that the russians hold comparatively triﬂing mortgage on the customs security their loan is true but long persia is able to pay interest on it russia has more power over the persian customs than we have under regular and honest management like the present the customs have already given considerable results and were it not the weakness of the government in the provinces the customs receipts might easily be doubled even without change in the tarif the duties levied in persia are determined by the treaty of turkmantchai with russia in 1828 by which uniform and reciprocal ﬁve per cent import and export was agreed to special convention nevertheless applying to turkey which ﬁxed reciprocal 12 per cent export and 6 per cent import duty and 75 per cent on tobacco and salt an attempt was made to negotiate new commercial treaty with russia last year but unfortunately matters did not go was expected by naus who was very keen on the subject high russian ofﬁcial was despatched to teheran who caused good deal of trouble and eventually the whole matter fell through regarding the employment of foreigners by the persian government it is not out of place to recall the maclean incident an agreement had been entered into with maclean british subject and former employee of the imperial bank to take charge of the mint in order to bring it up to date and work it on more principles than at present this led to demand from the russians that similarly high ofﬁce in the shah government should be given to russian so that this appoi ntment might not be taken slight against russia or if this were not possible that two or three russians might be employed instead in minor capacities in the new customs the persian government would not agree to this but owing to the pressure that had been brought to bear by the russians they felt obliged to dismiss maclean the british minister necessarily then stood up british rights and great scandal was made of the whole affair and an agreement three years had been signed the persian government had to pay the salary in full that period although they had only availed themselves of mr maclean services few months it is to be regretted that the sadrazam acted in so reckless manner the whole matter might have been settled quietly without the slightest disturbance and unpleasantness anyhow this led to decree being passed in 1901 that in future british subject russian and turk will be accepted in persian employ this inclu des the army with the exception of the special cossack regiment which had previously been formed under russian instructors it can safely be said that there is not single russian in any civil appointment in persia more than there is any britisher but in the customs service particularly naus being belgian nearly all the employees are belgian i have said with only one or two french lower subordinates the f irst p osition in p ersian w restling the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https wans or s trong m en giving d ispla y of f eats of s

chapter xvi russia on the apprehended invasion of russia the house of friendly understanding german peace of the ﬁrm policy of bold advance outlet in the persian policy of knowledge of foreign countries advantages of russian and british integrity there is unfortunately class of in have russia on the brain and those people see the russian everywhere and in everything every humble in india must be russian though he be an much is talked about russian invasion of india through tibet through afghanistan persia or beluchistan to any one happening to know these countries it is almost heartrending to hear such nonsense and worse still to see it repeated in serious papers which reproduce and comment upon it gravely the beneﬁt of the public in explanation and without going into many details i will only mention the fact that it is more difﬁcult than it sounds the sturdy russian march hundreds of miles across deserts without water men and animals or over high plateau like tibet where although suggested by the wise newspaper englishman at home sanatorium british troops in india the terriﬁc climate great altitudes lack of fuel and few other such triﬂes would reduce even the largest european army into very humble one at the end of journey across it then people seem to be ignorant of the fact that with mountainous natural frontier like the himahlyas maxim gun or two above each of the few passable passes would bring to reason any that it could get thus intended to cross over into india but besides have we not got soldiers to defend india why should we fear the russians are we not good they are why should we ever encourage the so far unconcerned russian to come to india by showing our fear it is neither manly nor has it any sense in it the russian has designs whatever upon india at does not even dream of advancing on should india eventually fall into russia is not it will never be by russian army marching into india from the north or or west the danger if there is any may be found probably very much nearer home in our own ignorance and blindness we also hear much about the infamy of russia in placing tariff on all goods in transit persia and we are told that this is another blow directed at english trade such is not the case russia i am told by people who ought to know would be only too glad to come to an understanding with england on some sensible basis but she certainly is not quite so unwise we are in letting germany her real enemy swamp her market with cheap goods the tariff is chieﬂy protection against germany of course if we choose to help germany to ruin russia markets well our own then we must suffer in consequence but looking ahead towards the future of asia it might possibly not be unwise to come to some sensible arrangement with russia by which her commercial interests and ours would mutually beneﬁt instead of suf fering they at present in persia we are playing rapidly losing game commercially i have already said we have lost northern persia and russian inﬂuence is fast advancing in southern persia this is surely the time to pull up and change our tactics or we shall go to the wall altogether joseph walton very ably put it before the house of commons on january 22nd 1902 in the case of russia we have at present to contend with abnormal conditions of competition it would therefore be wise the british government to reconsider its policy in order to maintain at least our commercial interests in southern persia the government of india too should take its share in upholding british directly concerned in affairs that regard the welfare of persia russia has gone to great expense to construct two excellent roads from the north into persia to facilitate russian commerce and it would be advisable if we were to the same from the south one of the roads the piri road is said to have cost including purchase of the kasvin teheran section something like half million sterling it is indeed idle walton said to adhere to methods of the past when foreign governments are adopting modern methods in order to achieve the commercial conquest of new regions the matter of establishing consulates too is of the greatest importance we ﬁnd even large trading cities like kermanshah yezd shiraz and birjand devoid of british consuls undoubtedly we should wish priority of right to construct roads and railways in southern the event of the persians failing to construct these be recognised and it seems quite sensible and fair to let persia give similar advantage to russia in northern persia nothing but friendly understanding between england and russia which should clearly deﬁne the respective spheres of inﬂuence will save the integrity of persia that country should remain an independent buffer state between russia and india but to bring about this result it is more than neces sary that we should support persia on our side much russia does on hers or the balance is bound to go in the latter favour the understanding with russia should i ﬁrmly believe russia would be only too anxious to acquiesce in protection against german commercial invasion and enterprise in the region of the persian gulf ot england bitterest the more to be dreaded because she is friendly enemy it is use to try and keep out russia merely to let germany reap any commercial advantages that may be that is the policy england is following at the present moment the question whether or we have secret agreement the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https in connection with the euphrates valley railway is serious one because although one can not but admire german enterprise in that quarter it would be well to support it only in places where it is not likely to be disastrous to our own trade and interests generally little or importance should be attached to the opinion of the russian press in their attacks upon england the inﬂuential men of russia well the emperor himself are certainly anxious to come to satisfactory understanding with england regarding affairs not only in persia but in asia generally an understanding between the two greatest nations in the world would long it lasted certainly maintain the peace of the world and would have enormous control over the smaller nations whereas petty combinations can be of little practical solid assistance or use to us i have pointed out before on sever al occasions 3 russia is not what she was half century ago she has developed enough to know her strength and power and her soldiers are probably the ﬁnest in the most practical and physically enduring her steady ﬁrm policy of bold advance in spite of our ridiculous remonstrances can but command the admiration of any person although we may feel sad very sad that we have men capable of standing up against it not with mere empty pompous words but with actual deeds which might delay or stop her progress matters are proceeding now we are only forwarding russia dream of possessing port in the persian gulf she wants it and she will doubt get it in chapters xxxiii and xxxiv the question of the point upon which her aims are directe d is gone into more fully the undoubted fact remains that notwithstanding our constant howling and barking she invariably gets what she wants and even more which would lead one to believe that at any rate her fear of us is not very great we are told that our which is meant towards russia is due to our inability to effect an entire reversal of our policy towards that country but this is not the case at all at any rate times and circum stances have changed our policy need not be altogether reversed but it must necessarily be subjected to modiﬁcations in order to meet changed conditions if we stand still while russia is going fast ahead we are perforce left behind the policy of drift which we seem to favour is bound to lead us to disaster and when we couple with it inefﬁcacious resistance and bigoted obstruction we can not be surprised if in the end it only yields us bitter disappointment extensive losses enmity and derision the policy of drift is merely caused by our absolute ignorance of foreign countries we drift simply because we not know what else to we hear noble lords in the governmen t say that the reason we did not lend persia the paltry two and half millions sterling was because men of business not lend money except on proper security and that before embarking on any such policy the government must be anxious to see whether the security is both sufﬁcient and suitable yes certainly but why did the government not see had the government seen they certainly would have effected the loan surely facts already mentioned in previous pages have proved very luminously our folly in taking the advice of incompetent men who judge of matters with which to say the least they are not familiar but the real question appears to be not how to make safe and proﬁtable ﬁnancial investment which is part of the functions of the british or any other government but rather whether it is not better to lay out certain sum valuable political object than to allow formidable competitor to so to our prejudice hence the disadvantageous position in which we ﬁnd ourselves at present all over asia but particularly in persia it would doubt be the perfection of an agreement if an amicable understanding could be arrived at with russia not only regarding persia but including china manchuria and corea well frank and fair adjustment of russian and british interests in these countries could be effected without serious difﬁculty mutual concessions could advantageously be granted and mutual advice and friendl y support would lead to remarkably prosperous results both countries russia notwithstanding all we hear of her would only be too glad to make sacriﬁces and concessions in order to have the friendship and support of england and russia friendship to england would i think be of very great assistance to british manufacturers it must be remembered that russia is an enormous country and that her markets both exports and imports are not to be despised in machinery alone huge proﬁts could be made well in cloths piece goods manchester goods worked iron steel etc articles of british manufacture are in much demand in russia and siberia and should the british manufacturer see his way to make articles required by the buyer very large proﬁts could be made in the russian market also huge proﬁts will eventually be made by the export of siberian products into england and the continent branch of industry which the russians themselves are attempting to push into the british market with the assistance of their government to return to persia it must not be forgotten that british imports into that country in 1900 amounted to whilst russia imported of british goods which after all is the customer best worth cultivating persia which takes of our goods or russia which buys from us it is mistake to believe that we are the only civilising agents of the world and that the work of other powers in that direction only tends to the stagnation of eastern peoples one might afﬁrm with more truth that our intercourse with the civilisation of the east tends to our own stagnation we impart to the natives it is true some smattering of the obsolete ways we possess ourselves but standing aside and trying to look upon matters with the eye of rational man it is really difﬁcult to say whether what we teach and how we teach it does really improve the eastern people or not personally with long experience of natives all over asia it appears to that it does not the russian though from british point of view altogether barbarian does not appear to spoil the natives quite so much in his work amon g them the natives under his régime seem happy and his work of civilisation is more of the patriarchal style tending more to enrich the people to promote commerce and trade on appropriate lines than to educate the masses according to western methods and laws the results are most decidedly good and anyhow lead to much greater contentment among the masses than we can secure instance in india above all things it makes peace the natives are treated with extreme consideration and kindness but at the same time they know that nonsense is tolerated and that is undoubtedly the way most appreciated by the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https persia it is to be hoped the peace of all that neither russia nor england will acquire any territorial rights but that the integrity of the shah empire may long be preserved only it would not be unwise to prepare emer gencies in case the half spoiled by european should one day collapse and make interference necessary the integrity of states in asia intended to serve buffers is all very well when such states can look after themselves but with misgovernment and want of proper reform in persia great trouble may be expected sooner than we imagine unless we on our side are prepared to help persia much russia does on her side if this can be done with little trouble to ourselves and in way agreeable to the persians there is reason why an independent state persia should not fully develop her resources reorganise her government and army become powerful nation and establish ﬂourishing trade russia and england proﬁting equally by the assistance given her footnotes 3 see china and the allies heinemann scribner chapter xvii but not instruc royal college in brain of persian on commercial education foreigners and englishman commercial training in british ays and colonies swamped with fast and ﬁrmly advancing to believe that the persians are illiterate would be mistake and to think that the masses of iran were properly educated would be greater mistake still but if i may be allowed the expression the average persian can not be better described than by saying he is educated in ignorance or in other words the average persian is educated yes but instructed if what the people are taught can be called we in england should not be the ﬁrst to throw stones at average persian is better educated than the average european but there is education and education it is difﬁcult to ﬁnd the commonest man in persian cities who can not read to certain extent and most people can also write little and have smattering of arithmetic the teaching except in the larger and principal centres is almost entirely in the hands of the mullahs so that naturally in our clerical schools religion is taught before all things verses of the koran are learnt by heart and the various rites and multiple religious ceremonies are pounded into the children brains and accessory religious sanitary duties of ablutions which are believed to purify the body and bring it nearer to allah are inculcated even in remoter villages the boys are taught these things in the mosques well little reading and enough writin g daily uses and how to add and subtract and multiply ﬁgures famous bits of national poetry and further passages from the koran are committed to memory iman j umeh head priest of teheran and ofﬁcial sayer of prayers to the shah in the large cities higher education can be obtained in the elaborate madr assahs adjoining the mosques and here too entirely at the hands of the mullahs but these higher colleges kind of university are only frequented by the richer and better people by those who intend to devote themselves to medicine to jurisprudence or to theological studies literature and art and science all based mostly on the everlasting koran are here taught fond the students spending many years in deep and serious study these are the and more common schools but new schools in european or style also exist and considering all things are really excellent in teheran royal college has been in existence some years it has foreign teachers besides native instructors educated in europe and supplies the highest instruction to the students modern languages are taught to perfection the higher mathematics international jurisprudence chemistry philosophy military strategy and i not know what else i understood from some of the professors that the students were remar kable their quickness and intelligenc compared with europeans and i myself on meeting some of the students who had been and others who were being instructed in the university was very much struck by their facility in learning matters so foreign the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https and by their astounding faculty of retaining what they had learnt it must be recollected that the various scientiﬁc lessons and lectures were delivered not in persian but in some foreign language usually french which intensiﬁed their difﬁculty of apprehending other private schools have also been started on similar principles in various parts of the empire even in yezd most excellent school on similar lines is to be found and will be described later on naturally the mullahs look askance upon these government schools in which foreign methods are adopted the alliance française of paris which has committee in teheran has opened french school under the direction of virioz certiﬁcated professor the school has nearly 100 pupils all natives this is primary school of which the studies are in french but mullah has been added to the staff to teach the koran and religious subjects in hamadan large jewish centre the alliance israelite has opened important schools which have largely drained the american presbyterian schools of their jewish pupils other secular schools it appears are to be opened in which foreign education is to be imparted and doub t this is ﬁrst and most excellent step of persia towards the improvement if not the actual reform of the old country not that the religious education received from the priests was without its good points the love literature and poetry which it principal ly expounded developed in the people the more agreeable qualities which have made the persian probably the most polite man on this earth the clerical education indeed worked ﬁrst upon the heart then upon the brain it taught reverence one parents love one neighbours and obedience to one superiors it expounded soft charitable ways in preference to aggression or the right instead of the is frequently the case in secular schools but softness consideration poetry and charity are things of the past they can only be indulged in by barbarians in civilisation unluckily there is very little use them except advertisement sake so the persians were wise to resort to our style of education which may yet be the means of saving their country they will lose their are fast beginning to that already ﬁlial love their charity and all the other good qualities they may possess only when these are gone will they rank in civilisation quite high any european nation the wealthier people send their sons to be educated abroad in european capitals and one can not help being struck by the wonderful ease with which these fellows master not only languages but science and extremely complex subjects whether this is due to the brain of young persians being fresher owing to its not having been overtaxed therefore the impressions are clearly received and ﬁrmly recorded or whether the mode of life is apt to develop the brain more than any other part of their anatomy is difﬁcult to say but the quickness and lucidity of the average young persian brain is certainly astounding when compared to that of europea n brains of the same ages the persian too has most practical way of looking at things he does take the trouble to sticking to one point of view but observing his subject from all round it were with good deal of philosophical humour that is of great help to him in all he underta kes and it is curious to see how fast and thoroughly the younger persians of better families can adapt themselves to european ways of thought and manner without the least embarrassment or concern in this i think they surpass any other asiatic nation the small community of the parsees of india alone excepted and here word or two on the education of englishmen intending to make living abroad especially in asia and particularly in persia will not i hope be out of place with the intercourse between east and west sufﬁcient stress can not be laid upon the fact that sound commercial education on principles is chieﬂy successful in coun tries under going the processes of development and that above all the careful study of foreign more the occupy the attention of the many students in our country who are to live in asia there is great deal too much time absolutely wasted in english schools over latin and greek not to mention the exaggerated importance given to games like cricket football tennis which if you like are all very well to develop the arms and legs but seem to have quite the reverse effect upon the brain yet what is required nowadays to carry man through the world are brains and not muscular development of limbs classical education it may be all right clergyman lawyer or man with high but unproﬁtable literary tastes but not fellows who are not only to be useful to themselves but indirectly to the mother country by developing the industries or trades of lands to be opened up if i may be permitted to say so one of the principal qualities which we should develop in our young men is the sense of observation in all its sense which is sadly neglected in english education it has always been my humble experience that one learns more of use in one hour keen observation than by reading all the books in the world and when that sense is keenly developed it is quite extraordinary with what facility one can things which the average unobservant man thinks utterly impossible it most certainly teaches one to simplify everything and always to select the best and easiest way in all one undertakes which after all is the way leading to success again when observation is keenly developed in fact anything be learnt with amazing facility the knack of learning languages is only due to observation the greatest scientiﬁc discoveries have been due to mere observation the greatest commercial enterprises are based on the practical results of observation but it is astounding how few people really observe not only carefully but at all the majo rity of folks might well be blind what they see themselves they follow like sheep what they are told to and make their sons and grandsons the same and few countries suf fer more from this than england when travelling in the east one can not help being struck by the difference of young englishmen and foreigners employed in similar capacities in business places the foreigner is usually ﬂuent in four ﬁve or six different languages and has smattering of scientiﬁc knowledge which if not very deep is at any rate sufﬁcient the purposes required he is well up in engineering electricity the latest inventions explorations discoveries and commercial devices he will talk sensibly on almost any subject he is moderate in his habits and careful with his money now take the young englishman he seldom knows well more than one language occasionally one ﬁnds fellows who can speak two tongues ﬂuently rarely one who is conversant with three or four his conversation generally deals with drinks the latest or coming races the relative values of the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https jockeys and subsequent offers to which he is most proﬁcient the local polo if there is any or tennis tournaments afford further subject conversation and then the lack of discussible topics is made up by more friendly calls drinks the same subjects are gone through with variations time after time and that is about all now i maintain that this should not be so because taking things all round the young englishman is really au fond brighter and inﬁnitely more intelligent than foreigners it is his education and mode of living that are at fault not the individual himself and this our cousins the ameri cans have long since discovered hence their steaming ahead of us in every line with the greatest ease we hear that the englishman is good at learning languages but that is again great mistake i not believe that there is any other nation in europe after the russians who have greater properly are more capable of learning languages to perfection than the english i am not referring to every shameless holiday tripper on the continent who makes himself buffoon by using misapplied mispronounced istaught french or italian or german sentences but i mean the rare observant englishman who studies languages seriously and practically speaking from experience in my trave extend more or less all over the have ever found that englishmen when put to it could learn languages perfectly hence my remarks which may seem blunt but are true truly there is reason why the gift of learning languages should be neglected in england gift which i think is greatly facilitated by developing in young people musical qualities if any and training the ear to observe and receive sounds correctly fact to which we are just beginning to wake up it is undoubted that the command of several languages gives commercia l man an enormous advantage in the present race of european nations in trying to obtain comme rcial superiority but the command of language requires too to limited extent the additional etiquette of ways and manners appropriate to it to make it quite efﬁcient and these well the proper manner of speaking the language itself can only i repeat be learnt by personal observation the germans train commercial men specially the east men who visit every nook of asiatic countries where trade is to be developed and closely study the natives their ways of living their requirements reporting in the most minute manner upon them so that the german manufacturers may provide suitable articles the various markets in the speciﬁc case of persia russia the predominant country in the north does exactly the same the russian manufacturer studies his client his habits his customs and supplies him with what he desires and cherishes and does not like the british manufacturer export to eastern countries articles which may very well suit the farmer the cyclist or the cabman in england but not the persian agriculturist or highwayman the everlasting argument that the british manufacturer supplies better article borders very much on the idiotic first of all setting apart the doubt whether he does really supply better article what is certain is that better article may not be of the kind that is wanted at all by the people there are in this world climates and climates peoples and peoples religions and religions houses and houses customs and customs and therefore the english article allowing it to be which suits english people is not always adapted all other countries climates and usages another prevalent mistake in this country is to believe that the persian or any other oriental will only buy cheap things the oriental may endeavour to strike that is one of the chief pleasures of his existence though fault which can easily be counter but he is ever ready to pay well what he really wants thus if because of his training in ﬁghting he requires certain curl and particular handle to his knife if he fancies particular pattern printed or woven in the fabrics he imports and if because of his religious notions he prefers his silver spoons drilled with holes there does not seem to be any plausible reason why his wishes should not be gratiﬁed long he pays the articles supplied we who own half the world and ought to know better by this time seem constantly to forget that our customs and ways seem ridiculous to orientals to some of ourselves too quite ridiculous theirs to us in some cases even great offence can be caused by trying to enforce our methods too suddenly upon eastern countries civilised people may prefer to blow their noses with an expensive silk handkerchief which they carefully fold up with contents into the most prominent pocket of their coats the unclean oriental may prefer to close one nostril by pressing it with his ﬁnger and from the other forcibly eject extraneous matter to distance of several feet away by violent blowing repeating the operation with the other nostril this may be thought not quite graceful but is certainly most effective method and possibly cleaner than ours in the end we may fancy it good manners when in public to show little more of our shirts than the collar and cuffs but the persian or the hindoo instance prefers to let the garment dangle to its full extent outside so to show its design in full again we may consider it highly unbecoming and improper ladies to show their lower limbs above the ankle the persian lady thinks nothing of that but deems it shocking to show her face and so we could go on and on in fact with the persians one might almost go far saying that with the exception of eating and drinking and few other matters they most things in contrary way to ours they remove their shoes when we would remove our hats they shave their heads and let the beard grow they sleep in the day and sit up the greater portion of the night they make windows in the roof instead of in the walls they inoculate smallpox instead of vaccinating to prevent it they travel by night instead of by day it would be absurd to believe that we can alter in day the customs religio ns and manners of millions of natives and it seems almost incomprehensible that in such long colonial experience ours we have not yet been able to grasp so simple fact but here again comes in my contention that our failing is absolute lack of observation unless it be indeed our conceited notion that other people must rise up to our standard anyhow we have lost and are losing heavily by it we see the germans and austrians swamping our own colonies with goods wherewith our bazaars in india are overﬂowing whereas engli sh cottons are seldom to be seen in the bazaars this seems indeed curious state of affairs nor we need to go to india england itself is overﬂowing with goods now why should it not be certainly more meet the wishes of natives of eastern countries and give them what they want the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https is another matter which greatly hampers the british manufacturer in his dealings with persians particularly it is well to recollect that the blunt way we have of transacting business does not always answer with orientals impatience too of which we are ever brimful is bad quality to possess in dealings with persians times have gone by when england had practically the monopoly of the trade of the east and could lay down the law to the buyers the inﬂux of europeans and the extension of trade to the most remote corners of the globe have increased to such an extent during the last few with these the exporter can longe r use the slack easy ways of ago when comm ercial supremacy was in our hands and must look out himself knowledge of the language with conciliatory courteous manner good stock of patience and fair capacity sherbet hot tea and coffee will in persia carry trader much further in his dealings than the smarter ways appreciated in england or america and another point to be remembered in countries where the natives are they are in persia is that personal inﬂuence and the natives can never dissociate from the bargain in very long way towards successful trading in iran this is to my mind one of the principal reasons of russian commercial successes in northern persia we will not refer here to the ridiculous idea so prevalent in england that russia was never and never will be manufacturing country russia is very fast developing her young industries which are pushed to the utmost by her government and what is more the work is done in remarkably practical way by people who possess thorough knowledge of what they are doing the natives and the geographical features of the country have been carefully studied and the russian trading scheme is carried ﬁrmly and steadily on an unshakable base we sit and express astonishment at russian successes in persia the people at home can hardly be made to realise them and i have heard people even discredit them but this is only the beginning and nothing to what we shall see later on unless we proceed to work on similar sensible lines it certainly arouses admiration to see what the russians can and how well they can it with ridiculously small capital when we waste absolutely waste immense sums and accomplish nothing or even the reverse of what we intend to accomplish but there again is the difference between the observant and the unobservant man chapter xviii persia industrial mineral and agricultural of various ghilan eheran and the surrounding and caspian astrabad and activity and concessions in malayer and borujird nomads of tribes of pastoral people of beluchistan the geographical situation of persia its extent the altitude of its plateau above the sea level its vast deserts and its mountain ranges give the country good selection of climates temperatures and vegetation we have regions of intense tropical heat and of almost arctic cold we have temperate regions we have healthy regions and regions where everybody is fever regions with moist air plenty of water and big marshes and dreary waterless deserts necessarily such natural conditions are bound to give great variety of resources which show themselves in various guises quick survey of the agricultural industrial and mineral resources of the principal provinces of persia according to information may not be out of place and will help the reader to appreciate the journey through some of the districts mentioned we have already been through ghilan with its almost temperate climate in the lowlands but damp in the northern portion where fever is rampant but where at the same time luxuriant vegetation with thick forests grass in abundance paddy ﬁelds the extensive cultivation of rice vineyards cotton wheat tobacco sugar fruit and all kinds of vegetable s nourish while the production of silk export on large and might be increased enormously if more modern methods were and wool and cotton fabrics mostly the persian market are manufactured it exports mostly to russia great quantities of dried fruit wool cotton and tobacco made into cigarettes salt ﬁsh caviare and oil of ghilan we ﬁnd teheran on high plateau its situation giving it delightful and healthy climate but very scanty agricultural resources owing to lack of water in and near the capital city there are good gardens grown at considerable expense and trouble but very little other vegetation we have seen in previous chapters what the industries of the capital both native and foreign are and what they amount to there is also manufacture of glazed tiles quite artistic but not to be compared in beauty of design colour and gloss with the ancient ones teheran is dependent on the neighbouring provinces and europe nearly everything this is not however the case with isfahan the ancient capital in the province of which cotton wheat indian corn tobacco and opium are grown in fair quantities the export mules and horses are reared and there are several ﬂourishing industries such metal work leather tanneries gold and silver work and silk and wool fabrics to the east we have khorassan and sistan great country with some good pastures and also producing opium sugar dates and cotton in summer the northe rly winds sweeping over the desert are unbearable and the winter is intensely cold in the northern part of khorassan snow falls during the coldest months but in sistan the winter is temperate life is extremely cheap natives in sistan which is favourite resort camel men and their beasts both from afghanistan and beluchistan northern khorassan is the great centre of turquoise mining copper and coal are also found there but its local trade now that the export of grain is forbidden is mostly in opium worked leather wool and excellent horses which can be purchased very little money camels both loading and riding or camels are also reared here in the southern portion of the province the northern part being too cold them in winter the handsomest and richest districts of persia but not the healthiest are undoubtedly the northern ones on the caspian sea or bordering on russian territory such mazanderan astrabad the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https in the ﬁrst two rice is grown in large quantities castor wheat cotton and barley and in mazanderan extensive pasturages are found on the hills sheep but not so in astrabad which owing to its peculiar formation is exposed to broiling heat on the sandy wastes and to terriﬁc cold on the mountains but has fairly temperate climate in the southern portion of the province if the production of silk is mostly agricultural districts at one time mazanderan had beautiful forests which are now fast being destroyed considerable bartering is carried on between the towns and the nomad tribes in rugs carpets horses and mules against grain rice felts and woollen cloths of local manufacture azerbaijan the most northern province of persia with tabriz centre is very rich in agricultural products particularly in rice and wheat notwithstanding the severe climate in winter when the snowfall is rather heavy and the thermometer down to below zero centigrade in february there are good vineyards in the neighbourhood of tabriz and most excellent vegetabl es and fruit tobacco is successfully grown and manufactured the pipe and into cigarettes the heat in summer is intense with hot winds and dust storms but owing to the altitude feet at tabriz the nights are generally cool in the spring there are torrential rains and also towards the end of the autumn but the months of may june october and november are quite pleasant the local trade of azerbaijan is insigniﬁcant but being on the russian border the transit trade has of late assumed large proportions and is increasing fast the importation instance of by russia is growing daily and also the importation of silk in cocoons and manufactured velvet woollen goods various cotton goods raw wool dyes such henna indigo cochineal and others and sugar the principal import of all with the exception of tea indigo and cochineal which come from india the imports into azerbaijan come almost altogether from russia turkey hungary and france the russian trade in sugar is enormous from this quarter the carpet trade which at one time seemed to be dying out is now about to enter on prosperous phase but not so the which does not go beyond the local market firearms are manufactured and sold to the kurds and jewellery is made but the principal exports are dried fruit raisins almonds pistachios chieﬂy to russia and turkey also gum oils raw metals copper iron hides precious stones alimentary products honey and dried vegetables various kinds of wood live stock mainly sheep and oxen tobacco raw and manufactured dyes and raw and manufactured cotton and silk carpets rugs and cloth all these exports are to russia and turkey and not all necessarily come from azerbaijan the russians are displaying great activity in this province and have established an important branch of their banque et prêts perse they have obtained road railway and mining concessions and according to the report of our consul in tabriz the russian bank makes advances to the extent of ﬁfty per to merchants dealing in russian goods especially to native exporters of dried fruit such advances being repaid in russia by the sale of such produce or in persia by the sale of corresponding imports of manufactured goods tabriz itself being centre of export of the produce of northern persia is promising ﬁeld banking enterprise and will assume greater importance even than it has now when the carriage road scheme concession which was granted by the shah is completed and furnishes easier communication trade and travelling purposes russian engineers are said to have surveyed and mapped the country the establishment of railway system in azerbaijan the mineral resources of azerbaijan are said to be considerable iron being found in rich deposits of hematite sulphur copper and arsenical pyrites bitumen lignite salt mineral ferruginous and sulphurous springs and variegated marble similar geological formation is found extending to hamadan where beds of lignite and anthracite exist and ﬁne marbles and granites are to be found here too we have triﬂing market local produce but considerable transit trade between the capital and kermanshah bagdad and tabriz hamadan is mostly famous its capital tanneries of leather and its metal work but its climate is probably the worst in persia if the suffocating gulf coast is cold in winter and spring moist and rainy during the rest of the year this produces good pasturages and gives excellent vegetables wine of sorts and ﬂourishing poppy speciality of the province the same remarks might apply to the adjoining south malayer and borujird districts which however possess more temperate climate although liable to sudden terriﬁc storms accompanied by torrential rains there is great deal of waste lands in these regions but where irrigated and properly cultivated wheat ﬂourishes well fruit trees vines vegetables poppies cotton and tobacco the people are extremely industrious being occupied chieﬂy in foreign export and preparing opium and dried fruit well dyed cottons gold dust is said to be found in beds of streams and traces of copper in quartz other provinces such kurdistan are inhabited by nomadic peoples who have small trade in horses arms opium wool and dates but the cultivation of land is necessarily much neglected except the supply of local needs in many parts it is almost impossible ﬁve or six winter months the soil is buried in snow and the heat of the summer is unbearable there seem to be intermediate seasons the people live mostly on the caravan trafﬁc from bagdad to various trading centres of persia and they manu facture coarse cloths rugs and earthenware of comparatively little marketable value naphtha does exist well other bituminous springs but it is doubtful whether the quantity is sufﬁcient and whether the naphtha wells are accessible enou gh to pay their exploitation that naphtha does exist not only in kurdistan but in luristan and all along the zone extending south of the caucasus is possible but whether those who bore wells oil in those regions will make fortunes similar to those made in the extraordinarily rich and exceptionally situated baku region is dif ferent matter altogether which only the future can show the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https d ivan who was at various periods governor of shiraz and khorassan the tribes of are somewh at wild and unreliable on the mountain sides are capital pasturages certain amount of grain tobacco and fruit are grown principally local consumption in luristan too we have partly noma d pastoral population being mountainous region there are extremes of temperature in the plains the heat is terriﬁc but higher up the climate is temperate and conducive to good pasturages and even forests in the mounta in district here too wheat rice and barley are grown successfully in huge quantities and the vine ﬂourishes at certain altitudes well fruit trees the local commerce consists principally in live stock the horses being quite good and there is brisk trade in arms and ammunition there remain now the large districts of khuzistan better known arabistan farsistan and laristan the heat in these provinces is terrible during the summer and the latter district is further exposed to the scirocco winds of the gulf carrying with them suffocating sand clouds if properly developed and if the barrage of the karun river at ahwaz were put in thorough repair the plains of arabistan could be made the richest in persia wheat rice and forage were grown in enormous quantities at one time and cotton tobacco henna indigo and sugar but this regio n being of special interest to britain special chapter is devoted to it well to the possibili ties of farsistan and laristan to which future reference will be made the trade in shiraz wines is fairly developed and they are renowned all over persia considering the primitive method in which they are made they are really excellent especially when properly matured the better ones resemble rich sherries madeira and port wine indigo horses mules and carpets form the trade of the province which they say possesses undeveloped mineral resources such sulphur lead presumed deposits of coal mercury antimony and nickel persian beluchistan is quite undeveloped so far and mostly inhabited by nomad tribes somewhat in many parts and difﬁcul t to deal with they manufacture rugs and and breed good horses and sheep their trade is insigniﬁcant and good deal of their country is barren the climate is very hot and in many parts most unhealthy chapter xix persian of nomzad or ofﬁcial betrothal wedding ceremony in the wedding of sheep and last obstacle the ruhmah bride bridegroom famous well unfaithful omen of property the general european idea about persian matrimonial affairs is about inaccurate is nearly every other european popular notion of eastern customs we hear great deal about harems and we fancy that every persian must have dozens of wives while there are people who seriously believe that the shah has less than one wife each day of the year or 365 in all that is all very pretty ﬁction but dif fers considerably from real facts first of all it may be well to repeat that by the mahommedan doctrine man can have more than four wives and this on the speciﬁed condition that he is able to keep them in comfort in separate houses with separate attendants separate personal jewellery and that he will look upon them equally showing special favour to any of them which may be the cause of jealousy or envy all these conditions make it impossible any man of sound judgment to embark in polygamy most persians therefore only have one wife another important matter to be taken into consideration is that persian woman of good family will ever marry man who is already married so that the chances of legal polygamy become at once very small indeed in young men of the better classes who not wish to ruin their career by marrying below their own level an exception should be made with the lower and wealthy middle classes who ﬁnd satisfaction in numbers to make up quality and who are the real polygamists of the count ry but even in their case the real wives are never above the number permitted by the koran the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https being merely concubines whether temporary or permanent the shah himself has more than one ﬁrst wife with two or three secondary ones in country where women are kept in strict seclusion they are in persia the arrangement of matrimony is rather complicated matte everybody knows that in mussulman countries girl can only be seen by her nearest relations who by law can not marry her such her father grandfather brothers and not by her cousins weddings between cousins are very frequently arranged in persia it falls upon the mother or sisters of the bridegroom to pick suitable girl him rule among folks of their own class and report to him in glowing terms of her charms social and ﬁnancial advantages if he has mother and sisters then complaisant old lady friend of the family undertakes to act middlewoman there are also women who are professio nal quite remunerative line of business i am told anyhow when the young man has been sufﬁciently allured into matrimonial ideas if he has any common sense he generally wishes to see the girl before saying yes or this is arranged by subterfuge the women of the house invite the girl to their home and the young fellow is hidden behind screen or window or wall wherein convenient apertures have been made him unperceived to have good look at the proposed young lady this is done several times until the boy is quite satisﬁed that he likes her the primary difﬁculty being settled his relations proceed on visit to the girl father and mother and ask them to favour their son with their daughter hand if the young man is considered well off sober and eligible in every way consent is given day is arranged the ofﬁcial betrothal day all the relations friends and acquaintances of the two families are invited and the women are entertained in the harem while the men sit outside in the handsome courts and gardens the bridegroom relations have brought with them presents of jewellery accord ing to their means and positions in life with number of expensive shawls ﬁve six seven or

lavishly provided the entertainment of guests on lar ge or small scale according to the position of the parents some time elapses between this ﬁrst stage of young man doom and the ceremony the legal contract and actual wedding there is special period of time speciﬁed and the parties can well please themselves to the time when the nuptial union is to be ﬁnally ef fected when the day comes the parties not go to the mosque nor the convenient registry is not yet civilised enough the mujtehed or high priest is sent who brings with him great many other mullahs the number in due proportion to the prospective backshish they are to receive their services the wedding ceremony takes place in the bride house where on the appointed day bands dancing singing and sweets in profusion are provided the great number of guests invited the high priest eventually adjourns to the harem where all the women have collected with the bride the room being partitioned off with curtain behind which the women sit the bride and her mother or other lady occupy seats directly behind the curtain while the priest with the bridegroom and his relations take places in the vacant portion of the room the priest in stentorian voice calls out to the girl this young man son of wants to be your slave will you accept him your slave reply trepidation on the bridegroom part the priest repeats his question in yet more stentorian voice again reply the women collect round the bride and try to induce her to answer they stroke her on her back and caress her face but she sulks and is shy and plays with her dress but says nothing when the buzzing noise of the excited behind the curtain has subsided the priest returns to his charge while the expectant bridegroom under goes the worst quarter of an hour of his life the third time of asking is generally the last and twice the girl has already not answered it is terrible moment evidently she is not over anxious to bring about the alliance or is the reluctance mere feminine expedient to make it understood from the beginning that she is only conferring great favour on the bridegroom by condescending to marry him the latter hypothesis is correct when the priest thunders the third time his former question faint voice tantalizing heard to say y es the bridegroom now that this cruel ordeal is over begins to breathe again the priest is not yet through his work and further asks the girl whether she said yes out of her will or was forced to say it then he appeals to the women near her to testify that this was so and that the voice he heard behind the curtain was actually the girl voice these various important points being duly ascertained in appropriate arabic words the priest exclaims i have married this young lady to this man and this man to this young lady the men present on one side of the curtain nod and in arabic say they accept the arrangement the women are overheard to say words to the same effect from the other side of the partition congratulations are exchanged and more sherbet tea and sweets consumed the religious ceremony is over but not the trials of the bridegroom now legal husband when sufﬁcient time has elapsed him to recover from his previous mental anguish he is conveyed by his mother or women relatives into the harem all the women are veiled and line the walls of the where solitary chair or cushion on the ﬂoor is placed at the end of the room he is requested to sit upon it which he meekly does small tray is now brought in with the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https gold coins silver if the people are poor mixed with sweets the bridegroom bends his head and sweets and coins are poured upon his back and shoulders being coins not the run about and are scattered all over the room all the ladies present gracefully stoop and seize one pellet of gold which is kept good luck then servants are called in to collect the remainder which goes to their special beneﬁt this custom is not unlike our ﬂinging rice luck at married couple the bridegroom then returns to the men quarters where he receives the hearty congratulations of relatives and friends alike from this moment the girl becomes his wife and the husband has the right to see her whenever he chooses but not to cohabit with her until further ordeals have been gone through the husband comes to meet his wife conversation sake in specially reserved room in the harem and each time he comes he brings presents of jewellery or silks or other valuables to ingratiate himself so that by the time the real wedding takes place they can get to be quite fond of one another there is special limit of time the last ceremony to be celebrated it is merely suited to the convenience of the parties when all necessary arrangements are settled and circumstances permit usually ten days or less before the wedding procession takes place festival is held in the bridegroom house when the mullahs the friends acquaintances relations and neighbours are guests being entertained on each night music dancing and lavish refreshments are again provided the guests the men of course are entertained separately in the men quarter and the women have some fun all to themselves in the harem on the very last evening of the festival grand procession is formed in order to convey the bride from her house to that of her husband he the husband waits her at his residence where he is busy entertaining guests all the bridegroom relations with smart if he is in some ofﬁcial position most persians of good families are infantry and cavalry soldiers bands and large following of friends and servants on horseback and on foot proceed to the bride house special carriage is reserved the bride and her mother or old lady relation and another the bridesmaids she is triumphantly brought back to the bridegroom house her relations and friends adding to the number in the procession guns are ﬁred and ﬁreworks let off along the road and from the bride and bridegroom houses one good feature of all persian festivities is that the poor are never forgotten so when the bride is driven along the streets great many sheep and camels are sacriﬁced before her carriage to bring the bride luck and to feed with their ﬂesh the numberless people who congregate round to divide the meat of the slaughtered animals in the house of the bridegroom too any number of sheep are sacriﬁced and distributed among the poor there are great rejoicings when the procession arrives at the house where the bridegroom is anxiously awaiting to receive his spouse she alights from the carriage more sheep are sacriﬁced on the the husband too is sacriﬁced to certain extent again he has to content himself with merely conducting his bride to the harem and to leave her there it is only late in the evening when all the guests stuffed with food have departed that the husband is led by his best man to special room prepared him and his wife in the harem the bride comes in heavily veiled in the company of her father or some old and revered relation who clasps the hands of husband and wife and joins them together making short and appropriate speech of congratulation and good wishes happy conjugal existence then very wisely retreats there is yet another obstacle the removal of the long embroidered veil which hangs gracefully over the bride head down to her knees this difﬁculty is easily surmounted by another present of jewellery known the ruhmuhah or reward showing the face there is further reward needed after that and they are at last husband and wife not only in theory but in fact true some gold coins have to be left under the furniture to appease expecting servants and the next day fresh trials have to be endured by the bride who has to receive her lady friends and accept their most hearty congratulations this means more music more professional dancing more sweets more sherbet more tea but gradually even the festivities die out and wife and husband can settle down to really happy quiet family life devoid of temptations and full of and thoughtfulness ten days before this last event takes place the wife is by custom compelled to send to the husband house the endowment which by her contract she must supply the whole furniture of the apartments complete from the kitchen to the both the man quarter and her own besides involves her in considerable of course further conveys with her anything of which she may be the rightful owner her father if f will frequently present her on her with one or more villages or sum in cash and occasionally will settle on her what would go to her in the usual course of time after his death all case of divorce or the wife property on the other hand the bridegroom or his parents him have to settle sum of money on the bride before she consents to the marriage and this is legally settled upon her by the mullah in the wedding contract she has right to demand it whenever she pleases it can be seen by all this that persian legal marriage is not simple matter nor cheap undertaking the expense and formalities connected with each wedding are enormous so that even if people were inclined to polygamy it is really most difﬁcult them to carry their desire into effect among the nobility it has become unfashionable and is considered quite immoral to have more than one wife partly because the marriages are seldom the outcome of fast burning partly because it is difﬁcult husban d and almost impossible wife to be unfaithful divorces in persia are not common besides on divorcing wife the husband has to pay her in full the settlement that has been made upon her and this prevents many rash attemp t to get rid of the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https to kill an unfaithful wife is in the eyes of persians cheaper and less degrading way of obtaining justice against an unpardonable wrong one hears good deal in persia about famous and extraordinarily deep shiraz i which untrue wives were precipitated by their respective offended husbands or by the public executioner and also how dishonoured women are occasionally stoned to death but these cases are not very frequent nowadays the persian woman is above all her husband most intimate friend he conﬁdes nearly secrets to her she does the same or nearly the same with him their interests are mutual and the love their own children unbounded each couple absolutely severed from the outside world forbidden to get intoxicated by their religion with excitements to speak of and the wife in strict is really alternative left them than to be virtuous women have in persia in other countries great inﬂuence over their respective husbands and through these mediums feminine power extends very far both in politics and commerce at the husband death the property is divided among his children each male child taking two shares to each one share every girl part after of the whole property has been paid to the deceased widow who is entitled to that amount by right most praiseworthy union exists in most persian families ﬁlial love and veneration parents being quite strong paternal or maternal affection extreme reverence old age in any class of man is another trait to be admired in the persian character chapter xx persian surmah of descendants of and teeth and persian woman indoor tadji and other chakchur chudder persia they say is the country of the loveliest women in the world it probably has that reputation because few foreign male judges have ever seen them the persians themselves certainly would prefer them to any other women still there is doubt from what little one sees of the persian woman that she often possesses very beautiful languid eyes with good deal of animal magnetism in them her skin is extremely white that of an italian or french slight yellowish tint which is attractive they possess when young very well modelled arms and legs the only fault to be found among the majority of them being the frequent thickness of the wrists and ankles which rather takes away from their reﬁnement in the very highest classes this is not so accentuated the women are usually of fair height not too small and carry themselves fairly well particularly the women of the lower classes who are accustomed to carry weights on their head the better women walk badly with long steps and consequent stoop forward whereas the poorer ones walk more ﬁrmly with movement of the hips and with the spine well arched inwards the neck lacks length but is nicely rounded and the head well set on the shoulders anatomically the body is not striking either its beauty or its strength or suppleness the breasts except with girls of very tender age become deformed and very pendant and the great tendency to fatness rather interferes with the artistic beauty of their outlines the skeleton frame of persian woman is curiously constructed the nes being extremely developed and broad whereas the shoulder blades and shoulders altogether are very narrow and undeveloped the hands and feet are generally good particularly the hand which is less developed and not so coarse the lower limbs generally and the feet in particular the ﬁngers are usually long and quite supple with nails the thumb is nevertheless hardly ever in good proportion with the rest of the hand it generally lacks length and character the feet bear the same characteristics the hands except i have said that they are inﬁnitely coarser why this should be i can not explain except that intermarria ge with different races and social requirements may be the cause of it persian w oman and c hild the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https p icturesque b eggar g irl the head i have left to the last because it is from an artist point of view the most picturesque part of persian woman anatomy it may possibly lack ﬁne chiselled features and angularity and the ﬁrst impression one receives on looking at persian woman face is that it wants strength and the lines of the face being broad uninterrupted curves the nose is broad and rounded the cheeks round the chin round the lips large voluptuous and seldom tightly closed in fact the lower lip is frequently drooping but when it comes to eyes eyelashes and eyebrows there are few women in the world who can compete with the persian there is exuberant ﬁre and expression in the persian feminine organs of vision large and and softened by eyelashes of abnormal lengt h both on the upper and lower lid the powerful curved eyebrows extend far into the temples where they end into ﬁne point from the nose over which they are very frequently joined the iris of the eye is abnormally large of very rich dark velvety brown with jet black pupils and the white of the eye is of much darker tinge than with light bluish grey the women seem to have wonderful control over the muscles of the eyelids and brows which render the eyes dangerously expressive the habit of artiﬁcially blackening the under lid with surmah too adds to mean extent to the luminosity and vivid power of the eyes in contrast to the alabaster really beautiful skin of the younger persian women i said younger owing to racial and climatic conditions the persian female is woman in every way at the age of ten or twelve sometimes even younger they generally keep in good compact condition until they are about twenty or when the fast expanding process begins deforming even the most beautiful into shapeless masses of ﬂesh and fat they are said however to be capable of bearing children till the mature age of forty to although from my own observation to forty i should take to be the more common average at which persian women are in full possession of proliﬁc powers in the case of sayids the descendants of mahommed both sexes of whom are reputed their extraordinary powers and vitality women are said not to become sterile till after the age of ﬁfty whether this is fact or not i can not say but it is certain that the sayids are superior race altogether more wiry and less given to and smoking ch may account their natural powers being preserved to later age than with most other natives of persia their women are very proliﬁc sayid men and women are noticeable even from tender age their robustness and handsome features they are digniﬁed and serious in their demeanour honest and trustworthy and are ﬁne race altogether infanticide after birth is not very common in persia but abortion artiﬁcially procured has particularly of late become frequent the prevention of large families that can not be supported this is done by primitive methods not dissimilar to those used in european countries medicine is occasionally also administered internall these cases are naturally illegal and although the law of the country is rather such matters any palpable case if discovered would be severely punished the umbilicus of children is inevitably tied by doctor and not by member of the family with some nations circumcision is practised on male children when at the age of forty days it is merely performed sanitary precaution and is not under gone religion sake there are few countries where deformities and abnormalities are common they are in persia in women less than in men still they too are afﬂicted with good share of nature freaks the harelip is probably the most common abnormality webbed and additional ﬁngers and toes come next marks are very very lar ge black moles on the face and body persian ears are very seldom beautiful they are generally more or less malformed and somewhat coarse in modelling although they seem to answer pretty well the purpose which they are created but although the hearing is very good in general sense i found that the persian of either sex had great difﬁculty in differentiating very ﬁne modulations of sounds and this is probably due to the under or degeneration of the auricular organ just the same in the ears of purely races to an observant eye to my mind there is part of people anatomy that shows character and reﬁnement more plainly than the ear much more delicate in texture than the hands or feet the ear is on the other hand less subject to misleading modiﬁcations by artiﬁcial causes which are bound to affect the other extremities the ear of persian is in the greater percentage of cases the ear of degenerate it is coarse and lumpy and somewhat shapeless with animal qualities strongly marked in it occasionally one does come across good ear in persia but very rarely the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https remarks might apply to teeth when young men and women have good teeth of fairly good shape and length and frequently so very ﬁrmly set in their sockets to allow their possessors to lift heavy weights with them pulling ropes tight when the strength of the hands is not sufﬁcient one frequently notices however irregularity or additional again by intermixture of upper teeth not ﬁtting properly the lower ones and causing undue friction early injury to the enamel and consequent decay this is also greatly intensiﬁed by the unhealthy state of persian blood especially in people inhabiting the cities where the worst of venereal complaints has crept in more or less virulent form into the greater part of the population add to this disor ganized digestion coloration by constant smoking and the injury to the enamel brought on by the great consumption of sugary stuff and if one marvels at all it is that persian teeth are good and serviceable they are to fair age native persian dentistry is not in very advanced stage with the exception of extraction by primitive and painful methods nothing efﬁcient is done to arrest the progress of decay the persian nose is well it is not perfection mind generally does not perform its duties in creditable manner it has nearly all the drawbacks of civilised noses partly owing to defective digestive organs and the escaping fumes of decayed teeth the nose really very well shaped in young children generally alters its shape they get older and it becomes blocked up with mucous matter causing it unduly to expand at the bridge and giving it rather stumpy fat appearance the nostrils are not very sharply and powerfully cut in most cases and are rounded up and undecided sign of pliant character women have better cut and healthier noses than men they lead more wholesome life in children and young people however very handsome noses are to be seen in persia the sense of odour is not very keen in either sex in fact it is probably the dullest of all persian senses which is not unfortunate them in country where potent smells abound in experimenting upon healthy specimens it was found that only comparatively strong odours could be detected by them nor could they distinguish the difference between two different scents when they did succeed in smelling them at all persian woman is not seen at her best when she is dressed this sounds very shocking but it is quite true of all the ugly inartistic clumsy uncomfortable tasteless absurd female attires that of the persian lady ranks ﬁrst let us see persian lady indoors and describe her various garments in the order in which they strike the observer first of all one eye is caught by bundle of short ually of very bright out at the hips and not unlike the familiar attire of our ballet shorter these skirts are made of cotton silk or satin according to the lady wealth and position there are various versions of how such fashion was adopted by persian ladies it is of comparatively modern importation and up to ﬁfty or sixty years ago women wore long skirts reaching down to the ankle the skirts gradually got shorter and shorter the women got more persian assures when shah visited europe and brought back to his harem the glowing accounts of the ladies rather the empire and alhambra ballets which seem to have much attracted him the women of his court in order to compete with their european rivals and to gain afresh the favour of their sovereign immediately adopted similar attire scissors were busy and down or up were the skirts reduced to minimum length in other countries fashions in men and women are copied from the court and so the women from one end of persia to the other in the cities took up the hideous custom one of the principal points in the fashion is that the skirt must stick out at the sides these skirts are occasionally very elaborate with heavy gold braiding round them richly embroidered or covered all over with small pearls the shape of the skirt is the same in all classes of women but of course the difference lies in the material with which the dress is made under the skirt appear two heavy shapeless legs in long foreign stockings with garters or in tight trousers of cotton or other light most unseemly sight when only the family are present the latter garments are frequently omitted perhaps the only attractive part of woman indoor toilet is the neat zouave jacket with sleeves breast and back profusely embroidered in gold or with pearls it is called the yel when lady friends are expected to call some additions are made to the costume long veil fastened to the belt and supported on the projecting skirt hangs down to the feet sometimes it is left to drag behind it is quite transparent and its purposeless use none of my persian friends could explain the women like it that is all was the only answer i could elicit and that was certainly enough to settle the matter persian women are extremely fond of jewellery diamonds pearls and precious stones on the head the hair being plastered down with parting in the centre and knot behind on the neck diadem is worn by the smarter ladies the tadji those who can afford it have tadji of diamonds the shape varying according to fashion others display sprays of pearls the tadji is luxurious heavy ornament only worn on grand occasions then there is another more commonly used the nim tadji or small diadem lighter and handsome feathery jewel worn either in the upper centre of the forehead or very daintily and in most coquettish way on one side of the head where it really looks very pretty indeed against the shiny jet black hair of the wearer heavy necklaces of gold pearls turqu oises and amber are much in vogue and also solid and elaborate gold rings and bracelets in profusion on the ﬁngers and wrists out of doors women in the cities look very different to what they indoors and can not be accused of any outward immodesty one suspec ts blue or black phantoms whom one meets in the streets to be women but there is really nothing to go by to make one sure of it the street costume of the persian lady is complete disguise was ever conceived before going out huge pair of loose trousers or chakchur at the waist and pulled in at the ankle are assumed and thick calico or cotton piece of cloth about yard wide hangs in front of the face small slit some three to four inches long and one and half wide very daintily netted with heavy embroidery being left ventilation sake and window this is fastened by means of hook behind the head to prevent its falling and is held down with one hand at the lower part over all this the chudder black or blue piece of silk or cotto the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https two yards square and matching the colour of the trousers covers the whole from head to foot and just leaves enough room in front the ventilating parallelogram in public places this cloak is held with the spare hand quite close to the chin so that with the exception of mass of black or blue clothing and tiny bit of white embroider y over the eyes one sees absolutely nothing of the persian woman when she promenades about the streets with sloping shoulders broad hips and huge bloomers her silhouette is not unlike bottle her feet are socked in white or blue and she toddles along on dainty slippers with back to the heels husband himself could not recognise his wife out of doors nor brother his sister unless by some special mark on her clothing such spot of grease or poor and rich young and old are all dressed alike of course the diadem and other such ornaments are only worn in the house and the chudder rests directly on the head yet with some good fortune one occasionally gets glimpses of women faces and chudders and the rest of them have their ways of dropping occasionally or being blown away by convenient winds or falling off unexpectedly but this is only the case with the prettier women the ugly old ones being most particular not to disillusion and disappoint the male this is possibly another reason why hasty travellers have concluded that persian women must all be beautiful chapter xxi the shah shah in his in at the shah graceful shah directness of kajars and the déﬁlé of blaze of diamonds there are great rejoicings in teheran and all over persia on the shah birthday and the night previous to it when grand illuminations of all the principal buildings ofﬁcial residences and business concerns take place large sums of money are spent in decorating the buildings suitably on such an auspicious occasion not in our country with cheap cotton rags and paper ﬂoral ornaments but with very hands ome carpets numberless of all sizes and shapes pictures in gold frames plants and fountains nor are the lights used of tawdry kind they are the best candles that money can purchase ﬁtted in candlesticks with tulip of crysta l candelabras of austrian make or rows of parafﬁn lamps hired the occasion it is customary in teheran even foreign business houses to illuminate their premises lavishly and the atabeg azam or prime minister and other high ofﬁcials go during the evening to pay calls in order to show their appreciation of the compliment to their sovereign and admire the decorations of the leading banks and merchants buildings in front of each illuminated house carpets are spread and number of chairs are prepared friends and guests who wish to come and admire the show sherbet tea coffee whisky brandy champagne cigarettes and all sorts of other refreshments are provided and by the time you have gone round to inspect all the places where you have been invited you have been refreshed to such an extent by the people who are very jolly and hospitable that you begin to see the illuminations go round you of their own accord the show that i witnessed was very interesting and really well done the effect in the bazaar with all the lights reﬂected in the mirrors and the gold and carpets against the ancient of the caravanserais being quite picturesque the crowds of natives were whole well behaved and quite amusing to watch they seemed quite absorbed in studying the details of each bit of decoration the bank of persia was decorated with much artistic taste side by side in the wind two enormous british and the on its façade fireworks were let off till late hour of the night from various parts of the town and bands and strolling musicians played in the squares in the bazaar and everywhere the following morning the shah came in his automobile to town from his country residence driven usual by frenchman the persian and foreign ministers were to be received in audience early in the morning and i was to be presented after by sir arthur hardinge our minister at the shah court the strict etiquette of any her european or remind one very forcibly of the comic opera only it is occasionally funnier the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https s ultaneh brother of the present shah early 9 we left the legation in on ofﬁcials in their diplomatic uniforms with plenty of gold braiding and cocked hats i in my own and somebody else tall hat mine had unluckily come to grief we rode along the very dusty streets and arrived at the palace where we got off our horses we entered the large court of the alabaster throne there were great many dismounted cavalry soldiers and we were then led into small on the ﬁrst ﬂoor where all the foreign representatives of other nations in teheran were waiting received by persian high ofﬁcial we were detained here considerable time and then marched through the garden to another building by the number of pairs of shoes lining both sides of the staircase in quadruple rows it was evident that his majesty had many visitors we were ushered into the jewelled globe room adjoining the shah small reception room after some adjustment of clothes and collars in their correct positions and of swords and belts the door opened and the ministers were let in to the shah presence one peculiarity of the shah court is that it is etiquette to appear before the sovereign with one hat on and making military salute in former days carpet slippers were provided the ministers to put on over the shoes but the custom has of late been abandoned it looked too ludicrous even court to see the ministers secretaries and attachés in their grand uniforms dragging their feet along fear of losing pantouﬂe on the way there was the usual speech of greeting and congratulation on the part of the doyen minister and presently the crowd of foreign represent atives returned to the in the most approved style walking backwards and stooping low my turn came next we entered the shah was standing almost in the centre of the room with the familiar aigrette in his kolah black headgear and his chest blaze of diamonds he rested his right hand on handsome jewelled sword he looked pale and somewhat worn but his features were decidedly handsome without being powerful one could plainly see depicted on his face an expression of extreme too soft and thoughtful face sovereign of an eastern country his thick underlip added certain amount of obstinate strength to his features which was counter by the dreamy look of his eyes heavily shadowed by prominent lids his thick black eyebrow s and huge moustache were in great contrast to the shah pallid face his majesty appeared bored and was busy masticating walnut when we entered the shell of which lay in débris by the side of two additional entire walnuts and on small jewelled we stood at attention with our hats on while sir arthur who we have seen is linguist of great distinction delivered to the sovereign most charming and graceful speech in persian with an oriental ﬂuency of ﬂowery language that nearly took my breath away the shah seemed highly delighted at the nice compliments paid him by our minister and graciously smiled in appreciation then sir arthur broke forth in he speaks like and with astounding grace proceeded to the presentation the shah was curt in his words and much to the point and i was greatly delighte d at the charming directness of his remarks there was ﬁgure of speech tawdry metaphor in the compliment paid i had presented his majesty with two of my books vous écrivez livres thundered the shah to in lame french he stroked his moustache in nervous manner malheur eusement pour le public oui majesté unfortunately the public yes your majesty i replied touching my hat in military fashion combien livr es avez vous écrits how many books have you written quatr four your majesty combien livres avez vous envoyé moi how many books have you sent he roared again in his perso adaptation of french deux two your majesty envoyez encor deux autres send the other two and with nod the conversation was over and we retreated backwards through the glass door but not before sir arthur hardinge had completed the interview with another most appropriate and graceful little the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https foreign ministers departed but i was allowed to remain in the palace grounds to witness the various native ofﬁcials and representatives paying their salaams to the shah after us the foreigners in persian employ were received in audience and it was interesting to notice that they had adopted the persian headgear and some even the persian pleated the shah reception room had very large window overlooking the garden the glass was raised and throne was placed close to the edge of the window on which the shah seated himself with kalian by his side then began the déﬁlé of native representatives the kajars in their grand robes and white turbans paraded before the window and then forming semicircle salaamed the head of their family one of them stepped forward and chanted long poem while the shah puffed away at the kalian and stroked his luxuriant moustache every now and then the sovereign bowed in acknowledgment of the good wishes paid him and his bow was repeated by the crowd below in the court after the kajars came the mullahs again another recitation of poetry again more bows more kalian smoking then foreign generals stood before the window and native ofﬁcers court servants and eunuchs the déﬁlé of troops colleges merchant associatio ns and schools came next and was very interesting persian cossacks in their nice long white uniforms and formidable chest ornamentations bandsmen with tin helmets and linoleum top boots hussars with plenty of braiding on cotton coats and trousers infantrymen artillerymen military cadets were reviewed in turn by his majesty who displayed his royal satisfaction by an occasional bow there were shrieks of enthusiasm applause hurrahs they went but they all walked past the royal window in quiet digniﬁed easy matter considering the extraordinary clothing that some were made to wear one had sort of suspicion that not unlike the armies marching on the stage one recognised the same contingents marching past several times to make up numbers but that did not take away from the picturesqueness of the scene in the really beautiful garden with lovely fountains spouting and ﬂowers in full bloom the procession with banners and music went on very long time but at last the garden was cleared of all people his majesty wished to descend little walk absolutely alone the shah sauntered about apparently quite relieved that the ordeal was over the atabeg azam was signalled to approach and prime minister and sovereign had friendly conversation although personally not fond of jewellery i must confess that i was much impressed by the resplendent beauty of the shah diamonds when ray of sun shone upon them his chest and the aigrette on the cap were blaze of dazzling light with myriad of most beautiful ﬂashing colours the great social excitement of the year in teheran was the prime minister evening party on the shah birthday when all the higher persian ofﬁcials were invited and nearly all the europeans resident in teheran regardless of their grade or social position this evening party was preceded by an ofﬁcial dinner to the members of the legations elaborate ﬁreworks were let off in the beautiful gardens and reﬂected in the ponds in front of the house and the gardens were tastefully illuminated with lanterns and decorated with ﬂags the house itself was full of interesting objects of art and had spacious rooms in the best european style persian ofﬁcials resplendent in uniforms their chests mass of decorations were politeness itself to all guests excellent persian bands playing european airs enlivened the evening and it was quite interesting to meet the rank and ﬁle and beauty of teheran ofﬁcial and commercial life all here assembled persian ladies naturally did not appear

inspecting the shah palace its treasures and its museum special permit must be obtained this through the legation or the foreign ofﬁce the ﬁrst large court which i entered on this second visit has pretty tiled buildings at the sides with its rectangular reservoir full of swans and bordered by trees is probably the most impressive part of the palace fountains play in the centre the spouts being women heads of the cheapest european kind the lofty throne hall stands at the end its decorative curtains screening its otherwise unwalled frontage my special beneﬁt the curtains were raised leaving exposed the two high spiral stone columns that support the roof in front the bases of these columns bore conventionalized vases with sunﬂowers and leaf ornamentations while the capitols were in three superpo sed ﬂuted tiers the uppermost being the largest in diameter the frieze of the ceiling was concave made of bits of and gold and the ceiling itself was also entirely composed of mirrors the back was of shiny green and blue with eight stars and two large while at the sides there was blue frieze two large portraits of shah two battle scenes and two portraits of decorated the walls the two side doors of the were of beautifully inlaid wood and the two doors directly behind the throne were of old shiraz work with ivory inscriptions upon them in the centre the lower part of the wall was of

in the back wall were ﬁve windows of the usual persian pattern and also cheap gold frame enclosing large canvas that represented ﬁgure of woman with number of fowls cat and dog two gold consoles were the only heavy articles of movab le furniture to be seen the spacious throne of yellow alabaster was quite gorgeous and had two platforms the ﬁrst with small fountain being reached by three steps the second step higher the platform was supported by demons guebre ﬁgures all round and columns resting on the backs of feline animals on the upper platform was spread an ancient carpet on leaving this

along the walls and curtains of glaring yellow and red plush the chairs being of the brightest blue velvet taken separately each article of furniture was of the very best kind but it seemed evident that whoever furnished that room did his utmost to select colours that would not match there were two parisian desks and ﬁne old oak inlaid desk capital inlaid bureau manufactured by russian in

case copies of old painti ngs of saints and the virgin coloured photographs of theatrical and stars and of picturesque scenery painting of the shah taken in his apartments jewels gold ornaments inlaid with precious stones beautiful malachite set consisting of clock inkstand vases and pair of candlesticks meteoric stones and fossil were displayed in the utmost confusion along the shelves at the further end of the museum reach ed by three steps was gaudy throne chair of solid gold and silver enamelled the throne had amphoras at the sides and sunﬂower in diamonds behind it the seat was of red brocade and the chair had very small arms it rested on platform with two supports and two ugly candelabras glance at the remaining glass cases of the museum reveals the same confusion everything smothered in dust everything uncared one eye detects at once valuable set of china and some lovely axes pistols and swords inlaid in gold ivory and silver then come busts of bismarck and moltke plaster clown tawdry painted fans and tortoiseshell ones set of the most common blue and two high candelabras green and white leather with silver ﬁttings unused automatic musical ﬁgures shilling candlesticks artiﬁcial coloured fruit in marble and really splendid silver dinner from the museum we passed into the atch kind of wherein were numberless cigar boxes wicker baskets and tiger skins here were photographs of some of the shah favourites great assortment of persians love prints in profusion and some good this led into the banqueting room in the european quite good sober style this time the room was lighted by column candelabras and there was collection of the shah family portraits in medallions also phonograph which is said to afford much amusement to his majesty and his guests the paintings on the walls ran very much to the nude and none were very remarkable if one excepts nude ﬁgure of woman sitting and in the act of caressing dove it is very clever copy of painting by foragne in the shah picture gallery and has been done by persian artist named who i was told had studied in paris most interesting of all in the room however was the exquisite old carpet with delightful design of roses it was the carpet that nasr shah brought to europe with him to spread under his chair the bore evident signs of his majesty hasty departure the country on the tables were piled up anyhow mountains of dishes plates and accessor ies the table service made in europe being in most excellent taste white and gold with small circle in which the persian lion and sun were surmounted by the regal crown in the s hah s p alace g rounds t eheran we go next into the shah favourite apartments where he spends most of his time when in teheran we are now in the small room in which i had already been received in audience by his majesty on his birthday room made entirely of mirrors there was low and luxurious red couch on the ﬂoor and we trod on magniﬁcent soft silk carpets of lovely designs one could not resist feeling with one ﬁngers the deliciously soft kerman rug of fascinating artistic green and charming red carpet from sultanabad the others came from isfahan and kashan the most valuable and beautiful of all however was the white rug made in sultanabad on which the shah stands when receiving in audience next after the carpets large clock by benson with less than thirteen different dials which told one at glance the year the month the week the day the moon the hour minutes seconds and anything else one might wish to know was perhaps the most noticeable item in the shah room there was nothing in the furniture to appeal to one the chairs and tables being of cheap bamboo of the familiar folding pattern such are commonly characteristic of superior in the way of art there was large ﬁgure of woman resting under palm tree photographic enlar gement of the shah portrait and on the shah two handsome portraits of the emperor and empress of russia the emperor occupy ing the highest place of honour two smaller photographs of the czar and czarina were to be seen also in shilling plush frames on another by the side of an electric clock and the eye was attracted by three terrestrial globes and an astronomical one with constellations standing on table number of very tawdry articles were lying about on the other pieces of furniture such were metal dog holding watch paper frames cheap imitation leather articles numerous photographs of the shah copy of the petit journal framed and containing representation of the attempt on the shah life an amber service and last but not least the cracker and the empty nutshells the contents of which the shah was in process of eating when i had an audience of him some days before still lying undisturbed upon small desk the shah special chair was embroidered in red and the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https this was reﬂected myriads of times in the mirror ceiling and walls and the effect was somewhat dazzling the room had partition and on the other side was an ample couch his majesty to rest upon in each reception room is to be seen splendid grand piano the music of which when good the shah is said passionately to enjoy one of his aides european an excellent pianist and composer we now come to the room and of course one makes at once the priceless globe enclosed in glass case in the centre of the room the frame of the large globe is said to be of solid gold and so is the tripod stand set in rubies and diamonds the globe to justice to its name is covered all over with precious stones the sea being represented by green emeralds and the continents by rubies the equator line is set in diamonds and also the whole area of persian territory there is nothing else of great artistic interest here and it depressed one to ﬁnd that although the portraits in oil and photographs of the emperors of russia and austria occupied prominent places of honour in the shah apartments the only image of our queen victoria was wretched faded cabinet photograph in twopenny paper frame thrown carelessly among empty envelopes and writing paper in corner of his majesty writing desk princess beatrice photograph was near it and towering above them in the most prominent place was another picture of the emperor of russia we ourselves may attach little meaning to these triﬂing details but signiﬁcant are the inferences drawn by the natives themselves in this room in most of the others there is bohemian glass in great profusion and one year chronometer of great precision really beautiful inlaid ivory table is disﬁgured by menagerie of coloured miniature leaden cats lions lizards dogs children kaleidoscop and some stuffed birds singing automatically on another table were more glass vases and variety of articles made of cockle shells on pasteboard cycle watches and brass rings with imitation stones adjoining this room is small boudoir possessing the latest appliances of civilisation it contains another grand piano large apparatus projecting moving pictures on screen and an soda fountain with four taps of the type one does not wish to the new york chemists shops the shah however lacks three things soda the ice and the syrups less modern but more reposeful is the next with white walls and pretty wood ceiling it has some military pictures of great value on going down ten steps we ﬁnd ourselves in long conservatory with blue and yellow tiles and roof channel of water runs in the centre of the ﬂoor and is the outlet of three octagonal basins and of spouts at intervals of ten feet there is profusion of lemon and orange trees at the sides of the water and the place is kept deliciously cool here we emer ge again into the gardens which are really beautiful although rather overcrowded but which have plenty of fountains and huge tanks with handsome buildings reﬂected into the water the high tiled square towers one of the landmarks of teheran are quite picturesque but some of the pleasure of looking at the really ﬁne view is destroyed by numerous ugly coloured ﬁgures imported from austria which disﬁgure the sides of all the reservoirs and are quite out of keeping with the character of everything round them we are now conducted into another building where roman mosaics occupy leading position large one of the coliseum being quite valuable work of art but on entering the second room we are suddenly confronted by collection of hideous tin ware and specimen case of ordinary ﬁsh hooks manufactured by bartlett and sons next to this is framed autograph of nina muller of petersbur g and photographic gathering of gay young ladies with suitable some of the late shah acquaintances during his european tours here are also stuffed owls an automatic juggler an imitation snake japanese screens and an amusing painting by persian artist of adam and eve in the garden of forbidden fruit already missing previous to entering the largest room we come to an with photographs of scenery and events belonging to the shah tour to europe in the large gold room the whole set of furniture i am told was presented to shah by the sultan of turkey and there are besides six large hanging upon the walls in gorgeous gold frames they represent the last two shahs the emperor and empress of russia the crown prince at the time of the presenta tion and the emperor of austria smaller picture of victor emmanuel also occupies prominent place but here again we have another instance of the little reverence in which our beloved queen victoria was held in the eyes of the persi an court among the various honoured foreign emperors and kings to whom this room is dedicated queen victoria only representation is small bad photograph skied in the least attractive part of the most evident slight when we ﬁnd such photographs that of the emperor william occupying front and honoured place does also the photograph of queen wilhelmina of holland with her mother yet another palpable instance of this disregard the reigning head of england appears in series of painted heads of sovereigns the shah of course is represented the biggest of the lot and king humbert emperor william the sultan of turkey and the emperor of austria of about equal sizes whereas the queen of england is quite small and insigniﬁcant the furniture in this room is covered with the richest plush we now come upon the royal picture gallery or rather gallery of painted canvases long long room where most interesting display of persian afghan beluch and turkish arms of all kinds ancient and modern gold bows and arrows jewelled daggers damascus swords are much more attractive than the yards of portraits of ladies who have dispensed altogether with dressmakers bills and the gorgeously framed advertisements of brooks machine cottons and other products which are hung on the line in the picture gallery the pictures by persian art paint in european rather quaint on account of the subjects chosen when they attempt to be ideal they run good deal to the fantastic in the case of the several square yards of canvas entitled the result of dream it contains quite menagerie of most suggestive wild animals and dozens of angels and demons in friendly intercourse playing upon the surface of lake and among the entangled branches of trees in the background pyrotechnic display of great magnitude is depicted with rockets shooting up in all directions while ethereal large women lie the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https and unconcerned upon most unsafe clouds the result on the spectator of looking at the result of dream and other similar canvases by the same artist is general ly i should think nightmare there are some good paintings by foreign artists such the nude with dove by folagne which we have already seen most faithfully and cleverly copied by persian artist in the shah then there are some pretty dutch and italian pictures but nothing really in purely artistic sense the cases of ancient and rare gold and silver coins are however indeed worthy of remark and so are the really beautiful persian afghan and turkish gold and silver inlaid shields and the intensely picturesque and ﬁnely ornamented matchlocks and ﬂintlocks here too in china we ﬁnd an abnormally large like the gingal of the celestials these long clumsy riﬂes possess an ingenious back sight with tiny perforations at different heights of the sight the various distances on exactly the principle of l yman back sight the persians who accompanied through the palace seemed very much my taking so much interest in these they said were only very old and so little in the hideous things which they valued and wanted to admire they were most anxious that i should stop before box of pearls lot of them all of good size but not very regular in shape anything worth big sums of money is ever much more attractive to persians also one might add to most europeans than are objects really artistic or even pleasing to the eye next to the pearls came dilapidated butterﬂies and shells and fossils and stuffed lizards and crocodiles and elephants tusks and i not know what else so that by the time one came out after passing through the confusion that reigned everywhere one brain was so worn and jumpy that one was glad to sit and rest in the lovely garden and sip cup after cup of tea which the palace servants had been good enough to prepare but there was one more thing that i was dragged to see before modern complete his majesty when the fancy takes him has books translated and specially printed his own use with sigh of relief i was glad to learn that i had now seen everything quite everything in the shah palace the shah has several country seats with beautiful gardens on the hills to the north of teheran where he spends most of the summer months and in these residences too we ﬁnd the rooms mostly decorated with mirrors and differing very little in character from those in the teheran palace only not quite so elaborate european inﬂuence has frequently crept in in architectura l details and interior decorations but not always advantageously the andarun or harem the women quarter is generally less gaudy than the other buildings the separate little apartments belonging to each lady being in fact quite modest and not always particularly clean there is very little furniture in the bedrooms persian women having comparatively few requirements there is in addition large reception room furnished in european style with elaborate coloured glass windows this room is used when the shah visits the ladies or when they entertain friends but there is nothing it may be noted to impress one with the idea that these are regal residences or with that truly oriental gorgeous pomp popularly associated in europe with the shah court there is probably court of any importance where the style of life is simpler and more modest than at the shah all the houses are nevertheless most comfortable and the principal feature of all these country handsome with many fountains tanks and water channels intersecting them in every direction the purpose of stimulating the artiﬁcially reared vegetation and also of rendering the places cooler in summer unlike most natives of the asiatic continent the persian shows reluctance in accepting foreign ways and inventions he may lack the means to indulge in foreign luxuries but that is different matter altogether the inclination to reform and adopt european ways is there all the same more forward in this line than most other persians is the shah son very intelligent bright young fellow extremely plucky and charmingly he takes the keenest interest in the latest inventions and fads and like his father the shah fell victim to the motor car mania only the shah entrusts his life to the hands of an expert french driver whereas the young prince ﬁnds it more amusing to drive the machine himself this of course he can only within the palace grounds since to so in the streets of the town would be considered below his dignity and would shock the people at the country residences he is said to have good deal of amusement out of his motor but not so the shah ministers and friends who are now terriﬁed at the name motor the young prince it appears on the machine being delivered from europe previous knowledge of how to steer driving it round large water tank he invited several stout ministers in all their ﬁnery to accompany him which they did with beaming faces overcome by the honour the machine started full speed ahead in somewhat fashion and with great destruction of the minor plants on the way then came moment of fearful apprehension on the part of spectators and performers alike the car collided violently with an old tree some of the high dignitaries were ﬂung into the water others though still on dry land lay ﬂat on their backs the s hah and his s uite the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https minister general kossakowski it speaks volumes the young prince pluck that when the car was patched up he insisted on driving it again but the number of excuses and sudden complaints that have since prevailed among his father friends when asked to go drive with the prince are said to be quite unprecedented the prince is great sportsman and much beloved by all his frankness and geniality chapter xxiii the selection of persian diligence round kerjawa of the lake of i had much difﬁculty in obtaining really servant although many applied with glowing certiﬁcates it has always been my experience that the more glowing the certiﬁcates the worse the servant my particular kind of travelling too special type of servant has to be got with constitution somewhat above the average i generally cover very great distances at high speed without the least inconvenience to myself but i ﬁnd that those who accompany nearly always break down after inspecting number of applicants i ﬁxed upon one man whose features showed ﬁrmness of character and unusual determination he was man of few of the rarest and best qualities in travelling servant he had relations dependent upon next best quality he could shoot straight he could stick on saddle he could walk he required little sleep he was willing to go to any country where i chose to take him he required high salary but promised by all he held most sacred that he would die before he would give the slightest trouble this seemed all fair and i employed him only one drawback did this man was an excellent european cook i had to modify him into good plain cook and then he became perfection itself his name was sadek on october 2nd i was ready to start south my foot was still in bad condition but i thought that the open air cure would be the best instea d of lying in stuffy rooms riding is my favourite way of progression but again it was necessary to submit to another extortion and travel by carriage far kum on road made by the bank of persia some few years ago the speculatio n was not carried on sufﬁciently long to become success and the road was eventually sold to persian concern the same company runs service of carriages with relays of horses between the two places and if one wishes to travel fast one is compelled to hire carriage the horses not being let out on hire riding purposes at any of the stations this time i hired large only vehicle in the stables that seemed strong enough to stand the journey it was painted bright yellow outside had windows and was very properly divided into two compartments one men and one women the money the journey had to be paid in advance and the vehicle was ordered to be at the door of the hotel on friday october 4th at it arrived on sunday evening october 6th at so much persian punctuality sadek said i was lucky that it did come so soon sometimes the carriages ordered come week later than the appointed time occasionally they not come at all sadek much to his disgust was made to occupy the ladies compartment with all the luggage and i had the men we were off and left the city just in time before the south gate was closed there were high hills to the much broken and rugged and to the north beyond the town the higher ones above golahek on which snow caps could be perceived damov end the highest and most graceful mountain in persia stood with its white summit against the sky to the even two hundred yards away from the city gate there was nothing to tell us that we had come out of the capital of place looks so insigniﬁcant from every side dome of impressive proportions minaret or two and few mud is all one sees of the mass of houses one leaves behind barren country and dusty road graveyard with its graves in sand are the attractions of the road one comes to an avenue of trees poor trees how baked and dried and smothered in dust couple of miles off we reached patch of verdure and some really green trees and even signs of agriculture to our left east lay the railway only one in to the azim mosque the whole length of the railway is not more than six miles to the right of the road some little distance before reaching the mosque very quaint large relief has been sculptured on the face of huge rock and is reﬂected upside down in pond of water at its foot men were bathing here in long red or blue drawers and hundreds of donkeys were conveying veiled women to this spot an enormous tree casts its shadow over the pool of water in the the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands

divided into three sections separated by columns the central section being large the two side ones taken together in the centre is supposed to be seated on throne he wears high cap with three aigrettes and his moustac he and beard are of abnormal length in his belt at the pinched waist he disports sword and dagger while he holds bâton in his hand there are nine ﬁgure s to his right in two rows the naib sultaneh hussein ali taghi mirza above below mahommed ali mirza fatali mirza abdullah mirza bachme mirza one ﬁgure unidentiﬁed to the shah left the ﬁgures of mirza and veri mirza are in the lower row malek mirza the last ﬁgure to the left hedar mirza and next to all the ﬁgures are and garbed in long gowns with swords and daggers on right hand is perched hawk and behind his throne stands an attendant with sunshade while under the seat are little ﬁgures of muchul mirza and kameran mirza there are inscriptions on the three sides of the frame but not on the base seat is carved in the rock by the side of the sculpture few hundred yards from this rock carving round tower 90 or 100 feet in height has been erected its diameter inside is about 40 feet and the thickness of the wall about 20 feet it has two large yellow doors why this purposeless structure was put up nobody seems to know certain one gets beautiful view from the top of the eheran in the distance on one side the mosque on the other mountains are close by to the east and patch of cultivation and garden all round down below near the is the case with all pilgrimage places in ﬁnd bazaar crammed with beggars black women riding astride on donkeys or mules men and mullahs there were old men blind men lame men deaf men armless men men with enormous tumours other s minus the nose or lower result of cancer millions of ﬂies were buzzing about one of the most ghastly deformities i have ever seen was tumour under mullah foot it was an almost spherical tumour some three inches in diameter with skin drawn tight and shining over its surface it had patches of red on the otherwise skin and gave the impression of the man resting his foot on an unripe water with the toes half dug into the tumour are of course forbidden to enter the mosque so i had to be content with the outside view of very must take my reader again along the ﬂat uninteresting country towards kum the usual troubles of persia are not lacking even at the very ﬁrst stage there are relays of horses and those just unharnessed are too tired to proceed they are very hungry too and there is nothing them to eat several hours are wasted and sadek employs them in cooking my dinner and also in giving exhibitions of his temper to the stable people then follow endless discussions at the top of their voices in which i not take part i am old and wise enough not to discuss anything with anybody the prospects of backshish the entreaties and prayers being of avail sadek ﬂies into fury rushes to the yard seizes the horses and harness gives the coachman hammering and the post master very nearly another and so we are able to start peacefully again at three and leave behind but the horses are tired and hungry they drag and stumble along in most tiresome manner there is moonlight that ought to add poetry to the in persia there is poetry about anything there are great many caravans on the all travel at night to save the animals from the great heat of the strings of camels with their monotonous bells and dozens of donkeys or mules some with the covered double kerjawa these kerjawas the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https enough people not accustomed to ride or women who can sleep comfortably while in motion inside the small panier the kerjawa is slung over the saddle like two large hampers with roof of bent bands of wood cloth covering is made to turn the kerjawa into small private room an exact duplicate of which is slung on the opposite side of the saddle two persons balancing each other are required by this double arrangement or one person on one side and an equivalent quantity of luggage on the other so to establish complete most important point to consider if serious accidents are to be avoided every now and then the sleepy voice of caravan man calls out salameleko to my coachman and salameleko is duly answered back otherwise we rattle along at the speed of about four miles an hour bumping terribly on the uneven road and the diligence creaking in most perplexing manner at hasanabad the second stage i was more fortunate and got four good horses in exchange the tired ones one of them was very fresh and positively refused to go with the others the driver who was brutal used his very freely with the result that the horse smashed part of the harness and bolted the other three of course did the same and the coachman was not able to hold them we travelled some few hundred yards off the road at considerable speed and with terrible bumping the shaky carriage gradually beginning to crumble to pieces the boards of the front part fell apart owing to the violent oscillations of the roof and the roof itself showed evident signs of an approaching collapse we were going down steep incline and i can not say that i felt particularly happy until the horses were got under control again i feared that all my photographic plates and cameras might get damaged if the diligence turned over while the men mended the harness i had look at the scenery the formation of the country was curious there were what at ﬁrst appeared to be hundreds of small mounds like topped and greyish or in patches of light brown with yellow sand deposits exposed to the air on the surface on getting nearer they appeare d to be long ridges evidently formed by water borne at the epoch when this was the sea or lake bottom khup es it is all right said the coachman inviting to mount in sudden outburst of exuberant affection he embraced the naughty horse and kissed him fondly on the nose the animal reciprocated the coachman compliment by promptly kicking the front splashboard of the carriage to smithereens we crossed bridge to the east the water mark made when this valley was under water is plainly visible on the strata of gravel with reddish mud above of which the hills are formed then rising gradually the diligence goes over low pass and along ﬂat plateau separating the ﬁrst basin we have left behind from second more extensive of similar formation the hills in this second basin appear lower to the is sand dune much higher than anything we had so far encountered and beyond it range of mountains salt can be seen mixed with the mud of the soil then we drive across third basin large and ﬂat with the scattered hills getting lower and seemingly worn by the action of weather they are not so corrugated by water channels the previous ones we had passed twenty feet or so below the summit of the hills white sediment of salt showed itself plainly the fourth basin is at higher level than the 100 feet or so above the is absolutely ﬂat with dark gravelly soil azizawad village has special attrac tion beyond the protecting wall that encloses all villages of the domed roofs of houses to which one begins to get reconciled next to it is the very handsome fruit garden of at khale mandelha the horses are changed the road becomes very undulating with continuous ups and downs and occasional steep ascen ts and descents glimpses of the large salt lake nimak or the masileh it is also called are obtained and eventually we had quite pretty view with high blue mountains in the background and rocky black mounds between the spectator and the silvery sheet of water aliabad has large caravanserai with portico to the east also special place the sadrazam the prime minister when travelling on this road garden with few sickly trees and that is all on leaving the caravanserai one skirts the mountain side to the west and goes up it to the horse station situated in most desolate spot from this point one gets view of the whole lake its waters owing to evaporation seem to withdraw leaving white sediment of salt along the edge the road from the runs now in perfectly straight line and with the exception of the ﬁrst short incline is afterwards quite ﬂat passing along and very little above the lake shore from which the road is about one mile distant the lake is to the of the road at this point to the lies long row of hills which circle round the valley we are about to cross the sunset on that particular night was one in which an amateur painter would have revelled foreground ﬂat sharp cutting edge of blue against bilious sky blending into ghastly cinabrese red which gradually vanished into sort of lead blue there are few countries where the sun appears and disappears above and from the earth surface with less glow than in persia of course the lack of moisture in the atmosphere largely accounts this during the several months i was in the all i know this may have been my misfortune never saw more than half dozen sunsets that were really worth intense admiration and these were not in western persia the usual sunsets are effects of sort with force and beautiful contrasts of lights and colours such one sees in egypt in morocco in spain italy or even with some amount of toning down in our little england the twilight in persia is extremely short chapter xxiv severe the holy of ruin and gilt the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https contrivance setting charcoal illages near kashan on deserted road sleepy and shaken with the wind blowing so hard that it tore and carried away all the cotton curtains of the carriage i arrived at kum feet above sea level in the middle of the night the distance covered between teheran and kum was farsakhs or miles we approached the holy city there appeared to be lot of vegetation around and sadek and the coachman assured that this was region where pomegranates were grown in profusion and the castor plant too cotton was moreover cultivated with success kum is to my mind and apart from its holiness one of the few really picturesque cities of persia i caught the ﬁrst panoramic glimpse of the shrine and mosque at sunrise from the roof of the post house and was much impressed by its grandeur amidst mass of mud roofs and beyond long mud walls rise the gigantic gilded dome of the mosque two high minarets and two shorter ones with most beautifully coloured tiles inlaid upon their walls the general effect of which is of most delicate greys blues and greens then clusters of fruit trees numerous little minarets all over the place and ventilating shafts above the better buildings break the monotony agreeably kum i need hardly mention is one of the great pilgrimages of mahommedans happy dies the man or woman whose body will be laid at rest near the sacred shrine is the remains of matsuma fatima corpses are conveyed here from all parts of the country even kings and royal personages are buried in the immediate neighbourhood of the shrine round the city there are thousands of mud graves which give quite mournful appearance to the holy city there are almost many dead people living ones in kum innumerable mullahs are found here who are very conservative and who seem to resent the presence of european visitors in the city access to the shrine is absolutely forbidden to foreigners immense sums of money are brought daily to the holy city by credulous pilgrims but outward signs of prosperous trade nor of ﬁne streets or handsome private buildings can be detected on inspecting the bazaar or streets of the town on the contrary the greater part of the residences are in hopeless state of decay and the majority of the inhabitants to all appearance little above begging point leather tanned with the bark of the pomegranate and cheap pottery are the chief industries of the holy city on inquiring what becomes of all the wealth that comes into the town persian with signiﬁcant gesture informed that the mullahs get it and with them it remains the handsome dome over the shrine was begun by order of hussein nadir shah but the gorgeous gilding of the copper plates was not ﬁnished till few years ago by shah theological college also exists at this place there is station here of the telegraphs with an armenian in char ge of it much to my disgust i was informed that the owner of the had the monopoly of the trafﬁc on the track six or seven farsakhs more and so travellers were compelled to submit to further extortion by having to hire another wheeled conveyance instead of being able to ride this time i chartered victoria and of f we went usual at gallop two horses had to be sent ahead while the carriage was driven with only two animals through the narrow streets of the bazaar covered over with awnings or with domed perforated roofs the place had tawdry miserable appearance the leather shops being the only interesting ones with the many elaborate saddles harness and horses ornamentations displayed on nails along the walls i saw in blacksmith shop an ingenious device to create perpetual draught with bellows the big bellows were double and allowed sufﬁcient room to let two boys stand between the two the boys clinging to handles in the upper part of the bellows and using the weight of their bodies now to the right then to the left inﬂated ﬁrst one then the other the wind of each bello w passing through common end tube and each being in turn reﬁlled with air while the other was blowing this human pendulum arrangement was carried on with incredible rapidity by the two boys who dashed their bodies from one side to the other and back keeping steady time and holding their feet stationary but describing an almost complete semicircle with the remainder of the body the whole length of the boy forming the radius there was shop or two where glass was being blown and numerous with mountains of pomegranates water and grape at the entrance of the mosques crow ds of people stood waiting admission some praying outside once out of the town the extra two horses which were waiting at the gate were harnessed and we sped along the lungs rejoiced in the pure air of which the stuffy cellar bazaar had afforded none behind in the far distance damovend mountain covered with snow could still be seen rising high above everything it was undoubtedly mountain to the and west lay indented hills of the most curious shapes and particularly like roof with greenish base surmounted by top hill further west presented the same peculiarities in the distant mountains to the west the same characteristics were apparent the greenish stratum below extending all along and increasing in depth towards the south the one may call it extremely bad and hardly ﬁt wheeled trafﬁc after leaving kum the vegetation ceased and it was only at langherut village that patch of green refreshed the eye few strolling wayfarers crowded round when the carriage stopped to give the horses rest under the shade of tree and sadek was about the sahib whom he was accompanying it was quite amusing to hear one self and one doings commented upon in the most open manner regardless of one personal feelings which are better discarded altogether while travelling in persia there is absolutely nothing private in the land of iran one appearance one clothes the the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https food one eats the amount of money one

entertainment is thus provided on the road passangun could be perceived in the distance and dreary desolate place it was when one got there in the way of architecture we found large caravanserai and the chappar khana the to vegetation thirteen sickly trees all counted barren uninteresting country surrounded the halting place i spent here pleasant hour while waiting my luggage to arrive on pack animals caravan of some ﬁfty horses and mules had halted at sunset and number of pilgrims with beards dyed red were making their evening salaams towards mecca having removed shoes and duly washed their feet and hands they stood erect on the projecting platform of the caravanserai and after considerable adjusting of caps and assumed meditative attitude head bent forward and muttered prayers with hands down then the hands were raised ﬂat before the face with bow kneeling followed with hands ﬁrst resting on the knees then raised again to cover the face after which with the palms of the hands resting ﬂat on the ground the head was brought down until it touched the ground too stand ing position was further assumed when the temples were touched with the thumb while prayers were recited and then the petitioners stooped low and fell second time on their knees saying the beads of their rosaries the forehead was made to touch the ground several times before the evening prayers were over next food was cooked in the small ﬁre places of the caravanserai and tea brewed in large quantities the inevitable kalian was called and the caravanserai boy brought out his interesting little arrangement to set charcoal quickly alight the large cup of the kalian to string three feet long hung small perforated iron cup which he ﬁlled with charcoal one tiny bit being already alight by quickly revolving the contrivance one would sling the draught forced through the apertures in the cup produced quick combustion and charcoal was at once distributed alight among the kalians of the impatient guests much amusement and excitement was caused among the pilgrims by ﬁght between and ﬁve or six small goats only one of these at time fought the dog while the others occupied high point of vantage on which they had hastily climbed and from that place of security displayed keen interest in the ﬁght the water at passangun was extremely bad there were two tanks of rain water drained from the hillside along dirty channel ﬁlled with animal refuse the wells were below the ground level and were walled and domed over to prevent too rapid an evaporation by the sun rays the water was pestilential it had nasty green look about it and patches of putrid matter decomposing visibly on its surface the stench from it when stirred was sickening yet the natives drank it and found it all right there is accounting people taste not even in persia at last from this point the positive torture of driving in carriages was over and chappar horses were to be obtained the saddles were got ready and with ﬁve horses we made start that same evening sin sin after the wretched bumping and thumping and being thrown about in the wheeled conveyance on the road it seemed heavenly to be ambling along at fairly good pace even on these poor animals which could not in all honesty be considered to afford perfect riding indeed if there ever was society the prevention of cruelty to animals it should have begun its work along the persian postal roads the poor can hardly call them bony and starved with sore backs chests and legs with bleeding tongue almost cut in two and pitifully swollen by bits and endowed with stinking digestive organs and other nauseous odours of sores heated by the friction of never clumsy heavy pads under the saddles it requires pretty strong stomach i can tell you to ride them at all yet the poor devils canter along when they not amble and occasionally gallop clumsily on their unsteady legs so that notwithstanding everything one generally manages to go at the rate of six or seven miles an hour if the horses at the various have just returned from conveying the an extra sorry time is in store the traveller the poor animals are then so tired that they occasionally collapse on the road i invariably used all the kindness i could to these wretches but it was necessary to get on i intended to proceed in the greatest haste over the better known parts of persia it is important to see the horses fed before starting from all the but on many occasions food whatever could be procured them when of course they had to go without it changing horses about every 20 to 28 miles and being on the saddle from fourteen to twenty hours out of the i was able to cover long distances and kept up an average of from 80 to 120 miles daily one can of course cover much greater distances than these in one day if one is fortunate enough to get good and fresh horses at the various stations and if one does not have to keep it up long period of time i had to from sin sin we go due south along ﬂat trail of salt and mud we have barrier of mountains to the and higher mountains to the south to the also low ridge with another higher behind it to the north we leave behind low hills sin sin itself is renowned its water and i too can humbly certify to their excellence i took load of them away the journey from here we began to see the wonderful effects of deceitful mirage extremely common all over persia one sees beautiful lakes of silvery water with clusters of trees and islands and rocks duly reﬂected upside down in their steady waters but it is all an optical deception caused by the action of the heated soil on the expanding air immediately in contact with it which seen from above and at distance is of bluish white tint with exactly the appearance and the mirror qualities of still water although in central persia one sees many of these effects every day they are sometimes so marvellous that even the most experienced would be deceived the country is barren and desolate kasimabad has but two buildings both caravanserais but nassirabad further on is quite large village with domed roofs and couple of minarets on the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https is large caravanserai with the usual alcoves all round its massive walls except the nice avenue of trees along refreshing brook of limpid water there was nothing to detain us here but the collision between one of my and mule of passing caravan with disastrous results to both animals loads but with the assistance of one or two natives commandeered by sadek the luggage scattered upon the road was replaced high on the saddles the fastening ropes were pulled tight by sadek with his teeth and hands while i took this opportunity to sit on the roadside to partake of my boiled eggs cold roast chicken persian bread some cake and half water the whole washed down with long drink of clear water riding at the rate i did the whole day and the greater part of the night in the hot sun and the cold winds at night gave one healthy appetite we got nearer kashan city the villages got more numerous aliabad and the yaze mosque and nushabad to my left east with its blue tiled roof of the mosque but the villages were so very much alike and uninteresting in colour and in architecture that description of each would be unimportant and most tedious so that i will only limit myself to describing the more typical and striking ones with special features that may interest the reader in the morning of october 9th i had reached the city of kashan seventeen farsakhs miles from kum and farsakhs or 164 miles from teheran in two days and half including halts chapter xxv the madrassah panja hand of nazareth fin the tragic end of an honest prime minister the mullahs

which if not always ornamental are proclaimed everlasting the silk manufactories are said to number over three hundred including some that make silk carpets of renown the population is souls or thereabouts nothing is ever certain in persia there are hotels in the city and it is considered undigniﬁed europeans to go to which there are some three dozen in to the chappar khana the telegraphs have large building outside the north gate of the city in charge of an armenian clerk where through the courtesy of the director of telegraphs travellers are allowed to put up and where the guests room is nice and clean with useful bedstead washstand and chair or two capital view of kashan is obtained from the roof of the telegraph building wide road the one by which i had arrived continues to the entrance of the bazaar the town itself is divided into two city proper surrounded by high wall and the suburbs outside to the west in the town proper rises the slender tower of slightly over 100 feet high and not unlike factory chimney further away in the the mosque of with its blue pointed roof adjoins the famous shrine from which all the most ancient and beautiful tiles have been stolen or sold by avid mullahs export to europe then we see the two domes of the mosque and theological college the madrassah shah where young future mullahs are educated to the west of the observer from our high point of vantage and of the town lies another mosque the panja shah in which the hand of one of the prophets nazareth abbas is buried hand and portion of the forearm most beautifully carved in marble is shown to devotees in receptacle in the east wall of the mosque the actual grave in which the real hand lies is covered with magniﬁcent ancient tiles it is with certain amount of sadness that one gazes on the old fin palace up on the hills some six miles to the west and listens to the pathetic and repellent tragedy which took place within its garden walls the square garden is surrounded by high wall and has buildings on three sides marble canals fed by large marble tanks in which run streams of limpid water intersect the garden in the middle of wide avenue of dark cypresses the garden was commenced by shah abbas the palace however was built by who also much improved the gardens and made this favourite residence during the hot summer months there is here very hot natural sprin g of sulphur water and copper which is said to possess remarkable curative qualities especially rheumatism and diseases of the blood one bath is provided men and another women the palace with its quaint pictures and decorations is now in state of abandonment and collapse the tragic end in 1863 or 1864 i could not clearly ascertain which at this place of taki khan then prime minister of honest and straightforward politician persia has ever peculiar gloom to the place man of humble birth but of great genius aki khan rose to occupy next to the shah the highest political position in his country and attempted to place the government of persia on ﬁrm basis and to eradicate intrigue and corruption to this day his popularity is proverbial among the lower classes by whom he is still rever ed and respected his uprightness the shah gave him his only sister in marriage but unhappily one ﬁne day his enemies gained the upper hand at court he fell into disgrace and was banished to kashan to the fin palace executioners were immediately sent to murder him by order of the shah aki khan when their arrival was announced understood that his end had come he asked leave to commit suicide instead which he did by having the arteries of his arms cut open he bled to death while in his the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https regret at the irreparable loss was expressed but it was too late the body of the cleverest statesman persia had produced was conveyed burial to the sanctuary of karbala one can not help being struck in stiﬂing hot place like kashan to ﬁnd large ice yet plenty of ice is to be got here during the winter especially from the mountains close at hand these have pit dug in the ground to considerable depth and are covered over with high conical roof of mud to the outside the city in the suburbs great many of these ice are to be seen well small roof of mosque the pilgrimage of there is some cultivation round about kashan principally of cotton tobacco melons and water melons which one sees in lar ge patches wherever there is water obtainable kashan is protected by mountains to the south and west and by low hills to the but to the north and the eye roams uninterrupted over an open ﬂat dusty dreary plain of light brown colour until it meets the sky line on the horizon softly dimmed by thick veil of disturbed sand due east lie the siah kuh mountains then comes another gap in the horizon to the east in the dark and gloomy bazaar the din of hundreds of wooden hammers on many pieces of copper being made into jugs trays pots or pans is simply deafening echoed it is under the vaulted roofs the sound waves clashing in such an unmusical and confused way to be absolutely diabolical few of these copper vessels are gracefully ornamented and inlaid but the majority are coarse in their manufacture they are exported all over the country the manufactured silk the other important product of kashan ﬁnds its way principally to russia the inhabitants are most industrious and like all industrious people are extremely docile amenable to reason and easy to manage the mullahs are said to have much power over the population and in fact we ﬁnd in kashan less than 18 mosques with ﬁve times that number of shrines counting large and small i experienced some difﬁculty in obtaining relays of fresh post horses the mail having been despatched both north and south the previous night and therefore horses were in the station at seven in the evening i was informed that ﬁve horses had returned and were at my disposal twenty minutes later the loads were on their saddles and i was on the road again after travelling under the vaulted bazaars where it was impossible to see where one was going the horses had to be led and threading our way out of the suburbs we travelled on the ﬂat some time before coming to the hilly portion of the road where it winds its way up at quite perceptible gradient we had end of small accidents and trouble the horses were with fatigue they had gone 48 miles already with the post and without rest or food had been sent on with 28 more miles the poor wretches collapsed time after time on the road under their loads although these were very light and my servant and i and the chappar boy had to walk the whole way and drag the animals behind us they had not sufﬁcient strength to carry us even then their knees gave way every now and then and it was easy job to get them to stand up again one of them never did he died and naturally we had to abandon him it came on to blow very hard and with the horses collapsing on all sides and the loads getting constantly undone owing to the repeated falls of the animals we could not cover more than one mile or two an hour caravans generally take the road over these mountains during the day so that now the road was quite deserted and we could get assistance from any one the loss of one horse increased our difﬁculty it involved putting more weight on the other horses at we managed to reach the caravanserai in the mountains at gyabrabat gabarabat the sight of which was enough to settle all the horses they one and all threw themselves down on reaching the door and it was not possible to make them stand again to continue the journey to kohrut kohrud through the night i had intended was absolutely out of the question so we roused the keeper of the hostelry and demanded admission the man was extremely uncivil he said he had some grievance against previous english traveller but on being assured that i would pay with my own hands all i got and not through rule which i always follow and which saves much unpleasantness and unfair criticism from the provided with all i required first of all i fed the horses then sadek cooked capital supper then i gave the horses and myself some four hours refreshed us all very much the caravanserai was ﬁlthy all the small rooms and alcoves were occupied and i preferred to sleep out in the yard sheltered from the wind behind the huge doorway i had with some boxes of my own invention and manufacture which had accompanied on several previous journeys and which besides number of other purposes can serve bedstead they came in very usefully on that particular occasion from gyabrabad to kohrut the region is supposed to be famous haunt of robbers undoubtedly the country lends itself to that kind of enterprise being mountainous and much broken up so that the occupation can be carried on with practical impunity the road is among rocks and boulders although there are very great elevations in the mountains on either side the scenery is picturesque with rocky slopes at the bottom of which tiny and beautifully limpid stream descends towards kashan the track is mostly along this the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https t rack along the k ohrut d am between g yabrabad and k ohrut after steep stony incline of some length between gyabrabad and the kohrut pass one comes across high and dam the work of speculator in winter and during the rains the water of the stream is shut up here into large reservoir high wall being built across the two mountain slopes and forming large lake the water is then sold to the city of kashan if in due course of time the is not forthcoming the supply is cut off altogether by blocking up the small aperture in the lets out the tiny stream the course of which we have been following upwards the persian is most wonderful animal his endurance and powers of recovery are simply extraordinary having been properly fed and enjoyed the few hours rest the animals notwithstanding their wretched condition and the bad road went fairly well on nearing kohrut one is agreeably surprised to ﬁnd among these barren mountains healthy patches of agriculture and beautiful groves of the fruit is excellent here plums apricots walnuts and the kohrut potatoes are said by the people of kohrut to be the best in the world the most remarkable thing about these patches of cultivation is that the soil in which they occur has been brought mountain itself being the imported earth is supported by means of strong stone walls forming long terraces this speaks very highly the industry of the natives who are extremely hardworking we go through these delightful groves nearly one mile when suddenly we ﬁnd ourselves in front of kohrut village most picturesquely perched on the steep slope of the mountain the houses are of an absolutely different type from the characteristically domed persian hovels one has so far come across they have sever al storeys two or even extremely rare occurrence in persian habitations the lower windo ws are very small like slits in the wall but the top windows are large and square usually with some lattice woodwork in front of them the domed roofs have been discarded owing to the quantity of wood obtainable here and the roofs are ﬂat and thatched supported on long projecting beams and rafters just before entering the village great number of ancient graves can be seen dotted on the and along the road the view of the place with its beautiful background of weird mountains and the positions of the houses the door of one on the level with the roof of the underlying one against the face of the rock are most striking the i nterior of c happ ar k hana at k ohrut the inhabitants of this village are quite polite and friendly and lack the usual aggressiveness so common at all the halting places in the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https horses were obtained at the chappar khana and i proceeded on my journey at once we still wound our way among mountains going higher and higher until we got over the the pass from the highest point lovely view of the valley over which we had come from the west displayed itself in dark brown tints and to the east we had mass of barren mountains chapter xxvi crossing the up by to protect from and tribes englishman feature of persian military compensation is paid by the persian and the from teheran to isfahan it was not till after sunset that we crossed the pass and the horses being tired my men and i were walking down the incline on the other side to give the animals rest it was getting quite dark and the chappar boy had warned that there were brigands about the neighbourhood i walked close to my horse my revolver being slung to the saddle the place seemed absolutely deserted and i was just thinking how still and reposeful the evening seemed the noise of the horses hoofs being the only disturbing element amid quiescent nature when suddenly from behind rocks and boulders leapt up on both sides of the road about dozen robbers who attempted to seize the horses before they had time to put up their riﬂes they found themselves covered by my revolver and requested to drop their weapons or i would shoot them they hastily complied with my request and instead of ransacking my baggage they had evidently designed to had to conﬁne themselves to polite remarks you are very late on the road sahib said one brigand in voice of assumed kindness and softness please put back your revolver we will not harm you said suavely and persuasively another who displayed most gaudy waistcoat which he evidently did not want perforated sadek was in great state of excitement and entreated not to shoot persian robbers he assured with logic of his own not kill the master until the servant has been killed because it is the servant who is in charge of the luggage they would not steal anything now but i must be kind to these fellows is usual with persons accustomed to stalk other persons i did not fail to notice that while trying to attract my attention by conversation my interlocutors were endeavouring to surround us but i checked them in this and warned them that i had met many brigands before and was well acquainted with their ways i hoped they would not compel to shoot which i would most certainly if they attempted any tricks they well understood that it was risky to try their luck so they changed tactics altogether the conversation that ensued was amusing sahib shouted boisterous robber very gaily attired and with cartridges in profusion in his belt there are lots of brigands near here and we want to protect you yes i know there are brigands not far from here i assented we will escort you you are our friend and if we lead you safely out of the mountains maybe sahib you will give us backshish i felt certain that i could have better protection against brigands than the brigands themselves and preferred to have them under my own supervision rather than give them chance of attacking us unexpectedly again some miles further on anyhow i resolved to let them come far the next pass we had to cross from which point the country would be more open and sudden surprise impossible so i accepted their offer with politely expressed condition that every man must keep in front of and not raise his riﬂe above his waist or i would send bullet through him in the middle of the night we parted on the summit of the pass and i gave them good not so much the service they had rendered relieving few hours the monotony of the journey they were grateful and were the most civil brigands i have ever encountered while resting on the pass we had an amicable conversation and i asked them where they got their beautiful clothes and the profusion of gold and silver it is not everybody we meet sahib that has formidable revolver like yours answered the boisterous brigand with ﬁt of sarcastic merriment echoed by all of us yes i retorted in the same sarcastic spirit if it had not been the revolver possibly next time i came along this road i might meet the company dressed up like sahibs in my clothes i advised them to put up white ﬂag of truce next time they sprang out from behind rocks with the intention of holding up another englishman or surely some day or other there would be an accident we all laughed heartily and parted with repeated my luggage intact in the moonlight i took the precaution to see them well out of sight on one side of the pass before we began to descend on the other and then we proceeded down the steep and rocky incline we reached soh feet early in the morning and went on to the chappa r house at biddeshk here one abandons the region of the kehriz kohrud and kale karf mountains west and east of the road respectively and travels over ﬂat sandy country devoid of vegetation and water copper and iron are to be found at several places in the mountains between kashan and soh instance near gudjar at dainum and at kohrut october is the month when the backhtiari tribes are somewhat troublesome previous to their return to winter quarters great many caravans are attacked and robbed on this road unless escorted by soldiers daring attempts have even been made to seize caravans of silver bullion the bank the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https only few days before i went through an english gentleman travelling from isfahan was robbed between soh and murchikhar of all his baggage money and clothes the country lends itself to brigandage one can see ﬂat plain several miles to the north and south but to the west and east are most intricate mountain masses where the robber bands ﬁnd suitable hiding places themselves and their booty to the we have ﬂat open country but to the west from biddeshk there are many three different ranges of mountains to the east rises the peak kehriz natenz great many low hill ranges lie between the main backbone of the high and important range extending from to and the route we follow and it is curious to notice not only here but all over the parts of persia i visited that the great majority of sand dunes and of hill and mountain ranges face north or in other words they extend either from to or roughly from west to east very seldom from north to south from biddeshk two soldiers insisted on escorting my luggage i was advised to take them in default one can not claim compensation from the persian government should the luggage be stolen in the case of bona ﬁde european travellers robbed on the road the persian government is extremely punctual in making good the damage sustained and paying ample compensation the method employed by the local governor responsible the safety of travellers on the road is to inﬂict heavy ﬁnes on all the natives of the district in which the robbery has occurred very simple and apparently effective way it would seem of stopping brigandage but one which in fact increases it because in order to ﬁnd the money to pay the ﬁnes the natives are driven to the road

water is very bad the soldiers laden with cartridges ran along by the side of my horses and pretended to keep sharp robbers every now and then they got much excited loaded their riﬂes and ﬁred away shot after shot at phantom brigands whom they said they perceived peeping above sand hills long way of at murchikhar there is nothing to be seen the were very good here and i was able to go through this uninteresting part of the road at good speed of from six to seven miles an hour to the west the mountains were getting quite close and in fact we had hills all round except to the east murchikhar is at fairly high altitude one still heard much about brigands soldiers armed to the teeth insisted on accompanying my luggage this of course involved endless back shish but had to be put up with it is one of the perquisites of the guards stationed at the various stages i have heard it stated that if one does not require their services it is often these protectors themselves who turn into robbers there is house on the road and the two soldiers stationed there told us that large band of thirty robbers had visited them during the early hours of the morning and had stolen from them all their provisions money and tobacco we were not troubled in any way and with the exception of some suspicious horsemen long way off making the mountains we hardly met soul on the road curious accident happened to one of my luggage horses some reason of his own he bolted and galloped to the top of one of the kanat cones when getting frightened at the deep hole before him he jumped it his having given way on the steep incline on the other side he fell the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https head and turned complete somersault landing ﬂat on his back where owing to the packs he remained with his legs up in the air until we came to his aid and freed him of the loads on nearing ghiez the track is over undulating country but after that the road to isfahan is good and ﬂat but very sandy and dusty i got to ghiez in the evening but proceeded at once to isfahan we galloped on the twelve miles and in less than two hours i was most hospitably received in the house of mr preece the british in isfahan the distances from teheran are follows from teheran to kum 24farsakhs 96miles kum to kashan 17 68 kashan to kohrut 7 28 kohrut to biddeshk 6 24 biddeshk to murchikhar 6 24 murchikhar to ghiez 6 24 ghiez to isfahan 3 12 total 69farsakhs or 276miles the time occupied in covering the whole distance including halts and delays was somewhat less than four days chapter xxvii missionary work in nal and medical mahommedan armenian view of long rev james loraine mission among the jews there is little to say of interest in connection with missionary work in persia except that considerable amount of good is being done in the educational and medical line there are established schools and hospitals the most praiseworthy institution is the supply of medicinal advice and medicine gratis or at nomin al cost far the work of christianising is concerned it must be recollected that missionaries are only allowed in persia on sufferance and are on account permitted to make converts among the mahommedans any mussulman man woman or child who discards his religion christianity will in all probability lose his life if any christianising work is done at all it has to be done surreptitiously and at considerable amount of risk to both convert and conv erter some interest in the christian religion is nevertheless shown by mussulmans of the younger now are practically atheists at whether this interest is genuine or not it is not to say there is much in the bible that impresses them and i understand that constant applications are made copies of translations into the persian language to avoid the great waste which occurred when bibles were given away nothing nominal charge is now made so to prevent people throwing the book away or using it evil purposes in isfahan itself there are missionaries among the mahommedans but some are to be found at julfa suburb of isfahan on the south bank of the river julfa was in former days prosperous armenian settlement of some inhabitants but is now mostly in ruins since the great migration of armenians to india there is an armenian archbishop at julfa he has real power but is much revered by the armenians themselves he provides priests the armenians of india handsome cathedral with elaborate ornamentations and allegorical pictures is one of the principal structures in julfa one can not help admiring the armenians of julfa retaining their conservat ive customs so long within the last few years however rapid strides have been made towards the abandonment of the ancient dress and tongue at julfa the armenians have to great extent retained their native language which they invariably speak among themselves although many of the men are equally ﬂuent in persian but in cities like teheran where they are thrown into more direct contact with persians the armenians are almost more conversant with persian than with their own tongue the men and women of the better classes have adopted european clothes in which they might easily be mistaken southern italians or spaniards but in julfa such is not the case and the ancient style of dress is so far maintained one is struck by the great number of women in the streets of julfa and the comparative lack of men this is because all men migrate to india or europe leaving their women behind until sufﬁcient wealth is accumulated to export them also to foreign lands the education of the armenian women of the middle and lower classes consists principally in knitting sees rows of matron s and girls sitting on the doorsteps busily employed thus and in various forms of culinary instruction but the better class woman is well educated in european fashion and is bright and intelligent the armenian woman in her ample and speckless white robes her face and beautiful soft black eyes is occasionally captivat ing the men on the other hand although handsome have something indescribable about them that does not make them particularly attractive the armenian true type of the great business capacities wonderful facility picking up languages and persuasive ﬂow of words ever at his command sceptical ironical and bright amusing manner alike in times of plenty or born philosopher but uninspiring of conﬁdence eyes that never look straigh t into yours but the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https roaming all over the place religious notions adaptable to busine ss prospects hospitable and given to occasional or gies is the of the more intelligent members of the male community migrate to better pastures where they succeed by steady hard work and really practical brains in amassing considerable fortunes the less enterprising remain at home to make and sell wine personally i found armenians surprisingly honest in julfa the whom except in business there are comfortable almost luxurious residences the principal streets of the settlement are extremely clean and nice persia the telegraph ofﬁce is also here but the best part of pictorial point of the extensive armenian cemetery near picturesque background of hills and directly on the slopes of mount soﬁa there are hundreds of rectangular tombstones many with neatly bevelled edges and epitaphs of four or ﬁve lines cross is engraved on each grave and some have little urn at the head ﬂowers from the roof of house situated at the highest point of the inclined plane one obtains magniﬁcent view of isfahan its ancient grandeur being evinced by the great expanse of ruins all round it the walls of isfahan were said at one time to measure miles in circumference like all other cities of persia isfahan does not improve by too distant view the mud roofs are so alike in colour to the dried mud of the streets that deadly monotony must follow matter of course but the many beautiful green gardens round about and in isfahan itself are great relief to the eye and add much attraction to the landscape most prominent of all buildings in the city are the great dome of the with its gracefully ornamented tiles the madrassah the palace and the high minarets in couples dotted all over the city then round about further away stand any number of curious circular towers the pigeon towers the bed of the river between isfahan and julfa is over six hundred feet wide and is spanned by three bridges one of these with arches is less than in length but is much out of repair the armenian christians of julfa are enjoying comparative safety at present but until quite recently were much persecuted by the mahommedans the mullahs being particularly bitter against them one sees great many priests about julfa and i visited the place on sunday the people looked so very demure and am speaking of the their way out of church taciturn and with head low or talking in whisper all toddling alongside the people from church generally i must confes s i was glad when i left this place of oppressive sanctity and returned to isfahan somehow julfa impresses one discordant note in persian although very ﬁne and pleasing note in itself until quite recently the persians objected to foreigners residing even in isfahan itself the ofﬁcials of the bank of persia were the ﬁrst to take up their abode within the city wall then soon after came preece our able and distinguished there is now third englishman residing in jubareh the jewish quarter the revd james loraine garland of the london society promoting christianity amongst the jews of isfahan why such society should exist at all seems to any one with sense of humour bewildering but on getting over the ﬁrst shock of surprise one ﬁnds that of all the missions to persia it is probably the most sensible and worked on practical sound useful lines much i am unfavourably inclined towards religious missions of any kind i could not help being impressed with mr garland very interesting work the ﬁrst time i saw garland i was nearly run over by him he was riding race with sporting friend on the golahek road near clouds of dust much to the concern of the same day i met garland in teheran when he was garbed in the ample clothes of the sporting friend his own wardrobe having been stolen with his money and all other possessions by robbers on the road in fact he was the englishman referred to in chapter xxvi being somewhat of sportsman myself this clergyman appealed to extremely gentlemanly courteous tactful sensible and he was not bit like missionary he was really good man his heart and soul were in his work he very kindly asked to visit his mission in isfahan and it was real pleasure to see mission worked on such sensible lines the ﬁrst mission to the jews of persia and chaldea was established in 1844 by the reverend stern who resided part of the year in bagdad and the remainder in isfahan the work was and in 1865 the mission was suspended chapter xxviii the mission among boys and practical jews of by of social level of jews from october 1889 to december 1891 christianised jew of teheran named mirza korollah worked in isfahan the representative of the society promoting christianity among the jews bible depôt was opened and school started at the request of the jews themselves in december 1891 however mirza korollah was banished from the city and the work was again interrupted in 1897 garland volunteered to undertake the work in persia and his offer was gladly accepted on his arrival in isfahan he found he told prosperous boys school that had been in 1894 by native jewish christian who rejoiced in the name of joseph hakim and who carried on the educational work under the supervision of members of the church missionary society resident in julfa it was deemed advisable to commence many of the boys were unable to attend day classes the scheme answered very well and has been steadily the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https many 200 boys attended the school daily in february 1898 fact that shows the success of the new enterprise from the very beginning at the invitation of number of jewe sses miss stuart the bishop of waiapu daughter kindly consented to go over twice week to the jewish quarter to instruct them in the holy scriptures this led to the commencement of girls school with twelve pupils at time of great turmoil and anxiety however the experiment had the happiest results it was not nevertheless till 1899 that garland was able to take up his abode in the jewish quarter he met with opposition whatever from mahommedans or jews the usual sunday service attended by converts and inquirers and saturday afternoon class were commenced in 1899 and have uninterruptedly continued to the present time to personally the most important part of the mission and one to which more time is devoted than to praying was the excellent carpentry class boys begun in 1900 and the apparatus set up on the premises the girls the former has been great success even ﬁnancially and is paying its way the latter althoug h ﬁnancially not yet success is of great value in teaching the girls how to weave necessarily so many hands have to be employed in the manufacture of large carpet and the time spent in the manufacture is so long that it is hardly possible to expect ﬁnancial prosperity from mere beginners but the class teaches the girls way to earn money themselves in future years both trades were selected by garland particularly because they were the most suitable in country where jews are excluded from the more honest and manly trades and jewesses often grow up to be more of hindrance than help to their husbands worse still is the case of jews who become christians they have the greatest difﬁculty in earning their living at all these industrial occupations are great practical help to the studies of the pupils who are taught besides their own language persian and hebrew and if they wish english geography etc more frivolous but less remunerative forms of recreation such cricket tennis football or gymnastic drills invariably accompany christianity in the east and develop most parts of convert anatomy except his brain not been deemed of sufﬁcient importance among the jews of isfahan who would moreover think our best english games or in the highest degree indecorous and unseemly on the whole the society work among the jews of teheran hamadan and isfahan has been most encouraging and this is to be put down entirely to the tact and personal inﬂue nce of garland who is greatly respected by jews and mahommedans alike better testimon y to the appreciation of his work could exist than the fact that in his interesting journeys through persia he is frequently invited to preach in crowded synagogues it seems probable that the jews of persia are descendants of the ten tribes and more probable still that jews have resided in isfahan from its earliest foundation in the tenth the dilemi consisted of two cities yahoodieh jewry and shehristan the city in the middle of the twelfth century according to benjamin of tudela the jews of isfahan numbered at present they number about they are mostly pedlars by profession or engaged in making silk thread abreesham kâr charkhtâbee there are few merchants of comparative inﬂuence jewellers and traders in precious stones brokers and are frequent but the majority consists almost entirely of diviners musicians and dancing are considered low contemptible occupations in and beggars the jews of isfahan like those of all other cities in persia have been subject ed to great deal of oppression there is story that timour of 14th century was riding past synagogue in isfahan where the mesjid now stands and that the jews made such horrible noise at their prayers in saying the shema israel on the day of atonement that his horse bolted and he was thrown and lamed hence his name and hence also terrible massacre of the jews which reduced their number to about even to this day it is not easy jews to obtain justice against mahommedans only recently 1901 jew was murdered in cold blood few miles from isfahan and his body ﬂung into the river although the murder had been witness ed and the murderer was well known punishment was ever inﬂicted upon him jewish g irls i sfahan the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https i sfahan j ew the jews of isfahan possess striking features can be seen by characteristic head of man reproduced in the illustration the face is generally very much elongated with aquiline nose of abnormal length and very broad at the nostrils the brow is heavy screening eyes revealing mixed expression of sadne ss and slyness tempered somewhat by probable abuse of animal qualities of quiet and rather sulky by assumedly courteous but morose by nature mighty level head in the matter of business such is the jew of isfahan he is extremely picturesque quite biblical in his long loose robe and skull cap with turban wound tight round his head jewish girls when very young are without being beautiful very supple and pensive and with expressive eyes they lack the unsteady insincere countenance of the men and have reposeful placid faces with occasional good features there is good deal of character in their ﬁrmly closed lips the upper lip being slightly heavy but the inside of the mouth is adorned with most regular ﬁrm and beautiful teeth curiously enough the typical jewish characteristic in seldom markedly noticeable in women i have even seen jewish girls with noses their arms are beautifully modelled and the hands whole extremely graceful with unusually long and supple ﬁngers but with nails of an unwholesome colour jewesses in persia are not kept in seclusion and go about with uncovered faces which exposes them to constant and unpleasant insult from the mahommedans they dress differently from persian women with long skirt of either black blue or coloured cotton the head is framed in white kerchief leaving exposed the jet black hair parted in the middle and covering the temples over that is worn long cloak either black or white almost identical with the persian chudder jewesses are said to be most affectionate and devoted to their husbands and their families they are extremely amenable to in cases of jealousy which is one of the leading characteristics of the race in general and of jewish women in particular they are intelligent thrifty they take life seriou sly are endowed with sense of humour to speak would be difﬁcult to have any under their whether owing to severe anæmia caused by wretched and insufﬁcient food or to some external inﬂuence are often affected by melancholia soft and shy in manner and speech under normal circumstances pale and silent the jewish woman is not unattractive one of the few occupations open to jewesses is the practice of midwifery hunted the jews are by everybody in the streets and in the bazaar insulted spat upon the women often compelled to prostitution it is to be marvelled that any honesty at all is left in them the higher persian schools and colleges not admit jews students nor is education permitted to them even in the lower persian schools therefore the welcome work of garland is much needed and appreciated special quarter is reserved in which the jews must live huddled together the majority of them in abject poverty until of late peace was given them their customs were interfered with in every way by vagabond persians and the little money they made by industrious habits was extorted from them by ofﬁcials or by the enterprising persian to whom the jewish community was farmed out the jews of city are taxed certain sum usually beyond what they can afford to pay some speculator undertakes to pay the amount them to the local governor and receives authority to compensate himself from the jewish community best he can either by making them work or trade or by selling their clothes or depriving them of the few articles of furniture they may possess until quite lately at public festivities the meek and resigned jews were driven before an insulting mob who held them in derision and exposed them to most abject treatment some of their number ending by being pitched into the water which adorns the courtyard or garden of most residences little by little however with the spread of civilisation jews have been spared the torture of these baths the jew is looked upon unclean and untrustworthy by the persian who refuses to use him soldier but who gladly employs him to all sorts of dirty jobs which persian pride would not allow him to himself his social level therefore stands even lower than that of the shotri of india the outcast who does not stop at the basest occupations the majority of the older jews are illiterate but not unintelligent each city has one or more rabbis or priests but they have power and receive good share of the insults in the persian bazaars whatever feeling of repulsion towards the race one may have

and the horsemen to make room the passing sahib it is very difﬁcult under such circumstances to stop any length of time at any particular spot to study the shops the and the buyers instead of being an unobserved spectator one is at all times the principal actor in the scene and the centre of attention and therefore most disturbing element in the crowd there are so many complicated and tiresome formalities to be adhered to in order to avoid offending the natives or the ofﬁcials or the susceptibilities of foreign residents who seem to feel responsible the doings of every who at all events remain to suffer the untactful deeds of some of them there are so many things one must not fear of destroying the prestige of one country that really if one possesses simple and practical mind one

by to our consul the horse had not been ridden some time and was slightly fresh the place to which we directed our animals was the brass bazaar the most crowded and diabolically noisy place in the shah dominions the sudden change from the brilliant light of the sun to the pitch darkness of the vaulted bazaar affected one sight and it was some few seconds before one could distinguish anything although one could hear the buzzing noise of an excited crowd and the cries of the ghulams ordering the people to make room the cavalcade in nearly all bazaars of the principal cities of persia very good custom prevails one or more streets are devoted entirely to the same article so that the buyer may conveniently make comparisons and the various merchants are also kept up to the mark by the salutary competition close at hand thus rendered unavoidabl persian does not go to shop to buy anything without going to every other shop in the bazaar to ask whether he can get similar article better

buyers from the sun in summer from the rain and snow in winter the height of the arcade is from thirty to sixty feet the more ancient ones being lower than the modern ones to any one well acquainted with other eastern countries there is absolutely nothing in persian bazaar that is worth buying the old and beautiful objects of art have left the country long ago and the modern ones have neither sufﬁcient artistic merit nor intrinsic value to be worth the trouble and expense of sending them home curiosity there are few tawdry articles which may amuse friends in europe but what i mean is that there is nothing that is really of intense interest or skilful workmanship such one can ﬁnd in japan in china in morocco or egypt we ride through the street of hatters each shop with walls lined with piles of kolah hats black and brimless shaped either in the section of cone or rounded with depression on the top they are made of astrakan or of black felt and are worn by the better people but further on we come to cheaper shops where spherical skull caps of white or light brown felt are being manufactured the lower classes we ride along stinging smell of dyes tells us that we are in the

leather bazaar man this is probably the most typical and interesting section of the persian retail commerce there is something picturesque and artistic in the clumsy silver or brass or iron mounted saddles with handsome red or green or brown ample leather ﬂaps gracefully ornamented with more or less elaboration to suit the pockets of different customers then the harness is pretty with its silver inlaid iron decoration or solid silver or brass and the characteristic stirrups nicely chiselled and not unlike the mexican ones the greater part of the foot can rest on the stirrup so broad is its base then come the saddlebags of all sizes the horjin in cloth in sacking in expensive leather in carpeting of all prices with an ingenious device of succession of loops fastening the one into the other the last with padlock to secure the contents of the bag from intrusive hands these horjins double extremely convenient and are the most usual contriva nce in persia conveying luggage on

impossible to hear any one speak the din of the hammered metal being so acute and being echoed in each dome of the arcade the horse became so alarmed when the bellows began to blow upon the ﬁre that he tried to throw ﬁrst by standing on his and scattering the crowd of yelling natives with his hindlegs then by standing up erect the other way about in moment the place was clear of people some had leapt on to the side platform others had rushed inside the shops the horse delighted in pirouetting about kicking the nearest metal vases and trays all over the place and causing quite commotion it

typical persian barbers their short razors in wooden cases are stropped on the barber arm or occasionally leg and are quite sharp the younger folks of persia shave the top of the skull leaving long locks of hair at the side of the head which are gracefully pushed over the ear and left hanging long behind where they are cut in straight horizontal line round the neck this fashion is necessitated

goods are spread inspection some of the richer caravanserais are quite handsome with neat latticed windows and doors the walls are painted white the court is crammed with tired camels mules beggars

after each horizontal row of twisted threads long horizontal thread is interwoven and then the lot is beaten down with heavy iron comb with handle to it not unlike huge cleaner there are different modes of twisting the threads and this constitutes the chief characteristic of carpets made in one province or another the labour involved in their manufac ture is enormous and some carpets take several years to manufacture the children employed are made to work very hard at the less than twelve or fourteen hours the exertion upon their memory to remember the design which has taken them several months to learn by heart is great the constant strain on the eyes which have to be kept ﬁxed on each successive vertical thread so not to pick up the wrong one is very injurious to their sight many of the children of the factories i visited were and there was hardly poor mite who did not rub his eyes with the back of his hand when i asked him to suspend work moment the tension upon their pupils must be enormous in the dim light although made in primitive method the carpet weaving of persia is about the only manufacture that deserves place in the industries of iran the carpets still have certain artistic merit although already contaminated to mean extent by european commerciality instead of the beautiful and everlasting vegetable dyes which were formerly used the worsted and silks and the magniﬁcent blue reds greens greys and browns ghastly aniline dyed and hurtful to the very commonly used now also of the carpets export to europe and america the same care is not taken in the manufactu re in the ancient carpets and the bastard design is often shockingly vulgarised to appease the inartistic buyer but even with all these faults persian carpets if not to the eye of an expert all general purposes are on the whole better than those of any other manufacture they have still the great advantage of being made entirely by hand instead of by machinery it is not unwise before buying persian carpet to rub it well with white cloth if it is some of the colour will come off but if the old persian dyes have been used mark should remain on the cloth however even without resorting to this it must be very poor eye indeed that can not recognise at once the terrible raw colours of aniline from the soft delicious tones of vegetable dyes which time can only soften but

are some thirty different types of carpets in persia the kerman carpets are to my mind the most beautiful i saw in persia in design colour and softness they seem more original and graceful with conventional plant ﬂower and bird representations of delicate and very varied tints and not so much geometrical design about them is the case in the majority of persian carpets less successful in fact quite ugly but quaint are those in which very large and ﬁgures are represented one feels arab inﬂuence very strongly in great many of the kerman designs they say that kerman sheep have extremely soft and silky hair and also that the kerman water possesses some chemical qualities which are unsurpassable obtaining most perfect tones of colour with the various dyes the principal carpet factory is in the governor palace where old designs are faithfully copied and really excellent results obtained the present governor and his nephew take particular interest in the manufacture and devote much attention to the carpets which retain the ancient native characteristics and are hardly contaminated by foreign inﬂuence the isfahan silk carpets are also very beautiful but not quite so reposeful in colour nor graceful in design those of kurdistan are principally small prayer rugs rather vivid in colour and much used by mahommedans in their morning and evening salaams towards mecca in khorassan meshed sultanabad kaian kain and birjand some very thick carpets are made of excellent wear but not so very artistic in the birjand ones brown is prevailing colour used too freely background and often taking away from the otherwise graceful design sultan abad is probably the greatest centre of export nearly every household possessing loom the ﬁrm of ziegler is the most extensive buyer and exporter of these carpets the herat afghanistan carpets are also renowned and ﬁnd their way mostly to europe in shiraz and faristan we ﬁnd the long narrow rugs soft velvet and usually with geometrical designs on them red blue and white are the prevalent colours it would be too long to enumerate all the places where good carpets are made but kermanshah tabriz yezd fact nearly all big centres make carpets each having special characteristics of their own although in general appearance bearing to the uninitiated more or less similar semblance the rugs made by the wandering tribes of and persia are quaint and interesting the persian beluch rugs are somewhat minute and irregular in design deep in colour with occasional discords of tones but they recommend themselves by being so strongly made that it is almost impossible to wear them out they are generally small being woven inside their tents by the women in northern persia turcoman most adaptable of all european seldom to be found now they are generally bought up russia dark red warm and extremely soft is the striking note in these carpets and the design is quite sedate carpets except the cheaper ones are seldom sold in the bazaars nowadays they are purchased on the looms the best ones are only made to order there are of course few rug shops and occasionally an old carpet ﬁnds its way to shop in the bazaar next in attraction to carpets come the jewellers shops the goldsmiths and silversmiths shops are not very numerous in the bazaars nor when we come to examine the work carefully they have anything really worth buying the work is on good gold or silver of pure quality but with few exceptions is generally clumsy in design and heavily executed figures are attempted with most inartistic results on silver cases and boxes the frontage of goldsmith shop has great variety of articles bracelets rings necklaces tea and coffee pots stands coffee cups and enamelled pipe heads silver kalian or two an old cigar full of turquoises and another full of other precious rather imitations of precious little tray with forgeries of ancient coins that is about all pearls and diamonds and really valuable stones are usually concealed in neat paper parcels carried on the person by the jeweller and produced on the demand of customers the swordmaker and gunsmith displays many daggers and blades of local make and great number of obsolete belgian and russian revolve rs also good many martini and snider riﬂes which have found their way here from india occasionally good modern pistol or gun is to be seen good riﬂes or revolvers ﬁnd prompt sale in persia at enormous ﬁgures nearly every man in the country carries riﬂe had i chosen i could have sold my riﬂes and revolvers twenty times over when in persia the sums offered them being two or three times what i had paid them myself but my riﬂes had been very faithful companions to one mannlicher had been twice in tibet the other winchester had accompanied through the chin ese campaign and i would accept sum them one is carried back few score of years on seeing the old rings carrying and also gunpowder ﬂasks and even old picture sque ﬂintlocks and matchlocks but still taking things all round it is rather interesting to note that there is considerable number of men in iran who are armed with serviceable cartridge riﬂes which they can use with accuracy cartridge riﬂes are at great premium and although their importation is not allowed they have found their way in considerable quantities from all sides but principally they tell from india via the gulf one of the notes of the bazaar is that in almost every shop one sees cage or two with birds in the morning and evening male member of the family takes the cage and birds out walk in the air and sun the

were only some ﬁfty students of all ages from children to old men much time is devoted by them to theological studies and some smattering of geography and history one can not leave isfahan without visiting the old palace in garden formerly beautiful but and untidy now on pavement of slabs which are longer on the level with one another stands the palace of the twenty columns called of the forty columns probably because the twenty existing ones are reﬂected in mirror in the long rectangular tank of water extending between this palace and the present dwelling of sultan governor of isfahan distance lends much enchantment to everything in persia and such is the case even in this palace probably the most tawdrily gor geous structure in persia the palace is divided into two sections the open throne hall and the picture hall behind it the twenty octagonal columns of the open hall were once inlaid with venetian mirrors and still display bases of four grinning lions carved in stone but on getting near them one ﬁnds that the bases are chipped off and damaged the glass almost all gone and the foundation of the columns only remains painted the lower portion of the column some three feet is ornamented with painted ﬂowers red in blue vases the ﬂoor under the colonnade is paved with bricks and there is raised platform the throne reached by four stone steps there is frieze here of graceful although conventional ﬂoral decoration with gold leaves in the wall are two windows giving light to two now empty rooms the end central receptacle or niche is gaudily ornamented with venetian cut in small triangles and it has pretty ceiling with pattern capitals in an upward crescendo of triangles the ceiling above the upper platform is made entirely of mirrors with adornments in blue and gold and glass representing the sky the sun and golden lions smaller suns also appear in the ornamentation of the frieze the ceiling above the colonnade and the beams between the columns are richly ornamented in blue grey red and gold this ceiling is divided into ﬁfteen rectangles the central panel having geometrical pattern of considerable beauty in which indeed throughout the ﬁgure of the sun is prominent the inner hall must have been magniﬁ cent room in its more ﬂourishing days it is now used storeroom banners furniture swords and spears piled everywhere on the ﬂoor and against the walls one can not see very well what the lower portion of the walls is like owing to the quantity of things amassed all round and so covered with dust not to invite removal or even touch but there seems to be frieze nine feet high with elaborate blue vases on which the artist called into life gold ﬂowers and graceful the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https large paintings are of considerable interest apart from their historical value in the centre facing the entrance door we detect nadir shah the napoleon of persia the leader of men through khorassan sistan kandahar and cabul he is said to have crossed from afghanistan through the khyber pass to peshawar and from there to delhi where his presence led to scene of loot and carnage but to him was certainly due the extension of the persian boundary to the indus towards the east and to the oxus on the north in the picture he is represented on horseback with great following of elephants and turbaned ﬁgures to the right we have ﬁght in which shah ismail who became shah of persia in 1499 is the hero and crowd of bokhara warriors and afghans the secondary ﬁgures evidently the painting is to commemorate the great successes obtained by ismail in khorassan samarkand and tashkend the third is more peaceful bokhara dancing girl performing before shah tamasp eldest of four sons of ismail and successor to his throne the shah is represented entertaining the indian emperor humaiyun in the lower portion of this picture is in good preservation but the upper part has been patched up with hideous ornamentations of birds and ﬂowers on red ground over the door shah ismail wearing white turban is represented riding white horse and carrying good supply of arrows the shah is in the act of killing foe and the painting probably represents one of his heroic deeds at the battle of khoi against salim to the right of the door there is picture of dancing and feasting with shah abbas offering drink in sign of friendship to abdul mohmek khan osbek finally to the left of the front door we have pictorially the most pleasing of the whole series another scene of feasting with the youthful ﬁgure of shah abbas ii died 1668 man of great pluck but unfortunately given to drunkenness and licentious living which developed brutal qualities in him it was he who blinded many of his relation s by placing irons in front of their eyes considering this too lenient punishment he ordered their eyes to be extracted altogether we see him now sitting upon his knees garbed in red tunic and turban in the foreground most graceful girl in red and green robes with peculiar waistband and ﬂying locks of hair the artist has very faithfully depicted the voluptuous twist of her waist much appreciated by persians in dancing and he has also managed to infuse considerable character into the musicians the guitar man and the followers of the shah to the left of the picture one looks at it and the tambourine ﬁgure to the right fruit and other refreshments lie in profusion in vessels on the ﬂoor elaborately painted this picture is rectangular and is probably not only the most artistic but the best preserved of the lot one of z il es ultan s unuchs the h all of the f orty c olumns i sfahan great labour and patience in working out details have been the aim of the artists of all these pictures rather than true effects of nature and the faces hands and poses are of course in most persian paintings conventionalized and absolut ely regardless of proportion perspective or atmospherical inﬂuence or called aerial perspective the objection common in nearly all countries england included to shadows on the faces is intensiﬁed in persian paintings and handicaps the artist to mean degree in his attempts to give relief to his ﬁgures moreover the manipulation and concentration of light and the art of composing picture are not understood in old persian paintings and the result is that it is most difﬁcult to see picture an ensemble the eye roams all over the painting attracted here by patch of brilliant yello w there by another equally vivacious red here by some bright detail there by something else and like so many ghosts in haunted room peep out the huge black eyes heads all over the picture standing like prominent patches out of the plane they are painted on the pictures are nevertheless extremely interesting and from persian standpoint magniﬁcently painted such is not the case with the modern and shocking portrait of shah painted the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https best oil colours in european style his majesty wearing gaudy uniform with great wealth of gold and diamonds this would be bad painting anywhere in persia or europe the ceiling of this hall is really superb it has three domes the centre one more lofty than the two side ones the higher dome is gilt and is most gracefully ornamented with reﬁned leaf pattern and twelve gold stars while the other two cupolas are blue with similar leaf ornamentation in gold there is much quaint irregularity in the geometrical design of the corners shaped like kite of gold blue and green while other corners are red and light blue with the sides of green and gold of most delicate tones these are quite violent contrast to the extravagant ﬂaming red patches directly over the paintings the hall is lighted by three windows at each end near the lower arch of the side domes and three further double windows immediately under them there is one main entrance and three exits one large and two small

quivering minarets above the shrine and tomb of saint these towers according to persians are at least eight centuries old enclosed in rectangular wall is the high sacred domed tomb and on either side of the pointed arch of the mesjid rise towards the sky the two minarets with quadrangular bases spiral staircase inside each minaret just wide enough to let man through conveys one to the top wherein four small windows are to be found by seizing the wall at one of the apertures and shaking it violently an unpleasant oscillation can be started and continues of its own accord the minaret diver ging from the perpendicular much two inches on either side presently the second minar et begins to vibrate also in uniformity with the ﬁrst and the vibration can be felt along the front platform between the two minarets but not in other parts of the structure large crack by the side of one of the minarets which is said to have existed from time immemorial foretells that some day or other minarets and front wall will come down but it certainly speaks well the elasticity of minarets of 800 years ago that they have stood up quivering so long the minarets are not very high some feet above the roof of

unfamiliar with the real topography and resources of country to those who have travelled it is quite extraordinary what an appalling mass of nonsensical rubbish can be supplied to the public by

quite navigable notwithstanding that in reality there may not be river nor city nor village at all we have ﬂaming examples of this in our government maps of persia i myself have had an amusing controversy in some of the london leading papers with less person than the secretary of prominent geographical society who assured the public that certain peaks did not exist because he could not ﬁnd

frauds are treated lightly the harm they to those who take them seriously and to the public at large who are always ready blindly to follow anybody with sufﬁcient bounce is enormous without going into minor details let us take the burning question of the russian inﬂuence in the south of persia we are assured that russia wishes an outlet in the persian gulf and suspicions are strong that her eye is set on bandar abbas on the map it certa inly appears most heavenly spot harbour and we hear from scribblers that it can be made into strong naval base and turned into formidable position the trade from meshed and khorassan and teheran isfahan yezd and kerman is with equal theoretical facility switched on to this place even allowing that russia should obtain concession of this most unlikely thing to be asked or conceded while persia remains an independent would not be simple russia the man in the street takes them to be it would ﬁrst of all be necessary to construct railway connecting the line with bandar abbas matter of enormous expense and difﬁculty and likely enough never to be proﬁtable ﬁnancial enterprise the political importance is dubious long railw ay line unguarded in foreign country could but be of little practical value it must be remembered that persia is very thinly populated country with vast tracts of land such the salt desert almost absolutely uninhabited and where the construction of such railway would involve serious difﬁculties owing to the lack of water several months of the year intense heat shifting sands and in some parts sudden inundations during the short rainy season moreover bandar abbas itself although ideally situated on the maps is far from being an ideal harbour the water is shallow and there is safe shelter the heat unbearable and unhealthy at enormous expense of course this spot like almost any other spot on any coast could be turned into fair artiﬁcial harbour the native town it can be honoured with such of few miserable mud houses with streets in which one sinks in ﬁlth and mud the inhabitants are the most miserable and worst rufﬁans in persia together with some hindoos there is european community of less than souls the british india and other coasting steamers touch here and therefore this has been made the caravans to kerman and yezd and sistan via bam but isfahan and teheran the more direct and shorter route via bushire is selected the caravan road from bandar abbas to kerman and yezd is extremely bad and unsafe several times of late the track has been blocked and caravans robbed during 1900 and since that date the risk of travelling on the road seems to have increased and it is useless persians to try and obtain protection or compensation from their own government the trafﬁc not only has been diverted when possible to other routes principally bushire but the rates transport of goods inland had at one time become almo st prohibitive in the summer of 1900 it cost 18 tomans abou t 9s to convey 900 lbs weight far yezd but in the autumn the charges rose to 56 tomans about 13s or more than three times much the same weight of goods eventually the rates were brought down to 22 tomans but only short time after which they ﬂuctuated again up to 28 tomans it was with the greatest difﬁculty that loading camels could be obtained at all owing to the deﬁciency of exports and this partly accounted the extortionate prices demanded an english gentleman whom i met in kerman told that it was only at great expense and trouble that he was able to procure camels to proceed from bandar abbas to kerman and even then he had to leave all his luggage behind to follow when other animals could be obtained according to statistics furnished by the british the exports of 1900 were half those of 1899 the exact ﬁgures being 1899 opium which had had the lead by far in previous years fell from to raw cotton however not only held its own but rose to value of from the previous year in the years 1888 1889 1890 and 1891 the exports of raw cotton were abnormal and rose to about in 1890 the highest record during the decade from 1888 to large quantities of henna and opium are also exported from this spot it is the principal outlet of the kerman and yezd districts but the trade may be said to be almost entirely in british hands at present and russian inﬂuence so far is inﬁnitesimal we ﬁnd that next to opium fruit and vegetables especially dates constitute large part of the export then wool drugs and spices salt carpets and woollen fabrics piece goods silk woven seeds skins and tanned leather wheat and cereals and cotton raw and manufactured largely exported from 1891 to the exportation of tobacco seems to decrease although it is now beginning to look up again little dyes and colouring substances are also exported the value of imports is very nearly double that of the exports cotton goods have the lead by long way then come tea and piece goods powdered sugar indigo metals wheat and cereals spices drugs wool and woollen fabrics jute fabrics cheap cutlery coffee tobacco mules horses donkeys in the succession the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https is pleasant to ﬁnd that the shipping increases yearly at bandar abbas and that second only to persian vessels the number of british sailing vessels entering bandar abbas in 1900 was nearly double 48 of the previous year 28 steamers were in the proportion of 101 to although in number of sailing vessels the persians have the priority because of the great number of small crafts the total tonnage of the persian vessels was tons against tons in 1899 and tons in 1900 british turkish steamers occasionally ply to bandar abbas and muscat and also arab small sailing crafts it is rather curious to note that in 1899 the imports into bandar abbas came entirely from india great britain and france and in small measure from muscat zanzibar the arab coast bahrain and persian ports whereas the following year 1900 the imports from india fell to less than half their previous value from to and from the united kingdom there was diminution from to whereas france doubled hers in 1900 and other countries entered into competition the chinese empire curiously enough was the strongest to the value of presumably with teas and germany and turkey imported to the value of some and respectively belgium java mauritius muscat the canaries america and arabia japan contributed to the amount of sweden italy and switzerland the modest sum of most signiﬁcant point is that russia with all her alleged aims and designs only contributed to the small amount of nothing was exported from bandar abbas to russia it would appear from this that at least commercially russia position at bandar abbas was not much to be feared late since then russian line of steamers has been established from the black sea to the persian gulf ports but i have accurate statistics at hand it is said not to be ﬁnancial success the establishment of customs under belgian ofﬁcials in 1900 caused some trouble at ﬁrst and may have been responsible portion of the f in trade but it is now agreed by everybody that the system is carried on in fair and honest manner preferable to the extortionate fashion employed by the former speculators who farmed out the customs i rather doubt whether russia aim is even directed towards lingah to the of bandar abbas has been supposed by others although this port would afford deeper and better anchorage and breakwater it has the same difﬁculties of approach by land from russia bandar fact greater ones being further south lingah is more prosperous port than bandar abbas its exports being roughly larger than those of bandar abbas and its imports in excess in value the export and import of pearls form the chief item next come wheat and cotton very little tea is disembarked at lingah but dates and ﬁrearms were landed in considerable quantities especially in coffee and tobacco were more in demand here than at bandar abbas and metals were largely imported white found their way in huge quantities to beluchistan where the women use them decorating their persons bangles and necklaces are made with them and the camels horses and mules well ornamentations on the saddle bags with these two exceptions the imports and exports of lingah are made up of larger quantities of articles similar to those brought to and from bandar abbas chapter xxxiv russia aims are of the navigation of the karun on the the government and down river disadvantages of policy of enterprise so much bandar abbas and lingah i will not touch on bushire too well known to english people but mahommerah may have special interest to us and also to russia it is rather curious to note that it has never struck the british politician nor the newspaper writer that russia aims based usually on sound and practical knowledge might be focussed on this port which occupies the most favourable position in the persian gulf russia purposes even strategically it is certainly good bandar abbas while commercially its advantages over the latter port are thousandfold greater these advantages are navigable river through fertile country instead of an almost impassable waterless desert and distance the crow ﬂies from russian territory to mahommerah shorter than from bandar abbas railway through the most populated and richest part of persia could easily be constructed to ahwaz the climate is healthy though warm another most curious fact which seems almost incredible is that the british government through ignorance or otherwise by policy of drift may probably be the cause of helpin g russia to reap the beneﬁt of british enterprise on the karun river in the development of which considerable amount of british capital has already been sunk the importance political and commerc ial of continuing the navigation of the karun river until it does become ﬁnancial it is bound to be soon the country all round it is fully too obvious to write at length upon it but it can not be expected that private company should bear the burden and loss entirely the good of the mother country without any assistance from the home government the british ﬁrm who run the steamers with much insight and praiseworthy enterprise improved the existing caravan track from isfahan to ahwaz on the karun river the point up to which the river is navigable by steamers not drawing more than four feet they built two ﬁne suspension bridges one over the karun at godar and the other the or constructed on the side of an ancient masonry bridge the track has thus been rendered very easy and every assistance was offered to caravans while regular service of river steamers plied from mahommerah to ahwaz to relieve the trafﬁc by water the blosse lynch 250 tons was sent up at ﬁrst but was too lar ge so the malamir 120 tons was specially built the karun the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https were very prosperous at ﬁrst until many obstacles came in the way the road has been open to trafﬁc some three years the ﬁrst year trafﬁc was healthy and strong but the second year owing to famine in arabistan the trafﬁc suddenly dropped and nothing would induce muleteers to travel by that route although they were offered much 100 to 110 krans 4s per load from isfahan to ahwaz distance of 17 preferred to take 70 krans 9s 2d to bushire journey of about 30 stages over distance of 510 miles the caravan men in persia are curious people to deal with and it takes very long time to imbue their minds with new ideas in the case of the ahwaz road it was partly conservatism and fear instigated by the mullahs that prevented their taking loads to the steamers it was fully expected that the route could not pay its way at least ﬁve years from its inauguration and the british at that time seemed to understand the value of the undertaking to give in equal shares with the government of india collective guarantee against losses up to the ﬁrst two years then of ﬁve years some unaccountable reason the government of india which the scheme mostly concerned dropped out and the guarantee was further reduced to payable by the home government only result of this the steamers have been run since at considerable loss and had it not been the patriotism of lynch brothers and the prospects to which they still cling of successful issue the navigation of the karun would have already come to an untimely end the principal article of export of any importance was wheat grown in enormous quantities in the fertile plains of arabistan and were its export legal the export of grain would be inﬁnitely greater than the whole of the present imports but the persian government unfortunately prohibited the export of grain from persia nominally to allay and prevent famine in the country in fact to enrich local governors by permitting illicit export consequently the peasants could not sell their produce in the open market and had to sell it accepting what they could get from speculators at about half the actual value this led to the disconti nuance of the cultivation of wheat when three years the exportation of grain was permitted the acreage under cultivation was enormous and yielded very large returns but soon the prohibit ion was set in force it dwindled year by year until it became approximately the ﬁfth part of what it originally was on the top of all this severe drought occurred and famine resulted it seems very likely that the british government may now fall out also and stop the meagre guarantee of this may have disastrous results it can not be expected that private ﬁrm will continue the navigation of the karun at great loss this is in few words what it may lead to should the british abandon the work already done russia will step has had her eye upon the karun more than upon any other spot in reap the beneﬁt of the money and labour that has been spent by us in the plain of arabistan russian inﬂuence is not yet very far advanced but among the backhtiaris it is spreading fast intrigue is rampant the russian agents endeavour to get the tribesmen into disgrace with the government and they succeed to great extent in their aim isphandiar khan who has the title of sirdar assad is the head chief of the backhtiaris and with his cousin sephadar keeps going the variou s branches of the family but serious family squabbles are very frequent and may eventually cause division the two above named men manage to keep all together except kuli khan who is an opposing factor he is an uncle of isphandiar khan and his rancour arises from having been ousted from the chieftainship he is said to have fallen very badly under russian inﬂuence and instigated his followers to rebellion the cause being however put down not to family squabbles and true to disappr oval of the new road and the inﬂuence exercised by it upon the backhtiari country only about of foreign imports into mahommerah ﬁnd their way up the karun river it is certainly to be regretted that articles direct from the united kingdom are forced up the river the trade with india in 1900 only amounted to some against the previous year france turkey and egypt being the only other importers the total imports into mahommerah transhipment to karun ports amounted to in 1900 and showed considerable increase on piece goods ﬁnd their way up the river in considerable quantities then and soft sugar are the principal articles of import dates iron and treacle come next while various metals tea and matches come last in regard to local commerce the river trade 1900 was showing an increase of upon the trade of this ought to be regarded satisfactory considering the slowness of oriental races in moving from their old grooves the down river trade falls very short of the up river commerce and consists mostly of wheat oil seeds opium wool gum ﬂour beans cotton rice tobacco piece goods glue in 1900 the decrease in the carriage of wheat was enormous and also the trade in oil seeds although gum was carried down stream in much larger quantities owing to the yield being unusually abundant the price obtained was very poor owing to the falling london market gum tragacanth was conveyed principally by the route notwithstanding all this there was an increase of in 1900 over the trade of 1899 which shows that the route is nevertheless progressing and is worth cultivating cotton goods which are reimported from india mostly by parsee and jewish ﬁrms originally come from manchester and are in great demand they consist of grey shirtings prints soft ﬁnish lappets imitation turkey red tanjibs and jacone ts marseilles beetroot sugar is holding its own against other cheaper sugars imported lately and ﬁnds its way to isfahan by the ahwaz road caravans usually employ twenty days on the journey but the distance can easily be covered in ﬁfteen days and even less fortnightly steamer is run by the euphra tis and tigris steam navigation company to ahwaz mahommerah exports chieﬂy to india then to turkey the united kingdom hong kong the persian gulf ports egypt and france in 1900 the exports were to the value of the imports were similar to those of bandar abbas viz goods sugar coffee silk iron tea manufactured metal thread spices etc they amou nted to an aggregate sum of in 1900 against in 1899 4 the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https i have gone into details it is to show the mistake made by the british government in letting such valuable position of absolute vital importance to our interest drift slowly but surely into russian hands russia aims in the gulf are at present concentrated on the karun river our movements are closely watched and nothing could be more probable than that if we abandon the karun russia will at once ﬁll our place and turn the whole business into formidable success the russian government have now granted subsidy of per round voyage to the russian steam navigation to run three steamers year from odessa to bussorah touching at all the principal ports of the persian gulf the kornilof made two voyages in 1901 arriving in bussorah in april and november on her ﬁrst voyage she landed most of her cargo in bushire and only conveyed cases of petroleum and quantity of wood date boxes but on her second journey cases of petroleum were landed at bussorah and further supply of wood besides great number of samples of russian products such ﬂour sugar and matches on the second return journey the kornilof took back to odessa freight two thousand pounds from bussorah principally dates cargo which had been previously carrie d by british steamers to port said and then transhipped the black sea the appearance of the russian boats excited considerable interest among the natives and merchants both british and indigenous comments are superﬂuous on the grant given by the russian government to further russian trade and the wavering attitude of the british government in safeguarding interests already acquired footnotes 4 see diplomatic and consular reports trade of

which time i was the guest of preece the british preece hospitality and popularity are proverbial among europeans and natives all over persia step in the right direction was taken by the british government in making in isfahan and another good step was that of furnishing the consulate with guard of mounted indian soldiers prestige and outward show go much together in persia and matter to what extent one private feelings may rebel at the idea we must make display i suppose we have in preece very able and intellectual ofﬁcer man who understands the persians thoroughly and gentleman of uncommon tact and kindliness his artistic taste has served him well so that the consulate and grounds have been rendered most comfortable and delightful and the collections of carpets and silver which he has made during his many years residence in persia are very interesting it is true that russian inﬂuence is sprea ding fast towards the south and that the establishment of russian consulate in isfahan with its guard of cossacks has made considerable impression on the population but doubt preece will be able to maintain british prestige high if the government at home show grit and enable him to so it is most important i think to come to some sound conclusion on the policy to be followed towards russia in persia either to check her advance immediately and ﬁrmly or to come to some satisfactory agreement with her so that her interests and ours may not altogether clash but it can not be impressed too often upon our minds that our present policy of drift and wavering is most disastrous to our interests we have lost northern persia southern persia will soon slip from our grip unless we pull up soon and open our eyes wide to what is happening we place too much reliance on the fact that the shah brother and now governor of isfahan was once extremely we have way of getting ideas into our heads and nothing will drive them out again but we forget that things and people change in persia everywhere else and what was accurate ﬁfteen years ago may not be so now also it must be remembered that sultan although in high power does not occupy the same high position politically before the late shah death he and his family are kept under strict control of the shah and any ideas which they may still have are discouraged if not promptly eradicated his highness sons have been forbidden to be educated in europe or to travel abroad although visit to russia only might be allowed beyond the secondary power of high governor has other inﬂuence and has to conform to

had never been out of i was much impressed by the kindliness of the towards his children and in return by the intense respect almost fear of these towards their father after pleasant visit and the usual compliments and refreshments coffee was brought the polite signal that the audience should come to close the prince accompanied the consul and myself to the door of the most unusual compliment there were many soldiers and servants and attendants with silver maces who escorted us out of the grounds where we found the consular guard again and returned to the consulate two days later i departed yezd there is high road between the two cities only mere track postal service and relays of horses are stationed on the track but by givin g notice some days previous to one departure horses can be sent out ahead from isfahan to various stages of the journey until the ezd road is met on which post horses can again be obtained at the chappar khanas this however involved so much uncertainty and exorbitant expense that i preferred to make up my own caravan of mules the ﬁrst part of the journey being rather hilly on leaving isfahan there are mountains to the south the urchin range and also to the east very rugged and with sharply deﬁned edges to the stand distant elevation s but nothing can be seen due north we go through great many ruins on leaving the city and here too in other cities of persia one is once more struck by the unimportant appearance of the city from little distance off the green dome of the mosque and four minarets are seen rising on the ﬁve more slender minarets like factory extremely everything else the colour of mud the trafﬁc near the city is great hundreds of donkeys and mules toddle along both towards and away from the city gate the dust is appalling there is nothing more tantalizing than the long stretches of uninteresting country to be traversed in persia where much one tries there is nothing to rest one eye upon so it is with great we come now to something new in the scenery in the shape of great number of most peculiar towers agricul ture and p igeon t owers near i sfahan these are the pigeon great institution in central persia they are cylindrical in shape with castellated top and are solidly built with massive walls they stand less than thirty to forty feet in height and possess central well in which the guano is object which the towers are erected quadrangular house on the top and innumerable small cells where pigeons lay their eggs and breed their young are constructed all round the tower these towers are quite formidable looking structures and are so numerous particularly in the neighbourhood of isfahan to give the country quite strongly fortiﬁed appearance the guano is removed once year after passing khorasgun at small could count many of these pigeon houses some amusement could be got from the way the persian telegraph line had been laid between isfahan and yezd via nain there were two poles of the same

farsakhs from isfahan we went through passage where the hills nearly meet after which we entered ﬂat plain barren and ugly in the distance to the lay line of blackish trees and another in front of us in the direction we were travelling due east then we saw another bunch of pigeon towers leaving behind the hills nearer to us to the west and and the more distant and most fantastically shaped range to the south my mules gradually descend into the plain an angle of from east to hills are visible to the naked eye but there is long range of comparatively low hills encircling us from to and of the observer the highest points being at almost to the north we have long line of kanats following the drunken row of telegrap h poles we arrive at gullahbad gulnabad village in ruins from this point some distance the soil is covered with deposit of salt giving the appearance of landscape in sharp contrast with the terriﬁc heat prevailing at the time this road is impassable during the rainy weather one

caravanserai with two rooms up stairs and ten down below around the courtyard the difference in the behavi our of the natives upon roads on which europeans not frequently travel could be detected at once here one met with the greatest civility and simplicity of manner and above all honesty which one seldom ﬁnds where european visitors are more common there are few countries where the facial types vary more than in persia the individuals of nearly each town each village have peculiar characteristics of their own at saigsi instance only 32 miles from isfahan we ﬁnd an absolutely different type of head with abnormally large mouth and nostrils the eyes wide apart and the brow overhanging the latter may be caused by the constant brilliant refraction of the white soil in the glare of the sun altitude of saigsi feet about four miles east of saigsi and north of the track we come across ﬁve curious parallel lines of or dunes stretching from north to south each of these heaps is precisely where there is gap in the mountain range to the north of it and each has the appearance of having been gradually deposited there by current passing through these gaps when the whole of this plain was

beautiful lake in the depression of the complete an optical deception it is possible to conceive in reality there is lake at all water is not at all plentiful here one ﬁnds reservoir made caravans along this track it is tank 25 feet by 10 feet sunk deep into the ground and roofed over with vault the water is sent to it by means of channel from the small village of vartan north of it we gradually rise to feet and again we have before us another beautiful effect of mirage in the shape of magniﬁcent lake with village and cluster of trees apparently suspended in the air my caravan man assures that the village which appears quite close by is many miles of long rows of kanats ancient and modern to the warn us of the approach of small town and on the road plenty of skeletons of camels donkeys and mules may be seen fodder is very scarce upon this track and many animals have to die of starvation also animals caught here during the rains can not proceed in the sinking soft ground and eventually die chapter xxxvi fishark and sara dangers of telegraph of sand and persian eaving type of earl y in the afternoon khupah altitude feet was reached with its very large and dirty caravanserai to the west just outside the town wall from the only clean part of the obtains good panoramic view of the town it is built in most irregular shape and is encircled by castellated mud wall with round turrets there is humble dome of mosque rising somewhat higher than all the other little domes above each dwelling feeble attempts at raising bazaar have been made on different sites in the town where bits of arcades have been erected but there are signs about the place of ﬂourishing industry or trade the majority of houses especially in the northern part of the city are in ruins the principal thoroughfare is picturesque enough and on the occasion of my visit looked particularly attractive to with its huge trays of delicious grapes they were most refreshing to eat in the terriﬁc heat of the day one peculiarity of the place is that most doorways of houses are from one to three the level of the street between the caravanserai and the city is sunken well with ﬂat roof and four ventilating shafts to keep the water cool further away are seven more garden the little range north of the city is quite low and has in front of it pyrami dal similar deposit to those we have already noticed to the in the morning on our march to this place but much higher the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https of the town many trees and verdant gardens are visible and to the west the immense stretch of sixty miles of it that we had travelled over from isfahan want of better amusement i sat on the roof to watch the sunset while sadek cooked my dinner the nearer hills of bright cobalt blue faded into light grey in the distance the sky shone in warm cadmium yellow and beneath stretched the plain of bluish colour uninterrupted miles and miles were it not one or two huts in the immed iate foreground and long track winding its way across the expanse until it lost itself in the dim distance directly below in the courtyard of the caravanserai four camels squatted round cloth on which was served straw mixed with cotton seeds that gave ﬂavour to their meal the camels slowly ground their food moving their lower jaws sideways from right to left instead of up and down is usual in most other animals and some of the caravan men placidly smoked their kalians while others packed up their bundles to make ready their departure soon the moon should rise in another corner of the courtyard my own caravan man groomed the mules and around big ﬂame little further off crowd of admiring natives gazed at sadek boiling chicken and vegetables my special beneﬁt we were to make night march the heat of the day was too great to trave l in at three in the morning yawning and stretching our limbs when we were roused by the charvadar 5 we got on the mules and made our departure the cold was intense and the wind blowing with all its might from the west six miles off we passed kamalbek then six miles further the large village of moshkianuh in ruins with few green trees near it the plain on which we are travelling rises gently up to the village of kudeshk at the foot of the mountain altitude feet we ascend gradually between hills to the north and south and ﬁnd ourselves in another ﬂat valley about three quarters of mile broad and one mile and half long altitude feet we are surrounded by hills and ﬁnd two villages one to the east the other to the west of the valley the latter possesses buildings with masonry walls instead of the usual mud ones and also masonry enclosures round and groves we continue to rise until the highest point of the plain is reached feet two or three smaller hamlets are found in the centre of the plain second basin is found on proceeding east with here and there miserable clusters of trees otherwise everything is barren barren could be on the reddish hills the rocky portion shows through at the summit only whereas the bases are enveloped in covering of sand and salt to the north the fishark and sara mountain range extends in general direction of to and its formation is quite interesting due north of us the eye is attracted by peculiar hill double cone two pointed and much redder in colour than the hills near it on nearing the mountains many small villages appear yazih village has solid stone wall round it wheat is cultivated by the natives good water being obtainable here in small but limpid streams then we have the old village of lhas now rejoicing in the new name of mazemullahmat and near it fezahbad where i halted i strolled in the afternoon mile from the latter village to the pass feet above sea level directly in front of the pass at bearings magnetic stands high peak and beyond it to the right of the observer at another and higher summit we leave behind to the the high sara mountain range peaks of which i estimated rose above feet at is most curious conical hill standing isolated and very high above the plain among the most common sights of these parts are the tourbillons revolving with terriﬁc rapidity round its own axis and raising to the sky cylindrical column of dust they further move along the country in spasmodic manner but never so fast that they can not be avoided the diameter of the wind columns i observed by the dust carried with it varied from 3 feet to 20 feet the mountains we are travelling on are said to be somewhat unsafe the villagers being given to attacking caravans and robber bands coming here shelter when it becomes unsafe them to be on the ezd high road in fact while resting in the house of ahmed at fezahbad curious lot of men appeared who notwithstanding the remonstrances of sadek and haji broke into the house in most boisterous manner demanding food of the landlord they were armed with revolvers and old martini riﬂes and had plenty of cartridges about their persons they seemed quite taken aback to ﬁnd european inside the room they changed their attitude at once and became quite polite i entertained them to tea of which they drank gallons i can not say that i was particularly charmed with their faces but their manner was certainly most courteous they show ed their english martinis with additional gold ornamentations of lion and sun such one sees in thousands all over persia i asked them where they got them from they said they came from the persian gulf haji mulla ahmed the founder of the village was ﬁne old fellow with kindly face eyes shining like beads under an overhanging brow and crimson beard dyed with henna he appeared rather sulky at this unwonted visit and more sulky still later when the visitors left and he had to provide food them he said that the robbers frequently called upon him and were great drain on his supplies when we left at to go across the pass he advised sadek and myself to load our riﬂes and keep sharp i had already measured the altitude of the pass in the afternoon i had particular object in keeping awake so i slung the riﬂe to my saddle and dozed off on my mule we were slowly winding our way up to the summit the long night marches were so dreary and the sound of the mules bells so monotonous that it was most difﬁcult to keep awake one gradually learns to balance one self quite well on the saddle while asleep and it does shorten the long hours of the night very considerably occasionally one wakes up abruptly with jolt and one fancies that one is just about to tumble over but although i suppose i must have ridden in my life hundreds of miles while asleep on the saddle i have never once had fall in the natural course of affairs the animals too are generally so intelligent that they one the balancing required and manage to keep under the rider the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https that particular night i was extremely sleepy i opened my eyes second when we reached the pass and began to descend on the other side but sleepiness overcame again i was riding the ﬁrst mule in the caravan unexpectedly i received fearful blow in the face and i was very nearly torn off the saddle there was curious metallic buzzing resounding in the air and before i had time to warn those that came after sadek who came next was knocked down and the mules frightened at this unusual occurrence stampeded down the steep incline it was the telegraph wire hanging loose right across the road that had caused the accident the road was in and was crossed several times by the wire which was laid more or less in straight line but this of course i did not know so few minutes later before we had time to bring the runaway mules to stop the wire unseen was again met with foot or so above the ground it caught the mules on the legs and they were tied to one another and were carried on by the impetus of the pace at which we were going all the animals tumbled down one on the top of the other in heap the packs got mercilessly undone and it took us the best part of an hour to disentangle all and get things straight again the cold was bitter some two miles east of the pass there were two roads one leading to nain the other to nao gombes we took the latter and shorter route and with some sense of relief now we left the telegraph line which proceeds to nain on the plateau east of the pass we found six small villages the most ishratabad the largest altitude when the sun was about to rise we more clearly distinguished grey sombre mountainous mass to the east sharply indented at its summit like the teeth of gigantic saw and ending abruptly on the northern terminus we had come between mountains and some twelve miles from fezahbad we reached kudarz altitude village situated at the foot of the range we had crossed the sun peeped above the mountains close by to the east large plain disclosed itself before the observer long mountain range bluish and indistinct could just be perceived in the distance bounding the plain to the north some low and few conical hills and also somewhat higher and rugged rocky elevation were found on entering the plain from the west oskholun village lies in the plain 16 miles from fezahbad at the foot of the mountains on one right one notices curious deposit of sand and gravel cushion shaped rising in gentle incline up the mountain side to height of 150 feet it would be interesting to ﬁnd out exactly how these accumulations have formed and whether the wind or water or both are responsible them on arriving at bambis altitude sadek was in great state of mind to ﬁnd suitable house where we could put up there were caravanserais several of the principal people in the town offered their own houses and eventually after careful inspection i accepted the cleanest of course in small villages great luxury could be expected even in dwellings of people but after entering by miserable door and going through ﬁlthy passage one came to nice little court with an ornamental tank of somewhat fetid water swarms of mosquitoes rose from the ﬂoating leaves of the water plants soon we appeared and gave us very warm reception in few seconds we were stung all over the women folks were made to stampede to the upper storey on our arrival where they remained concealed while we stayed in the house and the younger male members of the family hastily removed all the bedding and personal belongings from the principal room which i was to occupy clouds of dust were raised when an attempt was made to sweep the dried mud ﬂoor out of the windows of the upper storey the women ﬂung handsome carpets which sadek duly spread upon the ﬂoor the room was very nice one plastered all over and painted white enriched with adhering dried leaves of red roses forming design upon the ceiling there were nine receptacles in the walls and four more in the sides of the chimney piece next to this room was another similar one and opposite in the courtyard kind of alcove was used kitchen it had raised part of mud bricks some three feet high and about broad on which was ﬁxed the weaving loom that stretc hed right across the court when in use hole was made in the raised portion in which the weaver sat when at work so to keep the legs under the loom persian s pinning w heels and w eaving l ooms the loom is simple enough the two sets of long horizontal threads being kept at high tension by an iron bar ﬁxed into the cylindrical wooden rollers round which the threads are rolled there is then vertical arrangement moving the long horizontal sets of threads alternately up and down by means of pedals cross thread being passed between them with spool and beaten home each time with the large comb suspended in vertical position the threads are kept in position by two additional combs which represent the width of the cloth and in which each horizontal thread is kept ﬁrm in its central position by clever device of inverted loops between which it is passed and clenched tight the cloth is rolled round wooden cylinder it is extremely strong and durable almost each house has weaving loom on one side of the court was recess in the wall valuables the padlock was closed by means of screw by the side of the kitchen one found the lumber and refuse room and there were corresponding arrangements on the ﬂoor above unlike other persian houses this was lighted by windows with neat woodwork instead of by the usual skylight hole in the dome of the the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https natives at this village were very handsome there was touch of the afgh an type in the men and the women had ﬁne faces with magniﬁcent eyes one found ﬁrm mouths with and properly developed lips in contrast to the weak drooping mouths of the people one had met in the western cities and the noses were ﬁnely chiselled with nostrils there was unsteadiness in the eyes so common to the persians of the and these fellows consequently presented quite an honest appearance while the overhanging brow added look of pensiveness the skull was peculiarly formed slanting upwards considerably from the forehead to an abnormal height and giving the cranium an elongated shape the ears too generally malformed or under in most persians were better shaped in these people although by means perfect they nevertheless showed certain reﬁnement of blood and race in the matter of men clothing it was gratifying to ﬁnd the ugly pleated frockcoats rather never long picturesque shirts and ample trousers worn instead held together by kamarband over all was thrown brown burnous not unlike that of the bedouins and the head was wound in an ample turban of the hindoo pattern children wore short coats ornamented with embroidery and shells at the back and pretty silver buttons in front their little caps too were embellished with shells beads or gold braiding nearly all male natives old and young suffered from complaints of the eyes but not so the women because they spent most of the time in the house and did not expose themselves to the glare of the sun and salty dust which seemed to be the principal cause of severe inﬂammation of the eyes bambis village was greatly dependent upon isfahan its provisions and therefore everything was very dear excellent vegetables shalga sardek churconda and pomegranates were nevertheless grown by means of most elaborate and ingenious way of irrigation but the water was very brackish and dirty felt ﬁlters were occasionally used by the natives purifying the drinking water there were number of sayids living at bambis who looked picturesque in their handsome green turbans they were men of splendid physique very virile simple in manner serious and digniﬁed and were held in much respect by their fellow villagers footnotes 5 man chapter xxxvii ezd high kevir sand isolated long sand forsaken caravanserai at

which we struck at nao gombes here there were chappar khana and an ancient latter said to be of the time of shah we did not stop and continued our journey along broad immense stretch of ﬂat country consisting of sand and gravel my men were fast asleep on their mules but the animals seemed to know their way well they had been on this road many times before the night was extremely cold we were now at an altitude of feet in what is called the kevir small salt desert plain enclosed to the of the track by the continuation of the sara and keble range to the by the mehradji turkemani and duldul mountains and to the north by the aparek and abiane mountains during the rainy weather the drainage of the latter two ranges is carried in large volumes into the plain between them and eventually into

the mehradji mountains and copper lead in several localities nickel and antimony in the anarek region silver is said to have been found in the andjile to the almost in the middle of the kevir stands the isolated high mountain of siakuh miles from bambis we reached chanoh most desolate place with in ruins and couple of wells we arrived here at eight in the morning after having travelled since ten the previous evening but we only allowed ourselves and our mules four hours rest breakfast and we were again in the saddle at noon there is nothing to interest the traveller on this part of the road except an occasional passing caravan and the scenery is dreary beyond words long long stretches of ﬂat uninteresting sand and gravel or sand alone in places on nearing the spot where the track passes between the andjile and ardakan mountains we ﬁnd sand deposits stretching out nearly two miles from the mountain ranges to the and south shehrawat shehrabad village differs from most we have seen in the shape of its few roofs which are like vault and not mud tower rises above them and there are few ﬁelds and some near the habitations about mile further more sand dunes are to be found and long row of kanats carrying water to the village of nasirabad half mile east of the track further on we come upon an open canal and we can perceive village about two miles distant also to the east of the the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https before arriving at agdah the earth has positively been disembowelled in search of water so numerous are the kanats of all sizes and depths among which we wind our way the large village of agdah itself stands on prominence against background of mountains and is embellished with great many orchards tidily walled round it is famous place pomegranates which are really delicious usual number of ruined houses surround those still standing and we skirt the village wall over 30 feet high we observe some picturesque high round towers the telegraph wire which we had met again at nao gombes was here quite an amusing sight in the neighbourhood of the village it was highly decorated with rags of all colours and with stones tied to long strings which when thrown up wind themselves round and remain entangled in the wire there were some 300 habitations in agdah the principal one with large quadrangular tower being that of the governor but both the chappar khana and the caravanserai were the ﬁlthiest we had so far encountered number of sayids lived here we halted at four in the afternoon on monday october 19th the mules were so tired that i decided to give them twelve hours rest it may be noticed that we had travelled from ten the previous evening until four in the hteen only four hours rest good going caravan marching the mules were excellent at 4 on the tuesday we rode out of the caravanserai and still travelled on ﬂat gravel plain with the high ardakan mountains to the east fourteen miles or so from agdah the country became undulating with large pebble stones washed down from the cairns of stone had been erected on the ﬁrst hillock we came to near the road we passed two villages one on the track the other about mile north of it and near this latter two or three smaller hamlets were situated sixteen miles from agdah we halted an hour or so at the village of kiafteh chaftah its round tower and the mosque of semur one mile north of it here there was chappar khana the labourers wore short blue shirt and ample trousers with white turban and white shoes having partaken of hearty breakfast we were off again on the road in the broiling sun at beautiful effects of mirage were before us like splendid lakes with the mountains reﬂected into them and little islands we go through the gap in the mountains that are now to the and of us the plain narrows to width of some four miles and the direction of the track is to the the hillocks of low range stretch far the mountains on the and several parallel ranges lie on the south very far of f is the high shirkuh mountain eight miles from kiafteh we cross over the low hill range by pass about 100 feet above the plain there is mournful look about the soil of black sand and also about the gloomy shingle hill range extending from the to the the black underlying rock where exposed to the air shows numberless holes corroded in it by the action of moving salt water an inexplicable isolated hill stand s in the centre of the valley which here is not perfectly ﬂat but in gentle incline higher at its extremity than at its edge formation of mud dunes similar to those we had encountered near saigsi is here to be noticed this time however not directly in front of each gap in the mountain range but opposite them near the range in front that forms kind of bay these dunes were probably caused by the deposit of sand and gravel left by current that met the barrier of mountains on the opposite side of the bay on crossing the hill range some eighteen miles from kiafteh we come across which stretches in half way across the valley where it then suddenly turns it is about 80 feet high to all appearance the sand deposited upon this bar seems to have travelled in direction from north to south mile further it meets another sand dune stretching in general direction of to where the higher dune comes to an end across the valley we ﬁnd village having the usual quadrangular mud enclosure with towers an abandoned caravanserai fast tumbling down and few domed mud hovels the larger and better preserved village of bafru one mile to the east of the track is well surrounded by long expanse of verdant trees south of it is the other ﬂourishing settlement of deawat deabad the abandoned village of assiabo gordoneh now in ruins tells us sad story the village at one time evidently ran short of water hundreds of borings can be seen all round it in all directions but they must have been of avail the place had to be forsaken the sand dune is here 80 feet high the space between these two sand nicely cultivated in patches where some water has been found we arrived in the evening at biddeh very large and most weird place with habitations partly cut into the high mud banks the houses were several storeys high the greater number of buildings now in ruins show evidence of the former importance of this place and the wonderful ancient aqueducts with the water carried over high bridge from one side of ravin to the other are of great interest this must have been prosperous place at one time the whitis h clay soil has been quaintly corroded by the action of water and one ﬁnds curious grottoes and deep contorted natural channels mosque and several impressive adjective only applies when you not get too near high up against the clif f side the whole place is quite picturesque the mules go along narrow lane betwe en walled ﬁelds and then by steepish ascent among ruined houses and patches of cultivation we reach the summit of the clay dune on which the newer village of meiboh maibut situated there is most beautiful persia caravanserai here with delightful domed tank of clear spring water in which i then and there took delicious bath much to the horror of the caravanserai proprietor who assured it was too the tank was hammam or bath but was water drinking purposes his horror turned into white rage when moreover he declared that my soap which i had used freely would kill all the ﬁsh which he had carefully nursed years in the tank we spent most of the evening in watching the state of their health and eventually it was with some relief that we perceived all the soap ﬂoat away and the water again becom clear crystal to the evident discomﬁture of the caravanserai man when we paid the last visit to the tank at 4 just previous to my departure deaths were to be registered in the tank and therefore heavy damages to pay the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https is nothing one misses more than baths while travelling in central and eastern persia there is generally hardly sufﬁcient water to drink at the various stages and it is usually so slimy and bad that although one does not mind drinking it because one has to one really would not dream of bathing or washing in it hence my anxiety not to lose my chance of good plunge at meiboh on leaving meiboh at 4 we passed considerable distance through land under cultivation the crop being principally wheat large was in course of construction at meiboh after that we were again travelling on sandy plain with thousands of borings water on all sides and were advancing mainly to the towards the mountains we continued thus some twelve miles far shamsi another large village with much cultivation around it after that there were sand and stones under our mules hoofs and broiling sun over our heads on both sides the track was screened by mountains and by low hill range to the about eight miles from shamsi we entered region of sand hills the sand least judging by the formation of the the movement of the sand to have been from west to east this fact was rather curious and contrasted with nearly all the other sand accumulations which we found later in eastern persia where the sand moved mostly in direction doubt the direction of the wind was here greatly inﬂuenced and made to deviate by the barriers of mountains so close at hand there were numerous villages large and small on both sides of the track hodjatabad our last halt before reaching yezd only sixteen miles further had handsome caravanserai the porch of which was vaulted over the high road it was comparatively clean and had spacious stabling animals delicious grapes were to be obtained here and much of the country had been cleared of the sand deposit and its fertile soil cultivated fuel was very expensive in persia at the entrance of nearly every caravanserai was displayed large clumsy wooden scale upon which wood was weighed sale to travellers and also of course barley and fodder one animals the weights were generally round stones of various sizes jaffarabad very large and prospero us place stood about one mile to the of the caravanserai and had vegetation and many trees near it this was also the case with the other village of medjamed which had innumerable ﬁelds round it firuzabad came next we proceeded towards yezd and then after progressin g very slowly sank deep in sand several perceived upon rugged hill large round white tower of silence which had been erected there by the guebres or parsees the disposal of their dead we skirted the mud wall of the women dress was in shape not unlike that of turkish women and consisted of ample trousers and short zouave jacket the men resembled afghans i here came across the ﬁrst running camel i had seen in persia and on it was mounted picturesque rider who had slung to his saddle sword gun and two pistols while round his waistband dagger powder bullet pouch cap carrier and various such other warlike implements hung gracefully in the bright light of the sun few yards further we came upon ghastly split camel the poor obstinate beast had refused to cross narrow stream by the bridge and had got instead on the slippery mud near the water edge his long clumsy had slipped with sudden écart that had torn his body ripped open the camel was being killed we passed and its piercing cries and moans were too pitiful words the mountain on which the huge tower of silence has been permission of i was quadrangular with long narrow platform on the summit the best view of it is obtained from the south sadek told in all seriousness from informati on received from the natives that the bodies are placed in these towers in sitting position with stick under the chin to support them erect when crows come in swarms to pick away at the body if the right eye is plucked out ﬁrst by plundering bird it is said to be sure sign that the of the body will go to heaven if the left eye is picked at ﬁrst then warmer climate is in store the soul of the dead after leaving behind the guebre tower we come again upon thousands of borings water and ancient kanats now dry and unused the country grows less sandy about eight miles from yezd and we have now gradually ascended some 320 feet from the village of meiboh maibut to an altitude of feet here we altogether miss the ﬂourishing cultivation which lined the track far the guebre tower and can not detect single blade of grass or natural vegetation of any kind on any side there are high mountains to the and east on the right west side of the track eight miles from yezd is the neat mud wall of nusseratabad with few trees peeping above it but to the left of us all is barren and we toddled along on grey clayish sand between nusseratabad and yezd well is to be found and quarter of mile further the mazereh sadrih village one and farsakhs from yezd the mules sank deep in the ﬁne sand there were good many guebres about mostly employed in carrying manure on donkeys one of them who was just returning from one of these errands addressed much to my surprise in hindustani which he spoke quite ﬂuently he told that he had

and mushir parsee mission medical mission ladies in olerance of race religions yezd is the most central city of persia but from pictorial point of view the least interesting city in the shah empire there are great many is said about none very beautiful the streets are narrow and tortuous with high walls on either side and nothing particularly attractive about them curious narrow arches are frequently to be noticed overhead in the streets and it is supposed that they are to support the side walls against collapse there is not at least i could not ﬁnd single building of note in the city except the principal and very ancient mosque building in the last degree of decay but which must have formerly been adorned with handsome frontage there is very extensive but wn wall around the city and wide moat reminding one of once strongly fortiﬁed place the greater portion of yezd is in ruins the water supply is unfortunately very defective and irregular there are perennial streams of any importance and all the irrigation works are dependent on artiﬁcial subterranean canals and kanats and these in their turn are mostly subject to the rain and snow fall on the hills surrounding yezd unluckily the rains are now neither frequent nor abundant and the land has in consequence been suffering severely from want of water snow falls in winter and to great extent feeds the whole water supply of yezd and its neighbourhood it is not surprising therefore that more than of the province of yezd is barren land cultivation being under the circumstances absolutely out of the question some portions of the province however where water is obtainable are quite fertile towards the west the hills show some signs of vegetation mainly fruit trees but nothing larger than bush grows wild if we except occasional stunted surrounded by mountains yezd is there are two different climates close at hand that of the kohestan or hills temperate in summer but piercing cold in winter and the other much warmer of the land in the eastern lowlands the summer heat is excessive in autumn just bearable and in the spring the climate is quite delightful in all seasons however with few exceptions it is generally dry and always healthy and pure where some moisture is obtainable the soil is very fertile and is cultivated by the natives the chief cultivated products are wheat barley and other cereals cotton opium and tobacco the vine ﬂourishes near yezd and the wines used by the parsees are not unpalatable mulberries are cultivated in large quantities silk is probably the most important product of the yezd district wild game is said to be plentiful on the mountains with the exception of salt the mineral products of the district are insigniﬁcant yezd is great trading centre partly owing to its geographical position partly because its inhabitants are very and enterprising yezd men are great travellers and possess good business heads they go across the salt desert to khoras san and afghanistan and they trade with india principally via kerman bandar abbas and lingah and also to small extent via sistan previously the trade went entirely by shiraz and bushire but now that road is very unsafe owing to robbers yezd traders travel even much further aﬁeld far china india java during my short stay i met quite number of people who had visited bombay calcutta russia bokhara and turkestan the settled population of yezd consists mostly of shia mahommedans the descendants of the ancient persian race with an intermixtu re of foreign blood the parsees or zoroastrians who still retain their purity of race and religious faith and who are principally engaged in agriculture and commerce very small community of european christians including few armenian natives of julfa isfahan then there are about one thousand jews who live mostly in abject poverty the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https mahommedan population of the town may be approximately estimated at sixty thousand here even more noticeably than in any other persian town there is very little outward show in the buildings which are of earth and mud and appear contemptible but the interiors of houses of the rich are pleasant and the miserable look of the town however is greatly redeemed by the beauty of the gardens which surround it it is to be regretted that the roads in and around yezd are in wretched condition being absolutely neglected were there safer and more practicable roads trade would be facilitated and encouraged to mean degree things stand now indigenous trade is increasing slowly but foreign trade is making headway the silk and opium trades which were formerly the most proﬁtable have of late declined cottons and woollens silk the kasb and aluhi of very ﬁnest quality shawls cotton carpets and noted felts equal if not superior to the best of kum are manufactured both home use and export the exports mainly consist of almond s and nuts tobacco

arms cutlery watches earthenware glass and enamel wares iron powdered sugar etc the government of yezd of other cities of persia is purely despotic limite d only by the power and inﬂuence of the mahommedan priests the mullahs and by the dread of private vengeance or an occasional insurrection it is true that the actions of hakims and governors and their deputies are liable to revision from the teheran authorities but this does not prevent exactions and extortions being carried on quite openly and on lar ge scale the present governor glory of the state son of is an intelligent and young man sensibly educated who tries his best to be fair to everybody but it is very difﬁcult him to run alone against the strong tide of corrup tion which swamps everything in persia he is not in good health and spends much of his time hunting wild game at his country place in the hills near yezd his town residence is kind of particularly impressive nor the city wall the was the at the time of my visit he seemed quite an af fable and intelligent man near the palace in the heart of the city are the covered bazaars old and new and well stocked with goods but they are in character so exactly like those of teheran and isfahan already described in previous chapters that repetition is quite unnecessary the streets are irregularly planned and the older ones are very dark and dingy but the newer arcades are lofty and handsome the merchants active and at the beginning of the nineteenth century the population of yezd is said to have been one hundred thousand souls and to have dwindled down to less than thirty thousand in during the terriﬁc famine which took place at that time whether this is correct or not it is difﬁcult to ascertain but the city is on the increase again and the population already stated is certainly not less than sixty thousand there are numerous mahommedan hammams baths 65 or yezd but europeans are not allowed to enter them the yezd people are very forward in educational matters i inspected some of the schools and colleges and was much impressed by the matter sensible way in which some of the more modern institutions were conducted they would indeed put to shame great many of our schools in england and the talent of children compared with english children of the same age one had better say nothing at all with exaggeration children aged six analysed and reasoned out problems placed before them in way that would in this country bafﬂe men of six times that age the quickness of the persian child brain is astounding and their goodness and diligence there is only one word that ﬁts them they are simply angelic their intense reverence the teachers their eagerness really to learn and their quiet attentive behaviour were indeed worthy of admiration but it must be well understood that these angelic traits are conﬁned to the only when they leave school the angelic wears off very soon and the boys unluckily drift into the old and demoralized ways with which persia is reeking there are about dozen public schools in yezd but the one conducted on most modern lines is the new school started by the mushir if i understood aright the mushir provided the buildings and money to work the school period of time after which if successful it will be handed over to be supported by the city or by private enterprise the school was excellent there were hundred pupils from the ages of six to ﬁfteen and they were taught arabic persian english french geography arithmetic there was mudir or head master who spoke french quite ﬂuentl y and separate teachers the other various matters the school was admirably conducted with quite military discipline mingled with extreme kindness and thoughtfulness on the part of the teachers towards the pupils by the sound of bell the boys were collected by the mudir in the round which on two ﬂoors were the schoolroo ms specklessly clean and while i was being entertained to tea sherbet and coffee on high platform i was politely requested to ascertain myself the knowledge of the of whom had only been in the school less than year it was rather interesting to hear little chaps of six or eight rattle off in language foreign to them and without making single mistake all the capitals of the principal countries in the world and the largest rivers the highest mountains the biggest oceans and so on and other little taller than three up and subtracted and divided and multiplied ﬁgures with an assurance quickness and accuracy which i personall y very much envied then they wrote english and french sentences on the slate and persian and arabic and i came out of the school fully convinced that whatever was taught in that school was certainly taught well these were not special pupils but any pupil i chose to pick out from the lot i visited another excellent institution the parsee of several teach ing institutions that have been established in yezd by the bombay society the amelioration of persian zoroastrians most beautiful building internally with large courts and lofty vaulted hall wherein the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https are held the boys from the ages of six to ﬁfteen lined the walls sitting on mats their notebooks inkstands and slate by their side at the time of my visit there were many 230 pupils and they received similar education but not quite so high in the mushir school in the parsee school less time was devoted to foreign languages ustad javan mard most venerable old man was the and ustad baharam his assistant the school seemed most ﬂourishing and the pupils very although the stocks punishing bad children were very prominent under the teacher table the assured that they were seldom required another little but most interesting school is the one in connection with the clerical work done by the rev napier malcolm it is attended principally by the sons of mussulmans and by few parsees who take this excellent opportunity of learning english thoroughly most of the teaching is done by an armenian assistant trained at the of julfa here too i was delightfully surprised to notice how intelligent the boys were and malcolm himself spoke in high terms of the work done by the students they showed great facility learning languages and i was shown boy who in few months had picked up sufﬁcient english to converse quite ﬂuently the boys i was glad to see are taught in very sensible manner and what they are made to learn will be of permanent use to them the church missionary society is to be thanked not only this good educational work which it supplies in yezd to children of all creeds but the hospital men and women large and handsome caravanserai was presented to the medical mission by godarz irani one of the leading parsees of yezd and the building was adapted and converted by the church missionary society into hospital with permanent staff in the men hospital of an english doctor and three armenian assistants there is also smaller women hospital with an english lady doctor who in 1901 was aided by two ladies and by an armenian assistant trained at julfa there are properly disinfected wards in both these hospitals with good beds well appointed dispensary and dissecting room the natives have of late availed themselves considerably of the opportunity to get good medical assistance but few except the very poorest it seems care actually to remain in the hospital wards they prefer to take the medicine and go to their respective houses special dark room has been constructed the operation and cure of cataract which is common complaint in yezd the health of yezd is uncommonly good and were it not that the people ruin their digestive organs by excessive and injudicious eating the ailments of yezd would be very few the population is without exception most favourable to the work of the medical mission and all classes seem to be grateful the institution in the town the school work of the mission necessarily appeals to much smaller circle but there is doubt whatever about its being appreciated and further there seems to be exceedin gly little hostility to such religious inquiry and teaching does not altogether collide with or appear to tend to severance from the mussulman or parsee communities this is very likely due to the fast extending inﬂuence of the behai sect the members of which regard favourably an acquaintance with other idolatrous religions these people notwithstanding their being outside of ofﬁcial protection and in collision with the mullahs form large proportion of the population of yezd and exercise an inﬂuence on public opinion considerably wider than the boundaries of their sect actual missionary work of christianization going beyond this point the difﬁculties encountered and the risks of catastrophe are too great at present any sensible man to attempt it the european staff of the mission employed entirely in educational and medical work in yezd consists of the rev napier malcolm most sensible and able man and malcolm who is of great help to her husband geor ge day and day miss taylor miss stirling miss brighty the work ladies is somewhat uphill and not always pleasant in mussulman countries women if not veiled are constantly exposed to the insults of roughs but people are beginning to get reconciled to what appeared to them at ﬁrst the very strange habits of european women and doubt in time it will be less unpleasant ladies to work among the natives so far the few english ladies who have braved the consequenc es of undertaking work in persia are greatly to be admired their pluck patience and tact the yezd mission was started in may 1898 by henry white who had year previous experience of medical work at julfa and isfahan he was then joined in december of the same year by the rev napier malcolm who had just come out from england the euro pean community of yezd is very small besides the above mentioned not always reside in are two englishmen of the bank of persia and swiss employed by the ﬁrm of ziegler that is all the fact that the persian government recognizes the race religions such those of armenians parsees and jews has led many to believe that religious liberty exists in persia there is relative tolerance but nothing more and even the parsees and jews have had until quite occasionally even now submit to considerable indignities on the part of the mullahs new sects like the behai however who abandon the mussulman faith there is absolutely ofﬁcial protection great secrecy has to be maintained to avoid persecution there seems nevertheless to be disposition on the part of the government to go considerably beyond this point of sufferance but wider toleration does not exist at present nor is it perfectly clear to what length the government of the country would be prepared to go chapter xxxix the guebres of sassanian name parsees arab invasion of romantic es of the parsees

is extremely interesting from historical point of view and its close association with that wonderful race the guebres better known in europe by the name of parsees the ancient city of askizar was buried by shifting sands in desert with few oases and was followed by the present yezd which does not date from earlier than the time of the sassanian dynasty ardeshir m eheban i rani and the l eading m embers of the nguman i asseri p arsee n ational assembl y y ezd yezdeyard the weak and unlucky last king of the sassan family which had reigned over persia 415 years was the ﬁrst to lay the foundations of the city and to colonize its neighbourhood it is in this city that notwithstanding the sufferings and persecution of mussulmans after the arab invasion of persia the successors of handful of brave people have to this day remained faithful to their native soil to be convinced that the parsees of yezd are strikingly ﬁne lot of people it is sufﬁcient to look at them the men are patriarchal generous sober intelligent thrifty the women contrary to the usage of all asiatic races are given great freedom but are renowned their chastity and modesty the name of parsees adopted by the guebres who migrated to india has been retained from fars or pars their native country which contained before the arab invasion persepolis the capital with magniﬁcent royal palace from this province the whole kingdom eventually adopted the name it is not necessary to go into the history of the nine dynasties which ruled in persia before it was conquered by the arabs but our purpose it is well to remind the reader that of all these dynasties the sassanian was the last and yezdeyard we have seen the ultimate king of the sassan family one is ﬁlled with horror at the romantic tale of how through weakness on his part and treachery on that of his people the fanatic arabs guided by the light of allah the prophet conquered persia slaying the unbelievers and enforcing the mahommedan religion on the survivors the runaway yezdeyard was treacherously slain with his own jewelled sword by miller in whose house he had obtained shelter after the disastrous battle of nahavand and his ﬂight through sistan khorassan and merv persia with every vestige of its magniﬁcence was lost ever to the persians and the supremacy of mahommedanism with its demoralizing inﬂuence its haughty intolerance and fanatic bigotism was ﬁrmly established from one end of the country to the other the ﬁne temples the shrines of the zoroastrians were mercilessly destroyed or changed into mosques zoroaster the prophet of the parsees had ﬁrst promulgated his religion during the reign of gushtasp 1300 of the kayanian family but after centuries of vicissitudes and corruption it was not till the time of the sassanian dynasty 226 that ardeshir babekhan the brave and just restored the zoroastrian religion to its ancient purity it is this true religion of ancient was smothered by the conquered arabs by means of blood and steel and is only retained in slightly modiﬁed character by the few remaining guebres of yezd and kerman well by those who sooner than sacriﬁce their religious convictions and their independence preferred to abandon their native land migrating to india with their families where their successors are to be found to this day still conservative to their faith it is not too much to say that the conglomeration of races that form the indian empire parsees are few in number not more than all counted they nevertheless occupy through their honesty intelligence and ﬁrmness of character the foremost place in that country but with these parsees who migrated we have space to deal here we will merely see why the remainder escaped death at the hands of the mahommedans and while ever remaining true to their religion continued in yezd and kerm an when under the new rulers almost the whole of the zoroastrian population of persia was compelled to embrace the religion of islam the fact that yezd and kerman were two distant and difﬁcult places of access the invading moslems may be taken the likely cause of the zoroastrians collecting there also the same reason doubt the arabs tired of ﬁghting and slaying and having given way to luxury and vice had become too lazy to carry on their wholesale slaughter of the zoroastrian population this leniency however has not done away entirely with constant tyrannical persecution and oppression of the unbelievers so that now the number of zoroastrians of yezd does not exceed and that of kerman is under great many zoroastrians have notwithstanding their unwillingness been since compelled to turn mahomm edans even ﬁfty years ago the zoroastrians of yezd and kerman called in persia contemptuously guebres were subjected to degradations and restrictions of the worst kind now their condition under stronger govern ment and some foreign inﬂuence has slightly ameliorated but is not yet entirely secure against the cruelty fanaticism and injustice of the mullahs and ofﬁcials in the the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https yezd is its size now the most enterprising trading centre of persia it is mostly due to the guebres living there although held in contempt by the mullahs and by the mahommedans in general these guebres are manly fellows sound in body and brain instead of lascivious demoralized effeminate creatures like their tyrants hundreds of years of oppre ssion have had little effect on the moral and physical condition of the guebres they are still hardy and proud when the whole country belonged to them nor has the demoralizing contact of the present race to whom they are subject had any marked effect on their industry which was the most remarkable characteristic in the ancient zoroastrians the zoroastrian religion teaches that every man must earn his food by his own exertion and enterprise unlike the mahomme dan teaching that the height of bliss is to live on the charity of one neighbours which rule however carries counterbalancing conviction that the more money dispensed in alms the greater the certainty of the givers obtaining after death seat in heaven one of the most refreshing qualities of the guebres and of the parsees in india is that they are usually extraordinarily truthful natives of asia and their morality even in men is indeed quite above the average there are few races among which marriages are conducted on more sensible lines and are more successful the man and woman united by marriage live in friendly equality and are help to one another family ties are very strong and are carried down even to distant relations while the paternal and maternal love their children and touching ﬁlial love their parents is most praiseworthy and deserves the greatest admiration the mussulmans themselves although religiously at variance and not keen to follow the good example of the guebres admit the fact that the zoroastrians are honest and good people it is principally the mullahs who are bitter against them and instigate the crowds to excesses there is not such thing the guebres justice in persia and even up to quite recent times their ﬁre temples and towers of silence were attacked and broken into by mussulman crowds the ﬁres so tenderly cared mercilessly put out the sacred books destroyed and the temples desecrated in the most insulting manner there are number of guebre places of worship in yezd and in the surrounding villages inhabited by guebre agriculturists but the princip al one is in the centre of the guebre quarter of yezd city it is neat small structure very simple and whitewashed inside with fortiﬁed back room wherein the sacred ﬁre is kept alight well covered with ashes by specially deputed priest it is hidden so to make it difﬁcult intending invaders to discover it and the strong door well protected by iron bars wants good deal of forcing before it can be knocked down the religious ceremony in the temple of the guebres is very interesting the ofﬁciating priests being dressed up in long white garment the sudra held together by sacred girdle and with the lower portion of the face covered by square piece of cloth like handkerchief on the head they wear peculiar cap various genuﬂexions on specially spread carpet and bows are made and prayers read parsee p riests of y ezd fficia ting during c eremony in their f ire t emple the priests belong generally to the better classes and the rank is mostly hereditary certain ceremonies are considered necessary before the candidate can attain the actual dignity of prelate first of the ceremonies comes the navar or six days retreat in his own dwelling followed by the ceremony of initiation four more days in the ﬁre temple with two priests who have previously gone through the yasna prayers six consecutive mornings although after this he can ofﬁciate in some ceremonies such weddings he is not fully qualiﬁed priest until the bareshnun has been under gone and again the yasna the following day other prayers are offered to the guardian spirit and at midnight the last ceremony takes place and he is qualiﬁed to the degree of maratab when he can take part in any of the zoroastrian rituals preliminary great purity of mind and body are required from candidates and they are made to endure lavish ablutions of water and cow urine clay and ancient custom said to cleanse the body better than modern soaps after that the candidate is secluded nine whole days in the ﬁre temple and is not permitted to touch human beings vegetation water nor ﬁre and must wash himself twice more during that time on the fourth day and on the seventh it is only then that he is considered amply puriﬁed and able to go through the navar ceremony the zoroastrian religion is based on three excellent good thoughts good words good deeds long people adhere to them it is difﬁcult to see how they can go wrong they worship god and only one god and not admit idolatry they are most regarding other people notions and are ever ready to recognise that other religions have their own good the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https greater libel was ever perpetrated on the parsees than when they were put down worshippers or worshippers of the elements the parsees are pers but revere not worship ﬁre and the sun symbols of glory heat splendour and purity also because ﬁre is to human beings one of the most necessary things in creation if not indeed the most necessary thing otherwise they are more than the roman catholics instance who might easily come under the same heading they have lighted candles and lights constantly burning in front of images inside their churches besides it is not the ﬁre itself ﬁre that parsees nurse in their temples but ﬁre specially puriﬁed the purpose the process is this several ﬁres if possible originally lighted by some natural cause such lightning are brought in vases over one of these ﬁres is placed ﬂat perforated tray of metal on which small pieces of very dry are made to ignite by the mere action of the heat but must not actually come in contact with the ﬂame below from this ﬁre third one is lighted in similar manner and nine times this operation is repeated each successive ﬁre being considered purer than its predecessor and the result of the ninth conﬂagration being pronounced absolutely pure it is really the idea of the purifying process that the parsees revere more than the ﬁre itself and the ninth ﬁre alone is considered worthy to occupy special place in their temp les so in similarity to it they aim in life to purify their own thoughts words and actions and glorify them into good thoughts true words noble actions this is indeed very different from of which the parsees are generally accused in yezd the guebres told that they possessed very few sacred books in their temple or if they had them could not show them they said that all the ancient books had been destroyed by the mahommedans or had been taken away to india there were also several smaller temples in the neighbourhood of yezd which had gone through good many vicissitudes in their time but now the parsees and their places of worship are left in comparative peace parsee men and women are still compelled to wear special clothes so to be detected at once in the streets but this custom is gradually dying out the women are garbed in striped garments short jacket and small turban leaving the face uncovered the men are only allowed to wear certain cloaks and are not allowed to ride horse in the streets of yezd parsees not enjoy the civil rights of other citizens in persia and justice was until quite lately out of the question in the case of differences with mussulmans at death man property would be lawfully inherited by any distant relation who had adopted the religion of moslem instead of by the man own children and wife who had remained faithful to their creed and in the matter of recovering debts from mussulmans the law of persia is certainly very far indeed from helping guebre this is necessarily great obstacle in commercial intercourse worst of all the burdens formerly inﬂicted upon the well upon armenians and jews of the jazia tax some thousand or so male guebres of yezd were ordered to pay the tax yearly which with commissions and squeezes of governors and ofﬁcials was made to amount to some two thousand tomans or about at the present rate of exchange much severity and even cruelty were enforced to obtain payment of the tax the parsees were until quite lately debarred from undertaking any occupati on that might place them on level with mahommedans with the exception of few by migrating to india and obtaining british nationality returned and enjoyed certain amount of nominal the majority of the population consists of agriculturists and scavengers mainly by the efforts of the bombay amelioration society of the parsees the guebres of yezd and kerman fare comparatively well the jazia has been abolished and the present shah and the local government have to be congratulated on their fairness and consideration towards these ﬁne people that soon they will be permitted to enjoy all the rights of other citizens which they indeed fully deserve many steps have been made in that direction within the last few years the parsees are most progressive race if properly protected they are only too anxious to lead the way in all reformation and with all this are remarkable their courteousness and reﬁned manner the most prominent members of the yezd community especially the sons of meheban rustam have been the pioneers of trade between yezd and india besides the excellent parsee school several other institutions have been established in yezd and its suburbs by the bombay society supported by few charitable parsees of bombay and some of the leading members of the parsee community in yezd the bombay society has done much to raise the zoroastrians of persia to their present comparatively advanced state but trade and commerce also have to great extent contributed to their present eminence the bombay society nominates and sends an agent to reside in teheran the capital of persia to look after the interests of helpless zoroastrians and the parsees of yezd have moreover national assembly called the i was entertained by this interesting body of men and received from their president ardeshir meheban irani much of the valuable information here given about the yezd parsees the association has an elected body of members all honorary the most venerable and intelligent of the community and its aims are to advocate the social rights of the zoroastrians race to settle disputes arising between the individuals of the community to defend helpless parsees against moslem wantonness and to improve their condition generally the association was established on the 3rd of february 1902 by the late kaikosroo firendaz irani the then agent of the bombay society in this work he had the advice and help of the leading men of the community there are several naturalised british subjects in yezd including the president of the who speaks and writes english well any it is greatly to be regretted that these men can not obtain proper protection from the british government yet these fellows could be of very great assistance to england in spreading british inﬂuence in yezd not to speak of increasing british they are only too anxious to if chance is given conjunction with the representatives of their race in most anglicised except in religion of all our subject races of india there was formerly british in yezd but some reason the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https the government while russia ﬁnds it expedient to establish consular agents in all the principal centres of persia we have actually withdrawn our representative even from so important city yezd the parsee communities of yezd and bombay are in constant communication with each other and it is well known what marvellous prosperity these fugitives of fars have now attained in bombay through their honesty and hard work especially since their connection with the british whose civilisation with the exception of religion and the hat they have entirely adopted most of them speak perfect english and many of the sons of the wealthier parsees have been educated at universities in england we ﬁnd them working banking houses on large scale and cotton mills running lines of steamers and shipbuilding yards they trade considerably with the far east and far west and with every nook in asia even far samarkand bokhara siberia and petersbur g parsee traders are to be found and in japan china the united states and canada with england they carry on very extensive trade and through them intermediaries much of the import trade into india ﬁnds its way into neighbouring markets more difﬁcult of access to the direct british exporter one of the most noticeable traits of the ﬂourishing parsees of bombay is their extreme generosity often hampered by petty stupid indian ofﬁcialdom which they seem to stand with amazing patience and we ﬁnd well appointed hospitals erected by them schools clubs and only lately one of the richest of all parsees jamsetsji tata has given the city of bombay less gift than quarter of million pounds the erection of university on the most modern lines in that city chapter xl badjirs the sand service between yezd and elasticity of n three provinces capital serde kuh darestan and godare hashimshan khana inscriptions and ornamentations by the most characteristic objects in yezd are the badjirs most ingenious device catching the wind and conveying it down into the various rooms of dwelling these badjirs are on the same principle the ventilating cowls of ships the ventilating shafts are usually very high and quadrangular with two three or more openings on each side at the summit and corresponding channels to convey the wind down into the room below the lower apertures of the channels are blocked except on the side where the wind happens to blow and thus draught is created from the top downwards sweeping the whole room and rendering it quite cool and pleasant even in the hottest days of summer the reason that one ﬁnds so many of these high badjirs in yezd is probably that owing to constant accumulations of sand the whole city is now below the level of the surrounding desert and some device had to be adopted to procure fresh air inside the houses and protect the inhabitants from the suffocating lack of ventilation during the stiﬂing heat of the summer the badjirs are certainly constructed in most scientiﬁc or rather practical manner and answer the purpose to perfection when we leave yezd the city itself can not be seen at all but just above the sand of the desert rise hundreds of these quadrangular towers some very large indeed which give the place quaint appearance from yezd to kerman there is again service of so i availed myself of it in order to save much time possible the horses were not much used on this road so they were excellent i departed from yezd on october 26th and soon after leaving the city and riding through the usual plentiful but most unattractive ruins we were travelling over very uninteresting country practically desert we passed two and then wound our way through avenues of mulberry trees at mahommedabad or namadawat village where are reared in quantities which accounts the extensive mulberry plantations to provide food them the village is lar ge and is three farsakhs from yezd or something like ten miles the farsakh most elastic measure ever here to just above three miles whereas further north it averaged four miles in strong wind we rode on ﬁrst on sand then on gravelly soil ever through dreary desolate country the villages taghiabad zehnawat get smaller and poorer and further apart and some eight farsakhs from yezd we eventually reach the small town of from namadawat the country was an absolutely ﬂat gravel plain with water the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https of ld c ara vanserai with c entral w ater t ank at altitude feet we were detained some time the highest ofﬁcial in the place had received orders from the governor of yezd not to let proceed without strong guard to accompany this was rather nuisance than otherwise although the country between yezd and anar was reported infested by robbers we really should have been able to hold our own against them even without the rabble that was sent to accompany us after delay of some hours ﬁve picturesque they would have been useless in case of in an appearance they had old long muzzle loaders which must have been more dangerous to the person ﬁring them than to the ones ﬁred at and they wore elaborate leather belts with two ample pouches lead bullets two gunpowder ﬂasks made of desiccated sheep testicles leather bag small shot and large iron ring with small clips caps horses could not be procured these men so they had to follow my baggage on foot which caused further delay we left shortly before sunset i intended marching the whole night there was great discussion among these soldiers about crossing over into kerman territory four farsakhs beyond and just at the point where the robbers are supposed to attack caravans the guard whether through fear or otherwise declined to come on sadek remonstrated most bitterly but three of them left us while two said they had been entrusted with orders to see and my luggag safely to the place where another guard could be obtained and would continue i tried to persuade them to go back too but they would not it appears that between and there is an expanse of waste land near the boundary of the yezd kerman and farsistan shiraz provinces the possession of which is declared by the governors of all these provinces not to belong to them the boundary having never been properly deﬁned so robbers can carry on their evil deeds with comparative immunity they not come under the jurisdiction of any of the three governors in question moreover if chased by yezd soldiers they escape into shiraz or kerman territory and if pursued by kerman troops they escape into either of the neighbouring provinces while the governor of shiraz being the furthest and least interested in that distant corner of his province really never knows and probably does not care to learn what takes place in so remote and barren spot in any case he will not be held responsible anything happening there it would certainly involve him in too great expense and difﬁculty to send soldiers to live so far into the desert and unless in great force they could be of little assistance to caravans so that things stand robber bands have it all their own way strict etiquette is observed between governors of provinces and their subordinates and an encroachment on one neighbour territory would be considered most outrageous breach of good manners and respective rights still travelling quite fast across sand and with brigands in sight we went on pleasantly entertained by the astounding yarns of the two remaining soldiers we were told how twenty years ago foreign attacked by band of thirty robbers produced small bottle of foreign most highly concentrated essence of from his waistcoat pocket and having removed the cork the thirty brigands immediately fell on all sides in deep sleep the doctor and his party then continued their journey quietly and returned several days later with number of soldiers who had trouble in despatching the robbers from temporary into an eternal sleep without their waking up at all on being asked how it was that the doctor himself remained awake when such powerful narcotic was administered the narrator did not lose his presence of mind nor his absence of conscience and said the doctor had during the operation held his nose tight with his two ﬁngers the doctor had since been of fered thousands of tomans the precious bottle but would not part with it the soldiers told us great many more stories of this type and they recounted them with such an aplomb and seriousness that they nearly made one fall off one saddle with laughter every now and then they insisted on ﬁring off their riﬂes which i requested them to some distance away from my horses there were mishaps at i had not been able to obtain fresh horses so the yezd horses had been taken on with an additional donkey they had gone splendidly and we arrived at in shortly after ten at night solitary in the middle of the desert and by the side of salt water well stands alt feet there is chappar station and circular caravanserai with massively built these appeared much battered if from the result of repeated the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https left our soldier protectors behind here and two more military persons in rags and with obsolete guns insisted on accompanying us but they were on foot and would have delayed us considerably i paid them of f hundred yards from and sent them back there are mountains extending from the to the the serde kuh range and to the they are quite close to the track and show low passes mile or so apart by which the range could easily be crossed to the west also we have high hills some three or four miles apart from the mountains to the and to the north an open desert far yezd we notice here again the curious accumulations of sand high up on the south mountain side and also to the west of the mountain range east of us typical c ara vanserai and m ud f ort in the d eser t between y ezd and k erman t rade c ara vanserai k erman at ten in the morning after dreary ride through desolate country we reached the small village of kermanshah feet where post station and caravanserai were to be found few trees and above all some good drinking water from to kermanshah distance of sixteen miles ﬁve farsakhs we had seen only one solitary tree to the of the track we had now rugged mountains about mile to the west and these were ranges parallel to one another the darestan mountains being the nearest to us and the godare hashimshan behind them further while i was waiting fresh horses to be got ready i amused myself at every station studying the curious inscriptions and ornamentations by scribbling travellers on the caravanserai and walls laboriously engraved quotations from the koran were the most numerous then the respective names of travellers in characters more or less elaborate according to the education of the writer and generally accompanied by record of the journey place of birth and destination of the scribbler occasionally one was startled by french inscription in sickening terms of humility the work of persian minor ofﬁcials in government employ who thus made public exhibition of their knowledge of foreign language and expounded in glowing terms their servile admiration superiors more interesting were the records of illiterate travellers who in default of literature placed one arm and hand upon the whitewashed wall and traced their silhouette with the point of knife or bit of charcoal or brush held in the other hand then came those still more artistically inclined who ventured into conventionalised representations of the peacock with most favourite and frequent of persian outbursts of chappar khana art and probably the most emblematic representation of persian character the conventionalised peacock is represented in few lines such one sees on the familiar persian brass trays the shah portrait with luxuriant moustache is met in most chappar khanas scraped somewhere upon the wall and not infrequently other whole human ﬁgures drawn in mere lines such children in our country but with greater profusion of anatomical detail very frequent indeed are the coarse representations of scenes in daily life which we generally prefer to leave fact the artistic genius of the persian traveller seems to run very much in that direction and these drawings are generally the most elaborate of all often showing signs of multiple collaboration horses fully harnessed are occasionally attempted but i never saw camel represented only once did i come across huge representation of ship or boat small birds drawn with ﬁve or six lines only but quite characteristic of conventi onalised persian art were extremely common and were the most ingeniously clever of the lot centipedes and occasional scorpions were now and then attempted with much ingenuity and faithfulness of detail but artistic merit all these ornamentations studied carefully taught one good deal of persian character that the persian is very observant and his mind very analytical is quite out of the quest ion but his fault the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https the fact that in art in daily life minor details strike him long before he can grasp the larger and more important general view of what he sees he prefers to leave that to take care of itself we ﬁnd the same characteristics not only in his frivolous chappar khana he can be studied unawares and is therefore quite in his more serious art in his music in his business transactions in his political work the lack of simplicity which we notice in his rude drawings can be detected in everything else he does and the evident delight which he takes in depicting peacock with its tail spread in all its glory is nothing more and nothing less than an expression of what the persian feels within himself in relation to his neighbours nothing has greater fascination him than outward show and pomp he cares little else and further proof of this unhappy vainglory is obtained by the study of the wall scrolls of the travelling travelling ofﬁcially or trading in persia usually the most and intelligent section of the persian population on we go along the dreary track again on ﬂat desolate country of sand and stones at the spur of the mountains to the west and sand deposits rise at gentle gradient up to half the height of these mountains well padding their slopes the track here leads us due south to low pass at an altitude of feet one gets so tired of the monotonous scenery that one would give anything to perceive something attractive nor is the monotony of the journey diminished by two other miserable nagging soldiers who have clung to us an escort from kermanshah and who are running after our horses moaning and groaning and saying they are starved and tired and have not received their pay nor their food from the government several months on the other side of the pass there is basin encircled by mountains except to the where we ﬁnd an open outlet the track goes through this yellow plain and on proceeding across we ﬁnd several conical black mounds with curious patches of verdigris colour to the east rises low sand dune we come in sight of shemsh most forlorn cheerless place sadek gallops ahead with the horjins in which he has the cooking pans some dead fowls and load of vegetables and pomegranates and i slow down to give him time to prepare my lunch i arrived at the place at there was only desolate caravanserai and chappar khana on the track there are not more than three horses at each post some there are only two i required less than ﬁve horses or if possible six i always had to take on the deﬁcient number of horses from the previous stations i generally gave these horses two or three hours rest but it made their marches very long indeed it must be reme mbered that on my dischar ging them they must at once return to their point of departure fortunately the trafﬁc was so small by this road that the horses were in good condition and so i was able to proceed at good rate all along occasionally one or two horses had to be taken on three consecutive stages which taking an average six farsakhs each stage made the distance they had to travel including return journey six stages or some 120 miles in all the altitude of shemsh was feet chapter xli desolate word persian chappar post contractor his growing rade hindu and the chappar and ﬂat salty stretch of clay and kuh djupahr mirage in kerman i left shemsh two hours later at and we travelled over slightly undulating country on sandy ground with occasional tracts of stones and gravel if possible this part was even more desolate than the scenery we had found before reaching here and not vestige of vegetation or animal life could be detected anywhere when night descended upon us we had glorious moon light to brighten our way and we marched on time without the nuisance of an we arrived at anar at farsakhs about 22 miles from shemsh from what one could see during our short stay in the night there appeared to be large village mostly in ruins with few trees and mud fort we had gradually descended here to feet the water was quite good we only allowed ourselves three hours to have our dinner and sleep and i ordered the horses to be ready shortly after midnight and here whatever other faults they may have word of commendation must be put in the endurance of persian servants it is all very well one self to with little sleep but servants who will go days and days without any at all and without word of complain t or sign of collapse are retainers not easily found and not to be despised certainly one seldom obtains such qualities in european servants after doing ﬁfty or sixty miles on the saddle we would get off and i rested awhile writing up my notes or if at night changing plates in my cameras but sadek never had any rest at all sooner had we jumped off our horses than he had to undo the saddles and unpack the baggage and kill fowls and cook my meals which all took him some little time then he had to wash or clean up everything and repack and run about the villages to purchase provisions and all this kept him well employed until the hour of departure so that even when i could put in couple of hours sleep of night he never had time to sleep at all sleeping on the saddle of course was usual when we travelled by caravan but was impossible when chapparing so that he had to go several days at time without moment wink the remarkable facility with which under these trying circumstances he got most excellent meals ready at all hours of the day or night and in the most outlandish places and the magic way in which he could produce fuel and make ﬁre out of the most unlikely materials was really extraordinary true he took himself and his work most seriously and his pride lay principally in having reproach about the the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https had smattering of english that was very quaint everything above ground he called upstairs anything on the ground or below was downstairs thus to mount and dismount horse was laconically expressed horse upstairs horse downstairs similarly to lie down was downstairs to get up upstairs anything involving violent motion was shoot by which single word to fall to kick to bite to drop to jump to throw away were deﬁned he possessed good vocabulary of swear he had learnt from sailors at these served him well when anything went wrong but i forbade him to use them in my presence i wished to have the monopoly myself and thus his english vocabulary was very much curtailed the remainder of his english conversation applied entirely to cooking chickens shortly after midnight we moved out of the chappar khana and barring some slight cultivation in the immediate neighbourhood of the village we soon entered again upon the ﬂat sandy desert we had lovely full moon over us which added to the pleasure of travelling and we rode on to bayas ﬁve farsakhs some seventeen or eighteen miles where we arrived at ﬁve in the morning the altitude of this place was exactly the same that of anar feet bayas is tiny village with few mulberry trees and small stream of water it has fair caravanserai we rested the horses couple of hours while i had breakfast and by we were again in our saddles to the and by east we again perceived the familiar high sand deposits all along the base of the mountain ranges and they reached up to of the height of the mountains forming smooth inclined plane rising very gently from the ﬂat desert on which we were travelling to the by east the rose nearly to the summit of the hill range sadek and the chappar boy pointed out to village to the of the track and informed that all its inhabitants were robbers and murderers in fact upon the road we came across poor boy crying and bruised all over we asked him what was the matter he pointed to three men in the distance who were running away and said they had beaten him and stolen his money two krans and two pomegranates sure enough when we galloped to the men and stopped them they did not wait to be accused but handed at once both fruit and money to be returned to their rightful owner these folks had very brutal faces framed in ﬂowing locks of shaggy hair they were garbed in long thick coats of white felt made entirely of one piece and quite stiff with sleeves sticking out at the sides into which the arms were never to be inserted there were two red and blue small circular ornamentations at the bottom of the coat in front and one in the centre of the back on japanese kimonos we began to see more habitations now and about one mile of the track we perceived the villages of esmalawat aliabad and latter quite large place we still went on over sand and white salt deposits poor sadek was so tired and sleepy that he fell off his horse couple of times the soil got very stony on getting near kushkuhyeh altitude feet where we entered the chappar khana exactly at noon the contractor of the postal service lived at this village and he was extremely civil many eight horses were in his stable and he ordered that the best should be given he entertained to tea and took the keenest interest in my riﬂes he also possessed one of the familiar discarded british martini military riﬂes specially decorated the persian riﬂe worth at its most pound sterling or two but which he had paid less than 100 tomans about the smugglers of ﬁrearms must have made huge proﬁts on the sale of these antiquated weapons ﬁrearms are among the few articles which lar ge sums of ready money can be obtained in persia this particular man now took great fancy to my mannlicher and jokingly said he would not let proceed until i had sold it to him he produced large sums in solid silver to tempt about four times the value of the riﬂe and was greatly upset when i assured him that i would not part with the riﬂe at all when i left he accompanied part of the way some few hundred yards and he took with him his martini and belt full of cartridges his servant who followed him was also similarly armed on inquiring of him why master and servant loaded themselves with arms and ammunition to go such short distance he replied that it was not safe him to go unarmed even one yard out of his house one of his friends had been murdered only few days before and one never knows in persia when one turn will come next in places in persia private revenge is extremely common which generally takes the form of shooting one adversary in the back there seemed to be abundance of water at kushkuhyeh and the ﬁelds were properly irrigated cultivation seemed prosperous and vast cotton plantations were to be seen all round when we passed hundreds of men women and children were busy taking in the cotton and scores of camels donkeys sheep and goats grazing were dotting the green patch in the landscape this gay scene of active life and verdure was all the more refreshing after the many miles of sand and gravel and barren hills of which we had grown so weary since leaving yezd two hours were wasted lunch and off we went again on leaving behind kushkuhyeh we also left behind vegetation and again we sank in sand few tamarisk shrubs were scattered here and there on the lar ge plain we were traversing bounded on all sides by distant mountains three and half farsakhs about 13 miles saw us at hemmatawat lar ge walled enclosure at we entered the small town of barawamad bahramabad rafsenju it is called now by its new name this is place of quite modern origin and it owes most of its prosperity to the extensive cultivation of cotton exporte d from here direct to the persian gulf and india besides the route on which we are travelling there are several other tracks leading out of barawamad minor one runs in direction over the dehring mountains to the seroenan district where many villages are to be found and then turns sharply viâ zerend to kerman it is also possible when once one has crossed into seroenan to continue to lawah rawar and then across the salt desert to meshed or to the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https the persian gulf there are three tracks one by west to from which place the traveller has the option to travel to bushire viâ shiraz or to lingah or to bandar abbas viâ forg two different tracks to reshitabad and bidu join at melekabad and these eventually enter the track while another track the most in use goes almost due south direct to bidu skirting the pariz mountains on their westerly slopes this track too crosses the route at saidabad and proceeds due south to bandar abbas the few hindoo merchants of kerman come here during the cotton season to make their purchases and send their goods direct to bandar abbas shipment to india pottery of an inferior kind is manufactured at rafsenju we left the chappar khana at midnight in terriﬁc cold wind and this time on shockingly bad horses they were tired and lame the cold wind probably intensifying the rheumatic pains from which most of them were suffering the country was undulating and we gradually rose to feet the horses gave us end of trouble and we had to walk the greater portion of the night sadek ﬁve feet two in height and the chappar boy six feet two came to words and soon after to most sonorous blows to add to our comfort the chappar boy who got the worst of the scrimmage ran away and it was only at sunrise that we perceived him again long way off following us not daring to get too near eventually by dint of sending him peaceful messages by caravan man who passed us sadek induced him to return and still struggling in the sand of the desolate country all round us and our horses sinking quite deep into it we managed to drag men horses and loads into kafter kebuter in the morning where we were glad to get relays of fresh steeds we had gone about miles from the last station few mud huts an ice ﬂour mill high building said to have been an arsenal the usual caravanserai and dingy chappar khana were all quite all one could rest one eye upon at kafter there was some cultivation but nothing very luxuriant the few inhabitants were quite interested in the sudden appearance of ferenghi foreigner the women who were not veiled here were quite one girl particularly whose photograph i snatched before she had time to run away to hide usual effect of camera on persian women quite the reverse to its ef fects on the european fair sex we left almost directly on better animals and proceeded having lofty rugged hills to the east and south of us with the usual high sand accumulations upon their sides to the we could just discern the distant mountains near kerman the track itself on the sandy embankment at the foot of the hillside to the is rather high up and tortuous owing to very long salt marsh which ﬁlls the lower portion of the valley during the rainy weather and makes progress in straight line impossible but now owing to the absolute absence of rain months and months the marsh was perfectly dry and formed ﬂat white plastered stretch of clay sand and salt smooth and not unlike an immense ﬂoor prepared the dried salt mud was extremely hard our horses hoofs leaving scarcely mark on it i reckoned the breadth of this ﬂat white expanse at one and half miles and its length little over eleven miles two high peaks stood in front of us to the the kuh djupahr forming part of long range extending in direction at distance of four farsakhs about thirteen miles and directly on the other side of the salt stretch we came to another chappar khana at the village of robat there were good many women about in front of the huge caravanserai and they looked very ridiculous in the tiny short skirts like those of ballet girls and not particularly clean over tight trousers quite adhering to the legs we have the same mountains on both sides and we continue over undulating ground the valley getting somewhat narrower we proce ed towards baghih six or seven miles from kafter was esmaratabad village mass of ruins and ten miles or so large village still in fair preservation sadi with some vegetation principally wheat the track lay mostly over stony barren desert with here and there miles and miles apart forced patch of green baghih our last halt before reaching kerman was nine farsakhs from kafter it stood at an elevation of feet and had plenty of excellent water the village was large with handsome walled gardens and all round the inhabitants were most affable and civil and the women and children particularl y simple and attractive the girls were attired in longer and more graceful skirts than the damsels of robat and did not leave the leg exposed even high the knee over it they had an ample shirt with wide short sleeves showing their gracefully modelled and well rounded arms adorned with meta l bracelets on the head was kerchief neatly bound quite tight over the head by means of ribbon it was not possible to get fresh horses here and mine were very tired or i would have continued to kerman the same evening completing the journey from yezd 220 miles in three days we had arrived early in the afternoon and had i not been compelled to take on the tired horses the remaining four farsakhs 13 miles i could have easily reached kerman before the gates of the city were closed at sunset it was i had to give it up and had to sleep the night at baghih making an early start on wednesday the 30th baghih is actually of kerman and the track makes this long detour to avoid the bademan mountains to the north it thus passes over comparatively level land in the valley between that range and the kuh djupahr the track turning here sharply to the in which direction when we get to the highest point of the track feet one and half farsakhs from baghih we can almost discern kerman in the distance excep t to the we have high mountains all round the highest being the djupahr to the and of which we now get most lovely view and also of the whole kerman plain with its innumerable at the foot of the djupahr below us we see the two villages of kheirabad and akhibarabad with many trees and some cultivation round them on descending into the kerman plain we have deceiving effects of mirage lovely lakes on both sides and streams of water but on the rising of gentle breeze limpid lakes and streams suddenly disappear and the whole plain is nothing but big undulating stretch of yellow sand until we arrive within almost of the city gates of kerman at 11 on wednesday october the 30th i halted at the palatial chappar khana of kerman just outside the city wall in handsome garden having accomplished the journey from yezd in the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https including halts chapter xlii ark or of the british governor of teaching music to the campaign against the manufacture it was my intention to pay my respects to the british consul whom i had letters of introduction from the minister at teheran and i at once proceeded through the city entering ﬁrst the ark or citadel and then the gate with two side columns of green and blue tiles in spiral design and pointed archway into the meidan ﬁne rectangular square of great length and breadth sentries posted at the gates of the city and at the sides of the square saluted and also many of the people along the road this extraordinary civility was very refreshing in country where one only expects extreme rudeness from the lower classes we entered the vaulted bazaar the main big artery of kerman city intersected about by tortuous street from north to south and by other minor narrow lanes and crowded with people donkeys camels and mules and here too one was rather surprised to see various merchants get up in their shops salaaming i passed and to receive salameleko and bow from most men on the way the bazaar itself being in appearance more ancient than those of yezd isfahan and teheran was more alluring and had many quaint bits it bore however very much the same characteristics all other bazaars of persia at the end of it on the we emer ged into an open space with picturesque awnings suspended mats and spread umbrellas shading innumerable baskets of delicious green ﬁgs trays of grapes and pomegranates piles of water and vegetables of all sorts la el ulk g overnor of k erman in his p alace europeans live within the wall of kerman city itself and at the time of my visit there were only four europeans altogether residing in the neighbourhood of the town two missionaries husband and wife gentleman who misled by representations had been induced to come from india to dig artesian wells at great country where the natives are masters at ﬁnding water and making our most excellent consul major phillott one of the most practical and sensible men that ever lived the consulate was at zeris or zirisf some little distance to the east of the town we passed through graveyard on leaving the inhabited district and had in front of us some ancient fortiﬁcations on the rocky hills to the south which we skirted and then came to some huge conical old but still in excellent preservation we passed the and gateway of the and little further at the end of short avenue the british ﬂag could be seen ﬂying upon gate i came upon him ragged infantry soldier who being at his dinner was busy licking his ﬁngers sprang to his feet and made military salute having passed through court and garden and series of dismantled rooms i found myself in the consulate where i was greeted effusively by major phillott who had idea i was coming and who owing to my being very much had at ﬁrst mistaken persian he would not hear of my remaining at the chap par khana and most kindly sent at once all my luggage to be brought up to the consulate the hospitality of englishmen in persia is really unbounded governor of kerman called on the consul that same afternoon and i was able to present the letter i had brought to him having lived long in europe is most ﬂuent french scholar and being man of considerable talent sense and honesty he is rather adverse to the empty show and pomp which is ever deemed the necessary accompaniment of ofﬁcials in persia he can be seen walking through the town with only servant or two or riding about inspecting every nook of his city hardly attended at all this curiously enough has not shocked the natives people feared but on the contrary has inspired them with intense respect the new governor whose tact gentleness consideration and justice were fully appreciated by the whole town so that after all it is pleasant to notice that the lower classes of persia have more common sense and power of dif ferentiation than they have hitherto been credited with when i want anything well done said the governor to i it myself i want the welfare of my people and am only glad when i can see with my own eyes that they get it i inspect my soldiers i see them drilled before i go to the bazaar to talk to the people and any one can come to talk to nobody need be afraid of coming to i am ever ready to listen to all although this innovation in the system of impressing the crowds created somew hat of sensation at ﬁrst the governor soon managed to impress the people with his own personality and he is the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https popular among all classes except the who can not carry on their usual extortions with impunity he asked to go and inspect his troops whom he had drilled before his own eyes every morning and undoubtedly of all the soldiers i had seen in persia they were the only the cossack regiments drilled by had real military appearanc and were trained according to method they were better dressed better fed and more disciplined even than the soldiers of teheran the teaching of music to recruits the band was quite interesting the musical notes were written on and the young fellows were made to sing them out in chorus until they had learnt the whole melody by heart the boys had most musical voices and quite good musical ears while their powers of retention of what they were taught were quite extraordinary when it was considered that these fellows were recruited from the lowest and most ignorant classes the garrison of kerman was armed with vrandel riﬂes an old discarded european pattern but quite serviceable anyhow all the men possessed riﬂes of one and the same pattern which was an advantage not noticeable in the teheran troops instance persians they went through their drill in an accurate and manner mostly to the sound of three drums and also with capital band playing european brass instruments the governor took special delight in showing several tents which he had had specially manufactured his approaching campaign in conjunction with british troops from british beluchistan against marauding beluch tribes who had been very troublesome some time and who being so close to the frontier were able to evade alike persian beluch and british law until joint movement against them was made from west and east told that he intended to command the expedition himself man extraordinarily courteous and simple in manner was former persian ambassador in constantinople through fault of his own owing to certain customs prevalent at the sultan court the shah during his visit to constantinople was unreasonably displeased and the ambassador was recalled the governorship of distant kerman was given him but man like one of the ablest men in persia would be more useful in higher position nearer the capital if not in the capital itself kerman is very place and of very great importance just yet although if persia develops she should it will not be many years from the present time before kerman becomes place of great importance to england however is above all philosopher and he certainly makes the best of his opportunities he has to contend with many difﬁculties intrigue false dealing and corruption being rampant even among some of the higher ofﬁcials in the town but with his sound judgment and patience he certainly manages to keep things going in most satisfactory manner besides his ofﬁcial business and with the aid of his nephew he superintends the manufacture we have already seen of the best the most characteristically persian carpets of the ﬁnest quality and dyes there are great many looms in the buildings adjacent to the palace and hundreds of hands employed in the governor factories he also possesses good collection of very ancient carpets from which the modern ones are copied i returned his visit at his palace where the consul and i were received most cordially and had lengthy and most interesting conversation with his excellency then he showed all the buildings in the ark kerman is celebrated its cloth manufacture and felts the cloth is of ﬁne worsted and is generally in pieces six yards long by three quarters of yard wide it is much used by the natives both hangings and making clothes men and women being very soft and durable embroidered turbans and kamarbands are made from these cloths especially in white cloth generally of ﬁne quality the process of weaving these cloths called inappropriately kerman shawls is identical with that of the loom described at the village of bambis in chapter xxxvi the material used the best quality is the selected ﬁne wool growing next to the skin of goats these dyed threads are cut into short lengths and woven into the fabric by the supple and agile ﬁngers of the children working packed tight together at the looms some of the best cloths not more than ten feet in length take long month per foot in their manufacture and they realise very high prices even much nine or ten pounds sterling yard the design on the more elaborate ones is in the carpets learn t by heart the stitches being committed to memory like the words of poem this is not however the case with the simpler and cheaper ones which are more carelessly done boy reading out the design from pattern or book tiled w alls and p icturesque w indows in the m adrassah k erman the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https gha s s on the h ead of the s heikhi s ect k erman the carpet factories of kerman are very extensive the process being similar to that already described in previous chapter chapter xliii the peace on abraham the hammam hindoo or virgin deep it was made visit to the madrassah on the north side of the bazaar was extremely interesting it being the best preserved building of that type i had so far seen in persia the consul and i were shown round it by the son of sirkar agha the head of the sheikhi sect most digniﬁed individ ual with long black cloak and ample white turban and with beard dyed black ink he conversed most intelligently and took great delight in showing every nook of the building the college is only some ninety years old its courts its walls its rooms its dome are most beautifully tiled all over and strange to say it is kept in good repair and the gardens are well looked after there is handsome with four strong receptacles high up in the corners of the room and at the windows not unlike egyptian musharabeahs four very high ventilating shafts are constructed over the buildings to keep the rooms cool peace on abraham reads an elaborate inscription quoted from the koran but applying in this case sirkar agha son tells to the founder of the institution there are other inscriptions on the towers and ventilating shafts at the time of my visit the number of pupils was two hundred the adjoining hammam belonging to the college was to our astonishment also shown us such baths are under ground and are reached by steps or by slippery incline these particular ones were very superior and had beautifully tiled entrance but the door itself was small and always kept closed the ﬁrst room was domed with fountain playing in the centre and platforms three feet high all round on the matting of which lay spread great many cotton towels red and blue the only light came from centre aperture in the dome high earthen jugs stood artistic ally resting against one another and few people were dressing or undressing preparatory to taking or after having taken bath this was all that was done in this room through narrow slippery passage we entered another room where the steamy heat was considerable there were small sections round the room divided by wall like the cells of monastery and in each cell was tap of cold water then we ascended through small aperture into another and warmer room spacious enough but stiﬂing with sickening acid odour of perspiration and fumes of human skins the steam heat was so great that one saw everything in haze and one felt one own pores expan d and one clothes get quite wet with the absorbed damp in the atmosphere over with moisture there were two or three men stripped and only with loin cloth lying down ﬂat on their backs one under going massage being thumped all over another having the hair of his head and beard dyed the reason that the persian are so permanent is principally because the dyeing is done at such high temperature and in such moist atmosphere which allows the dye to get well into the hair when the same dyes are used at normal temperature the results are never so successful further third man was being cleansed by violent rubbing he needed it badly at least judging by the amount of black stuff that rolled from his skin under the operator ﬁngers the attendants too barring were naked with perspiration streaming down my cheeks i took the photographs here reproduced and then proceeded to yet hotter small suffocating place one may wish to enter in one lifetime or after one received positive scorching blow in the face one entered it the heat was so great this is the last chamber and in corner is tap of cold water with which the skin is repeatedly rinsed and made to sweat several times until the pores are considered absolutely clean there were two people lying down in state and although i was only there few minutes i came out quite limp and it ruined my watch and only by very careful nursing i was able to save my camera from falling to pieces on returning to the previous hot chamber it seemed quite cool by comparison and when we emer ged again into the open air thermometer about in the shade one felt quite chilled the various trade caravanserais of which there were over dozen in kerman on either side of the main bazaar street were quite interesting they were large courts with high platforms six to ten feet high all round them the centre well enclosed by them being tightly packed with camels mules and donkeys above on the broad platform lay all the packs of merchandise which had arrived from birjand and afghanistan from beluchistan or from india via bandar abbas the shops and the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https were neat and had in front with gigantic padlocks of primitive make some however had neat little english padlocks the i nterior of h ammam or b ath irst r oom the most interesting to us but not the most beautiful was the hindoo caravanserai where some forty british hindoo merchants carried on their commerce the place looked old and untidy and the shops overcrowded with cheap articles of foreign make such are commonly to be seen in india parafﬁn lamps knives enamelled ware cotton goods indigo tea sugar and calicos being prominent in the shops the piece goods come mostly from germany and austria the cottons from manchester the hindoos were very civil and entertained us to tea water melon and huge tray of sweets while crowd outside gazed at the unusual sight of europeans visiting the caravanserais the merchants said that the trade in cotton wool gum and dates was fairly good and that taking things all round matters went well but they had great many would not be hindoos if they had petty quarrels to be settled among themselves and with the persians these of course arose mostly out of matters of money they seemed otherwise quite jolly and happy notwithstanding the exaggerated hats and curious costumes they are compelled to wear so that they may be distinguished at glance from the persians themselves here too has been already said there is small parsee community of about souls they are however rather scattered nowadays and are not so prominent in yezd the side streets leading out of the bazaar are narrow and dingy covered up in places with awnings and matting there is very little else worth seeing in the city but the many ruins to the east of the town and the ancient fortiﬁcations are well worth visit it is to the east of the city that the ancient fortiﬁcations are found on the most western portion of the barrier of mountains according to some natives the smal ler fort the dukhtar or virgin fort on the terminal point of the range at one time formed part of ancient kerman the fort the is on the ridge of the hill with fairly castellated wall and lar ge doorway in the perpendicular rock at the end of the hill range in long semicircular wall at the foot of the hill row of niches can be seen but whether these made part of an ancient stable horses or were used other purposes i could not quite ascertain some people said that they were portion of hammam others said they might have been cells of prison but what remained of them was not sufﬁcient to allow one to come to satisfactory conclusion the h ot r oom in p ersian b ath the k ala i ukht ar or v irgin f ort the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https kala ardeshir on summit of mountain kerman the outside wall of the fort was very high and had strong battlements and towers inside the lower wall at the foot of the hill was moat from to thirty feet wide and ﬁfteen feet deep the upper wall went along the summit of two ridges and was parallel to the lower one which had four large circular turrets and extended down to and over the ﬂat some 120 yards there was another extensive but much demolished fortress to the east of this on the lower part of the hill range guarding the other side of the entrance of the pass and this too had two large walled enclosures in the plain at its foot great many fragments of pottery with angular geometrical patterns and small circles upon them were to be found here and in the neighbourhood the fort of is attributed by the people to king ardishir and is one of the three mentioned by mukaddasi in the tenth century who in describing the city of bardasir unmistakably identiﬁed with the present kerman speaks of the three famous impregnable hisn defended by ditch evidently the one above described directly outside the city gate and the old castle the on the crest of the hill it has been assumed that the third castle mentioned by mukaddasi was where the ark or citadel is now but personally i doubt whether this is correct the citadel the residence of the present governor is to my mind of much more recent origin there is every sign to make one doubt whether kerman extended in those days far west the citadel which occupies the most western point outside the city whereas in the accounts of mukaddasi one would be led to understand that the third fortress was well within the city near great mosque in persian chronicles too the hill castle the old and the new castles are often referred to but personally i believe that these three castles were adjoining one another on the same chain of hills an ascent to the kala ardeshir well repays the trouble of getting there it is not possible to reach the castle from the south side where the rocky hills are very precipitous and even from the north it is not easy of access on the side facing the british consulate there is somewhat narrow and slippery track in the rock along ravine by many places on all fours can get up to the top the gateway is very much blocked with sand but squeezing through small aperture one can get inside the wall within which are several small courts and series of small buildings in the walls can still be seen some of the receptacles in which grain and food were formerly stored gravey ard and k ala i ukht ar or v irgin f ort k erman although the exterior of the castle resting on the solid rock and built of ied bricks so welded together by age to form solid mass appears in fair preservation from distance when one examines the interior it is found to be in dreadful state of decay the courts and spaces between the walls are now ﬁlled up with sand there is well of immense depth bored in the rock the fort standing some ﬁve hundred feet above the plain but although this is said by some writers to have been way of escape from this fortress to distant place khabis some miles the crow ﬂies to the east of kerman i never heard this theory expounded in kerman itself but in any case it is rather strange that the well should have been made so small in diameter hardly to allow the passage of man its shaft being bored absolutely perpendicular hundreds and hundreds of feet and its sides perfectly smooth so that an attempt to go down it would be not way of escape from death but positive suicide the well was undoubtedly made to supply the fort with water whenever it became impracticable to use the larger wells and tanks constructed at the foot of the hills within the fortiﬁcation walls chapter xliv the deserted city of afghan surrenders to agha muhammed cruel to the afghan khan thousand human omen in stiff rock pilgrimage sterile russian persian trials of persian fruit garden the very large deserted city of farmidan lies directly south of the mountainous crescent on which are found the fortiﬁcations described in the previous chapter the houses of the city not appear very ancient their walls being in excellent preservation but not so the domed roofs which have nearly all fallen in the houses are entirely constructed of mud bricks now quite soldered together by age and reduced into compact mass few of the more important dwellings have two storeys and all the buildings evidently had formerly domed roofs in order that the conformation of each house may be better understood plan of one typical building is given on larger or smaller scale they all resembled one another very closely and were not unlike the persian houses of the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https was broad main road at the foot of the mountains along the southern side of which the city had been built with narrow and tortuous streets leading out of the principal thoroughfare curiously enough however this city appeared not to have had wall round it like most other cities one sees in persia it is possible that the inhabitants relied on taking refuge in the strength and safety of the forts above but more probable seems the theory that farmidan was mere settlement place of refuge of the zoroastrians who had survived the terrible slaughter by agha muhammed khan it may be remembered that when the afghan determined to regain his throne or die he came over the persian frontier from kandahar he crossed the salt desert from sistan losing thousands of men horses and camels on the way and with large army still under his command eventually occupied kerman kerman was in those days most ﬂourishing commercial centre with bazaars renowned their beauty and wealth and its forts were well manned and considered impregnable so unexpected however was the appearance of such large army that the inhabitants made resistance and readily bowed to the sovereignty of agha muhammed they were brutally treate d by the oppressors hastened from the coast to the relief of the city and ﬁercely attacked and defeated the afghan invader who was compelled to retreat to kandahar but kerman city which had under gone terrible oppression from the entry of the afghans fared better at the hands of the persians the zoroastrians of kerman particularly were massacred wholesale or compelled to adopt the mahommedan religion it is not i assume responsibility the at that time the zoroastrians who were still numerous in kerman driven from their homes by the invading afghan and persian armies settled few miles from the city unable to proceed further aﬁeld owing to the desolate nature of the country all round with animals means of subsistence it would have been impossible them with their families to go much further en masse in country where food and even water are not easily obtainable the name of the would point to the conclusion that it had been inhabited by fars and the age attributed to the city by the natives corresponds roughly with the epoch of the afghan invasion to the north of kerman city we have another similar settlement now deserted corruption of guebre of which there is little doubt that it was inhabited by zoroastrians one of the reasons that these cities are now deserted may be found in the fact that agha muhammed having raised another army in afghanistan proceeded second time to the conquest of persia the zoroastrians who had fared worse at the hands of than under the afghan rule were persuaded to join agha muhammed against their oppressors in hopes of obtaining some relief to their misery but history does not relate what became of them they were never heard of again one fact only is known that very few of those living in kerman at the time succeeded in escaping massacre that previous to this the zoroastrians must have been very numerous in kerman can be judged by the remains of many to be seen especially in the neighbourhood of the city ruined h ouses of f armit an plan of h ouse at f armit an in his second invasion of persia agha muhammed again reached kerman in 1795 and besieged the city defended by the inhabitants who had suffered at the hands of their saviours much if not more than at those of their oppressors made resistance and eventually in the thick of the ﬁghting the city gates were opened by treachery and handful of his faithful men fought like lions in the streets of the city but at last seeing that all hope of victory had vanished and forsaken by most of his men rode full gallop in the midst of the afghans according to chronicles he deﬁantly ran the gauntlet with only three followers and the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https able to force their way through the kajar post and escape to the most eastern part of the kerman province on the borders of sistan agha muhammed demanded the surrender of the city was searched to ﬁnd him and when it was learned that he had succeeded in effecting an escape the wrath of the afghan knew bounds the people having declared that they could not ﬁnd he ordered eyes of the inhabitants to be brought to him on trays and is said to have counted them himself with the point of dagger but this punishment he believed to be still too lenient general mass acre of the men was commanded and less than women and children were made into slaves to this day the proverbially easy morals of the kerma n women are attributed to the afghan invasion when the women became the concubines of soldiers and lost all respect themse lves and so is the importation of the dreadful disease which in its most virulent form is pitifully common in great portion of the population of the present kerman city according to some the city was razed to the ground but whether this was so or not there is doubt that kerman has never recovered from the blow received and from the subsequent oppression at the hands of this barbarous conqueror in the part of the mountainous crescent are three very low passes by which the hill range can be crossed one pass between the and the forts one between the and the ruins south of it along the southern continuation of the range and the third at the most southern point of the crescent where the precipitous rocky s are separated by narrow gap level with the ﬂat plains on either side one can still see the remains of ruined wall on the east side of this entrance round outpost mud turret with other building s and large walled enclosure directly outside the pass on the ﬂat to the south while on the lower slope of the eastern mountain stands tall square building now rooﬂess erected on strong quadrangular base with corner turrets it has three pointed arch doorways east west south almost tall the building itself and by the side of these are found high and broad windows in couples this building appears to be of much more recent date than the underlying castle ﬁlled up with earth on which it stands it has rather the appearance of ﬁre temple on going through the pass we ﬁnd ourselves in the centre basin formed by the mountainous crescent and here we have another deserted settlement smaller than farmidan also to all appearance not more than century old and directly under the lee of the precipitous rocky mountain high building of rich colour with dome of stone and latter said to have been mixed with camel milk which gives the mortar greater to be seen here this too is supposed to have been ﬁre temple its base is quadrangular with two tiers of three windows each small lateral wall is next to the entrance but nothing is to be seen in the interior except the bare walls east of this on the face of the cliff and several hundred feet above the valley one is shown gigantic inscription ya ali in white characters depicted on the rock the letters are so big that they can be seen from kerman about three miles off this is pilgrimage well worth making they say every wish of those who climb up to the inscription will come true two qualities are very steady head and the agility of monkey the angle of the rock is very steep almost vertical can be seen on the left side of the photograph which i took from the site of the inscription looking down upon the ruined city and the whole kerman plain the only way by which all fours can climb up is so worn greasy and slippery owing to the many pilgrims who have glided up and down that it is most difﬁcult to get grip on the rock yet the is much easier than the coming down the illustration shows the man who accompanied just about to reach the inscription took the photograph i clung to the rock just below him can be seen from the distortion of his lower limbs caused by my being unable to select suitable position from which to take the photograph we were then clinging to the rock with drop below us in straight line of several hundred feet we reached the inscription safely enou gh and sat on the edge of the only place where we could our legs dangling over it screened we were in deep shadow we obtained magniﬁcent eye view of the kerman plain brilliantly lighted by the morning sun and of the forts to our left and the many ruins down below between ourselves and kerman city bed of stream now dry wound its way from these mountains to almost the centre of the plain where it lost itself in the sand beyond cluster of ruined buildings undoubtedly at some previous time this torrent carried good volume of water to the village and this accounts the deserted settlement being found there the letters of the inscription were ten feet high painted white s teep r ock c limb k erman photograph of guide taken by the author on reaching the inscription several hundred feet above the the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https man who had climbed up with related an amusing incident of the occasion when the governor of the city was persuaded to climb to inspect the inscription hauled up with the assistance of ropes and servants he became so nervous when he reached the inscription and looked down upon the precipice below that he offered huge reward if they took him down again alive although otherwise brave man he was unaccustomed to mountaineering and owing to the great height had been seized with vertigo and was absolutely helpless and unable to move with considerable difﬁculty he was hauled down and safely conveyed to his palace the descent presented more difﬁculty than the ascent and one shoes had to be removed to effect it in more safety eventually we reached the bottom again where in gully is small ruined temple and mud hut or two great many women who from this point had been watching us come down along the face of the cliff stampeded away giggling at our approach and on my asking why so many representatives of the fair sex were to be found were lots more dotting the landscape below in their white or black chudders all conver ging towards this was explained that few yards off was rock possessing marvellous properties the rock in question forms part of the and in its natural formation coarsely suggests much magniﬁed the efﬁgy of component of feminine anatomy at the foot of it there was an inscription and certain offerings while above it in recess large wax candle was burning near this stone stunted tree was to be seen laden with bits of red and white rags and various kinds of most unedifying sight this is pilgrimage sterile women who after certain exorcisms in front of and on the divine stone and night or two spent in the neighbouring ruins are said infallibly to become proliﬁc the neighbouring ruins it should be added are the favourite night resort of the kerman young men in search of romantic adventure and most convenient rendezvous ﬂirtations but whether the extraordinary qualities of proliﬁcness are really due to the occult power of the magic stone or to the less mystic charms of nights spent away from home the reader is doubt better able to discriminate than judging by the long strings of ladies of all ages to be seen going on the pilgrimage one would almost come to the conclusion that half the women of kerman are in bad plight or else that the other half only is good lot much unsuspected amusement was provided to the natives by russian political agent who had visited kerman few weeks before i did with the was starting consulate there and caravanserai to further russian trade previous to his departure attracted merely by the lovely view from the pilgrimage stone and absolutely unaware of what misconstruction might be placed on his hospitality the russian gave picnic at this spot to the tiny european community of kerman needless to say the ded persians of course put wrong construction upon the whole thing and good deal of merriment was caused among the may lack many other qualities but not the sahibs going en masse to the pilgrimage the russian picnic was the talk of the bazaar when i was there and will probably remain so some little time we will now leave ruins and puzzling pilgrimages alone and will accept an invitation to substantial persian dinner with known by the title of and probably the richest man in the province of kerman at great expense and trouble this man bought an english carriage the pleasure of driving in which he actually made road several miles long he kindly sent the carriage the consul and to drive to his place and had relays of horses way on the road so that we could gallop the whole way he has planted trees all along the new road and brought water down from the hills by canal along the roadside in order to provide sufﬁcient moisture to make them grow when we reached was the name of the village close to which our host country residence alighted at most beautiful avenue of high trees on either side of long tank of limpid water in which gracefully ﬂoated dozens of swans and ducks we were met at the gate by our host charming old fellow and his son mahommed ali khan most intelligent young man surrounded by crowd of servants we were shown round the beautiful garden with its rare plants from all parts of the world its ﬂowers and its fruit trees of every imaginable kind there was handsome house built in style and with european furniture in it on table in the were spread great many trays of sweets after the usual compliments dinner was brought in by long row of attendants who carried tray after tray full of delicacies part of which they deposited on the table the rest on the ﬂoor our host with much modesty asked us to sit at the table and he and his persian friends sat themselves on the ﬂoor consul the two other englishmen reside nts of kerman and myself to take advantage of his offer and declared that we should all sit on the ﬂoor in the best persian style an atten tion which was greatly appreciated by our host and by his friends it was with some dismay that i saw more trays of food being conveyed into the room until the whole ﬂoor was absolutely covered with trays large and small and dishes cups and saucers all of something or other to eat v iew of the k erman p lain from the y li i nscription the project

so clean and tasty the fruit of central and southern persia it is eminently excellent and plentiful the persians themselves eat with their ﬁngers which they duly wash before beginning their meals but we were given silver forks and spoons and best english knives really to enjoy persian meal however one ﬁngers are quite unapproachable by any more civilised device the most sensible part of persian meal is its comparative lack of method and order anybody picking wherever he likes from the many dishes displayed in the centre of the room and all round him but any one endowed with digestive organs

trying to emulate it we all suffered considerably so pressing were our hosts to make us eat some of this and some of that and to taste some of the other that by the time we had ﬁnished we were all in state an attendant passed round brass bowl and poured upon our ﬁngers from graceful amphora tepid water with scent then our host very considerately had us led to the upper ﬂoor of the building to deliciously cool room wherein were soft silk broad divans with velvet pillows five minutes later one in each corner of the room we were all fast asleep it is the custom in persia to have siesta after one needs it badly when one is asked out to dinner so couple of hours we were left to ourselves while our hosts retired to their rooms then more tea was brought more cof fee more sweets we paid an interesting visit to the village of fatabad the older portion of which formerly called rustamabad had from distance the appearance of strongly fortiﬁed place it had high broad wall with four circular towers at the corners and quite an imposing gateway the interior of the village was curious the habitations being adjacent to the village wall all round and each room having perforated dome over it there was spacious stabling on one side horses and several irregular courts in the centre of the village long wall stretched from this village to the fatabad gardens and palatial dwelling of and on one side of this wall were nicely kept wheat ﬁelds while on the other lay capital fruit the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https the new village of fatabad

kittens and the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https charms of camel among mountains my intention was to cross the salt desert in an almost easterly direction by the route from khabis to neh which seemed the most direct route from kerman to the afghan frontier but on mentioning my project to the consul and his persian assistant khan they dissuaded from attempting it declaring it impossible to get across in the autumn why it was impossible i could not quite ascertain each man from whom i inquired giving different reason but the fact remained that it was impossible the governor of kerman all the highest ofﬁcials in the town told that it could not be done till three or four months later when the afghan camels would come over laden with butter by that route even faithful sadek whom i had despatched to the bazaar to get camels at all costs returned with long face after whole day absence and the ﬁrst time since he was in my employ had to change his invariable answer of sahib have got to bitterly disappointing sahib can get delay was predicted on all hands of at least month or two in kerman before i could possibly obtain camels to cross the desert in any direction towards the east the tantalising trials of arranging caravan were not small i offered to purchase camels but camel driver could be induced to accompany offers of treble pay and bakshish had effect and i found myself in serious dilemma when camel man appeared on the scene his high terms were then and there accepted everything that he asked was conceded when suddenly probably believing that all this was too good to come true he backed out of the bargain and positively refused to go had i chosen to go by the southern route skirting the desert via bam the difﬁculty would not have been so great but that route is very easy and had been followed by several europeans at dif ferent times and i declined to go that way i was beginning to despair when sadek who had spent another day hunting in the various caravanserais entered my room and with broad grin on his generally stolid countenance proclaimed that he had found some good camels to corroborate his words clumsy and footed camel man with face which by association had become like that of the beasts he led was shoved forward into the room he was striking ﬁgure with an ugly but singularly honest countenance his eyes staring and abnormally opened almost eyes of man who evidently lived during the night and slept during the day his mouth stretched with exaggeration from ear to ear and displayed double row of powerful white teeth what was lacking in quantity of nose was made up by superabundance of malformed shapeless ears which projected at the sides of his head like two wings when his legs were pour façon parler were still some six inches apart and similar space was noticeable between each of his arms and his body unmistakably this fellow was the very picture of clumsiness he seemed so much distracted by the various articles of furniture in the consul room that one could get coherent answer from him and his apprehension gave way to positive terror when he was addressed in ﬂowing language by the various high ofﬁcials who were then calling on the consul their ways of persuasion by threats and promises alarmed the camel man to such an extent that his eyes roamed about all over the place palpably to ﬁnd way to effect an escape he was however so clumsy at it that the consul servants and soldiers checked him in time and sadek broke in with one of his usual ﬂows of words at the top of his voice which however could hardly be heard amid the vigorous eloquence of the persians present who all spoke at the same time and at an equally high pitch with sinking heart i closely watched the camel man in whom rested my faint and last hope of crossing the salt desert he looked so terror that when he was asked about his camels the desert the amount of pay required he sulkily mumbled that he had camels knew nothing whatever about the desert and did not wish to receive any pay why then did you come here i did not come here but you are here i want to go away yes sahib cried the chorus of persians he has the camels he knows the desert only he is frightened he has never spoken to sahib before here young hindoo merchant mul chan dilaram entered the room and with obsequious salaams to the company assured that he had brought this camel man to and that when he had got over his ﬁrst fears i should ﬁnd him an excellent man while we were all listen ing to the hindoo assurances the camel man made bolt the door and escaped fast he could lay his legs to the ground towards the city he was chased by the soldiers and after some time was dragged back why did you run away he was asked sahib he replied almost crying i am only man of the desert my only friends are my camels please have pity on then you have camels and you know the desert you have said so in your own words the camel man had to agree and on being assured that he would be very well paid and treated and have new pair of shoes given him and much tea brewed him on the road with much sugar in it his capacity would endure he at last said he would come the hindoo with great cunning at once seized the hand of the camel man in his own and made him swear that death should descend upon himself his camels and his family if he should break his word or give any trouble the camel man swore an agreement was hastily drawn up before he had time to change his mind and handsome advance in solid silver was pressed into his hands to make the agreement good and to allay his feelings when requested to sign the document the camel man who had sounded the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https on the doorstep and to his eviden t surprise found them all good gaily dipped his thumb into the inkstand and afﬁxed his natural mark ﬁne smudge upon the valuable paper and licked up the surplus ink with his tongue the man undertook to provide the necessary camels and saddles and to take across the salt desert in direction the only way by which he said it was possible to cross the lut the year having been rainless and nearly all the wells being dry it would take from to days to get across and most of the journey would be waterless or with brackish water skins had to be provided to carry our own supply of water whole day was spent in preparing the journey and when november 4th came shortly before midnight my provisions were packed upon my camels with an extra load of fowls and one of fruit while on the hump of the last came l of my caravan were perched in wooden box made comfortable with straw and two pretty persian kittens aged respectively three weeks and four weeks which i had purchased in kerman and which we shall see lived through great many adventures and sufferings and actually reached london safe and sound proving themselves to be the most wonderful and agreeable little travelling companions imaginable one was christened kerman the other zeris kerman and z eris the two kittens who accompanied author on his wanderings the persian cat everybody knows possesses long soft silky coat with beautiful tail and ruff similar to the cats known in europe angora which possess probably longer hair on the body the persian cats too have longer pencil of hair on the ears than domestic cats and have somewhat the appearance and the motions of wild cats but if properly treated are gentleness itself and possess the most marvellous intelligence unlike cats of most other nationalities they seem to enjoy moving from place to place and adapt themselves to fresh localities with the greatest ease if fed entirely on plenty of raw meat and water they are extremely gentle and affectionate and never wish to leave you the reason that many persian still possess some of the qualities of wild grow savage and leave their homes being principally because of the lack of raw meat which causes them to go ahunting to procure it themselves the cat it should be remembe red is carnivorous animal and is not particularly happy when fed on vegetable diet more than we people are when invited to vegetarian dinner isfahan is the city from which persian cats the burak are brought down to the gulf and from there to india but the kerman cats are said by the persians themselves to be the best the white ones are the most appreciated by the persians then the blue grey ones with differently coloured eyes and the tabby ones mine were one perfectly white the other tabby at midnight i said to major phillott whose kind hospitality i had enjoyed four days and began my slow and dreary march on swung too and fro till one feels that one spine is breaking in two we wound our way down from the consulate at zeris skirted the town now asleep and in dead silence and then turned among the barren kupayeh mountains we had ﬁne moonlight and had i been on horse instead of camel i should probably have enjoyed looking at the scenery but what with the abnormal persian dinner to which i had been treated in the afternoon see vol i with the unpleasant swing of the camel and the monotonous dingle of the camels became so very sleepy that i could not keep my eyes open there is very little style to be observe d about riding camel and one only aim must be to be comfortable which is easier said than done camels have so many ways of their own and these ways are so varied that it is really difﬁcult to strike happy medium sadek had made kind of spacious platform on my saddle by piling on it carpets blankets and mattress and on the high butt of the saddle in front he had fastened pillow folded in two we wended our way along the foot of one hill and then another while nothing particularly striking appeared in the scenery i thought i would utilise what comfort i had within reach and resting my head on the pillow through which one still felt the hard wooden fram of the saddle and with one leg and arm dangling loose on each side of the saddle i slept soundly all through the night every now and then the camel stumbled or gave sudden jerk which nearly made one tumble off the high perch but otherwise this was really delightful way of passing the long dreary hours of the night we marched some nine hours and having gone over low pass across the range halted near tiny spring of fairly good water here we were at the entrance of an extensive valley with small village in the centre our way however lay to the of the valley along the mountains we were at an elevation of feet or 800 feet above the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https heat of the day was so great that we halted giving the camels chance of grazing on what tamarisks they could ﬁnd during indeed camels are troublesome animals they must not eat after sundown or it makes them they are let loose on arrival at camp and they drift away in search of lichens or other shrub at sunset they are driven back to camp where they kneel down and ruminate to their hearts content until it is time the caravan to start the heavy wooden saddles with heavy padding under them are not removed from the camel hump while the journey lasts and each camel has among other of tassels and shells one or more brass bells which are useful in ﬁnding the camels again when strayed too far in grazing we left at midnight and crossed the wide valley with the village of 1 four miles from our last camp again we came among mountains and entered narrow gorge the night was bitterly cold we caught up large caravan and the din of the camels bells and the hoarse groans of the camels who were quite out of breath going up the incline made the night lively one the sounds being magniﬁed and echoed from mountain to mountain every now and then halt had to be called to give the camels rest and the camel men spread their felt overcoats upon the ground and lay down ﬁve or ten minutes to have sleep then the long string of camels would proceed again up the hill the camels urged by the strange cries and songs of the men this part of the journey being mountainous one came across three little streams of water and at each the camel man urged to drink much i could because he said the time will come when we shall see water at all days at time we were gradually rising the camels panting dreadfully and had got up to feet when we camped near the village of few small domed hovels ﬁeld or two and cluster of trees along brook we were still among the kupayeh mountains with the kurus peak towering directly above us chapter ii fifty miles from not made climbing godar khorassunih olcanic variegated omen and their ways on november 6th we were some ﬁfty miles from kerman

start and the weird ﬁgure of the stooped over to say it was time to depart hrrrr hrrrr spoke the to each camel by which the animals understood they must kneel down the loads were quickly fastened on the saddles the kittens lazily stretched themselves and yawned they were removed from their warm nooks and sadek in moment packed up all my bedding on my saddle we continued to ascend much to the evident discomfort of the camels who were quite unhappy when going up or down hill it was really ridiculous to see these huge clumsy brutes quite done up even on the gentlest incline the track went up and up in zigzag and curves the cries of the drivers were constantly urging on the perplexed animals and the dingle of the smaller bells somewhat enlivened the slow monotonous of the huge cylindrical two and half feet high and one foot in to the load of the last camel and mournfully resounding in the valley down below and we swung and swung on the camels humps in the beautiful starlight moon had not yet several occasions going across narrow passages with drop unde r us of considerable depth where one earnestly hoped the quivering legs of the timid camels would not give way or perchance stumble the higher we got the more the camels panted and roared and the cries of the drivers were doubled one farsakh and half from our last camp we reached at 2 the top of the godar khorassunih pass and we had to halt while to let the camels rest the cold was bitter camels and men were trembling all over then came the descent camel riding is comfortable at time it is passable on the ﬂat just bearab le going up hill but dreadful going down fairly steep incline the wretched beasts assumed kind of hopping jerky motion on their front legs with good deal of spring in their knees which bumped the rider to such an extent that it seemed almost if all the bones in one body began to get disjointed and rattle when the camel happened to stumble among the rocks and loose stones the sudden jerk was so painful that it took some seconds to recover from the ache it caused in one spine the moon rose shortly after we had gone over the pass we were wending our way from one narrow gorge into another between high rocks and cliffs and mountains of most fantastic forms we passed the little village of huruh and at dawn the picturesqueness of the scenery increased tenfold when the cold bluish tints of the moon gradually vanished in the landscape and ﬁrst the mountains became capped and then lighted all over with warm brilliant reddish tints their edge appearing sharply cut against the clear glowing golden sky behind them we were now proceeding along dry wide river bed which had on one side tiny stream few inches broad of water dripping along evident signs could be noticed that during the torrential storms of the rainy season this bed must occasionally carry large volumes of water foot track can be perceived on either side some twelve feet above the bed which is followed by caravans when the river is in ﬂood we now entered volcanic region with high perpendicular rocks to our right that seemed if they had under gone the action of long periods of ﬁre or excessive heat then we emer ged into large basin in which the vegetation struck one being quite luxuriant by contrast with the barren country we had come through there were few old and healthy trees on the edge of the thread of water the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https tamarisks in profusion on our left where the gorge narrowed again between the mountains was large ﬂow of solid green lava in this basin was quaint little 2 actually boasting of ﬂour and curious rock dwellings which the natives inhabit we continued and entered broader valley also of volcanic formation with reddish sediments burying of yellowish brown rock which appeared in the section of the mountains some 300 feet above the plain to the stood lofty variegated mountain the higher part of which was of dark brown in horizontal stratum while the lower was slanting layer of deep red in the valley there was some cultivation of wheat and i noticed some plum apple ﬁg and pomegranate trees one particularly ancient tree of enormous proportions stood near the village and under its refreshing shade i spent the day the village quaint structure with ruined curiously built in the interior on the ﬁrst storey of the large tower were to be found several humble huts and other similar ones stood behind to the north these huts were domed and so low hardly to allow person to stand erect inside some had an opening in the dome most had only single aperture the door the majority of the inhabitants seemed quite derelict and lived in the most abject poverty few yards of the castle were some rock habitations there were three large chambers dug in the rock side by side two of one single room and one of two rooms en suite the largest room measured twenty feet by twelve and was some six feet high in the interi or were receptacles apparently storing grain the doorway was quite low and the heat inside suffocating curiously enough one or two of these chambers were not quite straight but formed an elbow into the mountain side at the sides of the row of cliff dwellings were two smaller doors giving acces s to storehouses also dug in the rock i was told that the natives migrated to this village during the winter months from october till one month after the persian new year while they spend the remaind er of the year higher up on the mountains owing to the inten heat firewood which is scarce is stored piled up on the top of roofs whence little at time is taken down fuel and prominent in front of the village was coarse and pen sheep wolves were said to be plentiful in the neighbourhood and i was sitting down writing my notes shepherd boy ran into the tower to say that wolf had killed one of his sheep both from men and beasts there seemed to be little safety near the village according to the natives who invariably took their matchlocks with them when they went to work in their ﬁelds even few yards away from the castle one peculiarity of this village which stood at an altitude of feet was that nobody seemed to know its name the people themselves said that it had name but whether they were afraid of telling in their suspicions that some future evil might come upon them or other reasons i can not say the natives were certainly rather original in their appearance their ways and speech and i comfortably sat under the big tree and watched them coming in and out of the they interested much donkeys in pairs were taken in and out of the gate to convey manure to the ﬁelds and old men and young came in and out carrying their spades and matchlocks even little boys were armed the men reminded one very forcibly both in features and attire of the ﬁgures in ancient egyptian sculptures of which they were the very image they wore felt skull caps the side locks of jet black hair cut straight across they had necks and lumpy black beards their tall bodies were slender with short waists and their wiry feet showed beneath ample ample almost to approach divided skirt the children were pretty and although miserably clothed looked the very picture of health and suppleness the women of whom number sat the whole day perched on the domed roofs of their huts to watch the doings of the ferenghi showed their faces fully and although professing to be mussulman made attempt whatever at concealment they wore picturesque light blue and red kerchiefs on the head and shoulders falling into point behind and held fast in position round the skull by small black and blue turban pin held the two sides of the kerchief together under the chin the women were garbed in short pleated blue skirts reaching just below the knee and short loose coat of the same cotton material with side slits and ample sleeves they had bare legs well proportioned and straight with handsome ankles and long feet and toes when working they went about footed but when their daily occupations were ﬁnished put on small slippers they were particularly to be admired when they walked which they did to perfection looking most attractively picturesque when carrying jugs of water on the head the head had to be then kept very erect and gave becoming curve to the neck and most gracefu l swing to the waist long black cloak not unlike chudder was worn over the head after sunset when the air was turning cold the women did all the hard work and seemed to put their whole soul into it some gaily spun wool on their wheels and others worked at small neat but primitive weaving looms which were erected on the top storey of the castle affectionate mothers carefully searched the hair of the heads of their remove therefrom all superﬂuous animal life to my dismay i discovered that their went so far not to destroy the captured brutes which were merely picked up most gently so not to injure them and ﬂung down from the wall on the top of which this operation took place there were other people sitting quite unconc erned down below doubt this provided good deal of perpetual occupation to the women of the castle and the parasites were provided with constant change of abode probably what astonished most was to see young damsel climb up tall tree in the best monkey fashion with successively superposed arms and legs stiff and straight not round the tree mind you and using her toes the purpose with almost equal ease her ﬁngers the of the men was interesting they wore clogs held fast to the foot by

moun tains until we reached pass above the sea after which we came upon the abandoned caravanserai of abid pronounced obit on descending the way was between high vertical rocks and then we found ourselves among hills of most peculiar formation the sun was about to rise and the fantastic in some places not unlike sharp teeth of gigantic saw in others recalled stonehenge and the pillar remains of temples of druids in this case they were of course entirely of natural formation although there was water in the valley into which we had descended we camped here owing to the camels being very tired and i took the opportunity of climbing to neighbouring hill in order to obtain panoramic view of the surrounding country to the whence we had come were low and comparatively mountains with two narrow valleys separated by tortuous hill range to the of my camp was high and most impressive mountain the upper portion of which appeared at ﬁrst almost of basaltic formation with vertical quadrangular columns while the lower portion of the mountain evidently accumulated at later period and slanting at an angle of displayed distinct strata of light brown deep band of grey then dark brown light brown thin layer of grey and then gradation of beautiful warm burnt sienna colour getting richer and richer in tone towards the base here at the bottom all round the mount ain and in appearance not unlike the waves of choppy sea in shallow water rose hundreds of pointed hillocks the point of each hillock being invariably turned in direction away from the mountain and these were formed not of sand but by much stratum of black burnt slate at an angle of in relation to an imaginary horizontal plane author s c ara van and thers h alting in the d eser t it was most curious to ﬁnd these enormous layers of black slate here they were quite different in character from the whole country around about two miles further off we had instance range of mountains of quite different type not at all broken up nor with sharp cutting edges but quite nicely rounded off between this range and the high peculiar mountain which i have just the ﬂat to be seen some curious hillocks apparently formed by water was the way towards birjand ﬁrst across long ﬂat plain bounded before us by low greyish hills beyond which high leker sublime two mountain masses of fair height stood in front of this range one on the left of the track the other with white sediment of salt at its base while beyond could be distin guished long topped mountain with peculiar white horizontal band half way up it like huge chalk mark all along its entire length of several miles this mountain appeared to be some thirty miles off the mountain mass to the showed picturesque characteristics but more mountain somewhat similar to the one to our stood between my camp and the range beyond i have already stated we had come along dry river bed and from my high point of vantage i could see its entire course to the est it ran in tortuous manner until it absolutely lost itself in the ﬂat desert the long separating the parallel valleys from to appeared to owe its formation to the action of water the surface pebbles even at the summit of it being well rounded and worn quite smooth many with grooves in them near my camp i came across some very curious imprints in the hard rock like lava there were some rocks hollowed out in fantastic way if the hollows had been formed by some softer matter having been enclosed in the rock and having gradually disappeared and also perfect cast of large tibia bone on other rocks were footprints of large animals evidently made when the lava was soft on returning to camp i found general row going on between sadek and the camel own and those of the other caravan who had asked permission to travel with there was water at this camp and only salt water could be procured in small quantities some distance away the intense heat had played havoc with some of my fresh provisions and we unfortunately had an accident to the load of eggs which were all destroyed great many of the chickens too had gone bad and we were running rather short of fresh food the caravan men said that it was impossible to go on because this being such dry year even the few brackish wells across the desert would be dry and they refused to come on the greater part of the evening was spent in except myself shouting himself hoarse at midnight the usual hour of our departure the camel men refused to pack the loads and continue across the desert at 1 they were preparing to leave to return to kerman

come back to their senses i duly entertained each of them to cup of tea brewed with what salt water we had got on ﬁre of camel dung and at 2 we pro ceeded on our course quietly possible if nothing had happened we still followed the dry river bed among hills getting lower and lower about three miles on either side of us and at last we entered vast plain we went some twelve miles when by the side of some low hillocks of sand and pebbles we came upon caravanserai and an older and smaller structure large covered tank of rain water almost empty which is conveyed here from the hills twelve miles of f by means of small canal to the we could still see the mountain under which we had camped the previous day and all around us were distant mountains the ﬂat plain stretching miles on every side had deep grooves cut into it by water ﬂowi ng down from the during the torrential rains and eventually losing themselves in the sand on the english and some of the german maps these dry grooves are marked large and important rivers but this is mistake there is not drop of water in any of them at any time of the year except during heavy storms when the drainage of the mountains is immediately carried down by these channels and lost in the desert it is more right to mark these channels rivers than it would be to see piccadilly marked on map of london foaming torrent because during heavy shower the surplus water not absorbed by the wood pavement had run down it half an inch deep until the rain stopped to the we saw much more clearly than the day before the extensive salt deposits at the base of the mountains and to the grey mountain with ﬂuted top high mountain mass stretched from the south to the est and then there was wide opening into another ﬂat sandy plain far far beyond this distant range of high mountains could hardly be distinguished storm was raging in that direction and veiled the view with curtain of dirty yellowish grey this caravanserai called haoz panch or fifth water altitude was built by some charitable person to protect caravans during and also to supply them with water which was quite drinkable if one were not too particular and if one did not look at it the caravanserai very solidly built was left to take care of itself there being one in charge of it the kilns erected to bake the bricks with which the caravanserai had been built still stood near it it is rather curious to notice what effect drink of fair water has on the temper of one men my camel man ali murat that was his name was in high spirits and came to fetch to show how he made his bread he was keen to know whether camel men in my country made it the same way i reserved my answer until i had seen his process the hands having been carefully washed ﬁrst ﬂour and water with great lumps of salt were duly mixed together in bowl until reduced into fairly solid paste clean cloth was then spread upon the ground and the paste punched hard upon it with the knuckles care having been taken to sprinkle some dry ﬂour ﬁrst so that the paste should not stick to the cloth when this had gone on considerable time the paste was balanced upon the knuckles and brought gaily bounding to where the hot cinders remained from ﬁre of camel dung which had previously been lighted the ﬂattened paste was carefully laid upon the hot ashes with which it was then covered and left to bake an hour or so when ready ali murat brought piece of the bread to i reluctantly did so not to offend his feelings camel men in your country sahib make good bread this when they cross the lut desert inquired ali murat with an expectant grin from ear to ear we have camel men in my country and camels and lut how could we then get good bread yours really when one tried to forget the process of making it which did not quite appeal to one the bread was not bad you have camels sahib your country exclaimed ali with his eyes fast expanding with surprise why then did you come here we have so much scenery in my country

caravanserai at on november 9th and travelled across the plain all through the night about 4 miles from haoz panch we found an ancient mud caravanserai abandoned and partly ruined we had the hills quite close on our right and we came across good many dry channels cut by water we travelled on the ﬂat all the time but we passed on either side great many low mounds of sand and gravel there was absolutely nothing worth noticing in the night journey until we came to the small villages of heirabad and shoshabad eighteen miles from our last camp two miles further we found ourselves at lawah rawar very large oasis with small town of some three thousand mud huts and ten thousand inhabitants according to native accounts chapter iv lawah or way to the smoking and its ingenious local gentleman the fresh provision ater unhealthy fever is olves in third cat purchased lawah or rawar is in way quite an important centre it is the last place one passes before entering the salt desert proper on the border of which it is situated and is therefore the last spot where provisions and good water can be obtained it has certain amount of local trade and is connected with yezd by very tortuous track via it has possible resting place and we therefore camped just outside the town the natives were not particularly friendly and seemed inclined to give trouble there was considerable excitement when we crossed the town in the morning on our arrival and even more when i went to inspect the city alone in the afternoon there was nothing to see the bazaar in the place being one of the most miserable looking in persia it was not domed over like those of other persian cities but the streets were merely covered with rafters supporting brush wood and rotten mats there were shops proper but various merchants and or sellers of articles caravans had certa in amount of cheap goods within their habitation doors more quaintly interesting were the commercial caravanserais or small squares with receptacles all round travelling merchants to display their goods upon lawah trade is principally transit trade the caravans which occasionally come through the desert taking an opportunity of selling off some of their goods here also of course those that come from yezd or kerman there is some cultivation of wheat and cotton in the immediate neighbourhood and of fruit which is quite excellent the water is not very plentiful can be seen by the hundreds of borings water and disused kanats to the north of the city where most ﬁelds are to be found while the majority of fruit gardens and trees are to the east here everywhere else in persia great portion of the town is uninhabited and in ruins and to the outside the inhabited part can be seen an interesting ruined quadrangular castle with double wall and moat with an outer watch tower besides the corner turrets inside this castle was formerly village another smaller fort also in ruins is situated to the there are great many palm trees within the place and they produce good dates the climate is most unhealthy fever of the desert being rampant great use is made of opium which is smoked to excess by the natives and has very disastrous effects in such an unhealthy climate personally i have ever believed and believe still that opium used in moderation has worse effects upon the headed human beings who choose to make themselves slaves to it than whisky or tobacco but under these particular circumstances and in this particular climate it had undoubtedly most evil effects in just the same way that whisky which is certainly the best drink damp scotland is most injurious to those who make use of it in similar doses in india although i have visited opium dens merely the purpose of observing in almost every asiatic country where opium smoking is practised i have never seen cases quite so depressing here great proportion of the population suffered from fever to allay the sufferings of which opium was used there was of course the usual contingent of sick people visiting my camp to obtain medicine their various fever ken man with cadaverous face and limbs collapsing altogether when reaching and remaining senseless considera ble time i never carry medicine of any kind in my trave ls i was unable to satisfy them but i gave them some little present each which did them just much good beggars too visited

within pile of straw which she had sold the day before to man to feed his camels upon she was to reasoning of her own since i had not yet arrived here the day before nor could she identify the man with any of my rtain that my camels had devoured the sum and i therefore must pay the sum back she was nevertheless sure that i was not to blame in the matter and was willing to waive the claim on the immediate payment of two although it is well to be kind one can to the natives it is never right to allow them to go unpunished playing tricks of all the they were applied charity that day she was the

trimmed with fur with short sleeves not reaching quite to the elbow leaving the arm quite free in its movements and displaying the loose sleeve of the shirt underneath couple of babies were swung in hammocks in the garden and were remarkably quiet when asleep on going walk on the outskirts of the city one found great many fairly high mud hillocks to the east averaging 400 feet there stood hundreds more of these hillocks with taller brown hills the leker kuh behind them and to the west high peak rising to an estimated feet in the mountains the tokrajie mountains of lawah did not seem to rise to more than or feet and extended in direction we could still see the kuh legav mountain at the foot of which we had camped on november 8th to the north was long mountain with white stratum like horizontal stripe up it and the summit was in regular teeth like those of saw another similar but more pointed mountain was to the the white stratum being less horizontal in this portion this curious white stripe in the hills extended over an arc of circle from to we made great purchases of provisions in chickens eggs vegetables and fruit the slaughtered chickens being carefully prepared in layers of salt to make them last long possible then we purchased number of sheep skins to carry further supply of drinking water from this place we were told we should be several days without ﬁnding any

day it was impossible to touch it with one food sadek idea of good cooking was intense ﬂoating in grease and butter so these skins which absorbed all the butter we had were really godsend to far the cuisine of the future was concerned there was something in the climate of lawah that made one feverish and irritable in the afternoon some of the camel men had ﬁght with number of lawah people and later the camel men in body attacked sadek he was very plucky and were heavy but that sadek succeeded with heavy mallet in giving them several cracks on the head but they were eight to one and closed in upon him and were about to give him good hammering i had to rush to his assistance and with the butt of my riﬂe scattered the lot about moment they seemed if they were going to turn on they were very excited and seized whatever they could lay their hands upon in the shape of sticks and stones but i casually put few cartridges in the magazine of my riﬂe and sat down again on my carpets to continue writing my diary they came to beg pardon the trouble they had given and embraced my feet professing great humility four camels of the combined caravans had been taken ill with fever and had to be left behind their cries from pain were pitiful owing to the abundant dinner we got here with lavish supplies of meat delicious ﬁgs pomegranate s and water which we partook more copiously than

possession of and i could feel that i was fast inhaling the miasma of fever the natives shut themselves up inside their sunset they say and sunrise are the times when fever is contracted we were out

heat of the day i had wrapped myself up in my blankets shivering with the fever that had seized quite violently and the kittens were playing about near my bed my men were all sound asleep and only the occasional hoarse roar of the squatted camels all round our camp broke the silence of the night i eventually fell asleep with my hat over my face screening it from the heavy fall of dew suddenly i woke up startled by the kittens dashing under my blankets and sticking their claws into and making fearful racket and also by some other animals snifﬁng my face i jumped up riﬂe in hand indeed there were some wolves visiting our camp most impudent standing on one of my boxes and another had evidently made dash the white cat hence the commotion the wolves bolted when i got could not ﬁre owing to the camels and peop le being all but the kittens did not stir from their hiding place until the next morning when in broad they cautiously peeped out to see that the danger had passed with the coming day the gruesome reality had to be faced that one and all of my party had contracted fever of the desert in more or less violent form even the kittens who sneezed and trembled the whole day some of the camels too were unwell and lay with their long necks resting upon the ground and refused to eat the prospects of crossing the most difﬁcult part of the desert with such sorry party were not very bright but we made everything ready and at ten in the evening we were to make start i purchased here third and most beautiful weird animal and so wild that when let out of the bag in which it had been brought to he covered us all over with scratches he was three months old and had quite will of his own when introduced to master kerman and miss zeris there were reciprocal growls and arched backs and when asked to share their travelling home the night there was evident objection and some exchange of spitting but there were four corners in the wooden box and only three cats they eventually settled

gladly left poisonous lawah and spent the night november 12th traversing mountain region by ﬂattish and low pass and then travelling due north entered the actual sandy salt desert the sediment of surface salt being in some places so thick and white to resemble snow here and there some hillocks of sand relieved the monotony of the dreary journey otherwise ﬂat sand and surface salt extended far the eye could see the nights even when there was moonlight were so clear and the stars and planets so brilliant that with little practice one could general purposes see almost well by day the night was terribly cold which i felt all the more owing to the fever i hung resting my head on the padded pommel of the saddle and my legs and arms dangling at the sides howling cutting wind blew and made it impossible to cover one self up with blankets they were constantly being blown away matter how well one tucked one self in them there was certain picturesque weirdn ess in these night marches in the one could dissociate one self from the discomfo rts the camel men had some sad plaintive songs of their melodious and in good tune with the accompaniment of dingling bells hanging from the camels necks there was musician in our murat young carried ﬂute in his girdle during the day but played upon the instrument the whole doleful tunes of his own composition which were not bad true when one had listened to the same tune not only scores but hundreds of times during one night one rather felt the need of change but still even the sound of his ﬂute was great relief in the dreary night marches occasionally when the fancy took him and he made some variations in the airs the camel men who slept while mechanically walking would join in to sing in chorus overhead the stars gleamed with brightness that we can never dream of seeing in europe and in the distance we now began to perceive some hills rising from the surface of the desert good deal of the poetry of the desert is nevertheless lost each time that the camel on which you ride breathes behold one is brought to earth very soon the rancid smell which comes in regular whiffs is sickening so is the powerful stench of

under it nor could one breathe at all if one tried to get little shade by screening one self against wall of loads which impeded the air moving my camel men showed device which by the ignorant may be ridiculed but to the sensible is great blessing when exposed to abnormally high temperatures the only way to protect one self against the broiling air is to cover one self head and all leaving space to breathe with one or two thick blankets of wool or thick felt of white or light colour preferably white being absorbent of the hot sun rays the thickness of the cloth keeps the body at an enveloping temperature slightly above the temperature of the body itself even when with high fever seldom more than and therefore cooler temperature than outside the blankets when it is frequently sometimes and even more by contrast this seems quite cool it is in other words similar process to that used by us in summer to maintain ice from melting in morocco algeria egypt arabia the people who are much exposed to the rays of the hot sun in deserts always wear extremely thick woollen clothing or bernouses and in persia the camel men of the desert we have seen possess thick white felt coats in which they wrap themselves head and all during the hot hours of the day the italians too seem to have been fully aware of this in naples and southern italy they have an ancient proverb in the neapolitan dialect quel che lo freddo lo caldo what is protection against cold is protection against heat i know one englishman in southern persia who when crossing the broiling plains of arabistan wears thick overcoat and plenty of woollen method which he learnt from the nomad tribes of he is generally laughed at by his countrymen who not know any better this cooling device naturally only applies to tropical climates when the temperature of the air is greatly above the actual temperature of the blood i had arranged with the caravan that accompanied mine to carry fodder my camels there was grazing the animals here large cloths were spread on which straw and were mixed together and then the camels were made to kneel round and have meal on this occasion i was much struck by the really marvellous intelligence of cats we hear lot about dogs ﬁnding their way home from long distances by using their sense of scent how far this explanation is correct we have time to discuss but of cats the general belief is that if they are taken away from home they seldom ﬁnd their way back this may be the case with cats that have always been shut up in some particular house but it is not that they not possess

manner running here and there dog would but jumped out of the box took his bearings with great calm and precision and in most scientiﬁc manner ﬁrst by looking at the sun and then at his own shadow evidently to discover whether when shut up in the box he had travelled east or west north or south or to some intermediate point he repeated this operation several times with wond erful expression of intelligence and reﬂection on his little face and then dashed away with astounding accuracy in the direction of lawah town mind you he did not at all follow the track that we had come by the project

miles from lawah i repeated the experiment three or four days from subsequent camps until the cat reconciled himself to his new position and declined to run away i took the trouble to revolve him round himself several times to mislead him in his bearings but each time he found his correct position by the sun and his own shadow and never made mistake in the absolu tely correct bearings of his route remarkable fact in connection with this is that the most ignorant natives of persia men who have never seen or heard of compass can tell you the exact direction of places by very similar method so that there is more in the process than we think it is rather humiliating when we reﬂect that what we highly civilised people can only with difﬁculty with the assistance of elabora theodolites

which to put sudden stop to it i thought i would climb to the top of the mountain to sweat the fever out and also to obtain view of the surrounding country after having slept some three hours and having partaken of had the greatest difﬁculty in raising enough animal fuel started off about one in the afternoon under broiling sun the camp was at an altitude of feet and the ascent not difﬁcult but very steep and rocky and involving therefore good deal of violent exertion the dark rocks were so hot with the sun that had been shining upon them that they nearly burned one ﬁngers when one touched them still the view from the top well repaid one the trouble of getting there general survey showed that the highest mountain to be seen around was to the bearings magnetic and couple of almost conical hills exactly alike in shape but not in size stood one in front of the other on line with between them both to east and west were number of misshapen mountains were it not low confused heap of grey mud and sand the desert would be an absolutely ﬂat stretch from the distant mountains enclosing the plain on the south to the others on the north long high mud barrier runs diagonally at the northern end in direction from east to west and another extending from east to meets it forming slightly acute angle the latter range is of most peculiar formation extremely brilliant in colour the ground being vivid red regularly ﬂuted and striped across so straight with friezes and bands formed by strata of different tones of colour that from distance it almost resembles the patient work of skilful artisan instead of the results of the corrosive action of water another parallel and similar range stands exactly opposite on the east the mountain itself to which i had climbed was most

men overcome by the heat when we left camp soon after midnight on november 13th we had to make quite long detour to take the caravan around the darband mountain which barred our way directly on the course we were to follow on foot one could have taken short cut in more direct line by climbing up to certain height on the western mountain slope but it was out of the question to take camels up by it we had to go some distance due north through very broken country with numerous hillocks after which we followed narrow gorge cut deep by the action of water the sides of this gorge were like high mud and gravel walls occasionally rocks worn smooth averaging from 60 to 100 feet apart the river bed now absolutely dry evidently carried into the desert during the torrential rain all the drainage of the mountainous country we had traversed practically that from abid the leker mountains and the combined ﬂow of the lawah plain from the mountains to the west of it to which of course may be added the western watershed of the darband mountain itself glance at the natural walls between which we were travelling and the way in which hard rocks had been partly eaten away and deeply grooved or huge hollows bored into them was sufﬁcient to show the observer with what terriﬁc force the water must dash its way through this channel the highest water noticeable on the sides was feet above the bed the impetus with which the rain water must ﬂow down the almost vertical ﬂuted mountain sides must be very great and immense also must be the body of water carried the mountain sides being rocky absorb very little of the rain falling upon them and let it ﬂow down to increase the foaming it is stream some sixteen miles from our last camp we came across circular tower very solidly built standing on the edge of river cliff and higher up on ridge of hills in commanding position stood the remains of two quadrangular towers in condition of one in fact there remained but portion of the base of the other three walls were still standing to good height the circular tower below however which seemed of later date was in good preservation according to the camel men none of these towers were very ancient and had been put up to protect that passage from the robber bands which occasionally came over westward from sistan and afghanistan it had however the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https impossible to maintain guard in such desolate position hence the abandonment of these outposts this is one of the three principal passages by which the mountains can be crossed with animals from kerman towards the east north of the latitude of kerman 17 30 the other two passages are one to khabis over pass of kerman in the husseinabad mountains the second between the derun mountain and the leker kuh from abid also to khabis from the latter place it is also possible to cross the desert to birjiand but the lack of water even at the best of times makes it very dangerous track to follow both men and animals barring these passages there are high mountains protecting kerman and continuously extending roughly from to we travelled partly above the high cliffs then near the circular tower we descen ded to the dry bed of pebbles and sand our course had gradually swerved to the then we left the river bed once more and went due east over confused masses of mud hillocks from twenty to hundred feet high to the north we had mountain range formed of superposed triangles of rock the upper point of each triangle forming either an angle of or slightly acute angle and to the south also another range quite low but of similar character to the northern ones beyond it to the twenty miles back by the way followed lay the darband mountain on the other side of which we had made our previous camp the camp at which we halted bore the name of darband and from this point the desert again opened into wide ﬂat expanse the mountains to the north suddenly ended in crowd

could perceive low range of hills extending in an easterly direction and beyond at bearings magnetic about rose very high mountain and yet another very far east with some isolated conical hills of fair height standing before it in the same direction otherwise everything else in front of us was ﬂat and barren could be at darband halting place there is an interesting old circular tower much battered if it had seen some ﬁghting the attacks on it seem to have taken place mostly from the side which aspect bears evident marks of violent assaults the tower is most cleverly loopholed so to protect the inmates while ﬁring on the enemy and has house on the top additional protection the entrance door is about twenty feet above the ground and can only be reached by ladder which was drawn up in cases of emer gency large dilapidated and ﬁlthy regular fortress with watch tower of its own and all erected in the vicinity in another commanding position in the gully below there is small oasis

here only feet above the sea the heat was terriﬁc author s c amels being f ed in the d eser t brackish water is not pleasant to drink but it is not necessarily unhealthy personally i am great believer in the compensating laws of nature in preference to the habits of civilised men and am certain that the best thing one can drink in the desert under the abnormal conditions of heat dust and dryness is salt water which stimulates digestion and keeps the system clean of ﬁlters condensing apparatuses cartridges and other such appliances difﬁcult land travelling the less said the better they are very pretty toys the glowing advertisements of which may add to the proﬁts of geographical magazines but they are really more useful in cities in europe than practical in the desert possibly they may be consolation to certain class of people but anything else it might be argued would serve equally well one sees them advertised preventatives of malarial fever but sensible person who has ever had fever or seen it in others would ever believe that it comes from drinking water fever is in the breathes fever one does not necessarily drink it when the water is corrupted the air is also corrupted and to ﬁlter the one and not the other is an operation the sense of which i personally can not see it has ever been my experience and that also of others that the fewer precau tions one takes the more one relies on nature to take care of one instead of on impracticable better one health in the end i not mean by this that one should go and drink dirty water to avoid fever from it if the water is dirty the best plan is not to drink it at all whether to be accurate passed through not or made into one fact is certain that if one goes through fever district one can take all the precautions in the world but if one system is so inclined one is sure to contract it only the more the precautions the more violent the fever but to return to our speciﬁc case bracki sh water is not necessarily dirty and i

were to follow being quite ﬂat and therefore easier the animals we went along between low hills getting lower and lower and some two miles from the darband tower we emer ged into the open the river losing itself here in the desert during the night of the we travelled 28 miles on the ﬂat until we came to more low hills which we entered by another also dry we had come in direction so far but we now turned due east among high hills which resembled mass of ruined persian houses of quadrangular shape so strangely had they been carved out by the corrosive action of water they were of solid rock and eaten into holes here and there which from distance gave the appearance of windows and doors and of caves the on which we travelled was of soft minute gravel strewn here and there with large boulders fallen from the cliffs at the sides cairns had been erected in various prominent points by caravan men to show future travellers the way to naiband birjiand and meshed following this in an easterly direction we came to large basin and then further on to another we continued in short distance when we arrived at place where the makes an elbow turning to the north at this spot caravanserai was in course of construction built at the expense of some charitable person there was only one well of brackish water and very little of that too the workmen would not let us partake of it everything of course had to be brought nothing could be obtained there and the few workmen complained bitterly of the hardships they had to endure in going on with their work they feared they would soon run short even of water they were all fever and two quite in pitiable condition they had little food left most of their animals had died and they were unable to leave was the name of this well altitude feet we were miles from our last camp and reached here at 8 on taking the loads down we had great disappointment sadek who was not accustomed to ride camels was suffering considerably and in order to make himself comfortable he had contrived clever device to avoid coming in immediate contact with the wooden frame of his saddle he had fastened the two largest skins we had with our supply of good water on the top of his saddle and having covered them over with blankets and carpets on them he sat and slept through the whole night alas the weight of his body burst both skins during the night and squeezed all the water out so here we were with only two small skins of fresh water left which would have to last the whole party several days but we were to have further misfortune on the following march the heat was in the an inch of shade in the middle of the day and the bed being cut into the plain and therefo re lower than the surface of the remain der of the desert the lack of current of air made this spot quite suffocating so much so that both camels and men were getting quite overcome by the heat and we had to start of f early in the afternoon at 4 chapter vii long troublesome hours

cooking with and we marched all night november 15th most painful march the camels were all more or less sick and tired and they dragged themselves jerkily grunting and making the most awful noises all night my fever got very bad and i was seized with bad pains in my ribs and spine sadek and the camel men complained of feeling very ill and the cats remonstrated from their high perch at not being let out of their box at the customary hour to add to our happiness one of my camels carrying some cases with sharp brass corners collided with the camel conveying the precious load of the two remaining water which hung on its sides and of course fate would have it the brass corners wrenched the skin and out ﬂowed every drop of water which was avidly absorbed by the dry sand the t rail we left behind in the s alt d eser t the character of the country was the same on the previous day long stretch of ﬂat then undulations after which we entered another dry canal cut deep with vertical rocky sides very similar to the except that in the bed of the gorge itself there were now enormous the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https of stone instead of sand and gravel the day before further on we were surrounded by low hills which we crossed by pass and after having been on the saddle continuou sly sixteen hours we halted at eight in the middle of broiling barren stretch of sand gravel and shingle after so long march and under such unpleasant conditions our throats and tongues were parched with thirst fortunately we still had one skin of water left i thought so my ﬁrst impulse was to hasten to have it taken off the saddle that we might all have sip but misfortune pursued us on approaching the camel that carried it the animal was all wet on one side and i fully realised what to expect sadek with long face of dismay took down the ﬂabby empty skin the water had all dripped out of it and here we were in the middle of the desert well whether salt or otherwise and not thimbleful of water the very thought that we could get nothing to drink made us ten times more thirsty and we seemed to be positively roasting under the ﬁerce sun the camel men threw themselves down upon their felt coats and moaned and groaned and the camels who had drunk or eaten nothing three days appeared most unhappy and grunted pitifully want of better remedy we sucked pebbles which stimulated salivation and allayed the thirst to certain extent but with the high fever which brought about fearful exhaustion and severe aches and the unpleasant abundant electricity in the air caused by the intense has most peculiar effect on one none of us felt particularly happy the three cats were the only philosophers of the party and were quite sympathetic they amused themselves by climbing up the camel long necks just they would up tree to the evident discomfort of the larger animals they had particular fancy sitting on the camels bushy heads the electricity with which the air of the desert is absolutely saturated is gradually absorbed by the human body and stored in an accumulator on touching the barrel of riﬂe or any other good conductor of electricity one would discharge an electric spark of some length by rubbing one woollen blankets with one hands one could always generate sufﬁcient electricity to produce spark and the cats if one touched them they always gave out good many sparks at night if one caressed them there was quite luminous greenish glow under one ﬁngers they came into contact with the hair quite brilliant ﬂash ensued when the cats were rubbed with woollen blanket we had only risen about 100 feet to feet from our last camp and we steered the high naiband mountain the camel men taking advantage of my being ill were very troublesome and attempted some of their tricks but although i was absolutely at their mercy i screwed up what little strength i had and brought them back to their senses the camels they said were very ill and we could not possibly go on we certainly could not stop where we were and i most decidedly would not go back so when night came on we went leaving camp at 10 and travelling ﬁrst over great ﬂat stretch then among low hills and through several ravines cut by water we travelled some ten hours at good pace and when nearing the naiband mountain the country became quite undulating on november 16th we arrived in small oasis of high palm trees with streamlet of salt water forming pool or two dirty to degree owing to the bad habits of camels when drinking our camels who had drunk nothing several days on perceiving these pools made dash them and sucked to their hearts content gallons of water of ghastly tint almost thick syrup with mud and or ganic matter but which they seemed to enjoy all the same there was here much battered tower attributed to beluch who are said to have fought here most bravely in times gone by but more probably of afghan at least erected during the time of the afghan invasion it is said to be some centuries old but here again it is well to have one doubts upon the matter i was examining the tower which has undoubtedly seen some terriﬁc ﬁghting giant man emer ged from the palm trees and came towards us he was some 6 feet 6 inches in height and being slender with small head appeared to be even taller than he really was he strode disjointedly towards us and was somewhat peculiar in manner and speech he examined us very closely and then ran away up to the quaint old place perched high on the mountain side and with eight picturesque towers most of these towers were round but large quadrangular one stood apart on separate hill there were innumerable holes in the rock which were at one time habitations but are used now stables mostly donkeys of which there were great number in the place the rock on which the village stood is very rugged and difﬁcult of access can be seen by the photograph which i took and the architecture of the buildings had character peculiar to itself and differed very considerably from any other houses we had met in persia they were with very high walls and four circular apertures to answer the purpo of windows about up the wall the roof was plastered and made kind of verandah where the natives spread fruit and vegetables to dry and the women had their small weaving looms on one side of the rock

highest peak of the naiband was to the north of the village and the mountainous region extended also in direction further north beyond the mountain that gives its name to the whole mass of the village

some grievance against him but although it seemed rather hard that i should come in the punishment which should have been meted to my predecessor i well knew that the only way out of the scrape was to face the music to run away would have been fatal so we entered the village by narrow path while men women and children collected on the tops and in the doorways and gesticulated and spouted away ﬁne collecti on of insults one may expect to listen to in one life the naiband people may certainly be congratulated on the possession of most extensive and complete vocabulary of swear words pretending unconcern but keeping watchful eye on what was taking place all round i stopped here and there to examine the small water hanging in couples or more outside each doorway and halted in the small square of the village to admire the wretched buildings all round the lower portion of the houses was of mud the upper of stone down the side of the main street gurgled the limpid little stream each house had sort of walled recess outside the front door reached by step or two where tilling tools rested against the wall and where the women spinning wheels were worked during the day the wheels however were now idle the women had joined the men in the demonstration it was most evident that ferenghis were not popular at naiband but come what might here i was and here i would stay long it suited stone ﬂung with considerable force hit in the always have way of striking you in the most sensitive it took some minutes before i could recover from the pain and move on but i never let the natives suspect what

hit quite badly again the camel man had warned that the population of naiband was mixture of robbers and and the facts fully proved his words so i was rather glad that i had taken not only my riﬂe with but pocketful of cartridges well things were getting rather hot and it was only when having reached high point of vantage i stopped and in full view of the crowd inserted ﬁve cartridge clip in the magazine of my mannlicher that most anxious inquiries were made from the camel man to what i was about to the camel man amid sudden silence and eager attention explained the terriﬁc powers of ferenghi riﬂe which he said never misses and ever kills even ten miles off and to add more humour to his words he explained that shots could be ﬁred so quick that one had not time to count them at this point of the lecture i casually produced handful of cartridges from my coat pocket and having counted them aloud proceeded to count the people who watched somewhat ﬂabber gasted the device answered perfectly they dropped the stones which during the short armistice they had carefully nursed in their hands and some thought they had better return to their homes the bolder ones only remaining who put grin of friendship on their faces and made signs that they would try to further harm peace being proclaimed and after making them pay their salaams which seem ed the most unusual thing they ever had to in their lifetime i spoke to them in friendly way and patted them on the back they were much impressed with the riﬂe and wanted to let them see it in their own hands which of course i did not they showed some of their houses which were very people fowls and in some cases donkey or goat occupying the same room these brigand villagers were most interesting type they were quite unlike the persians of the west and they certainly had nothing in common with the afghan nor did they resemble the people of the northern part of persia the beluch type came nearer it would be curious to trace exactly where they came undoubtedly their features must have been greatly modiﬁed even altogether altered by the climatic conditions of the spot they live in one was struck by the abnormal length thinness and disjointedness of their limbs and by the long faces with handsome aquiline noses broad and high foreheads eyebrows in straight line across the brow piercing eyes well protected by the brow and drooping at the outer corners with quite hollow under the lower eyelid very ﬁrm mouths full of expression and power also drooping slightly at the corners and high cheek the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https m en of an asis in the d eser t man and c hild of the d eser t their appearance was certainly most picturesque and they possessed the manner and general ways of feline animals which made them appear rather unreliable but in way quite attractive they were evidently people accustomed to ways and they needed very careful handling they were frank and resolute enough in their talking at the top of their voices which however sounded quite musical and not grating they possessed dirty but very hands and feet the thumb only being somewhat short and stumpy but the ﬁngers supple long and tapering the few lines which they possessed in the palms of their hands were very stron gly marked there was good deal of reﬁnement about their facial features and hands which made think that these people came from good stock and even the were generally malformed with all the natives of persia which had so far come under my in this case much more delicately modelled and inﬁnitely better shaped the chins were beautifully chiselled even when somewhat slanting backwards i give here photograph which i took of two typical young men and which i think bears out my remarks there was an extraordinary family resemblance in nearly all the heads one saw which made one suspect constant intermarriage among relations in the small community in fact on asking they professed to be all related to one another another very curious point about the faces of the male members of naiband village which contrasted with other natives of persia was that whereas the latter can grow heavy beards from comparatively very tender age the naib and young men were quite hairless on the face almost like at twenty or years of age when they had reach ed fairly advanced age however some forty years they seemed to grow quite good black beard and heavy moustache somewhat curly never very long and of ﬁner texture than with modern persians the hair of the skull was perfectly straight and was worn long parted in the middle with an occasional fringe on the forehead nature freaks are many and varied while the men had invariably long aquiline noses elongated faces and eyes well protected by the brow the children until the age of ten or twelve had rather stumpy faces with noses actually turned up and most beautiful large eyes softened by abnormally long eyelashes the eyes themselves strangely enough being quite ﬂeur tête i noticed this curious phenomenon in members of the same family and the older ones told that when they were young their faces were also stubby and their noses turned up the inference i drew was that it must be the climatic conditions of the desert that have the elongating effect not only upon the facial features but on all the limbs of the people the people were not naturally born elongated the climate certainly has an elongating effect on plants or leaves which all tend to come to point such the leaves of the elongated palm trees instance or any of the other spiky plants one ﬁnds in parts of the desert there was good deal of the demon about the women of the place superabun dance of ﬁre in their movements and in the expression of their ﬂashing eyes which was great contrast to the slow digniﬁed manner of the men when seen under normal circumstances their frame was much more powerfully built than that of the men the ladies seemed to be in perpetual state of anger that they were industrious there could be mistake and one could but be amazed at their muscular strength in lifting heavy loads but taking things all round one was rather glad to have friends among the naiband fair sex when one saw how their men relations or otherwise were pulled about by them the men positively feared them and the women seemed to have it all their own way the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https were so violent that it was most difﬁcult to approach them but with some careful coaxing i succeeded in persuading the wildest and most typical of the lot to sit her photograph which i look upon quite an achievement considering that it might have cost her life or mine or both it was it went pretty well and when i gave her few silver pieces she screamed with delight and sounded them on stone to make sure they were good women blackened their eyes underneath artiﬁcially which gave them languid but ardent appearance their long wild curly hair hung loose at the side of the head over which they wore kerchief fastened into knot under the chin their costume was simple mere short blue cotton skirt reaching below the knee and little red loose shirt with ample sleeves various silver ornaments and charms mainly old coins hung round their necks from leather cords the arms and legs quite bare were in most cases and showed abnormal muscular development due doubt to the hard work the women were made to endure they were positively used beasts of occup ation they seemed to the men i presume lazily sat about smoking their tobacco or opium but the likely owing to the same from european point of view quite shapeless even in comparatively young women hardly above twenty their little blouses generally torn or carelessly left open display repulsively pendent breasts and overlapping waists while the abdom inal region draped by thin skirt appeared much deformed by undue development these facts are given they were typical of the majority of women in the place the diet and the strain of lifting and carrying huge weights on the head may to certain exten t account these evils i also saw one or two cases of varicose veins the children seemed very pale and anaemic condition which has been mainly brought about i think by the constant intermarriage among relations naiband b arber s tropping r azor on his l eg w oman of n aiband men women and children possessed admirable teeth of slightly yellowish tint very thick powerful and regular enough although the front teeth were rather too long especially in adults they were however generally well protected and covered by the lips almost invariably tightly closed the people i noticed had tendency to breathe mostly through the nose their nostrils were wide and healthy looking they all possessed very keen eyesight but not good hearing the want of expansion of the men chests was striking feature of masculine anatomy at naiband and in fact the proﬁle silhouette of members of the naiband strong sex was not unlike that of phonograph trumpet resting on the ground they wore trousers of enormous size divided skirts of the largest pattern pure and simple and little jackets over them with broad sleeves and buttoned over on the right shoulder it seemed almost that the further we got into the desert the larger the trousers of the men in the oases some of the men had several yards of material draped round their legs in hindoo fashion instead of trousers the colours of their clothes were white and dark blue while their headgear consisted of double skull cap thin coloured one underneath and light brown thick felt one over it the men were either barefooted or wore sandals things went fairly well while we remained talking in the village but in the meantime the entire population had turned out and some reason of their own again became rather boisterous having seen all there was to be seen i made my way down to camp slowly possible followed by howling mob the moment one had one back turned stones ﬂew in abundance the camel man and i went down the steep incline and when we reached the last houses of the village great number of people were congregated on the roofs who gesticulated frantically and yelled something or other the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https i passed one or two of them had long matchlocks we had gone but few yards when shot was ﬁred at us and minute or so later another but damage was inﬂicted we went on with assumed calm and stopped apparently to look at the scenery all round but really to watch what the howling mob behind were doing and eventually when we reached the foot of the mountain and were out in the open inste ad of among rocks the mob taken by panic bolted and we saw them scrambling with great speed up the rocky path to the village like so many rabbits chapter ix focating expected barber and his track to husband and wife across the long salt well many misfortunes befel us at this place we had made our camp in the oasis of palm trees at the foot of the mountain and the camels were much worn out we were unable to proceed on our journey the same evening the heat during the night under the palm trees was quite suffocating and i had to remove my bedding into the open where one could breathe little better the camel men feared that during the night we might be attacked by the villagers and we made ready any emer gency but nobody came there was so much electricity in the air that it gave quite an unpleasant feelin g and had curious effect upon one skin the cats on coming in contact with the woollen blankets dischar ged sparks all over and sparks also snapped from one ﬁngers on touching anything that was good conductor of electricity wild animal came into our camp during the night and carried away some hens we had been told that there were many wolves and foxes in the neighbourhood in the morning we were confronted with what seemed disaster eleven camels of our combined caravans had disappeared had they been stolen or had they run away the camel men were in tears and instead of going to look them sat on the loads sobbing bitterly and wiping the tears from their eyes with the skirts of their long coats ray of hope arose when we discovered their tracks they had made some hot water springs some miles to the east and judging from their footprints were evidently travelling at great pace two men on other camels were despatched after them and we had to resign ourselves to delay of another day curiously enough there was sudden change in the temperature and the thermometer in the sun only registered which made us feel quite chilly after the and of previous days our camp was at an altitude of at the foot of the naiband mountain sadek took the opportunity of the delay to set everything tidy and we had great washing day he sent barber in the village to trim his hair and beard the naiband figaro was an extraordinary creature most rascal who had plenty to say himself and whose peculiar ways and roaming eyes made us conceal away out of his sight all small articles fear that he should walk away with them he carried all the tools of his trade around his waist in belt and ground his razor ﬁrst on stone which he licked with his tongue then using his bare arms and legs stropping purposes snapshotted in the accompanying photograph the camel whom he was ﬁrst requested to shaved splashing their faces with salt water during the process but sadek the next victim produced cake of soap with which he luxuriously lathered his own face and which the barber scraped gradually from the chin and cheeks and every now and then deposited the razor wipings on his patient head we were able to buy some fresh water skins and this time they were really water tight the natives naturally took every advantage of us in the bargains but we were able to purchase lot of fresh provisions which we needed badly and men and beasts felt none the worse our compulsory halt in the middle of the second night we were waked up by some distant grunts and the camel men jumped up in great glee they had recognised the beloved voices of some of their strayed camels few minutes later in fact the whole eleven were brought back by the two men who had gone in search of them they had found them some twenty miles of from lawah to naiband we had come practically due north but from this camp to birjand the way lay due east the ﬁrst portion of the journey at in the desert rose high mountain we had everything ready our departure but the camel men were in dreadful state some villager had told them that the news had spread that the strong boxes which the ferenghi had were full of silver and matter of fact there was hardly any left of that raid was being arranged that night to kill us and rob our baggage when we were starting the camel men spent the whole day polishing up the old riﬂes they possessed and much to my concern their safety loaded them to allay their fears we made sudden start at 5 instead of at the hour of 10 which had been previously arranged one mile beyond naiband track branches to the meshed and here we bade to persian husband and aged she aged in the company of donkey were on pilgrimage from yezd to the sacred shrine we had picked them up in sorry plight in the desert the husband riding the lame donkey the girl on foot and shoving both from behind i could not help admiring their enterprise all the provisions they had carried were few cucumbers ﬁgs and load of bread nearly all of which were exhausted when we found them on remonstrating with the strapping youth riding the donkey while he made his poor wife walk he replied that they had been newly married and it would not man to show consideration wife so soon the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https being city girl was bundle of clothing and we could not see her face but she seemed nice meek little thing with pretty hands and feet on being asked whether she was tired thread of voice from under her chudder said she was and on being invited to ride one of my camels on the top of load there was giggle which meant yes the selected camel was brought down on his knees and sadek and ali murat hauled her up in the most approved style she having an evident joke at her selﬁsh husband having better mount than he after all unfortunately the poor child was so exhausted that after she had gone some distance with the swaying of the camel she became fast asleep lost her balance and fell on her head nobody delighted in the misfortune more than her lord and master who did not fail to impress upon her that this was evidently allah punishment her vanity in trying to be superior to her better half rubbing her aching skull and much concerned at the chudder having got torn the bride thought she had better resign herself to walk after all here too in other parts of the desert near mountainous regions we found the usual deep cut channels carrying into the desert the overﬂow of rain water from the naiband mountain and the many little hills at its foot otherwise in the miles which we covered during the night there was absolutely nothing of interest when we had gone some ten miles from naiband the camel men tired of carrying their matchlocks slung them to the saddles and professed the danger of an attack over we were in the open again i was much troubled by my fever which had seized violently and brought on aches all over my body we camped at feet having descended 330 feet in miles an almost perfectly ﬂat stretch except hillock or undulation here and there my fever continued so ﬁerce the whole day that i had not the strength to stand up nor the inclination to eat the exhaustion caused by the very high temperature being indescribable we left at 7 meaning to make another long march the night was intensely cold with terriﬁc wind sweeping from the several times during the night when we came across tamarisk shrub or two we halted few minutes to make bonﬁre and warm our frozen hands and toes we actually came across stream of brackish feet broad and about two to three inches largest stream we had seen since entering the desert and having been twelve hours on the saddle to cover only miles camels and men shivering pitifully from the cold and the latter also from fever we made camp in spot where there was an abundanc of tamarisks and deep well the water of which was fully twenty feet below the earth surface small basin had been excavated next to the well we ﬁlled it with water by means of bucket and it was real pleasure to see the camels crowding round it and satisfying their thirst of two days we did not allow them to drink the water of the brackish stream the elevation of this camp was feet chapter x intense sense of of the of the salt on the moustache and of the camel murat meets his dens and opium fects of smoking opium in ofﬁcial reduced to idea of sunset and keshk in birjand we left camp at 8 on the night of november and by midnight the cold grew intense the camel men lighted big bonﬁres all through the night wherever they found few shrubs but i was so ill with fever that i had not the strength and energy to dismount from my camel on which i was shivering with cold although well wrapped up in blankets after marching eight miles from our last camp we came to brackish well where the camel men replenished their water i was rather interested to see what dulled sense of taste these men of the desert possessed when i saw them making rush this well i thought that probably we had come to fresh water and on asking them they said this was well of excellent sweet water when i tasted it it was so salt that it quite made one inﬂamed gums and palate smart with pain i noticed some days later that when we did actually get fairly sweet water they could detect difference between it and the most brackish water we had come through hilly and broken country over low passes and narrow gorges ﬂanking dry then we had entered another immense ﬂat stretch of lut quite level except an occasional solitary hillock breaking the monotonous line of the horizon here and there from one of these hillocks feet near our camp of november 21st one got quite an interesting panorama all round the highest mountain in sight was still the naiband peak to the of us range which seemed about 50 miles off spread to the and before 20 miles distant from very long low hill range in an arc from our west to our north were distinguishable several high pointed peaks blackish brown hands omely cut hill stood prominent mile or so from us in the middle of the plain to the north the country was much broken up and low there was stream of salt water running from east to west with thick salt deposi ts on each side of the water edge to the the hills showed peculiar characteristics but to the east and could be observed two short ranges much indented of broken up and corroded rock similar to the many we had already found across the desert to the north and to the south of the hill range which stood to the east of us there were low passes and behind them again the ﬂat lut the only thing of real interest in the absolutely bare parts of the desert is the geological formation of the soil and the only amusement is to examine the different beautifully coloured stones that can be picked up such handsome agates bits of malachite crystals beautiful marbles and ﬂints the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https all the more interesting when one thinks that most of them may have travelled hundreds some thousands of miles to get there either brought by the water when the country was submer ged or shifted on and on by the wind they all bear marks of travel and even the hardest are polished smooth the original natural angles of crystals being in many cases actually worn down and quite rounded pebbles of red jasper jasper chalcedony quartz and agatescent quartz pink and brown corroded limestone and calcite were the most frequently met with desert is in england always associated with glorious sunsets why this should be so is rather difﬁcult to be understood by anybody reasoning in the right way because the magniﬁcent tints of sunset are caused by moisture in the air and not by abnormal dryness all the time that i was in the desert itself i never saw sunset that really had half the picturesqueness of one of our most modest sunsets in europe the sun disappeared very fast leaving slightly yellow glow above the horizon which soon became greenish by blending with the blue sky and then black with night the twilight was extremely short we seldom saw clouds at all in the desert and when we did they were scrubby little patchy angular lumps at enormous heights above the earth surface they were generally white or light grey occasionally they were of the pattern in long successive ridges resembling the waves formed on the sand surface when shifted by wind soon after the sun had disappeared behind the horizon these clouds generally changed their colour from white into black and made long lines stretching great distances across the sky but adding beauty to it naturally the play of shifting lights and shadows upon the desert when the sun shone above the clouds was quite weird especially when the last formation of clouds referred to cast long bluish shadows slowly moving upon the whitish tint of the ground lower upon the horizon line curtain of dirty brownish tint was generally to be seen due to particles of sand in the air otherwise in almost all cases that came under my observation the clouds formed thin clean horizontal lines or else when very high up patchy small skif fs one missed greatly the fat rolling globular clouds which are so common to europe and which ﬁll the sky with fantastic forms there is such thing getting tired of an everlasting spread of blue sky and the glow of roasting sun strong westerly gale swept low over the surface of the desert it was very cold after sunset but fortunately we had plenty of tamarisk shrubs at hand and camel dung with which to make big ﬁres the river bed below our camp was very wide but the salt stream itself not more than three to four feet across it eventually lost itself to the in the desert the camels had been let loose to graze and had good feed of tamarisk which they seemed to enjoy much after their long diet on reduced rations of straw and cotton seeds we left this camp feet soon after dinner at 7 and during the night passed several ranges of hills we travelling all the time on the ﬂat in the middle of the night the cold was bitter so cold that i had icicles hanging on my moustache and eyelashes it was impossible to remain on the camels and ill we all felt we had to ourselves would be more suitable to keep ourselves from freezing on these cold nights we simply longed the sun to come out the dark hours seemed interminable one began slightly to revive when the ﬁrst glimmering of yellowish light began to tinge the dark blue sky and the dazzling stars gradually lost their brilliancy and eventually disappeared altogether from the heaven above us on the ﬁrst ray of sun appearing the devout camel men stopped the caravan spread small cloth upon the ground and having picked up small stone placed it in front of them they duly turned towards sacred mecca and lifted their arms then muttering their prayers knelt and placed their heads upon the ground we have already seen others in the usual mussulman manner they were most diligent in this respect and one could not help admiring the intent fervour of their appeals to allah at sunset too their prayers never failed to be matter what they were busy doing at the time all being interrupted the purpose at we arrived at village called fedeshk large place situated in ﬂat oblong plain ten miles long and mile and half wide surrounded by low hills on all sides on being asked why he had made the camels go so fast on this march ali murat my camel man blushingly confessed that in this village was his home and his wife whom he had not seen eight months the anxiety to see his better half who lived only from where we made camp did not however prevent him looking carefully after his camels whom he placed ﬁrst of all in his affection and smoking sadek cigarettes and pipe with the other camel men and waiting till my tea had been brewed to receive his customary six cups after all this had been gone through which took the best part of two hours he disappeared and we did not see him again the remainder of the morning the people of fedeshk were striking two reasons ﬁrst being sadly fever secondly because they were addicted to opium smoking to disastrous degree there were number of opium dens in the place and i went to see them they were dreadful places in which one would suspect opium smoking was not the only vice indulged in by the natives i entered one of these houses after considerable knocking at the door and great rustling of people running about the small courtyard inside we were admitted into room so dark that i at ﬁrst could discern nothing at all the pungent sickening odour of the opium pipes gave one quite turn and i lighted up match to see where i was there were men lying about on mats in state and men attendants reﬁlling the pipes to those used in china cane holder with earthenware pipe in which tiny pills of opium were inserted and consumed over the ﬂame of small lamp several of the men were in such torpid state that they mechanically inhaled the opium smoke when the pipes were pressed to their lips but were hardly cognizant of what went about around them the keeper in the meantime did roaring business and had little scale on which he weighed the opium that he served out it seemed evident i lighted match after match by certain articles of ladies attire which in the hurried departure had been left behind in the room that the usual attendants of the smokers were women but they had stampeded away on our arrival one heard them chuckle in the the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https and in their haste they had left behind great many pairs of slippers at the entrance of the room i had two men conveyed out into the sun where i wanted to examine them the pupils of their eyes had contracted to most abnormal extent even before they were exposed to the sunlight and seemed to have almost lost the power of expanding and contracting in various lights and although the eyes were wide opened and staring they did not seem to discern what was placed before them the had yellowish tinge and the iris was not but seemed to have under gone discoloration and faded away into the white of the eye they seemed affected by kind of temporary atrophy the pulse beat extremely slow and faintly the lips were drawn tight the hearin g so dulled that even loud noises seemed to have effect upon them the body was ﬂabby and almost lifeless it was not possible to obtain an answer to anything one asked them they had quite cadaverous appearance with yellowish pallid skins sunken eyes and teeth showing fully under the drawn lips only now and then one watched them sigh followed by shiver or grunt came forth to show us that they were still alive the ﬁngers and toes displayed some muscular contraction but not the other joints which were quite loose the heart beat so feebly that one could hardly feel it they remained spread out in the yard in the positions we had placed them and were indeed most pitiful objects the told that these two men were most inveterate smokers and were at it the whole time until they became quite unconscious there were other men in slightly bette r condition but all more or less showing the same symptoms of stupefaction those that could mutter words said that it was an irresistible passion that they could never stop the opium gave them dreams they told but delicious feeling of absolute contentment and happiness which they could never experience when not indulg ing in this disastrous vice on looking upon things impartially however one came to the conclusion that bad it was smoking had certainly more peaceful and less disgusting effects upon those unfortunates addicted to it than whiskey or absinthe or votka drunkenness instance the entire population of this village was unfortunately given to this bad habit and it was quite pitiable to look upon their haggard staring faces and idiotic expression malarial fever is very prevalent at fedeshk and some of the people affected by it came to my camp medicine they were not unlike walking skeletons with stringy hands and feet and skin of ghastly yellow colour they had parched bloodless ears curled forward and sunken cheeks with deep eyes in the more virulent cases fever was accompanied by rheumatic pains so strong practically to paralyse the legs and arms which were reduced to positive minimum of ﬂesh the dwellings of fedeshk were not impressive mud hovels usual with domes over the rooms everywhere in persia only the familiar aperture instead of being directly in the centre of the dome itself had kind of hood over it to screen it from the terriﬁc winds of the west fever s tricken m an at f edeshk the c itadel b irjand it is to be noticed in connection with these winds that to the west of fedeshk there are rather high mountains and even winds originally not coming from the west may be turned back or switched in that direction by this chain of the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https large ice is met with at the end of the village which testiﬁes to the intense cold that can be experienced here in the winter months an ofﬁcial residing in the place sent word that he would call upon and we made grand display of all the carpets we possessed to receiv him he arrived with number of servants and we had very pleasant interview with great consumption of tea he was extremely civil inquired whether he could be of any assistance which was politely declined and showed intense interest in my ﬁrearms and scientiﬁc instruments he and his people were amazed when i told them that their village stood at an elevation of above sea level and explained to them how i had measured the height by means of aneroids and the hypsometrical apparatus these are wonderful he said with salaam he handed back the instruments which had been eagerly examined by all present and he added can you also measure the length of cloth with them compass too he had never set eyes upon and he at ﬁrst thought that it was constructed to point towards mecca had not one long ago got accustomed to similar questions often asked one by london people the innocence of the persian ofﬁcial might have taken one breath away but this was nothing to what happened later the persians showed great curiosity to learn everything in connection with whatever foreign articles i possessed and the respective prices i had paid them then sadek was closel y examined to the amount of food i ate every day the salary i paid him and why i had come across the desert was i russian or an englishman the ofﬁcer had never seen either but heard both well spoken of he had understood that all englishmen had yellow hair why had i dark hair london he like most persians believed to be suburb of bombay connected with russia by means of machine road railway why on earth did the ferenghi want to know how high mountains were did the ferenghi know how to ﬁnd gold in the earth and so on were the queries which sadek had to answer with repeated salaams preceded by thousand other questions the ofﬁcial departed but sadek who was much excited was still bent on highly scientiﬁc conversation to the following ef fect sahib he said you have travelled in many countries have you not yes sahib have you been to the country where the sun to sleep in hole in the earth every evening that was sadek idea of sunset his idea of sunrise was that sun was sent up every day and this explained how it was that it rose from the opposite side to that on which it had gone to sleep ali murat looking somewhat washed out and absent minded came back to camp at noon garbed in very handsome new coat which his wife had woven and embroidered him during his absence he was very proud of it we left fedeshk an hour later i was very anxious to reach the city of birjand the same day if possible we were now again in fairly inhabited country and on our hurried march passed great many villages large and small such shahzileh mazumabad tagot siaguih shamzabad further at ossenabad is to be seen ruined of the governor of birjan d then the last two villages of khelatekhan and khelatehajih ali murat seemed rather dazzled on this last march and was so worn out that he threw himself down upon the ground several times regardless of spoiling his smart new coat in moment he became fast asleep and it took some rousing to make him get up again his wife had given him bag of keshk kind of cheese which looked like hardened curdled of this he partook freely to try and regain his former strength keshk cheese was very hard stuff to eat and took lot of chewing to prevent it getting too hard it had to be soaked in water every few days we had nasty wind against us but the way was ﬂat and good our direction due east across the long narrow valley of sand nowhere broader than couple of miles to the north were number of low hills shaped like so many tents white grey and in colour and also to the south where there was an additional irregular and somewhat higher rocky mountain in the evening of november 24th we had crossed the entire salt desert and arrived at the large city of birjand after meshed the most important city of khorassan the journey having occupied twenty days which was considered very fast crossing there was beautiful new caravanserai here with clean spacious rooms and with most attentive and obliging keeper in char ge of it chapter xi my caravan of rade strategical position trading fresh carpets pioneer british and business is and british long picturesque afghan camel men at birjand my camels being utterly exhausted i disbanded my caravan paid up ali murat and attempted to make up fresh caravan to proceed to sistan this would take two or three days at least so i employed my time at ﬁrst by seeing all that there was to be seen in the place then by receiving various ofﬁcial callers and last in trying to shake off the fever which i partially did by very violent but ef fective the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https c ity of b irjand showing main street and river bed combined we entered birjand from the west by wide dry river bed which formed the main street of the city ruined fortress which seemed at one time to have been of great strength was to be seen on the western extremity of the town on low hillock the interior was quite interesting with several tiers showing how the walls had been manned defensive purposes the general view of birjand reproduced in the illustration was taken from the fort and gives better idea of the place than any description it can be seen that the city is unequ ally divided by the combined and main street the northern portion to the left of observer in the photograph having merely an extensive graveyard few houses the large caravanserai at which i had halted and row of shops whereas on the southern side was the bulk of the houses two three and some even four storied all of monotonous greyish colour the buildings being mostly of mud bricks the little windows in sets of threes and ﬁves with brown wooden shutters relieved to certain extent the dulness of the architecture while certain relief to the eye was afforded by dome and another building both painted white in marked contrast to the mud walls many houses had long verandahs and balconies on which the women spread their washing the city was built in terraces upon undulating ground and two higher hills it covered greater area than it at ﬁrst appeared to the streets were very tortuous and narrow arched over in some places forming long dark tunnels many of the dwellings having rooms over them directly above the roadway making rough guess there were i daresay some to houses in birjand and its suburbs with population of not over souls these ﬁgures the natives said were about correct but exact statistics existed the higher point of birjand was at its east portion and at the most extreme point of the town at the bottom of the hill was the high square enclosure with bastions and high tower represented in the illustration it was in dilapidated condition but was nevertheless the only structure in birjand which had claim to some picturesqueness it was the old citadel inhabited at one time by the amir the wall of the citadel facing south had large window with musharabeah woodwork and lower building to the side the adjacent building also had quaint balconies good view of the whole city was obtained from high isolated building to the south of the town in the centre of large but somewhat untidy fruit garden an ofﬁcial residence but now very little used except in cases of emer gency to accommodate passing ofﬁcials or distinguished people there were some persian military ofﬁcers staying there and they most kindly showed all that there was to be seen after having enter tained to some refreshments they conveyed inside the citadel where they proudly showed battery of six guns of obsolete austrian manufacture an eighteen pounder bronze gun and another gun of somewhat smaller calibre both of persian make they were very carelessly kept there being apparently only ragged boy or two to look after them the ofﬁcer told that the garrison of birjand consisted of one thousand men about one hundred of whom were stationed in birjand itself the rest being scattered in the villages around and at one or two posts along the afghan frontier the accuracy of this statement however i leave the entire responsibility to the ofﬁcer he was much distressed when i inquired whether the soldiers were ever drilled in artillery practice and he said it could not be done because they had not sufﬁcient ammunition but they possessed some gunpowder he agreed with that artillery would be of little use if there was one who knew how to use it and ammunition at hand birjand being so near the afghan frontier and having direct roads to meshed herat sabzawar anardar farah lash sistan beluchistan bandar abbas kerman yezd isfahan and teheran is place of interest from strategic point of view in its present condition it could not possibly offer any resistance the city and citadel can be commanded from many points on the hills to the and east and the allowing that it were strong enough to make be shelled with the greatest ease at close range from the hill on which now stand s the ruined fortress west of the city this point could be reached in perfect safety and would afford absolute cover under ﬁre from the citadel but with modern artillery even of moderate calibre would prove fatal to the citadel itself birjand is probably the greatest commercial centre in eastern persia its transit trade at various seasons of the year being very extensive from all the routes agriculturally birjand could not even support its own population the water supply is scanty and bad there is fresh water obtainable in the city but brackish water is little more plentiful small spring of good water is however to be found some two miles from the city and there i daily sent man to bring us supply in war time therefore the city could not support nor aid an army which would fare badly if locked up here possibly in some seasons it might supply some camels horses and mules but the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https the persians themselves believe this an untenable place in time of war is evident this is one of the few lar ge cities in persia which is not surrounded by wall the amir or governor does not live in birjand itself but half farsakh or two miles across the plains to the where he has handsome residence in pretty garden much to my regret i was too unwell to go and pay my respects to him although i carried an introduction to him from the shah brother he very kindly sent to inquire after my health several times during my stay and the kar ghazar was deputed to come and convey these messages to one can not speak too highly of the extreme civility of persian ofﬁcials if one travels in their country properly accredited and in the right way if one does not naturally one only has to blame one self the consequences one hears good deal about the advantages of being britisher in any country and one could not help being amused at the natives of birjand who could not distinguish european from the blackest bengalese they were all inglis to them some natives came to announc that caravan of twenty of my own countrymen had just gave quite pleasant surprise although i could hardly credit its truth on rushing out of my room to greet them i found myself confronted with crowd of impudent untidy indian pilgrims from bengal on their way to the sacred shrine of meshed most of them were fever others they told had died on the way these caravans have caused good deal of friction both with the persian and russian authorities fear that they should bring plague into persia and transcaspia when one saw these religious people can be so could not with any fairness blame the authorities making fuss and taking stringent measures to protect their own countries and people from probable infection true it should be remembered that the journey of 600 miles across the hot baluchistan desert to sistan and the 500 more miles to meshed ought to have been sufﬁcient disinfectant far the plague went but their wretched appearance was decidedly against them these pilgrims were great nuisance they traded on the fact that they were under british protection they lived in the most abject fashion continually haggling and quarrelling with the natives and decidedly did not add to our popularity in eastern persia to say nothing of the endless trouble and worry they gave to our ofﬁcials at the consulates and on the route i have said the natives not know the difference between these men and englishmen and believe that all british subjects are of the same which one can not quite feel ﬂattered if these pilgrimages could be gradually restricted and eventually stopped i think everybody all round would beneﬁt the pilgrims themselves who might possibly not feel so holy but whose health would not be impaired by the fearful sufferings they have to endure to often obtain very claim to seat in heaven the opening up of the nushki route from quetta to sistan and meshed is responsible the great inﬂux of pilgrims who have been attracted by the glowing reports of how easy it is to travel by this route and so it is very easy men accustomed to that particular kind of trave lling like myself or like traders or government ofﬁcials who can travel with all they want and just they please but not people who have to live from hand to mouth and who are destitute of everything those fellows have idea whatever when they start of what they will have to endure on the road there is not much local trade in birjand but quite brisk transit trade the industrie s are practically conﬁned to the carpets being renowned all over persia their softness smooth texture and colours which are said never to fade but the designs upon them are not always very graceful nor the colours always artistic ally matched the most curious and durable are the hair ones but the design usually with very large medallion in the centre does not seem to appeal to european eyes even the smallest rugs fetch very large sums although called birjand carpets they are mostly manufactured in some of the villages north of birjand especially at darakush among the shops there are few silversmiths some blacksmiths and some sword and gunsmiths the latter manufacture fairly good blades and picturesque matchlocks the trade caravanserais in the town are quaint but to most interesting of all was the one approached by sharp very old an indian british trader had started business attempting to further british trade in these regions this man by name umar khan of the ﬁrm of mahommed ali of quetta was really remarkable fellow if russian trade has not yet succeeded in getting fair hold in birjand if british trade has it so far almost altogether its own way we have only to thank the tact energy patience and talent of this man the patriotism enterprise and hard labour of umar and his ﬁrm deserve indeed the greatest credit and gratitude birjand is most interesting point commercially because it will be here that russian and british competition in eastern persia will eventually come into collision the main imports of the province of kain of which birjand is the capital are now english and russian made merchandise english goods are so far preferred and realize higher prices because of their better quality the articles principally required and which in retail the natives are ready to pay well are ordinary cotton woollen and silk cloths household iron copper brass vessels sugar and crockery especially of shapes suitable persian uses indian tea sold very well at ﬁrst but the market is greatly overstocked at present and great caution should be exercised by indian exporters russian sugar being of much cheaper quality is rapidly driving out of the place french and indian sugars but the quality of russian sugar is so bad that of late there has been rather reaction in favour of shahjahanpur rosa indian sugar there are in birjand several native merchants having fair amounts of capital at their disposal but it appears that the prices which they are willing to pay are so low and the credit required so long that it is most difﬁcult to business with them the retail business is therefore more proﬁtable than the wholesale the competition in cotton cloths and tea is getting very keen and the russians can sell these things so cheaply that it is not possible indian traders to sell at their prices also the russians have learnt to manufacture the stuf f exactly required by the the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https glass ware and fancy goods are chieﬂy sold to the better class people but very great proﬁts especially to passing trading caravans can be assured on such articles the exports consist of wool and skins to russia and to bandar abbas india carpets to russia europe and india barak kind of woollen cloth to various parts of persia opium to china via bandar abbas saffron caraway seeds onaabs to india also via bandar abbas and some english and russian merchandize to herat birjand is the commercial pivot not only of the trade of persia but also of western afghanistan the commercial supremac y of this town will decide whether we are able in the future to hold our own in the south or not but once driven back from this centre we may altogether to the northern and central persian markets while even the southern markets will be very seriously attacked far goods coming overland are concerned umar has made most careful and serious study of the trade of eastern persia and i am certain that if we were to encourage number of other indian traders of the same type to establish themselves in birjand with possible branches in meshed england could make rapid headway against any foreign competition being an asiatic himself although umar has travelled i believe in australia england and speaks hindustani persian and english perfectly he is able to deal with the persians in way in which european would not be so successful he is on most friendly terms with the governor and all the local ofﬁcials by whom he is held in much respect and who have at various times made most extensive purchases in his shop to the amount of several thousand tomans dollars worth of british goods on one occasion he imported the amir and his son double barrel english gun of the latest type some revolvers bicycle with lot of european furniture which he received immediate payment in cash of rupees umar was the ﬁrst indian trader to open shop in birjand by this means he has exercised great inﬂuence over the persian merchants of the place and has induced the leading ones to trade with india in preference to russia by the route his good work has been reported to government by major chevenix trench then consul in sistan now consul in meshed by temple major benn and others on his arrival in birjand he acted agent the british government and was ten months in charge of the consular postal arrangeme nts from sistan to meshed while advising the government on the best ways of promoting trade in those regions work which he did mostly love and out of loyalty he has experimented great deal and his experience is that indigo is the article which commands the greatest sale at present then plain white and indigo dyed cottons of two qualities superior kind with shiny surface the better classes and one rather inferior with gloss the lower people fancy articles ﬁnd sale one of the greatest difﬁculties that trader has to contend with is the impossibility of selling anything ready money and thus making small but quick proﬁts credit has to be given generally one year eighteen months and even long two years even in the few cases where credit has been allowed one or two months the greatest difﬁculty is experienced in obtaining payment the goods supplied threats and applications to the amir being often necessary delays are constant although the money is always paid in the end this necessitates keeping the prices very high to compensate the loss but by careful handling good proﬁts can be made if sufﬁcient capital is at hand to keep the concern going the caravanserai in which umar had hired several rooms which he had turned into shop was now known by the name of the english caravanserai and nearly all the caravans with indian and afghan goods halted there when i went to visit the place there were number of afghan soldiers who had conveyed some prisoners who had escaped into afghan territory back from herat to birjand their riﬂes with bayonets ﬁxed were stacked on the platform outside and they loitered about two soldiers dressed alike some had old english military uniforms which they wore over their ample white or blue cotton trousers these fellows looked very ﬁerce and treacherous with cruel mouths and unsteady eyes they wore pointed embroidered peaks insid their turbans and curly hair ﬂowed upon their shoulders at distance they were most picturesque but extremely dirty number of beluch mari or running camels were being fed with huge balls of paste which were stuffed down their mouths by their owners these camel men were the ﬁrst beluch i had come across and although they wore huge white ﬂowing robes long hair and pointed turbans not unlike the afghans the difference in the features and expression of the faces was quite marked one could see that they were ﬁghting people but they had nice honest faces they looked straight in one eyes and had not the sneakish countenance of their northern neighbours chapter xii loud military abbas ali khan

disastrous effects upon the mud walls all round well upon some of the spectators who were close at hand and who were nearly stunned by the fearful report the ofﬁcers were extremely civil intelligent and full of humour intense astonishment and interest was shown in my repeating riﬂes they had never set their eyes upon nor ever heard that there was such thing repeating riﬂe i was nevertheless much struck by their quickness compared with that of the average european in grasping the mechanism and the way to use the weapons they seemed fully to realize that it would be of little practical use to defend birjand city in case of an attack because it could be commanded from several excellent positions close at hand to the north and furthermore the water supply could easily be cut off they told if i remember right that it was the intention of the persian government to strengthen this place and that some more pieces of artillery were expected we have in birjand an indian doctor by name abbas ali khan who acts british agent he is young fellow of uncommon ability and education capital doctor and most gentlemanly man who has had great experience of the world having travelled with several political missions in various parts of asia including the pekin syndicate survey expedition under command of purvis captain where not only did he look after the medical necessities of large party of europeans indians and chinese but helped to manage large transport of mule carts captain purvis testiﬁes to abbas ali having performed his professional duties with zeal and extraneous duties cheerfully during journey of some miles through china it was in april 1897 that abbas ali khan at hours notice accompanied major brazier creagh mission to sistan when british inﬂuence in that part of persia was the mission returned to india in october of the same year but abbas ali was sent on second journey to sistan in charge of small party from december 1897 to july 1898 when he was entrusted with political business which required great discretion and tact it is greatly to his credit that he spite of many difﬁculties and win the conﬁdence and friendship of ofﬁcials of district where all british subjects were regarded with undisguised suspicion and distrust better proof of this could be furnished than by reproducing here literal translation of quaint document dated may 1898 given him unsolicited by mir masum sar deputy governor of sistan whose ofﬁcial seal it bears god is acquainted with what is in the minds of men beyond doubt and without hesitation it is rightly and justly stated that military doctor mirza abbas ali khan has during the period of his stay in sistan displayed his personal tact and natural ability he has treated with great civility and politeness any person who has applied to him medical attendance and treatment of diseases and has in case whatever demanded payment or anything from anybody he has never hesitated to give gratuitous medical aid with medicines or personal attendance and all the natives from the highest to the lowest are well satisﬁed and under great obligation to him it is hoped that the trouble taken and the pecuniary loss suffered by him will be appreciated by his government i have personally greatly beneﬁted by his treatment of my personal diseases and ailments and i trust that he will receive great favour from his government naturally the medicines are supplied to him by the government but it would be becoming if the government saw its way to reward men of this type the soul which they put into their work this it is after all that wins the esteem of the natives more than the actual cost of the medicines few grains of quinine or few ounces of castor oil have often been the means of obtaining information and advantages the british government which if properly used may be worth millions of pounds sterling it is to these pioneers that the nation should be grateful to these people who build sound foundations on which the empire can spread without fear of collapsing we are indebted far more than to the folks who stop at home and reap with little trouble the credit of the work which has been done by others abbas ali has gained most intimate knowledge of the country and people which gives him enormous inﬂuence and he has been the means of smoothing the way to considerable extent the new trade route to quetta major chevenix trench consul at meshed fully testiﬁes to this and speaks very highly of abbas ali political work and so does captain are in charge of the road who writes that in his belief the growth of british inﬂuence in sistan and birjand is due in small degree to the tact discretion and conscientious dischar ge of duties of abbas ali abbas ali was ordered again to persia in august 1899 and has remained there since stationed at birjand the russians have established rival agent to look after their own interests in the person of vezirof f gazumbek subject and mussulman this man very politel y called upon in great state wearing decoration of the third class which had just been bestowed upon him by the shah and accompanied by four cossacks who were on their way to the russian consulate at sistan to relieve the escort there he and abbas ali were socially and outwardly on excellent terms but great rivalry necessarily existed in their work the russian had gained temporary advantage in the eyes of the natives by the honour conferred upon him by the shah and it was pity that an exception to the general rule could not be made and similar or higher honour obtained abbas ali whose work certainly would some consideration matters of that sort although of absolutely signiﬁcance in themselves are of great import ance in country like persia where appearances can not altogether be neglected the british government one feels makes primary and most palpable mistake in not being represented by more english consular ofﬁcials not necessarily sent by the london foreign ofﬁce but rather of that most excellent type the military political servants such those who are now found in some few persian cities the establishment of here at birjand instead of the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https political agency would i think also be of very great help at the present moment and would increase british prestige there the afternoon of that day was spent in returning the visits of abbas ali khan the russian agent and the karghazar everywhere i met with extreme civility both the british and the russian agent lived in nice houses handsomely carpeted and furnished only abbas ali place had more appearance than that of the russian because of the many books the red cross trunks of medicine and surgical instruments and folding camp furniture the house of the russian was practically in persian style with handsome carpets and cushions but with hardly any european chairs or furniture birjand is very high up above sea level and we did not feel any too warm the thermometer was seldom more than in the shade during the day and from to at night in the evenings the four cossacks of the sistan consular escort who had been detained here and occupied one of the rooms of the carava nserai sat out in the open singing with melodious voices in chorus the weird songs of their country these men were really wonderful they had come down from turkestan journey of close upon ﬁve hundred miles riding their own horses with only few roubles in their pockets and little more than the clothing they wore their riﬂes and bandoliers of cartridges the affection their horse s was quite touching and it was fully reciprocated by the animals one or two of the men slept by the horses so that one should steal them and the animals were constantly and tenderly looked after there was bright scene in the graveyard behind the caravanserai the day that all the women went to visit the graves and to lay offerings of food rice and dried fruit upon the tombs of their dead little conical white tents were pitched by hawkers and dozens of women in their white chudders prowled about like so many ghosts or else squatted down in rows beside or upon the graves the doleful voices of blind beggars sang mournful tunes and cripples of all kinds howled charity persian crowd is always almost colourless and hardly relieved by an occasional touch of green in the men kamarbands or bright spot of vermilion in the children clothes the illustration representing the scene shows on the side of the observer the ruined fortress at the western end of the city of birjand and the near range of hills to the which i mentioned would afford most excellent positions artillery commanding birjand the domed building in the centre of the photograph is one of the adjoining every cemetery in persia to which the bodies are conveyed and prepared previous to interment the persian government have belgian customs ofﬁcial in birjand but he generally spends much of his time travelling along the afghan frontier he had left birjand when i arrived women v isiting g raves of r elatives b irjand ruined fort can be observed on hill with more pity than regret i watched at the caravanserai the departure of the indian pilgrims the shrine at meshed they had obtained number of donkeys and mules and were having endless rows with the natives about payment eventually however the caravanserai court having been pandemonium several hours all was settled their rags were packed in bundles upon the saddles and the pilgrims shivering with fever were shoved upon the top of the loads there was more fanaticism than life left in them the four cossacks also who were at the caravanserai received orders to leave at once their post at sistan and gaily departed in charge of the british consular courier who was to show them the way this courier travels from meshed to sistan with relays of two horses each in connection with the postal service the service is worked entirely by the consuls and by the agent at birjand and is remarkably good and punctual considering the difﬁculties encountered there is also persian postal service of some sort but unfortunate is the person who rashly entrusts letters to it even the persian ofﬁcials themselves prefer to use the english post the russians have established similar service from their frontier to sistan but it does not run so frequently the making up second caravan in hurry was easy matter but event ually i was able to persuade one of the men who had accompanied across the salt desert to procure fresh camels and convey there this he did and after halt of three days we were on the road again to cross our third desert between birjand and sistan distance of some 210 miles chapter xiii departure from cloud like skeleton village of ruined beautiful by native callers towers at impression of foreign twin the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https large and most respectful crowd collected in and out of the caravanserai to watch the departure of my caravan at ﬁve in the even ing on november 27th we were soon out of birjand and steering course passed one or two large mud enclosures with few but otherwise there was hardly any vegetation visible in the immediate neighbourhood of birjand everything was barren barren could be overhead the sky after sunset was most peculiarly marked by weird black hand of perfect but gigantic proportions spreading its long bony ﬁngers over us night came on it grew very cold and the skeleton hand of mist compressed itself into nasty black cloud few minutes later regular downpour drenched us to the skin and the camels experienced great difﬁculty in walking on the slippery mud this was the ﬁrst rain we had seen or rather felt since leaving teheran our macintoshes had been applied to such usages wrapping up cases of photographic plates and enveloping notebooks so that we could not very well get at them now that we needed them without taking all the loads down so we went on until our clothes were perfectly satura ted when at least we had the satisfaction of knowing that we could not get wetter than we were the rain came down in bucketfuls over an hour then luckily stopped and in few moments with howling wind rising the sky was clear again and the myriads of stars shone bright like so many diamonds the cutting wind and our wet clothes made this march rather chilly one although one felt some relief at the sensation of moisture after so many months of intense dryness there was nothing whatever to see on any side and i have never thanked my stars so much when after marching thirteen hours we reached the village of muht place of fair size in picturesque little valley with nice hills on all sides to the of the village was an interesting demolished fortress standing on low hill it had very deep well in the centre within its walls which were of stone with twelve turrets round it at the foot of the hill was haoz or water tank now dry which the natives said was very ancient and which they attributed to the hindoos to the west lake was said to exist called kiemarakalah by the side of mountain not unlike swiss roof in shape while to the of the fortress were rugged rocks and low the elevation of this village was feet we left muht at noon of the same day and passed small village on our way then we gradually ascended to pass feet high on the other side of which was not from vegetation but because the clayish soil was of that hills to the east and west it was hardly possible to imagine more dreary desolate scenery than that through which we were going there was not living soul beyond ourselves anywhere in sight the camels which had caught cold in the shower of the previous night had to be given rest and we halted again after ﬁve hours march the cold was intense whether owing to the moisture in the atmosphere or to some other cause we had on the evenin g of the 28th really beautiful sunset the sky was dazzling with brilliant gold and vermilion tints at midnight we were again under way ﬁrst across ﬂat then over undulating country after which we got among the mountains and between precipitous gorges this was quite welcome change but not the camels the way being somewhat rough and stony we had some little difﬁculty in going up the steep pass feet the camels panting terribly we suffered from the cold and the heavy dew which positively drenched men camels and baggage it was quite bad having been out in the rain we were so soaked i unfortunately became ill again fever attacking afresh more ﬁercely than ever sadek too and abbas ali the camel man were also taken very sick on the other side of the pass we went through steep narrow and most fantastically picturesque deﬁle of rocks and eventually passed the little hamlet of golandeh which boasts of less than mud huts and many fruit trees we had descended to precisely the altitude of muht or feet from this village the sistan track descends few hundred yards and then proceeds in south by direction over ﬂat stretch with some hills very high mountain could be seen to the south by and another quite pointed to the south by at to the some twenty miles from muht was another tiny hamlet built against the foot of the mountain along which we had come large plain opened before us to the at golandeh we were besieged by natives applying medicine there seemed to be hardly soul in the place who was not affected by some complaint or other affections of the eyes were most common those who wanted medici ne begged money or lumps of sugar latter there is apparently some difﬁculty in obtaining here and which they seemed to have perfect craving men women and children implored to be given some there were two towers at golandeh the lower one quadrangular in shape and the upper ﬂoor had recesses in all the rooms storing grain and provisions we left camp at and all went well until about ten when sadek took it into his head that we were travelling in the wrong direction and proceeded to put us right i being fast asleep on my camel the camel man having never been on this route did not know the way and depended great deal on the bearings i gave him daily by my compass when i awoke we had got sadly mixed up among big boulders and sharp rocks from which the camels had the greatest difﬁculty in extricating themselves and we wasted good deal of time in helping the animals to get on to better ground they continually stumb led and fell among the loose stones the loads got undone several times and we were all three so ill that we had not the strength to tie them up again properly on the saddles in the course of time i put the party on the right track again and more than one hour we went up and down steep but not high passes through deﬁles and across small stream we were following the dry among rocks in gorge and we arrived at spot where there was rock barrier several feet high beneath us which made it impossible camels to get down so abbas ali was despatched to try and ﬁnd an easier way while sadek and i were left to freeze in cutting the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https camel man returned and led the camels back long distance until we came to faint track along streamlet which we tried to follow but it went along such precipitous places that we had to abandon it fear the camels who could not get proper might come to grief in birjand i had only succeeded in obtaining just sufﬁcient animals to carry my loads sadek and myself and so was not very anxious to run the risk of losing any and becoming stranded in such an inhospitable place we eventually contrived to take the camels down to the ﬂat without any serious mishaps and wandered and wandered about and went over another compass being all we had to go by sadek whose high fever had affected his vision now swore that we were going back towards birjand instead of going on and said he was certain my compass was wrong but i paid heed to his remarks and by carefully steering our course with the involved reckless waste of matches owing to the high eventually got the party into the open upon wide plain of sand and gravel here having shown abbas ali the right bearings to follow i got upon my camel again wrapped myself well in my blankets and went fast asleep so unfortunately did abbas ali who was tired out after his exertions among the rocks and at 3 i woke up to ﬁnd the camels going and where they pleased and the camel man buried under his thick felt coat snoring so soundly upon his camel that it took good deal of shouting to wake him up i had idea where we had drifted while i had been asleep and the night being an unusually dark one we could not well see what was ahead of us so we decided to halt until sunrise in the d eser t tamarisks in the foreground when it grew light in the morning i was much interested in some curious circular and quadrangular pits only few yards from where we had stopped which were used shelters men and sheep but were now deserted these pits were from four to six feet deep below the level of the ground and from ten to thirty feet in diameter when circular section being partitioned sheep by fence of thick but soft cane that grows in the neighbourhood of water in the part reserved human beings there was circular ﬁreplace of stones and some holes in the earth at the sides storing foodstuf the lower portion of the inside wall all round the pit was of beaten earth up to height of two feet above which wall of stones carefully ﬁtted one upon the other was constructed from two to four feet high up to the level of the earth here projecting screen of cane was erected all round at an angle conver ging towards the centre of the pit the double purpose of preventing the sheep escaping and of sheltering the inmates during the fearful sand and windstorms that sweep with great force along the earth surface the entrance was cut on one side with an incline to afford easy access to the pit at this particular place there were altogether some ﬁfteen of these pits and in one of them we lighted big ﬁre with some shrubs we collected and rested some three hours to give sadek time to cook my breakfast the difference in the temperature betw een the interior of these pits and the open ground was extraordinary they were comfortably warm even when it was unpleasantly cold one peeped out of them while sadek was busy with his culinary work and the camel man chewed dried pieces of bread and keshk cheese i proceeded to ﬁnd our right way it lay about one mile to the east of the pits on resuming our march ﬁve farsakhs twenty miles from golandeh we reached sahlabad an unimportant village south there was to be seen an extensive white salt deposit which at ﬁrst had all the appearance of large lake and stream of salt water ﬂowed across the large valley and through the village from to to the east there was long range of mountains all with high sand accumulations at their base greys in several beautiful tones were prevalent and there were stretches of black brown burnt sienna and pale cadmium yellow to the whence we had come low hills were visible and to the fairly high ones sahlabad was depressing place the natives were in abject poverty and their habitations dismal to say the least the huts were partly under ground and the top aperture of the domed roof was screened by hood with an opening to the ﬁrewood was obtainable at this place and the only water the natives had to drink was the salt water from the stream at sahlabad we had descended to an elevation of which made considerable change in the temperature we encountered here large caravan in charge of beluch drivers and among other curious articles one of the camels carried beautiful new enamelled iron bedstead the reader may suppose that after several months of sleeping on the ground i wished it had been mine i did not on the contrary i was particularly struck on that occasion by what an elaborate clumsy useless thing it seemed although bedsteads go it was one of the best to the south stood high mountain very closely resembling in shape the fujiama of japan only this one had somewhat wider angle beyond the white expanse of salt to the east there was low ﬂattish country but to the west and rose fairly high the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https valley itself in which we were was some two and half miles broad and covered with grey sand in the centre of the village in the neighbourhood of which we camped was circular tower and an octangular tower in two tiers also partly ruined the latter stood at the corner of an enclosure which at one time must have been the beginning of the village wall chapter xiv suspicious haunt of daily olcanic salt caravan from quetta we remained at sahlabad the whole afternoon and we were visited in camp by number of people who were most inquisitive to know what i posse ssed and how much money i carried and other such pertinent questions which they put to sadek and my camel man also peculiar lot of fellows with very ugly countenances and armed to their teeth passed by they were mounted on ﬁne horses with gaudy saddles and on coming suddenly and unexpectedly upon us seemed quite upset instead of salaaming us had been usual with the few people we had so far met they whipped their horses and galloped away sadek said they must be ounted soldiers abbas ali said they were robbers from afghanistan we shall see later what they were at we was quite we had gone but two miles when distant voice called upon us to stop by his speech the stranger seemed very excited when he reached us and said we must keep the track to the left and not follow the one to the right where two trails branched off we could not see his face he kept some twenty or thirty yards off and besides his face was wrapped all round in the tail of his turban we professed to be thankful the information but continued on the track to the right which seemed greatly to disturb least judging by the number of times he entreated us to follow his advice both sadek and abbas ali corroborated my conviction that this was trap laid us the man on seeing us go different way from the one he advised us ran away and presently we heard some shrill whistles which were doubt signals to his companions we had gone but another mile when suddenly ﬁgure with gun in hand sprang before us and seized the camel man by the chest whose caravan is this he shouted it is the ferenghi hastily replied the camel man there was short pause in the conversation when our interlocutor looking up at my camel which had got close upon him perceived himself covered by my riﬂe sadek had leapt off his camel quick lightning and shoved the muzzle of his winchester in the man face the stranger demeanou r was most peculiar and his answers incoherent well ﬂippant sadek ﬁrst disarmed his adversary then turned his own riﬂe the round way about and gave the man good pounding his impertinence in holding up my camel man we heard number of voices of people hidden all around when the fellow managed to effect an escape he gave an alarm signal and we saw lot of black ﬁgures jump up and stampede their lives this furnished little variation in our dreary night marches and we proceeded briskly sadek abbas ali and i being most grateful to our unknown friends the amusement they had provided us some three miles further we came upon several caravans that had halted and were hiding they were aware of robbers being had seen fresh tracks of their horses during the day and were in fear of being attacked at ﬁrst when we appeared on the scene they mistook us brigands and we discovered them hidden we also mistook them robbers so that the beginning of our interview did not lack in humour we had hearty laugh over it all when their identity and ours were establish ed and after few minutes halt we continued our journey on soft sand rather undulating with frequent depressions in places we travelled the whole night of december 1st passing to the right of the salt which looked like big stretch of country covered with snow and threw out certain luminosity possibly because the salt crystals reﬂected and condensed what light there was from the stars the hours of the night went by we gradually left the salt stretch behind us to the north and proceeded on the ﬂat some distance in the morning we passed small villag right up on the mountain side one mile and half to the west of our course we then entered dry between high sand hills and having marched nineteen hours continuously camels and men were rather in need of rest at one on december 1st we pitched our camp in the middle of the feet broad here only place where we could get draught of air the heat was suffocating the thermometer registering 1 altitude being feet we expected to ﬁnd water of some kind we had omitted to ﬁll up the skins and load the camels unnecessarily but unluckily there was water anywhere at hand abbas ali was sent to the village we had some four miles get some but being too tired to carry the heavy skin down to us again he entrusted it to boy giving him full directions where our camp was the boy did not ﬁnd where we were and in the meantime sadek and i had our throats parched with thirst abbas ali returned at seven and had to be despatched back to the village in search of the lost boy and the water skin it was ten when he returned and after hours of dryness we had our ﬁrst drink of water it was brackish but it tasted delicious we were compelled to remain here the night several caravans passed through going north and also lot of suspicious people whose manner was so peculiar that we were compelled to sit up the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https part of the night and keep watc h on my property some of the caravan men who had gone through had warned us that we had encamped in regular nest of robbers and that three men had been robbed and murdered at this spot only few days before the high sand hills afford excellent hiding places these gentry it appears that the men on horseback whom we had seen at sahlabad and who had bolted on coming suddenly upon us were the high chief of the robber band and some of his confederates likely on their way to birjand to dispose of booty being so near the afghan border these fellows enjoy practical safety by merely going from one country into the other to suit their plans and to evade search parties occasionally sent out their capture we had come forty miles from sahlabad and abbas ali brought us the news from the village that we should ﬁnd water on our course ﬁfteen miles more and habitations more miles unluckily we had hardly enough provisions to last one day and we perceived fair prospect before us of having to go one day without food when abbas ali was despatche d third time another eight miles walk to the village and back to see what he could get in the way of edibles he returned riding cow in company with another man and third fellow on mule carrying fat sheep the latter was there and then purchased and killed and we had copious breakfast before starting along the winding dry bed of the river at 1 on december 2nd before us to the south by was lofty mountain which appeared about ﬁfteen miles off and directly in front of our course was also another and more extensive long mountain stretching from to three miles off with precipitous sides towards the and north the sides were padded with sand accumulations which reached almost to the summit of the lower portions of the mountain barrier to the approximately twenty miles of f stood high range west and winds blew every day in ﬁerce manner usually from sunset till about ten or eleven the following morning at which hour they somewhat abated they are doubt due to the great jumps in the temperature at sunset and sunrise on december 1st instance from in the sun during the day the thermometer dropped to at night or of frost on december 2nd at noon it was up again high 1 we traversed plain twelve miles long and at its course where the mountain ranges met there occurred curious of volcanic formation on the top of the black hills of gravel and sand lying in confused mass if left so by an upheaval rose pinnacle of bright yellow and red stone with patches of reddish earth and of dissimilar texture to the underlying surface of the hill there seemed little doubt that both the rocky pinnacle and the red earth had been thrown there by some under the projecting rocks and masses of soft earth one could in fact ﬁnd different formation altogether bearing the same characteristics the remainder of the hill surface this was on the northern slope of that hill the track turned here due east and rounded it were this curious mount we found in reality on the other side large crater basin with lips of confused masses of earth both vermilion and of vivid burnt sienna colour well most peculiar in spiral formation all round the crater looking if worn into that shape by some boiling liquid substance to the on the very top of hill of older formation was perched at dangerous angle another great yellow boulder like the one we had seen on the north side of the crater diameter of several hundred yards the earth was much disturbed one mile further in traversi ng basin mile broad it was impossible not to notice curious range of hills with some strange enormous baked they had evidently been exposed to terriﬁc heat upright or at different angles to the east side of the hills stuck partly in the sand and salt with which the ground was here covered irregular and unsystematic heaps of rock on which sand had accumulated up to certain height were to be seen to the south and huge boulders of rich colour lay scattered here and there whereas near the mountains which enclosed the basin both to south and east there were thousands of little hillocks of rock and sand in the most disconnected order we went on two perpendicular barriers were before us to the gigantic walls somewhat higher than the other and of picturesque dark burnt sienna colour in horizontal strata the whole country about here seemed to have been much deranged at different periods we passed hillocks in vertical strata of brittle stone in long quadrangular prisms but evidently these strata had solidiﬁed in horizontal position and had been turned over by sudden commotion of the earth this conclusion was strengthened by the fact that the same formation in horizontal position was noticeable all along the strata in one or two places showing strange distortions with actual bends continuing in curves not unlike the letter in the dry river bed there were large rocks cut into the shape of tables on single pillar stand but these were of course made by the erosion of water and at subsequent date further on we found tiny stream of salt water in the picturesque weird and puzzling bit of scenery can be found in persia if one carefully examined each hill each rock and tried to speculate on their formation from the hundred feet or so above the salt stream came to sprin one could call it by that delicious sweet water the water dripped at the rate of about tumbler an hour but gallon or two had collected in pool directly under the rock with refreshing border of green grass round it we gladly and carefully transferred the liquid into one of the skins by means of cup judiciously handled so not to take up the deep sediment of mud in the shallow pool we came across very large caravan from quetta in charge of some beluch drivers one experience of how things are packed by persian was greatly struck by the neat wooden packing boxes duly marked and numbered i inquired whose caravan it was and the beluch said it belonged to two english sahibs who were ten miles behind and were expected to catch it up during the night the names of the two sahibs were so mispronounced by the beluch that i could not to save my life understand what they the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https halted in the gorge at four having come only sixteen miles from my last camp altitude feet chapter xv sadek two enterprising english circular ind and electricity in the and our welcome ruski or inglis several miles of villages and maps and foreign by major benn we intended continuing our journey after dinner this camp being well screened on all sides sadek gave way to his ambition to have the camp lighted up by number of candles with which he was always most wasteful he had two candles alight where he was doing his cooking i had two more to my writing by abbas ali had also two to nothing by luckily there was not breath of wind to disturb the illumination towards nine we heard noises of camels and horses hoofs stumbling against the rocks down the gor ge and my ears caught the welcome sound of english voices what can all those lights be said one they look like candles replied the other they are candles i intervened will you not get off your horses and have some dinne r with by the light of them who in the world is that queried one of the riders of the other evidently taken aback at being addressed in english in such queer place and at such time of the night my name is henry savage landor what not tibet landor our names are clemenson and what in the world are you doing here have you not some companions yes i have here they are three persian kittens clemenson had some big dogs with him the moment the cats were let out of the box to be introduced there was chase but the kittens climbed in due haste up the side of the cliff and left the disappointed dogs below to bark on this high point of vantage they squatted down and watched our proceedings below with the greatest interest it was real delight to meet countrymen of one own after so many weeks of loneliness these two enterprising english traders had brought over very large caravan from quett and were on their way to meshed having done good business in sistan they had with them every possible article they could think of from tea to phonographs lamps razors music boxes magic lanterns bedsteads cottons silks cloths chairs clocks watches and i not know what else i believe that it was the lar gest caravan of that kind that had ever come over to persia from beluchistan after pleasant interview of an hour or so and what humble refreshments i could offer they were compelled to continue their journey to the north the kittens having anxiously watched the departure of clemenson dogs leapt back from rock to rock and down on to my carpet all three sitting usual in row in front of my plate while i was having my dinner with their greedy eyes on the meat and occasionally also one of their paws we did not make start till when there was moonlight the way was very bad among stones and boulders short distance we travelled between high cliffs and boulders then between low hills much further apart on our left we came to most peculiar formation of rock which seemed almost like castle and from this point we got into long and wide plain most uninteresting and swarming with troublesome kind of small ﬂy rugged mountain to the north being higher and more vividly coloured than the rest attracted the eye one tried hard to ﬁnd something to admire in the scenery and to the we saw the back view of the plateau we had skirted the day before to the lay another topped high mountain like the section of cone which we had noticed on our previous march we were now marching due east and after some sixteen miles journey from our last camp we again entered hilly portion of country we made halt of three hours from 8 to 11 to have our breakfast then we entered the hills by one of the usual dry channels formed by the water washing down with great force in rainy weather from the hillsides after half mile we emer ged again into another plain three miles long and about equally wide with very broken low rocky mountains to the east and low sand hills to the south to the in the direction we were following stood mountain which however possessed very beautiful lines more interesting and quaint was the circular crater in conical mountain to the of the long dreary plain we were now traversing the mouth of this large crater was much lower on the west side than on the thus exposing to the full view of the traveller the entire opening in the centre of the mountain in colour having gone some twelve miles more we stopped at four in the afternoon in bitterly penetrating cold wind which seemed to have most uncomfortable effect upon one nervous system whether it was that the intense dryness caused an excess of electricity or what i not know but one ached all over in frightful manner and exper ienced the same feeling when exposed to an electric current one farsakh before reaching camp we had passed the camping ground of angiloh where tiny drip of fresh water exists we happily found here quantity of wood abandoned by the clemenson caravan which we put on our camels and carried further down into the plain where having found the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https in the ground affording some shelter from the fearful wind we halted to wait until the moon rose my fever seized violently on that night and i experienced intense pain in my spine my legs and arms more especially in places where i had received wounds on previous journeys we left again in the middle of the night at 3 and great effort it was too to get out of one warm blankets and scramble on the camel aching i was all over and with the indescribable exhaustion that fever of the desert brings on luckily with the rising of the moon the wind had somewhat abated but the electricity in the air was unpleasant it was extraordinary one was absolutely saturated with it and dischar ged sparks from one ﬁnger when one touched anything that was good conductor in the morning at the foot of the mountains we passed large fortress where they told twenty soldiers had been stationed the previous year in order to suppress brigandage that had been rampant here both afghan and sistan robbers seemed to be most partial to this spot probably because it is that at which all the caravans from birjand and meshed conver ge on their way to sistan we actually perceived some trees in the distance and at last we arrived at zemahlabad quadrangular fort with two such peculi ar structures at the sides that i really could not at ﬁrst guess what they were sadek called upon to explain was wiser and we had to ﬁnd solution to our speculation from one of the local authorities they were windmills and most ingenious and simple they were too when once one had grasped the mechanism of them only in their case the large opening to the east and west to let in and out the wind had been screened with elaborate work and it was not easy to understand the principle of the device until one visited the interior we shall come later in our journey to some quite superior ones which i will endeavour to describe there were many palm trees at this place and some few patches of vegetation great many sheds had been erected and hundreds of cows were to be seen the land being marshy provided fair pasturages altitude to the extreme east of the long valley we had traversed the bandan mountains conver ged into an acute angle with those on the opposite side of the valley and on the side we had again the same formation of rock in horizontal strata with some contortions at its western end salt stream ﬂowed here through narrow gorge between the picturesque barrier to the north and the handsome hills to the great number of palm trees gave quite tropical appearance to this gorge although the whitish sand mixed with salt impressed one like dirty snow and the sky was also whitish and promising real snow it was none too just before reaching called darban by some natives noticed on the precipitous slopes of the mountain to the several buildings in ruins said to be ancient tombs they were domed at the foot of the mountain were the remains of village bandan consisted of quadrangular walled village with ﬁve high towers and two more partly collapsed the lower part of the village regular of stone and mud the upper portion of mud bricks it appeared to have been built at different epochs the half especially seeming more modern than the portion holes about three feet above the ground in the wall served the purpose of windows to the houses adjoining the wall inside the castle and stone of suitable size shoved into the aperture was the shutter the village wall had two entrances on the side where outside the wall could be seen ﬁfteen small domed ovens of the usual persian type baking bread the paste of which is plastered on the inside of the dome when sufﬁciently heated the highest tower was on the side and all of these structures had foundation of stone but the remainder was of mud we saw here string of picturesque women they were carrying loads of wood and heavy bags of wheat on their heads on perceiving unexpectedly they tried to run away and did so but not before i had got the good snapshot of them here reproduced it can be seen by this photograph what long steps these women took and how those that carried heavier loads swung their arms about to diminish the ef fort and balance themselves they walked with good deal of spring in their knees these women had much stronger features than the persian generally have and fact were women one or two only had the hindoo type with large soft drooping eyes large hook noses and lips with small receding chins the younger ones were strikingly handsome on our last march we had come from north to south but now after short halt we went on towards the on what we thought would be our last two marches before reaching the capital city of sistan only some sixty miles off soon after leaving bandan we found ourselves in an open plain with gradually vanishing mountains to the to the the barrier about one mile from bandan suddenly ceased in gentle slope east and now that the plain became of immense breadth one could see two isolated low hill ranges barring which in the arc of circle between and south we had nothing before us except ﬂat dreary stretch of sand and stones meeting the sky on the horizon line on getting nearer the swamp formed by the halmund river and others losing themselves into the sand and ﬂooding part of that region the whole country was covered with high reeds and small water channels which constantly made us deviate from our course in the middle of the night we got so mixed up that we were unable to go on it is most dangerou s to make camels get into water channels especially if muddy without being certain of their depth the brutes if sinking are seized with panic and collapse or in trying to get out quickly often slip sideways and get split in two which necessitates their being killed in the morning we passed two cossacks from the sistan consulate escort who having been relieved were now on their way back to russia they gave us hearty greeting and shortly after messenger from the british consul in sistan handed letter most kind invitation from major benn to go and stay with him at the consulate towards noon we reached nasirabad altitude very old village founded by one malik nasir khan kayani is well known being the former rulers of sistan and every the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https being called malik we stopped couple of hours lunch the principa l house in the village being vacated by the courteous inmates my use the arrival of ferenghi excited considerable attention and numerous and anxious inquiries were made whether i was ruski or inglis on learning that i was inglis they expressed their unsolicited conviction that all inglis were good people and ruski all bad and doubt if i had been ruski the reverse conviction would have been expressed with similar eagerness the natives were polite but extremely noisy shouting and yelling at the top of their voices when they spoke the men wore large white turbans over their white skull caps long blue shirts opened and buttoned on the left side reaching to below their knees and the enormous afghan trousers from nasirabad we came across long uninterrupted row of ruined villages and towns stretching in line some eight miles from north to south the most northern one had the appearance of fortress with very high wall still in fair preservation and several more of these fortresses were to be seen along the line of houses the majority of dwellings being outside these forts the domed of which were in perfect the identical architecture and characteristics of persian houses of we were benighted again curiously enough even within mile or so from on asking some natives where the city of nasirabad or nasratabad it is marked in capital letters on english maps even those of the indian trigonometrical survey nobody could tell and everybody protested that such city existed the real name of it sher of course i only learnt later this was puzzling but not astonishing there is deal of fancy nomenclature on english maps eventually when i had almost despaired of reaching the place that night although i could not have been more than from it i appealed to another passer riding briskly on donkey how far are we from nasratabad never heard the name is there town here called nasirabad there is such you must have come through small village by that name two farsakhs of yes i have you happen to know where the english consulate is oh yes everybody knows the english consulate i will take you there it is only short distance from here near the city of sher thanks to this fellow few minutes later i found myself greeted most effusively by major and benn in their charming mud consulate this was on the evening of december 6th chapter xvi english fancy geographical main centre of the of the natives major splendid type of british and russian shikin maghut increasing trade of the nushki horses the wind of 120 days benn bazaar disappointing it may seem that the natives themselves should be barefaced enough not to call their city by the fancy name given it by certain british geographers we might well explain why the natives call the capital of sistan by its real name the three words mean the city of nasr nasr being an abbreviation of shah in honour of whom the city was named in sistan itself the city goes by the shortened name of mere sher or city but letters sent by persians from other parts of the shah dominions are generally addressed or simply sistan women at b andan the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https g olam j elami and his p atients when the place was ﬁrst conquered by the father of the present amir it was spoken of nusratabad or the city or victory just the same we speak of the city of the commune or the eternal city or the city of fogs the name nusratabad only applied to the victory and not to the city we should certainly not wish to see the names of the three above illustrations given on maps paris rome or london calling the city nasirabad the trigonometrical survey maps there is excuse whatever this which is mere the only one attributes to the city the name of small village some eight miles of the present is not more than twenty years old it has double wall all round higher one with semicircular castellated towers and lower on mud bank with outwardly projecting semicircular protected platforms the walls of which eight feet high are loopholed in primitive fashion on the inner side of the lower wall there is platform all along the wall soldiers to stand upon the city wall forty feet high is separated from this outer defence by road all round the city and outside of all there is moat but with very little water in it the wall on the south side really has ten towers the two central ones being close together and larger than the others between which is the principal city gate reached by an earthen bridge and tortuous way the entrance of the outer wall is not in line with the inner the east and west side have only eight towers including the corner ones the double towers being the fourth and ﬁfth every tower is semicircular with loopholes pointing towards the useful in case of defence large opening pieces of artillery the corner towers have two of these apertures one under the other kind of bastion or battlement has been formed by piling up the earth removed from the moat round the lower wall the moat is forty feet broad and thirty feet deep large road was made not long ago round three sides of the city by colonel trench then our consul there so that the amir could drive to his garden quarter of mile outside the north city gate the residence of the amir son the on the west side of there is merely sheep track the m ain s treet s her i asr ya showing centre of city in the corner of the city is higher wall enclosing large space and forming the citadel and anderun in which the amir and part of his family reside there are three large towers to each side of the quadrangle the centre tower to the south being of much larger proportions than the others lower outer wall surrounds the higher one and in the large tower is the entrance gate to the governor citadel the inside of the city of is neither beautiful nor interesting from pictorial point of view there is main street with some mud buildings standing up others tumbled down the page illustration shows the most attractive and interesting point of the city the centre of the quadrangle where the two streets one from south to north the other from east to west intersect at right angles dome of mud bricks has been erected over the street and under its shade number of the amir soldiers were generally to be seen with their riﬂes resting idle against the wall the type of sistan residence can be seen in the two hovels to the right of the observer in this photograph the two hoods on the highest point of the dome are two typical ventilators to the left the large doorways are mere shops with kind of narrow verandah on which the purchasers squat when buying goods the main street is very narrow and has small platform almost all along its sides on which the natives sit smoking their kalians or the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https was really very much impressed each time that i visited the city in the consul company by the intense respect shown by these people to our representative there was not single man who did not rise and salaam when we rode through the bazaar while many also came forward to seize the consul hand and pay him the customary compliments major benn modestly put down this civility of the natives to the popularity of his predecessor major trench and the good manners which he had taught these men but major benn himself with his most affable manner his unsophisticated ways absolutely devoid of nonsensical or false pride is to my mind also to be held responsible the reverence which he inspires among the masses to personally i must confess it was very great pleasure indeed to see an english gentleman held in such respect and that solely on account of his tact and savoir fair it is not common sight of course certain amount of show has also to be made to impress the natives but show alone some believe will be of little good unless there is something more attractive behind it major benn seemed to be everybody welcomed friend everybody whether rich or poor whether in smart clothes or rags gleamed with delight they saw him come and major benn stopped his horse now to say kind word to merchant then to shake hands with native friend further on to talk to little child who had run to the door of his parents mud hut to say salameleko to the consul it is men with sound common sense civil manners and human sympathy of benn type that we want to represent england everywhere and these men i have ever maintained can great britain more good in foreign countries in day than all the ofﬁcial in year it is mistake to believe that persians or other asiatics are only impressed by gold braiding and by large retinue of servants the natives have wonderful intuitive way of correctly gauging people we civilised folk not seem able to and it is the man himself and his doings that they judge and criticise and not so much the amount of gold braiding on man coat or trousers or the cut of resplendent uniform in the northern portion of the main street are the few shops with english and russian goods most of the articles i saw in the couple of indian shops were of indian or english of the articles appeared to of german manufacture like the usual cheap goods one sees in the indian bazaars on the opposite side of the road was the rival merchant who dealt in russian goods and he seemed to be doing quite brisk business he appeared to deal mostly in clothes there is kind of moleskin russian cloth called the shikin maghut of various shades colours and qualities which commands ready sale both in khorassan and sistan although its price is high and its quality and dye not particularly good with little enterprise indian manufacturers could certainly make similar and better cloth and easily undersell the russian material it is most satisfactory to ﬁnd from capt ain are statement that indian trade by the sistan route which was absolutely nil in the year and only amounted to some rupees in made sudden jump to rupees in the following twelve months it has since been steadily on the increase can be seen by the following ﬁgures rupees 1 these ﬁgures are the total amount of imports and exports by the nushki route beginning from 1st of april each year in the imports were rs the exports rs when the route comes to be better known the returns will inevitably be greatly increased but of course only service of motor make this route really practical one trade on lar ge scale the cost of transport at present is too great point which should be noted in connection with the railway is that every year great number of horses are brought from meshed to india via quetta remount purposes in the number of horses brought by dealers to quetta amounted to 408 and the khorassan horses are most excellent they were promptly sold at very remunerative prices the average price capital horse in persia is from 80 to 100 rupees 15 rupees to i understand that these horses when in quetta are sold by dealers to government at an average of 300 rupees each leaving very large proﬁt indeed horses are very plentiful in khorassan if railway existed the government could remount its cavalry at of the present cost adjoining to the south is the partly ruined village of husseinabad it has wall now collapsed and moat which forms an obtuse angle with the east wall of there are in this village some miserable little mud houses still standing up and inhabited and the gloomy mud building of the russian which has lately been erected opposite to an extensive graveyard the site and the outward appearance of the russian which one can only reach by jumping over various drain channels or treading over graves was decidedly not one ideal spot residence but once inside the dwelling both house and host were really charming miller the consul was very intelligent and able man indeed most wonderful linguist and undoubtedly very efﬁcient ofﬁcer his country there is also in husseinabad round tower where the beluch sirdar fought the amir some nine years ago and one or two windmills characteristic of sistan and beluchistan these windmills are not worked by sails in vertical position like ours but are indeed the simplest and most ingenious contrivance of its kind i have ever seen the motive wheel which revolves in horizontal position is encased in high walls on three sides leaving slit on the north side from whence the prevalent winds of sistan blow the wind entering with great force by this vertical the walls being so cut to catch much wind the wheel in wheel which although made coarsely of reeds tied in six bundles fastened together by means of of wood revolves easily on long iron pivot and once set in motion attains high speed the ﬂour mill has two stories the motive wheel occupying the entire second ﬂoor while attached to its pivot on the ground ﬂoor is the actual grinding stone the wheat to be ground ﬂows into central aperture in this stone from suspended vessel simple system of strings and ropes acting the project

preventing its ﬂow the b ritish b azar h usseinabad s istan there sweeps over sistan in the hot weather what is called the oz or wind of the 120 days which blows from the and although this may seem unpleasant to the inhabitants it has most undoubtedly salubrious effect upon the climate of the province which owing to the great quantity of channels and stagnant water would otherwise be most unhealthy it is the climate is now extremely healthy the water of the halmund is delicious to drink the suburb of husseinabad stretches about one mile towards the south and contains among other places of importance the buildin gs of the customs with modest and picture of which is here given what is called benn bazaar or the british bazaar is also found at the portion of husseinabad and facing the consulate hospital chapter xvii the british pioneer traders of house and not the terminus of the and tea in market of indian tea are the markets worth s mostly wanted in sistan and problem to be ays of communication needed to cities of central persia the entire british modest one so be taken in at glance the snapshot reproduced in the illustration gives very good idea of it besides this one or two indian british merchants are established in the main street of where we have seen they have opened nice shops the pioneer merchants of sistan were the ﬁrm of mahommed ali brothers of quetta established in 1900 and represented by very intelligent man called seth suliman the ﬁrm has branches in birjand and meshed they have done good business both in sistan birjand and meshed and have been followed in sistan by of the wealthy ﬁrm of chaman singh from one time the of asia this ﬁrm holds the opium contract of the whole of the sind district and is most enterprising concern mahommed azim khan brothers of lahore have also opened shop in sistan and so has mahommed hayab agent shek fars mahommed the biggest british ﬁrm in meshed it is probable that in the near future number of other indian ﬁrms may be induced to open branches in sistan and khorassan but if they are to avoid disappointment they should remember that the sistan market is merely retail one and there is very little wholesale trade to be transacted so far in time to come doubt wholesale trade will eventually be developed point which is seldom grasped or at any rate is frequently overlooked is that sistan sher nasrya is mere house between quetta and meshed and not is supposed by many people the terminus of the route considerable loss and disappointment have been sustained by some rash british traders who notwith standing the exceptional opportunities given them to obtain accurate ofﬁcial information set out with large caravans apparently without the most rudimentary geographical knowledge well without sound commercial foresight another mistake is frequent somehow or other the idea seems to prevail among some indian traders that persia or eastern persia forms part of the indian empire and they forget that the protection and unusual facilities which they enjoy from quetta to robat the beluch frontier and to certain extent far sistan can not possibly be given on persian territory beyond sistan far meshed although practically across desert the journey from to sistan travelling of that comfortable and easy the real difﬁculty begins traders when they are perforce left to look after themselves on persian soil where there are more clean and where travelling more thought of than if he were an asiatic trader he is longer the salaamed sahib of the indian cities but becomes mere ferenghi stranger and is at the mercy of everybody moreover it should be well understood that the protection and redress obtainable under english law cease on crossing the persian frontier very little if any redress is to be obtained from persian ofﬁcials except at great cost and inﬁnite worry waste of time and patience indian tea traders have probably been the greatest sufferers in consequence of their rash ventures and they will probably suffer even more in the future if they not exercise greater caution in ascertaining beforehand the suitable markets their teas and the actual cost of transport to the markets selected several traders have brought very large caravans of indian tea to sistan on the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https believing that they had arrived at the end of their journey and after having paid the heavy duty imposed upon goods introduced into the country have found before them the option of going the 600 miles back to quetta or continuing at great expense via bam to kerman long journey with doubtful results at the end or of going to birjand meshed teheran where they have eventually been compelled to sell at loss or to pay the additional russian duty and send the tea on to moscow the persian market is at present very much blocked up with indian teas and great caution should be exercised by intending exporters from india in time to come when good roads have been made in every direction or railways constructed and cost of transport greatly minimised persia will be i think considerable buyer of indian teas but matters are the expense of conveying the tea to the various persian markets especial ly by the land route is too great to make any proﬁt possible at the very low prices paid by the persians tea tea exported overland to the meshed market not to sistan realised before the market became overstocked better prices than the tea via bandar abbas it is certain that the delicate aroma of tea is not improved by being exposed to the warm sea air matter how carefully it has been packed and major are the political agent at chagai points out tea despatched by the land route direct from the gardens or from calcutta is not liable to the numerous incidental charges commissions and transhipments which are matter of course upon teas sent via bandar abbas or other persian gulf ports the demand unspoiled teas brought overland is considerable in russia and all over europe even more than in persia and when sensible understanding has been arrived at with russia to let indian teas proceed in transit through that country there is reason why the better indian teas should not favourably compete all over europe with the china caravan teas the persian market to my mind speaking generally will only be able to purchase the inferior teas the persians individuals being comparatively poor superior teas in small quantities however may ﬁnd sale at good prices among the ofﬁcial classes and the few richer folks but not in sufﬁcient quantities to guarantee large import the same remarks i think would apply to teas ﬁnding their way into western afghanistan from various points on the route the indian have shown very commendable enterprise in attempting to push their teas by the overland route and trying to exploit the new markets which the route has thrown open to them but their beginning has been made too suddenly and on too large scale which i fear will cause temporary loss to some of them gradual steady development of the tea trade is wanted in persia not rush and violent competition ﬂooding the market with tea that has to be sold at loss when the natives all over persia have by degrees got accustomed to indian tea and when it is brought in at cheap price indian teas are likely to be popular in persia the w all of s her i asr ya at s unset i may be wrong but to my mind the greater proﬁts on indian teas brought by this route will in the future be made not in persia itself but in transcaspia turkestan russia and central europe where people can pay well good article great credit should be given to the indian and dehra dun tea associations despatching representatives to study the requirements of the persian market on the spot but captain are suggests in the gazette of india the tea associations would well to turn their attention to the sale of indian teas in russia and to send some experimental consignments of their teas to moscow by the overland route the same remarks might also apply to great many other english or indian manufactured goods we complain great deal that the russia n protective tariff is high but it is mild when compared with the murderous protectionism of the united states or of our beloved friend germany and after all does this protection keep out our goods from those countries by means russia industries are indeed fast developing but they are far from sufﬁcient to supply her own wants english german and american goods ﬁnd their way even to the most remote spots of siberia it is then problem worth considering whether free trade persia with her english and indian imports amounting to one million four hundred thousand pounds sterling is customer so well worth cultivating protectionist russia which buys from us nearly millions worth yearly in regard to the route it would strike casual observer that from our geographical situation we might without much difﬁcu lty kill two birds with one stone by happy persia being dealt with en passant it were while aiming quicker sounder and more extensive markets further north persia is good market indian indigo which has so far commanded ready sale in sistan it can not be too emphatically repeated is only comparatively poor and articles which have so far found quick retail sale have been

savage landor https amir and the sardars have at different times made purchases of boots shoes saddlery silk woollen and cotton cloths rugs shawls crockery and enamel ware watches chains and knives and have also bought considerable number of fancy goods furniture stationery cigarettes cigars and tobacco the humbler sistanis purchase very freely from the indian british shops but can not afford to pay very high prices but the high ofﬁcials pay cash and give good price all they buy speaking generally the articles which are mostly wanted at present are those mentioned in the ofﬁcial report these commodities there is steady demand in the markets of sistan and khorassan but the supply it should be remembered should be in proportion to the size of the population sistan birjand meshed are not london nor paris nor berlin the articles wanted are woollen stuf fs ﬂannels muslins mulls sheetings chintzes cottons velvets satins silks brocades indigo of medium and good quality oudh indigo is

tinning copper vessels would command very ready sale but their importation is strictly forbidden the articles of export from khorassan and sistan are wool ghi saffron dried fruit of various kinds hides jujubes assafoetida barak kurak gum valuable carpets and some turquoises in sistan itself wheat and oats are plentiful but their export to foreign countries is not permitted opium ﬁnds its way out of the country via bandar abbas and wool ghi feathers carpets and assafoetida are conveyed principally to kerman birjand meshed yezd the gulf and quetta one of the principal problems of the new land route to india is not only how to induce british traders to go to persia but how to solve the more difﬁcult point of persuading the big persian traders to cross the bridge and venture into india they seem at present too indolent and suspicious to undertake such long journey and would rather pay luxuries to be brought to their doors than go and get them themselves with the assistance both moral and ﬁnancial of the enterprising major sykes large caravan was sent from kerman to quetta with persian goods and paid satisfactorily but others that followed seem to have had good many disasters on the road on persian territory and fared less well major sykes effort was most praiseworthy indeed regards purely persian trade i think kerman or yezd must in future be the aiming points of british caravans rather than meshed these places have comparatively large populations and the ﬁeld of operations is practically unoccupied whereas in meshed russian competition is very strong with the present ways of communication across the salt desert it is most difﬁcult and costly to attempt remunerative commercial communication with these towns small caravans could not possibly pay expenses and large caravans might fare badly owing to lack of water while the circuitous road via bam is too expensive when more direct tracks with wells at each stage after the style of the route have been constructed between robat and kerman and also between and kerman and and yezd matters will be immensely facilitated chapter xviii sistan state of consul russian ﬁght between sistanis and benn pluck and personal

post sistan is in state of rapid transition and it is doubtful whether the position of the three or four europeans on duty there is one of perfect safety the natives are so far undoubtedly and absolutely favourable to british inﬂuence in preference to russian state of affairs mainly due to the personal tact of majors trench and benn rather than to instructions from home but great caution should be exercised in the future if this prestige now at its highest point is to be the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https russians are advancing very fast and their inﬂuence is already beginning to be felt in slight degree the sistanis may or may not be relied upon they are not perfectl y europeanised like peoples of certain parts of western persia nor are they quite so amenabl to reason could be wished they can easily be led or misle d and bribed and are by means easy folks to deal with few tomans one can have people assassinated the afghan frontier so close at hand being guarantee of impunity murderers and ﬁghts between the townspeople and the afghans or beluch in which many people are injured and killed are not uncommon the s ar tip one of these ﬁghts between sistanis and afghans under british protection took place when i was in sistan and i think it is only right that it should be related it proves very forcibly that i have continually urged in this book calm and tact gentleness and fairness have greater and more lasting control over persians than outward pomp and the consul and i after calling on the amir proceeded to visit the the amir ﬁrst son by his legal wife the is the head of force of cavalry and inhabits country house the chahar bagh in garden to the north outside the city he is bright and intelligent youth who had travelled with golam jelami to which country he had recently returned and where he had gone to consult specialists about his eyesight the of whom portrait is here given received us most kindly and detained us till dark being we then bade him and were riding home when we neared the consulate gate man who seemed much excited rushed to the consul and handed him note from the belgian customs ofﬁcer i was still was my ﬁrst not allowed out after dusk major benn asked to go back to the consulate he was called to the customs caravanserai on business i suspected nothing until messenger came to the consulate with news crowd of some 300 sistanis had attacked some ﬁfteen afghan camel men who had come over with caravan of tea from quetta these camel drivers had been paid several thousand rupees their services on being dismissed and some money quarrel had arisen on the arrival of the consul the ﬁght was in full swing and he found crowd of howling sistanis throwing stones and bricks at the afghans at major benn appearance notwithstanding that their blood was up and their temper one would think beyond control the sistanis immediately opened way him some even temporarily stopping ﬁghting to make courteous salaam this will show in what respect our consul is held the afghans having by this time realised that they had been insulted and having furthermore discovered the loss of some hich they only detected when they went their riﬂes and swords which they kept together in safe place with their up in line and with drawn swords made rush on the sistanis major benn with considerable pluck dashed between the ﬁghting men seizing with his left hand the riﬂe of the had knelt down and was on the point of with his right hand got hold of the another afghan sword who was slashing away at the sistanis near him the force of the blow caused quite wound in the gallant major hand but suddenly by magic owing to the respect he commanded on both sides his action put stop to the ﬁght seizing this opportunity he talked to them calmly in his usual quiet jocular manner and told the afghans how by behaving in this fashion while under his protection they were doing him harm in the eyes of the persians in whose countr y they were guests and that if they had any claim they must apply to him and not take the law into their own hands with his keen sense of humour he even succeeded with some joke or other in raising laugh from both belligerent parties and requested them to sit down and give up their arms into his custody which they willingly did the afghans seated themselves at the further end of the caravanserai while the sistanis whom he next addressed in the kindest way were persuaded to desist from using further violence he managed to turn the whole thing into joke and eventually the sistanis dispersed laughing and retired within the wall of their city but indeed there were ﬁve afghans left on the ground severely wounded with fractured skull being carried to the consulate hospital in dying condition the afghans possessed some excellent russian riﬂes great many of which ﬁnd their way into afghanistan from the north the consul when the row was over proceeded to the amir who had the gates of the city instantly closed and promised the consul that they should not be opened again until the consul could go the next day to identify the ringleaders of the attacking sistanis the amir received the consul the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https than usually marked respect and showed himself greatly disturbed at the occurrence he took personal charge of the keys of the city and undertook to mete out severe punishment upon the offenders the city gates which are daily opened at sunrise remained closed the greater portion of the day at the consul request but consideration the doorkeepers let out occasional citizens all probability those very ones that should have been kept in unfortunately being when mussulmans sit up feasting the greater part of the night they are compelled to fast when the sun is above the horizon his excellency the amir was unable to attend to even this important matter which was left to slide from day to day the consul however although extremely patient was the last man to let things go to the wall and doubt in the end the leaders were duly punished and compensation paid the

great addition to the british consulate now that so many beluch and afghans all under british protection travel through sistan if british caravanserai could be built in which they their goods and their camels might enjoy comparative safety the expense of putting it up would be very small and it would avoid the constant friction which is bound to exist at present in country where honesty is not the chief forte of the lower people and where quarrels are ever rampant even during the short stay of clemenson and marsh caravan several articl es were stolen under their very eyes in the consulate shelter and at the time of my visit caravans british or otherwise were absolutely at the mercy of the natives the goods were left out in the open in front of the caravanserai and the customs people had not sufﬁcient men to protect them from interference at the hands of the lower people i have seen it stated by correspondents in leading london papers that russian customs ofﬁcials were stationed in sistan and interfered greatly with british caravans that is mere ﬁction from beginning to end i have already stated there is not single russian in the customs anywhere in persia in sistan the only from interfering with the caravans is of great help to them and does all in his power within the limits of his duty to be of assistance to them the consul himself was full of praise of the extreme fairness and justice to all alike of the belgian ofﬁcial there never was the slightest trouble or hitch so long traders were prepared to comply with persian laws and so long people paid the duty on the goods entering the country bother of any kind was given to anybody either british or others on april 3rd 1901 the persian government introduced law abolishing all inland customs houses and transit dues and substituting inste ad rahdari tax of 6 annas per 240 pounds this tax is payable on crossing the frontier and is levied in addition to the 5 per cent ad valor duty to which the persian government is entitled under the existing international customs convention the rate of duty levied 5 per cent is calculated on the actual value of goods plus the cost of transport the sistan consul well the ofﬁcials of the nushki sistan route in beluchistan go to an immense deal of trouble to be of use to british traders and travellers and everything is made easy them is compatible with the nature of the country and existing laws great deal of extra heavy work was thrown upon the shoulders of major benn who acted in less than three ofﬁcial postmaster and well unofﬁcially architect and general reference ofﬁcer it is very satisfactory to learn that this autumn 1902 an assistant is to be sent out to him from india the work seemed indeed too heavy one man day and night incessant work would in time have certainly told on even the cheerful disposition and abnormally wiry constitution of major benn who besides being most loyal and careful ofﬁcial takes great deal of personal pride in ﬁghting hard to win the severe race which will result in our eventually acquiring or losing sistan and eastern persia commercially major benn is most decidedly very far ahead in the race at present and owing to him british prestige happens to be at its zenith but greater support will be needed in the future if this advantageous race is to be continued up to the winning post were established at birjand i have said before the sistan consular work would be relieved of much unnecessary strain the distance from birjand to sistan being too great under present conditions to allow the consul to visit the place even yearly the medical british agent whom we have there at present is excellent but the powers at his disposal are small and consulate with an english ofﬁcer in charge would most decidedly enhance british prestige in that important city well being useful connecting link between sistan and meshed distance of close upon 500 miles it was most excellent step to select the consular work in eastern and southern persia men from the military political service instead of the usual foreign ofﬁce men who are probably better adapted countries already developed the political service is most perfect body of gentlemanly sensible men of versatile talents the pick of the healthiest the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https englishmen in our indian service they can not help doing good wherever they are sent captain trench major benn major phillott captain white have all answered perfectly and have all done and are doing excellent work what is most needed at present in sistan is telegraph line to nushki should everybody in the sistan consulate be murdered it would be the best part of fortnight or three weeks before the news could reach india at the present rate of post going if assistance were needed it could not reach sistan from quetta in less than couple of months by which time i think it would be of little use to those in danger and the danger mind you does exist it seems rather hard that we should leave men who work and work hard and well their country absolutely at the mercy of destiny the next most important point would be to join sistan or at least robat on the frontier with the railway to quetta but of this we shall have occasion to speak later so far the line has been sanctioned to nushki but that point it must be reme mbered is still 500 miles distant from sistan considera ble distance across what is practical purposes desert country the third easiest of all which would involve little expense but would have most salutary be to maintain small garrison at the ghan frontier post of robat this to my mind would at the present moment strengthen the hands of our ofﬁcials in persia to most extraordinary extent something tangible which the natives themselves could see and talk about together with the knowledge that smart body of soldiers could soon be on the spot if required would not only assure the so far doubtful safety of the few but precious english lives in those parts but would add enormously to our prestige and make us not only revered but feared chapter xix the history of the sistan chevenix the foundation of the the british terrible plucky mud new under horses are enclosing legend of trenchabad consulate golam complaints of sistan sore the history of the sistan does not go back very far but is nevertheless very interesting we will recapitulate it in few words major brazier was sent to sistan on special mission has already been said and captain are political assistant at chagai visited the place every year at the end of his annual trip along the new route in north beluchistan from quetta to robat the most eastern station of the route prior to entering persian territory major sykes visited sistan in 1896 in connection with the boundary commission and again in 1899 when he travelled here from kerman by the easier southern route via bam it was on february 15th 1900 that russian that important province was appointed to sistan to take the place of persian who was in russian employ major chevenix trench was then specially selected by the viceroy of india suitable person to look after british interests in that indeed better man could have been chosen having given up his appointment in india this ofﬁcer left quetta on march 7th 1900 and arrived at on the 18th of april accompanied by major benn who was on year furlough and can be said i believe to be the ﬁrst european who has travelled all the way from india to england by this overland route via ranscaspia major trench prior to leaving meshed to take up his appointment of khorassan being unable to stand the ﬁerce heat of the sun laid the foundation was dried mud brick to be the present temporary buildings of the consulate domed mud hut la persane was built with an additional spacious window but framework and glass the great difﬁculty of hoisting the british ﬂag which seems to have been strongly objected to during the commission when sir frederic goldsmid passed through sistan in 1872 was overcome mainly owing to the great tact shown by major trench the union jack ﬂew daily gaily and undisturbed over the mud hovel which will probably be during the next few years one of the most important consular posts we possess in asia major benn who had hastily proceede d to london on long expected holiday was immediately recalled to replace major trench majo r benn accompanied by his plucky and devoted wife and child journeyed second time across the beluchistan desert to reach his post the journey was terrible owing to torrential rains and snowstorms when already several marches out they were compelled to return to quetta their child had become very but they were despatched again on their duty they encountered severe storms the country was practically ﬂooded some of their camels died and days at time they were in the desert unable to move the country being in many places inundated in blizzard two of their men lost themselves and died from exposure but the party advanced slowl y but surely the plucky little english lady standing all the hardships without murmur major benn having been ordered to make detour they went down into the sarhad south of the and it was not till february 15th 1901 that they eventually reached nasrya and were received by trench in his consulate he having moved into tent major trench on the arrival of major benn proceeded to meshed during major benn time the consulate buildings went through marvellous evolution it may be recollected that i reached sistan in december 1901 or only ten months after his arrival but the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https already several additional built and connected so to form suite of spacious ofﬁce two bedrooms and storeroom there were doors made locally by imported indian carpenters but glass to the windows nailed to the wall answering the purpose of blinds famished dogs attracted by the odour of dinner would occasionally jump through this ﬂimsy protection much to the despair of those were only small troubles thieves found their way into the rooms and even succeeded in stealing benn jewellery there was protection whatever against an attack in force and the natives were at ﬁrst most impudent in their curiosity the s istan c onsula on c hristmas d ay being mussulman country things were at ﬁrst very uncomfortable benn until the natives got accustomed to the sight of an engl ish lady she being the ﬁrst they had ever seen or who had ever travelled so far the temporary were gradually furnished and decorated with so much taste that they became simply charming but new consulate is now being built which by comparison in size and style seems quite palatial it is being constructed of real baked bricks major benn having put up serviceable kiln the purpose and the handsome structure is so sensibly built after design by the versatile consul that when ﬁnished it will fully combine english comfort with the exigencies of the climate the incessant northerly winds of the summer june to the end of rendering life unbearable unless suitable arrangements to mitigate their ef fects are provided into the northern wall ka khanas or camel thorn compartments are being built some four feet deep ﬁlled with camel thorn to make them effective two coolies are employed all day long to swish buckets of water on to them the wind forcing its way through causes rapid evaporation and consequent cooling of the air in the rooms when the wind stops the heat is however unbearable the rooms are also provided with badjirs or on the domed roof but these can only be used before the heat becomes too great an attempt had been made to start garden both vegetables and ﬂowers but the hot winds burnt up everything only four cabbages out of hundreds that were planted had survived and these were carefully nursed by benn our christmas dinner unluckily on christma s eve cow entered the enclosure and made meal of the lot another garden is being started but great difﬁculty is experienced in making anything grow owing to the quantity of salt in the ground and the terriﬁc winds poplars have come up fairly well under shelter of wall but tree can hope to stand upright when it attains height where the wind can reach it in fact what few trees one sees about near are stooping southward in pitiful manner the consul horses and those of the escort are kept out in the open they are tethered and left well wrapped up wearing nearly double the amount of covering to protect them from the heat during the hot summer months that they in winter on the principle explained in previous chapters it is not possible to keep them in stables owing to the terrible white ﬂy which has poisonous sting when out in the open the ﬂies and mosquitoes are blown away by the wind it was satisfactory to ﬁnd that although the government did not see its way to furnish the consulate with wall the protection of the consul and his wife whose personal property was constantly being stolen an allowance was at once granted with instructions to build at once high wall all round the consulate when one of the government horses was stolen this wall wonderful bit of work was put up in fortnight while i was in bed with fever and on my getting up from bed i had the surprise of ﬁnding the consulate which when i had arrived stood few lonely the middle of sandy plain now surrounded by handsome mud wall with most elaborate castellated fortres gate of major benn own design the wall encloses good many acres of land it would be rash to say how many this has given rise among the natives to the report that new city is rising near sher called trenchabad or trench city major benn is to be complimented on the wonderful work he succeeds in getting done with comparatively little expenditure the government and there is doubt that he manages to impress the natives and to keep england prestige high he imported from quetta ﬂagstaf f in pieces which when erected measured less than 45 feet and on this the highest ﬂagstaf f in persia ﬂies from sunrise to sunset the union jack except on grand occasions only small ﬂag can be used in summer owing to the ﬁerce winds which tear the larger ﬂags to pieces the moment they are put up major benn scored heavily in the esteem of sistanis when he had the bright idea of erecting handsome little mosque within the consulate boundary wherein any traveller whether persian or beluch or afghan or any other mussulman can ﬁnd shelter and meal at the private expense of the consul people devoid of house too or beggars when in real need are always helped the erection of this mosque has greatly impressed the persians with the respect of england the mahommedan religion on the religious festival day of the sheep eat the place is crowded with beluch and persians alike the mahommedan members of the british consulate having raised fund to feed all worshippers at the mosque during the day the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https benn who has really the energy of men taken together has organised some weekly gymkhanas with the double object of giving his indian escort of fourteen men of the 7th bombay lancers and duffadar native ofﬁcer little recreation and of providing some amusement to the town folks exhibitions of horsemanship and sword exercises are given in which some of the persian gentlemen occasionally also take part the sistanis of all classes turn out in great force to witness these displays persian crowd was really amazed at their extraordinarily quiet and respectful demeanour each man who entered the grounds courteously salaamed the consul before sitting down and there was unstinted clapping of way of applauding which they have learnt from great enthusiasm the lancers displayed their skill at the various feats the phonograph was also invariably brought out on these occasions and set working near the ﬂagstaf f much to the delight and astonishment of the sistanis who i believe are still at loss to discover where the voices they hear come from to study the puzzled expressions on the stricken faces of the natives they intently listened to the music was intensely amusing especially when the machine called out such words mamma which they understood or when it reproduced the whistling of nightingale which sent them raving with delight perhaps the most touching part of these performances was when loyal major benn wound up with god save the king scraped on the record by tired and blunted needles are scarce in sistan and could not be renewed the sake of only one and last we britishers removed our hats now to the natives of persia removing one hat seems ludicrous thing can be done just their equivalent discarding of shoes seems very ridiculous to us but the natives to whom the meaning we attach to our national anthem had been explained behaved with the utmost reverence notwithstanding the trying circumstances and many actually placed their right hands to their foreheads in sign of salaam until the anthem was over another department in the consulate of great interest is the spacious hospital containing supplied dispensary where an average of forty daily patients are treated gratis by golam jelami and compounder patients came on in their turn with various complaints and they were disposed of with due speed under going the necessary treatment with various degrees of grace the hospital contains besides the dispen sary an and an accident ward ofﬁce operating room and doctor quarters the whole place being kept beautifully clean by indian golam jelami taking great pride in his work and in the success and efﬁcacy of the establishment being himself mussulman golam jelami has great advantage over christian doctor in attending the natives and in fact he has become the medical adviser to the amir and his entire family and favourite with all the darbaris or people at the amir court owing to his extreme tact skill and charm of manner he has performed some quite extraordi nary operations one day when the consul and benn were about to sit down to lunch huge tumour which had just been excised from the back of man neck was sent round on tray the consul inspection and lenses of the eye from successful cataract operations are frequently sent in the consul approval the climate of sistan is very healthy generally and the halmund water some it is said to be an actual the hot winds of the summer and the salt sand cause severe injury to the eyes cataract is most common complaint even in comparatively young persons also ophthalmia in its two forms confusion of vision is frequent even among children and myopia but not so common the opacity of the cornea the most common complaint is the sistan sore which affects people on the face or any other part of the body it is known by the local name of it begins with seldom come to suppuration and burst and if not checked in time last several months extending on the skin surface above which they hardly rise the digestion of sistanis although naturally good is interfered with by the abuse of bad food such krut or dried rancid indigestible stuf venereal complaints are also most common the most terrible form of all curiously enough being treated even by persian doctors with treatment called the kalyan shingrif administered in such quantities that its ef fects are often worse than the ailment itself partly owing to this complaint and stomach troubles and the chewing of tobacco the teeth are usually bad black and decayed even in young people nor have the sistanis themselves any way of saving the teeth siphylitic tonsilitis is almost the only throat complaint noticeable in sistan but inﬂammation of the palate is not rare heart disease is practically unknown in sistan and there are but very few lung affections the bones of the skeleton are extremely hard and possess abnormal elasticity of texture and are therefore not easily fractured there are several kinds of hair diseases caused by climatic conditions and dirt well cutaneous affections of the scalp the nails both of ﬁngers and toes are healthy not brittle with ﬁbre showing through their smooth surface and of good shape the tape worm so common in many other parts of persia is absolutely unknown in sistan and this is probably due to the excellent water obtainable lunacy is also scarcely ever met with in sistan in any violent form but cases of hypochondria are not unusual produced principally by least judging by the symptoms shown the women are much healthier than the men they lead more rational life but neither possess the power of producing large families one or two is the average number of children in healthy families twins and triplets are unknown in sistan or so i was the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https mode of life of sistan men of the better classes is not conducive to large families the men not returning to their wives till midnight or later having spent the greater part of the day in orgies with their friends when what with opium

miles civility of persian unusual an eye an eye tooth tooth and criminals from and decapitation it was my intention to remain in sistan only four or ﬁve days but unluckily my fever got so temperature above notwithstanding my desire to continue the journe y major benn most kindly would not allow i was placed in bed where covered up with every available blanket i remained close upon three weeks the tender care of major and benn to whom my gratitude can not be expressed in words the skilful treatment of golam jelami the consulate doctor to speak of the unstinted doses of quini ne phenacetin castor and other such delightful fare to which may also be added some gallons of the really delicious water of the halmund river last told upon and eventually after days of sweating i began to pull up again and was able to get up the fever was shaken off altogether but strange to say whether it was that i was unaccustomed to medicine or whether it was due to the counter of the violent fever my temperature suddenly went down and remained several months varying from two to three degrees below normal medical men tell that this should mean physical collapse but on this point i can only say that i have never in my life felt stronger nor better i was just out of bed on christmas day when the consulate was decorated with ﬂags and major benn in his uniform had his escort of bombay lancers on parade there was an ofﬁcial christmas dinner in good old english style with ﬁne plum pudding and real sixpences in it followed by crackers while illuminations were burning bright on the consulate wall and roofs ofﬁcial visitors were received the doctor of the russian and the belgian customs ofﬁcer forming the whole european community of sher sadek who was great on charity especially when it went to my account in order to thank providence my recovery sacriﬁced two sheep and their meat was distributed to the clamouring poor such an expedient was necessary sadek said or i should certainly get fever again owing to the russian calendar being in disagreement with ours the consul benn and i were most cordially entertained to second christmas dinner by the russian consul who had just returned from meshed and we had most delightful evening convalescent i could not help thinking so many christmas dinners coming together might have been fatal but fortunately owing entirely to the charming and thoughtful kindness of my hosts both english and russian i managed to pull through with very ill effects the consular escort of cossacks looked very and smart they paraded in the yard which had been duly illuminated the occasion the amir expressed wish to see and i was just able to get on horse the consul and i paid an ofﬁcial visit to the governor in the citadel we rode in full state with the escort of lancers and traversed the town along the main street entering from the south gate i was again much struck by the intense respect shown by the natives towards major benn all rising we passed and making profound salaam we traversed the greater portion of the city by the main street and then arrived at the gate of the citadel in the part of sher the door was so low that we had some difﬁculty in entering without dismounting and just we were squeezing in it were through this low passage one of the soldiers on guard ﬁred his sign of somewhat startled our horses and set them in the small court where we dismounted was crowd of soldiers and servants and here another salute was ﬁred by the sentry through winding dilapidated passages and courts we were conveyed to the amir very modest chamber whitewashed and with humble carpets on the ﬂoor huge wood ﬁre was burning in the chimney and the furniture consisted of table and six chairs three folding ones and three vienna cane ones arranged symmetrically on either side of the the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https b enn british consul sistan and his escort of 7th bombay lancers the amir sat on folding chair on one side of the table and the consul ghul khan and myself in row on the opposite side we were most cordially received by lk the amir this being ramzam or fasting ample evidence of nights he had all the semblance of person addicted to opium smoking his excellency was unshave n and unwashed and seemed somewhat dazed if still under the effects of opium his discoloured eyes stared vaguely now at the consul now at ghul khan now at and he occasionally muttered some compliment or other at which we all bowed presently however his conversation became most interesting when having gone through all these tedious preliminary formalities he began to describe to the many ruined cities of sistan he told how at one time centuries and centu ries gone by sistan was the centre of the world and that city existed some twenty miles off named zaidan the length of which was uninterrupted some eighty or ninety miles the remains of this city he said are still to be seen and if you not believ my words you can go and see yourself in fact added the amir you should not leave sistan without going to inspect the ruins the city had ﬂat roofs in continuous line the houses being built on both sides of main road goat or sheep could practically have gone along the whole length of the city went on the amir to enforce proof of the continuity of buildings of zaidan but the city had great breadth it was long and narrow the dwellings being along the course of an arm of the halmund river which in those days before its course was shifted by moving sands ﬂowed there the ruined city lies partly in afghan partly in sistan territory in many parts it is covered altogether by sand but by digging houses and in them jewellery and implements are to be found all along i promised the amir that i would go and visit zaidan city the very next day when we had once begun talking the amir spoke most interestingly and i was glad to obtain from him very valuable and instructive infor mation one hears accounts in some quarters of the persian ofﬁcials being absolutely and showing incivility to british subjects but on the contrary the amir positively went out of his way to show extreme civility he repeatedly inquired after my health and expressed his fervent wishes that fever should more attack what you think of my beloved city he exclaimed i prudently answered that in my travels all over the world i had never seen city like it which was quite true but you look very young to have travelled so much queried the amir it is merely the great pleasure of coming to pay your excellency visit that makes look young i replied with my very best temporarily adopted persian manner at which the amir made deep bow and placed his hand upon his heart to show the full appreciation of the compliment he too like all persian ofﬁcials displayed the keenest interest in the chinese war of 1900 and the eventual end of china he spoke bitterly of the recluse buddhists of tibet and i fully endorsed his views then again he told more of historical interest about his province and of the medical qualities of the halmund cures all evils more elaborate compli ments ﬂowed on all sides and numberless cups of steaming tea were gradually sipped then we took our leave most unusual courtesy the consul told and one meant great honour the amir came to escort us and bid us right up to the door usual custom being that he rises but does not go beyond the table at which he sits out we went again through the same narrow passages stooping so not to knock our heads against the low and came to our horses the soldier on guard ﬁred another salute with his gun and who happened to be near at the time nearly had his eye put out by it we rode through the gate number of or with chains round the neck and wrists and all bound together were being led in they salaamed us and implored our protection but we could nothing i could not help feeling very sorry the poor devils the way justice is administered in sistan in most parts of persia is not particularly attractive the tendons of the hands or feet are cut even small offences hot irons are thrust into the criminal limbs and other such triﬂing punishments are inﬂicted if sufﬁcient money is not forthcoming from the accused or their relations to buy them out here is an example of persian justice while i was in bed with fever one day major and benn went ride along the wall of the city with their usual escort on reaching the city gate they saw several people come out and they were startled by shot being ﬁred close by them and dead body was laid ﬂat across the road the dead man it appeared had been himself murderer and had been kept in chains in the amir custody pending trial the verdict might have possibly turned in his favour had he been willing to grease the palms of the jailors in accordance with old persian custom but although the man was very well off he refused to disburse single shai he was therefore there and then handed over to the relations of the murdered man so that they should mete out to him what punishment they thought the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https man was instantly dragged through the streets of the city and on arriving outside the city gate they shot him in the back the body was then left in the road the persian crowd which had assembled round looking upon the occurrence great joke and informing major benn that the corpse would remain there until some of his relations came to fetch it away on referring the matter to the governor the following day he smilingly exclaimed an eye an eye tooth tooth quotation from the koran that quite cleared his conscience this is very common way of disposing of criminals in persia by allowing personal revenge to take its course although such ways of administering justice may not commend themselves to one the moral of it looked upon by persian eyes is not bad it might at ﬁrst appear the honest the man they reason has nothing whatever to fear from anybody and if man chooses to be criminal he must take the consequences of it the more severe the punishment the less crime there will be in the country persian law prevents crime in province like sistan where the people are not quite in other parts of persia naturally ways which to us may seem very cruel have to be applied by the amir to impress the people if ﬁnes to the maximum of the prisoner purse are excepted the usual way of satisfying the law almost any offence the next most common punishment is the bastinado applied on the bare soles of the feet when an option is left to the prisoner of under going the bastin ado or paying ﬁne he generally selects the sticks which he feels much less than the anguish of disbursing the smallest sum in cash minor crimes only are so is considered the lightest punishment occasionally it is used to obtain confessions people are seldom known to die under it disﬁgurement or deprivation of essential limbs such one or more phalanges of ﬁngers or the ears or nose is also much in vogue thieves and highwaymen second offences of criminals so branded the whole hand or foot is cut off blinding or rather atrophizing the eyes by the application of hot iron in front but not touching them such is common all over central asia is occasionally resorted to in the less civilised parts of persia but is not frequent now i only saw one case of man who had been so punished but many are those who have the tendons of arms and legs favourite punishm ent which gives the most dreadfully painful appearance to those who have under gone it imprisonment is considered too expensive the government and is generally avoided except in the bigger cities the prisoners have very poor time of it number of them being chained close together to burn people or to bury them alive are severe punishments which are very seldom heard of days but which occasionally take place in some remote districts and unknown to his majesty the shah who has ever shown tender heart and has done all in his power to suppress barbarous ways in his country but cases or cruciﬁxion and stoning to death have been known to have occurred not many years not direct punishment from ofﬁcials yet with their indirect sanction strangling and decapitation are still in use and i am can not guarantee its blowing criminals from guns is rarely practised now although at one time this was favourite persian way of disposing of violent criminals persian ofﬁcial was telling that since these terrible punishments have been to great extent abolished crimes are more frequent in persia than they were before the same very enlightened person who had travelled in remarked to that had we similar punishments in europe instead of keeping criminals on the fat of the i am only repeating his words should not have so much crime in the country your laws he added protect criminals our ways deter men and women from crime to prevent crime matter in how cruel way it is done is surely less cruel than to show leniency and kindness to the persons who commit crimes that was one way of looking at it taking things all round if blood feuds and cases of personal revenge are excepted there is certainly less crime in persia than in many european countries chapter xxi the london of the city miles village of ancient kalantar of of ancient jewellery from the buried romantic life and tragic treacherous relations between the sistan and afghan roofs and gable pillar of conical imposing fort of neighbouring modern village the consul benn and i started off early one morning on horseback to inspect the ruins of the ancient london of the east the great city of zaidan which in the days of its glory measured less than lash yuwain on the north to on the of the city being traceable the whole distance to this day except in the portion which has been covered by the waters of the hamun halmund on the way there was little to be seen the ﬁrst four miles until we reached the village of bunjar the biggest trading village in sistan and the residence of the iman jumeh the next holiest man to the head priest of this village and neighbourhood supply entirely with wood and very largely with food there are many stunted trees about all curved southwards by the wind and much cultivated land the ground being intersected by numerous natural and artiﬁcial water channels very curious ancient tower split in two and the portion of another very much corroded at its base and looking like big mushroom are to be seen on the south near this village we cut across almost due east to iskil wading through several canals and channels into which our horses dived up to their saddles on approaching iskil from the west one was impressed by the unusual height of some of its buildings most of which were ied and had domed roofs the domes being of much larger proportions than usual quadrangular tower of considerable loftiness stood prominent above the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https of all the other buildings persian village iskil had quite clean fresh appearance even from short distance on getting near we entered the main might more accurately call it in on both sides and ﬁlled with water some eight or ten inches deep our horses waded through and having rounded another large pond of dirty green is always found in the more prosperous villages of came to high wall enclosing garden and an andarun near the residence of the kalantar of sistan kalantar means the bigger one the title taken by the head of the tribe who in days were the masters of the whole of sistan the kalantar is large landowner and has the contract all the grazing tax of east sistan among the villages owned by him are iskil bunjar and the three richest in sistan the name of kalantar is taken by each of the family he succeeds to the possession of these villages lands and rights the kalantar previous to the one now in possession was man of most commanding presence very tall and very biggest man in much respected by everybody he was extremely friendly towards the english he had planted an entire garden of english ﬂowers and fruit at iskil and took the keenest interest in horticulture and agriculture above all however he was renowned magniﬁcent collection of ancient seals coins jewellery implements beads and other curiosities of which he had amassed chests and chests full that had been dug up from the great city of zaidan and neighbourhood some of the cameos were very delicately cut in hard stone and reminded one of ancient greek work symbolic representations in circle probably to suggest eternity were favourite subjects of these ornamentations such designs serpent biting its own tail or three ﬁshes biting one another tails and forming circle being of frequent occurrence so also were series of triangles and simple circles the gold rings were most beautifully delicate and simple in design and so were all the other ornaments showing that the people of zaidan had most reﬁned civilisation which is not to be found in persian art of personally i have certainly never seen modern persian work which in any way approached in beauty of line and execution to the articles excavated from the great city of zaidan great profusion of beads of amber jasper crystal turquoise malachite agate had been found in zaidan and some that we saw were handsomely polished and cut some were ornamented others were made of some composition like very hard enamel the harde st crystal clean holes drilled through them the kalantar had built himself ﬁne residence at iskil with huge rooms and lofty domes and here he kept these collections his generous nature had caused him to build handsome guest house in front of his dwelling in order to put up and entertain his friends native or foreign it was on the steps of his guest house that the last act of terrible tragedy took place only short time before we visited iskil about ten years ago in 1891 man called mahommed hussein khan an afghan refugee came to live in bunjar bringing with him sigah wife concubine her mother and child shortly after his arrival he left his family in bunjar and went on pilgrimage to meshed news was received of him very long time and the wife wrote to her money and patience were if he did not return on certain date or answer her letter she should consider herself divorced from him he replied that she might consider herself free from the date of receipt of his letter and requested her to send her mother in char ge of his child to meshed during mahommed hussein absence rumour says that kalantar had an intrigue with the lady and on receipt of her husband letter from meshed he forcibly removed her from bunjar and compelled her to marry him mir at iskil unluckily the lady was suni and kalantar was shia which made it difﬁcult to overcome certain religious obstacles such union would anyhow be greatly resented by relations on both sides in fact about year ago 1900 the lady brother native of girisk near kandahar enraged at his sister marrying man who was not an afghan and of different persuasion came to iskil with characteristically treacherous afghan ways and sought service with the kalantar assuring him of the great affection and devotion he entertained towards him the kalantar immediately gave him employment and treated him most generously on the night of september 19th 1901 the kalantar had been entertaining some friends in the durbar building opposite his residence among whom was the afghan who left the room before and went to conceal himself in the darkness at the entrance when the kalantar was joyfully descending the steps after the pleasant night assembly the treacherous afghan attacked him and placing his riﬂe to head shot him dead the assassin then endeavoured to enter the andarun to kill his sister but the lady having her suspicions had barricaded herself in and an alarm being given he had to make his escape across the afghan frontier only few miles distant from iskil it was rumoured that the murderer had been sheltered by the afghan governor of the chikansur district who goes by the grand name of akhunzada or the great man of high family the governor of sistan angered at the infamous deed demanded the extradition of the assassin but it was refused with the result that the afghan ofﬁcial was next accused of screening the murderer there was much interchange of furious correspondence and threats between the persian and afghan governors and their relations became so strained that ﬁght seemed imminent the shrewd afghan then offered to allow ﬁve persian soldiers accompanied by twenty afghans to search his offer which was very prudently declined persian and afghan soldiers were posted in some force on both sides of the the devoted their time to insulting one another but when i left sistan in january 1902 although the relations were still much strained the affair of the kalantar which seemed at one time likely to turn into national quarrel was gradually being settled on somewhat less martial lines the death of such good honest man has been much regretted in sistan and great hopes are now built on his son and successor young fellow much resembling his father both in personal appearance and kindliness towards his neighbours we next came to second and smaller village four miles further having waded through numberless water ponds and pools and our horses having perfor med some feats of balancing on bridges two feet wide or even less some of these structures were so shaky that the horses were not inclined to go over them except after considerable ur the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https country between was ﬂat and uninteresting except that here and there some low mounds had formed where the sand blown by the wind had been arrested by some obstacle such shrub of or tamarisk most of these had striking peculiarity they were except to the where section of the sphere was missing which left vacuum in the shape of perfect crescent by the numberless waves on the sand surface it seemed evident that the sand had accumulated from the side the village was small and miserable with few scraggy trees bowing low like all trees of sistan towards the owing to the severe winds here instead of the everlasting domes ﬂat roofs were again being doubt available close at hand more curious however were actual gable roofs the ﬁrst i had noticed in persia in purely native houses the ventilating apertures were not in the roof itself in the domed houses but in the walls which were of much greater height than in the domed habitations the doors and windows were invariably on the south wall but to the north at the lower portion of the roof in each house one could observe triangular projecting structure usually in the centre of the upper wall this was different type of catcher but in winter blocked up with bricks and mud between this village and zaidan there was again good deal of water to be crossed and in some spots it was so deep that our horses sank into it up to their chests and we had to lie ﬂat with our legs resting on the animals backs to escape ducking to our the be seen in the distance high tower which is said to have spiral staircase inside and must be of very great height even from where we miles it rose very high above the horizon some 70 feet we guessed and looked very big this tower stood alone several miles to the north of the principal zaidan ruins which we were steering and i had not therefore time to visit it the pillar is locally called and is circular in shape made of bricks cemented together by clay on the summit above broad band with ornamentations and much worn inscription can be seen the fragments of two smaller structures also cylindrical which may have been the supports of the dome of the minaret there is said to be another illegible inscription about thirty feet from the ground according to goldsmid who visited this place in 1872 the tower then stood on square foundation and its circumference was 55 feet at the base and only 28 feet at the summit the lower portion of the tower seen through powerful glasses seemed very much corroded and it will not be long before it collapses there are various theories regarding this tower which now rises directly above the ﬂat desert it is said by some to be one of number of isolated watch tower s but this i think is incorrect the c itadel of z aidan the g rea t c ity according to major sykes who quotes from the seljuk history every three hundred paces pillar twice the height of man was built and two minars between gurz and fahraj one forty gaz high the other and under each minar caravanserai and tank by the word under the historian evidently meant directly underneath the was the customary way of constructing such buildings the minars seldom rose from the ground but were and are generally constructed on the roofs of buildings proof that this was the case in this particular instance was that when goldsmid visited it in 1872 he stated that it was built on square foundation the caravanserai underneath this tower and the tank are evidently buried by the sand is the case with great portion of the city of zaidan that there is underneath the sand city connecting the southern portion of zaidan partly above the northern portion of zaidan and that this minar rises above buried habitations there can be little doubt all along the severa l miles of intervening sandy stretch the earth is covered with debris ruins and fragments of tiles bricks showing the remains of great city we went along leaving the pillar to the north and steering the main ruins of zaidan we saw close by on the north very large structure forming the section of lower portion buried in sand and the upper portion having collapsed sista ni who accompanied us said was an ancient this theory may be correct it is probable that the climate of sistan may have greatly changed but it is also possible that the structure may have been large to this day mills are built in persia on similar exterior lines to the structures of the same kind are also to be observed far south the southern terminus of the great city ice to speak of can be collected nowadays either in sistan or within very large radius of country and snow is seldom almost never seen near this mill or whichever it was another high building in ruins was to be observed but i could not afford the time to deviate from my route and inspect it it appeared like and was not dissimilar to two other round towers we had seen before on the south likely they were all outer stations so common all over the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https z aidan w est t owers and m odern v illage after brisk ride of some four hours we arrived at the main portion of the ruins of imposing fort on clay hill which must have formed the citadel at the foot of the hill was the modern village of ﬁfty houses some with ﬂat others with gabled roofs such we had seen at the previous villages and few with domed roofs there were few cultivated ﬁelds in which wheat was raised chapter xxii an ancient city big walls of the some parts are buried and some are not extensive length of the that the habitations were double outer protected immense drifts former gate of the or tomb of forty interesting objects inscriptions on marble and ghastly ﬁgure we approached the ruins we could not help being impressed by their grandeur they were certainly the most imposing i had so far come across in persia the high walls and towers of the fort could be seen from great distance and the beneﬁt of my readers photograph is reproduced in this book to show how the citadel of this great city appeared one drew near it from the west the photograph was taken half mile away from the fortress we entered the citadel by short incline on the northern side of the main fort and found ourselves in huge court the sides of which were much blocked towards the wall by sand drifts contrary to what has been stated by others the citadel is not inhabited nor are there any signs of its having been inhabited probably great many years there is nothing whatever to be seen in the centre of this yard which is covered with accumulated sand far above its original level and at the sides too of the court where buildings would have very likely been everything is smothered in sand up to great height of the wall in other places the wall has collapsed altogether towers of the c itadel z aidan remains of small rooms high up near the top of the wall can be seen the inside of the inner fort enclosed by the highest wall is quadrangular and has ten towers round it eight of which are still in wonderful preservation considering their age those at the angles of the quadrangle had large somewhat elongated windows ending in point cut into them in two tiers may be seen in the illustration curiously enough while the windows were six feet in height the doors were never more than ﬁve feet there were rooms in all the towers but all were extremely small the largest averaged eight feet square the walls of the towers were of mud bricks with layers of bricks and were three to four feet deep and of very great strength can be seen by the illustration fragment of an archway was to be found on the summit of the wall and there were often signs that covered passage such may be found in other northern forts of this great city must have been in existence when the place was in all its glory the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https one stood on the highest point of the wall and looked around one got fair idea of the former immensity of the city it evidently stretched from to north forming an obtuse angle at the citadel on which i stood to the of the fortress where sheltered from the terriﬁc north winds and from the sand drifts the ruins were in better preservation and less covered with sand which here indeed made quite depression while the northern aspect now displays continuous mass of ﬁne sand interrupted only by some of the higher buildings projecting above it one could distinguish quite plainly where the wall of the city continued long distance to the with occasional towers but this portion of the wall seen in the illustration facing page 208 is now in sad state of decay and fast being covered with sand the ﬁrst three hundred yards of it which are the best preserved however will show what place of great streng th zaidan must have been the towers appear to have been enormous shown by the base of the nearer one in the foreground of the photograph and also by the second one portion of which still remained standing the city boundary made detour to the at the third tower all the buildings visible being on the east of the wall and none to the west the modern village of zaidan should of course be excepted there seems to have been great space intervening between this wall and the nearest habitations but why that was would now be difﬁcult to ascertain except by digging to considerable depth it seems hardly likely that moat with water should have been constructed on the inside of the fortress although at ﬁrst sight one might be led to conclude that this was the case p ortion of z aidan c ity showing how it disappears under distant sand accumulations double w all and c ircular u nroofed s tructures z aidan in the distance high sand accumulations above city the city does not seem to have had great general breadth and is mostly remarkable its enormous length although at several of the most important points it has indeed considerable width it extended mostly like long line and one could still perceive far the eye could see partially destroyed domed roofs fragments of walls and in some cases entire structur es still standing and bearing roofs the which we had passed on the way stood prominent to the north by and also the pillar the minar of major sykes makes very quaint statement in the geographical journal february he says i have seen it stated by previous travellers presumably sir goldsmid and bellew that the ruins of zaidan extend fourteen miles but the fact is that there were villages lining the nasru throughout its length length of 30 miles according to major sykes maps and these have been mistaken suburbs of the capital of sistan it seems to that major sykes has only strengthened the contention of previous travellers and that whether one calls them suburbs or continuity of habitations villages or by any other name the fact is that continuous miles of buildings can be traced the canal according to major sykes own maps given in the geographical society journal is over 30 miles in length and if the 30 miles are lined throughout by villages surely that fact further establishes the continuity of the city personally however i have my doubts whether major sykes is correct in placing the to the west of the city in zaidan days of glory there are signs of canal but to the east of the city the hamun too i think more stretched across from east to west in the northern portion than it does but rather formed two separate eastern one fed by the surplus water of the halmund the western ﬁlled by the farah rud the space between is liable to be occasionally ﬂooded by the excess of water in these two lakes but that is all all the evidence goes to show that the great city under different local names extended continuously northwards far lash yuwain passing between the two marshy lakes in the next chapter i the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https undoubted evidence pointing to that conclusion and if any one is still sceptical about it all he has to is to go there and see himself in such dry climate the ruins although gradually being covered over with sand will remain long enough any one wishing to spend some time there and to make thorough study of them to the east of the zaidan fort about 100 yards and 200 yards respectively are the remains still fairly well preserved of high double wall castellated and with up the wall these two walls where free from sand stand some 40 feet high but in most portions the sand has accumulated to height of 15 to 20 feet these parallel walls were somewhat puzzling they were only few feet apart and protected road between them which went from est to each wall was constructed very strongly of two brick walls ﬁlled between with beaten earth the lower portion of the wall was much corroded by the wind and sand but the upper part where it had not collapsed was in good preservation there were rows of holes at the bottom on the east side where there appeared to have been extensive stables with mangers horses the lower portion of the wall was of bricks and the upper part in horizontal layers of baked bricks every four feet and mud bricks between of the two parallel walls the eastern one was not castellated but the western or inner had castellated summit there was an outer moat or canal only comparatively small portion of this double wall stood up to its former few hundred feet of traces could be seen that it must have extended very long distance it appeared to be tortuous and not in straight line its direction being plainly traceable even in the photograph reproduced in the illustration facing page only one tower of quadrangular shape could be seen along this wall and the apertures in the wall were at regular intervals of four feet the doorway in these walls appeared to have been next to the quadrangular tower which was very likely constructed in order to guard the gate there were small circular unroofed structures between the fort itself and this double wall but they appeared more like the upper sections of towers than actual habitations though much smaller and lower they bore all the architectural characteristics of the towers of the greater fort and possessed windows one above the other similar to those we had found in the larger towers of the main fort in the illustration the reader can see himself that considerable portion of this structure is buried is shown by the fact that the upper portion of window is just visible above the sand in the circular building to the left of the observer these structures had in the interior some elaborately moulded recesses and ornamented windows in pointed arches the circular building had three rooms on the ﬂoor still above ground and six small recesses one window was in most excellent preservation further on beyond the double wall to the was most extensive graveyard portion of which had been freed from sand by the natives of the modern village of zaidan there were hundreds and hundreds of tombs some in quite good preservation can be seen by the two photographs facing pages 212 and the photograph facing page 212 shows the eastern portion of the graveyard where some of the tombs were altogether free from sand and in splendid state of preservation they were made of bricks plastered over with mud the body it may be remarked being enclosed in these rectangular brick cases and entirely above ground they were mostly single tombs not compound graves like some which we shall inspect later on mount their measurements were about 7 feet by 4 feet by 3½ feet and they were extremely simple except that the upper face was ornamented by series of superposed rectangles diminishing in size upwar ds and each of the thickness of one brick and the last surmounted generally by prism interior of z aidan f ortress gravey ard of z aidan c ity the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https photograph facing page 214 shows the portion of the graveyard with the entire eastern aspect of the zaidan fortress i took this photograph the special purpose of proving how high the sand has accumulated over many portions of the graveyard well over great portion of the city the particular spot where i took the photograph was somewhat protected from the north hence the low depression slightly more free from sand than further back where the sand can be seen was able to settle down to great height the upper portions of several graves can be noticed mostly buried in sand and by the ripples on the sand and the casting of the shadows the photograph was taken in the afternoon when the sun was west it can be seen plainly that the sand has accumulated from the north under the immediate lee of the fortress and of the outer walls similar depressions in the sand were found and it is owing to these that some portion of the city was still uncovered by sand in the photograph facing page 214 it may be noticed that where the lee of the high fortress longer protects the buildings from the drifting sand the city gradually disappears it were under fairly high accumulations we shall ﬁnd later on our journey to the beluchistan frontier how these sand accumulations in their turn forming themselves into barriers against the sands which came from the north allowed further southerly portions of the city to escape unburied which portions can be seen extending in and out of these transverse sand ridges far south north of the zaidan fortress the sand ﬁnding high obstacles has accumulated to much greater height only very lofty buildings remaining visible above the surface in the photograph facing page 206 this high cushion it were of sand can plainly be seen over the north of the city beyond the tower of the castle also portion of the small canal at the foot of the tower which some will have it was the in the distance towards the two quadrangular towers could be seen which the katkhuda of zaidan village told us formed part of one of the former gates of the city these two towers can be seen in the background of the photograph facing page some distance beyond the graveyard we came to section of tower heptagonal in form which had just been dug out to depth of 4 feet by the natives of the village of zaidan the could have given points to an us that this was the tomb of the renowned legendary forty saints of zaidan and added that they numbered on being asked why it was called the tomb of the forty saints if their number was he did not lose his presence of mind but explained that four had been added afterwards when this sacred spot had already received its legendary name east v iew of the z aidan c itadel very long time the zaidan people had searched this sacred spot and they seemed very proud to have discovered it it is called by them or the forty saints the tower is not large enough to contain them all number of them are said to be burie d in the immediate neighbourhood to the south and west of the structure and the katkhuda to prove his words showed us some three graves more elaborate than the rest there were also others that were anxiously searched but had not been located yet the graves which i was shown were entirely of bricks and so was the wall of the tower itself can be seen by portion of it showing in the illustration facing page 218 behind the marble inscription and columns since its discovery the natives had made this into ziarat or shrine and on its western side towards mecca had adorned it with bundle of sticks horns and number of rags or pieces of ribbon white red or blue every mussulman visiting it leaves an offering of piece of cloth generally from his coat or turban if man or from the chudder or other feminine wearing apparel if woman the katkhuda told us that great many things had been found in digging near here but the more valuable ones had disappeared sold to ofﬁcials or rich people of sistan great many seals coins stone weapons lamps and pottery had been found the latter often glazed innumerable fragments of earthenware were strewn everywhere round about these ruins some with interes ting ornamentations generally blue on white ground the parallel lines and heart pattern were common while on some fragments of tiles could be seen quotations from the koran in ancient arabic some pieces of tiles exhibited very handsome blue glaze and on some plates the three leaf pattern almost like was attempted in company with the and some unidentiﬁed ﬂower most interesting of all were the beautiful inscriptions on stone and marble recently been found in the tomb of the forty saints some had already been covered again by the sand but we dug them out afresh and i photographed them they were in fair preservation they bore arabic characters and were apparently dedicated in most laudatory terms one to the pomp of the country sun of righteousness and religion and the founder of mosque the other commemorated the death of great amir however there appears to be some difﬁculty in deciphering some of the very ancient characters i will refrain from giving any translation of them fear of being inaccurate the photographs given of them facing pages 218 220 222 are however quite clear enough any one interested in the matter to decipher them the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https tablets were most artistic and beautifully carved and one had most charming ornamentation of two sprays of ﬂowers in each of the two upper corners the second inscription had much more minute writing on it and was of ﬁner design and cut but was unfortunately rather worn it had evidently been subjected to long period of by sand the natives had made sort of altar with this last inscription and some cylindrical sections of columns carved out of beautiful marble white or most delicately variegated there were also various other large pieces of marble and stone which had evidently formed part of very ﬁne and rich building well very ancient fragment of red baked earthenware water pipe many of the pieces of marble in the heap contained ornamentations such successions of the heart pattern graceful curve scrolls suggesting leaves and also regular leaf patterns one stone was absolutely spherical like cannon ball and quite smooth and some stone imple ments such conical brown hammer and pestle were very interesting on the white marble columns stood two charming little oil lamps of most graceful shape in green earthenware and in digging we were fortunate enough to ﬁnd third which is now in my possession they can be seen in the illustration facing page 218 although i fear not at their best being so small they were not unlike the old pompeian lamps in shape and certainly quite graceful the wick used to be lighted at the spout among other fragments was the capital of pillar and portions of koran inscriptions we dug excitedly with our hands in the sand we found other inscriptions on slate and on of one of which i took an impression on paper it seemed much more ancient than the others and had most beautiful design on it of curves and ﬂowers tablet at the entrance of the tomb of the forty saints was not of marble but of slate carved it bore the following date ۲۸۲۱ which i believe corresponds to the heptagonal tower had two entrances one to the north the other to the south but was unfortunately getting smothered in sand again we became greatly excited on discoveri ng the inscriptions and pulled up our sleeves and proceeded in due haste to dig again in the process which although much dryer reminded one very forcibly of one younger days at the seaside our efforts were somewhat cooled by ghastly white marble ﬁgure which we dug up and which had such sneering expression on its countenance that it set the natives all round shrieking with laughter the f igure we dug out at z aidan arabic inscription and marble columns with earthenware lamps upon them fragment of water stone implements brick wall of the t ombs of forty saints showing in top corners of photograph we thought we had better leave off moreover the natives who had accompanied us seemed rather upset at my photographing and digging and now that i had got what i wanted i did not care to make them feel more uneasy than was necessary i had exhausted all the photographic plates i had brought out with night was coming on fast and we had twenty miles to ride back on my last plate i photographed our last ﬁnd which is reproduced the beneﬁt of my readers facing page this ugly head with very elongated and much expanded nose and vicious mouth full of teeth had been carved at the end of piece of marble one and half feet high the head with its oblique eyes was well polished but the remainder of the marble beyond the ears which were just indicated by the artist was roughly cut and appeared to have been made with the intention of being inserted into wall leaving the head to project outside its ﬂat forehead too would lead to the conclusion that it had been so shaped to act support very likely to some tablet or moulding of the mosque the katkhuda said that it was very ancient god but its age was not easy to ascertain on so short an acquaintance it certainly seemed very much more ancient than anything else we had found the

persia it is not to go fully into the history of this great city of zaidan so much of it rests on speculation and confused traditions that i would rather leave this work to some scientist of more gambling disposition than my own but now that i have described what i myself saw i will add few historical details which seem correct and the opinions of one or two other travellers in that region which add interest to the place well strengthen my statements with the many photographs which i took and which are reproduced in this book i hope that fair idea of the place will be conveyed to the reader the following short historical notes were furnished to by the katkhuda or head village man of the present village near the zaidan ruins i reproduce them verbatim without assuming any responsibility the accuracy of the historical dates but the information about the great city itself i found to be correct arabic i nscription on m arble dug by uthor at the c ity of z aidan when shah rukh shah was ruler of turkistan and one malek was ruler of sistan and kain shah rukh shah was engaged in settling disturbances in the northern part of his dominions and malek taking advantage of it attacked herat and plundered it shah rukh shah hearing of this collected an army and marched on sistan during this march he devastated the country which was then very fertile and wealthy and captured and dispersed the inhabitants of the endless city of extended from to the south now in afghan territory on the present bank of the halmund to lash yuwain on the north also in afghan territory on the bank of the farah rud distance according to the trigonometrical survey maps of 86 miles the crow ﬂies this would agree with the account given by the amir of the extent of the city the city of zaidan was protected by large fortress at every six farsakhs 24 miles each fortress was said to be strongly garrisoned with troops and had high watch tower in the centre similar to that which i saw at distance on the of iskil and which has been described in previous pages another historical version attributes the destruction of zaidan and adjoining cities to taimur lang tamerlane or taimur the lame father of shah rukh whose barbarous soldiery some traditions will have it were alone responsible the pillage of zaidan city and the devastation of all sistan the name of taimur lang is to this day held in terror by the natives of sistan but whether zaidan was devastated twice or whether the two accounts apply to the same disaster it is not easy to ascertain at so distant date there are obvious signs all over eastern sistan that the country must have under gone great trouble and under the rule of shah rukh and his successors after which revolutions seem to have been rampant some sixty years

these ruins with those of pulki nadali and peshawaran are the most extensive in sistan and mark the sites of populous cities the like of which are not to be found at this present day in all this region between the indus and the tigris doshak or deshtak is situated about fourteen miles south by of on the right bank of the main canal which extended from the halmund towards the west it was large walled town with towers and square fort in the centre deshtak is said to have been the residence and capital of the ﬁrst member of the safavi dynasty in sistan which like all other cities of sistan was pillaged and razed to the ground by the terrible taimur lang on its ruins rose the smaller city of some 500 houses which we have called which eventually became the seat of bahram khan the last of the kayani chiefs the city was built by him his son jalaludin after whom it was named jalaludin however was expelled from the throne and from that date the kayani family ceased to reign in the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https was also located on this main canal east of deshtak and peshawaran was situated due north of zaidan they consist of an immense extent of ruins both sir goldsmid and bellew who travelled in that part testify to the whole country between jalalabad and peshawaran being covered with ruins the ruins at peshawaran i was not able to visit they being in afghan forbidden to being the guest of the british consul i did not wish to cause trouble sir goldsmid who visited them during the frontier mission describes them covering great area and being strongly built of alternate layers of and baked brick the ruins of madrassah with mosque and mihrab were most extensive and had traces of ornamentations and an inscription said to be kuﬁc the walls of the citadel were in 1872 in fairly good repair the citadel sir goldsmid relates was of circular form somewhat irregu lar in shape with diameter of from two to three hundred yards the walls are about ﬁfty feet high built strongly of baked brick with species of arched covered gallery ﬁve feet high and ﬁve feet wide running round the summit of the ramparts very similar arrangement was to be seen on the zaidan fort can be noticed in the photograph which i took and which is reproduced in the full page illustration facing page 206 two massive round towers guard the gateway approached by narrow steep ascent in the centre of the fort on mound stood superior house probably the residence of the gover nor to the south 6 dense drifts of sand run to the summits of the ramparts if these drifts can rise so high on the high wall of the citadel it is certain that great many of the smaller buildings must be rather deep under the sand level by now but that they are there there can be little doubt fragments of tiles bricks vases strew the ground doubt the usual critic will wonder how it is that if the houses are buried these fragments are not buried also the wind principally is responsible their keeping on the surface of the sand they are constantly shifted and are blown from place to place until arrested by some obstacle such wall where great number of these fragments can generally be found collected by the wind the great characteristic of these ruins sir is the number of accurately constructed arches which still remain and which are seen in almost every house and the remains of strongly built windmills with vertical axis is usually the case in sistan this again we have seen is also one of the characteristics of the zaidan buildings the ruins of peshawaran are subdivided into several groups such the kol marut saliyan three miles east of the fort khushabad bellew who camped at saliyan describ es this section of the ruins which cover many square miles of country with readily distinguishable mosques and colleges madrassahs and the arabic inscriptions traceable on the façades of some of the principal buildings clearly refer their date to the period of the arab conquest and further is evidenced by the domes and arches forming the roofs of the houses that then now the country was devoid of timber ﬁt building purposes the most remarkable characteristic of these ruins is their vast extent and excellent preservation i too am of bellew opinion about these points the several inscriptions i found at zaidan photographs of which i have given in this book were we have seen in arabic the ornamentations of which i took tracings were arabic in character bellew reckons the great extent of the peshawaran section of the ruins cover ing an area of about six miles by eight he states that they were the outgrowths of successive cities rising on the ruins of their predecessors upon the same spot and like the other few travellers who have intelligently examined the ruins came to the conclusion that in point of architecture and age the whole length from lash yuwain to the north to to the south and including pesh awaran zaidan and were absolutely identical goldsmid supplies information similar to bellew regarding the peshawaran ruins and he writes that on his march north to lash yuwain he had to go three or four miles to the west on account of the ruins he speaks of seeing place of worship with mihrab and curiously enough on the wall above it he found the masonic star of ﬁve points surrounded by circle and with round cup between each of the points and another in the centre he also saw the tomb of saiyid ikbal also mentioned by another traveller christie eight miles west by from the ruins rises hill called the kuchah not dissimilar in shape to the to the of four villages are found near it to the east of it is found the farah rud and to its west the harut rud two rivers losing themselves when they have any water in them into the lagoon the harut is not always ﬂowing to the south is the naizar lagoon forming part of the this lagoon was mostly dry when i went through it has formed huge lake at various epochs but now only the northern portion skirting the southern edge of the peshawaran ruins has any permanent water in it and is principally fed by the delta of canals and by the overﬂow of the halmund over the band kind of barrage some explanation is necessary to make things clear on the present boundary at place called the is the great dam across the halmund completely turning the waters of the stream by means of canals the irrigation of sistan hence the fertility of that district the dam the band it is called by the natives is barrier slightly over 700 feet long constructed of upright wooden stakes holding in position horizontal fascines of tamarisk interwoven strengthened by stones and plastered with mud to form wall in olden days the band was so feebly constructed that it was generally carried away every year at the spring ﬂoods but now greater attention is given to its construction and it is kept in fairly good repair although portions of it usually collapse or are carried away by the force of the current during the ﬂoods the height of the band is not more than eighteen or twenty feet practically the actual river course comes to an end at this band and from this point its waters are spread into delta of canals large and small subdivided into hundreds other tortuous channels the hussein ki canal is one of the most important and feeds zaidan iskil bunjar and nasrya husseinabad and other places and is subdivided into minor channels during its course it ﬂows roughly in the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https 1896 according to major sykes royal geographical society journal new canal known the was formed and destr oyed jahanabad ibrahimabad and jalalabad this canal he says is not far from the which he seems to think was at one time the main stream and ﬂowed in natural bed past zaidan to the west of it but personally i have my doubts about the accuracy of this statement i believe that the was merely shallow canal that passed to the west of zaidan but that the river course of the halmund itself was always to the east of zaidan well of the other adjoining cities north of zaidan the canal to the east of is doubt naturally cut channel the obvious continuation under natural circum stances of the river course the same remark might apply to the small channel to the west of that place there are other important channels such the madar which supplies water to chiling pulki and sekhuka the kimak canal and the kasimabad before the present dam was constructed some eighty years ago previous band existed we shall see further up the course of the halmund to the south and secured the irrigation of the southern portion of sistan which is now absolutely dry and barren dried up canal beds of great length are still to be found in southern sistan sketch plan of zaidan c itadel by h enr y s avage l andor it would be great undertaking to describe accurately all these canals and the various positions they have occupied at different epochs and the task would at best be most thankless and useless with the exception of the larger ones the minor ones keep constantly changing their course by cutting themselves new beds in the soft soil anybody who has visited eastern sistan even in very dry season i did knows too well how the ground is intersected in all directions by myriads of natural water channels all fed by the halmund so that unless one had months of time at one disposal it would hardly be possible to map them all out exactly during ﬂood time the water ﬂows over the band and into its natural channel due north up into the hamun where it loses itself there is good deal of verdure trees and high reeds near the banks of the river at the band with many snakes while ﬁsh is plentiful in the water and myriads of wild fowl are to be seen curious conical temporary graves of mud can occasionally be seen some six feet high the body being it is said buried standing within these cones previous to proper interment with due ceremony on the outside clear imprints made while the mud was still soft of several sized of the deceased relations or left on the surface of the cone the imprints being one above the other in line among the ruins of peshawaran belle w found traces of several canals now dry one of which however had been restored by the chief of hokat and brought stream of good water up to the silyan ruins irrigation purposes the southern end of the great city at we have very good accounts from ferrier goldsmid and bellew all testifying to its great extent here too there is strong citadel standing on an artiﬁcial mound and seeming to have been repaired some or thirty years ago bellew says that the ruins extend over several miles of country and goldsmid speaks of circumference of ruins of some two and half miles at with large citadel and ﬁne arched buildings within he mentions spacious courtyards and the remains of reservoirs caravanserais and large buildings in abundance but vestige of anything approaching magniﬁcence this however is the case with everything persian whether ancient or modern especially in regard to architecture and great deal of the humbleness of the buildings is i think due to the facts that the inhabitants of persia are nomads by nature that the shifting sands drive people from their homes that rivers constantly alter their courses and that the water supply is constant source of difﬁculty in most parts of iran moreover the terrible wars and invasions made the natives disinclined to construct themselves very elaborate houses which they might at any moment have to abandon these reasons account the extraordinary number of abandoned villages towns fortresses and whole ruined suburbs of towns all over persia sight which i think can not be seen on such large scale in any other country in the world at the question of the water may not have been the principal one but the fear of constant attacks must have deterred the natives from erecting magniﬁcent buildings or else how could we account these enormous fortresses which are found all along to protect the great city goldsmid describes ﬁne caravanserai at built of large baked brick s each brick eleven inches square and displaying nicety of design foreign to sistan the caravanserai seems to have been domed over large central courtyard with wings rooms and stabling and an adjoining house of mud bricks in the graveyard fragments of alabaster and tiles were found the wall round the city which goldsmid feet at the base tapering to one foot at the somewhat different in character from that of zaidan and is to my mind of much later construction are many of the the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https some of the streets he says which all run from east to west are in excellent preservation and if they were of recent construction it is quite possible in fact very probable that this portion of the great by the bye is said to have been the last capital of the kayani kings and was deserted by them when attacked by nadir owing to its favourab le geographical position on the east bank of the halmund been inhabited to certain extent until much later date the local accounts at least would point to that conclusion dry canal exists which we shall cross on our way to the beluchistan frontier it is fed by the halmund north of and strikes across the plain in westerly direction if all the accounts given by people who have been there are taken into consideration together with the photographs here given which seem to to show that the place was one of unusual grandeur if the fact is grasped that whether considered single city or conglomeration of adjoining successive cities zaidan was undoubtedly continuous and uninterrupted row of houses of less than miles i think that whatever theories may be expounded by the usual scientiﬁc speculator at home the fact must remain that this ancient london of asia marks period of astounding prosperity in the history of eastern persia footnotes 6 i think this must be mistake it should be to the chapter xxiv departure from one idea of city of roars of laughter ascent to the water grave with the gandun piran and graves and their smaller kuk view of legends about the is famous owing to the tender care of major and benn i was at the beginning of 1902 in fair condition of strength to undertake the journey of 600 miles on camels across northern beluchistan to quetta with the help of major benn i made up fresh caravan entirely of running camels and expected therefore to be able to travel very fast the camels selected were excellent and the two beluch drivers who came with most faithful considerate and excellent servants sadek also accompanied everything was made ready to start by january 2nd but some hitch or other occurred daily and it was not till january 10th that i was able to take my indeed to say to my new good friends major and benn to whose charmingly thoughtful care i altogether owed it that i was now able to proceed in good health the hour of our departure was ﬁxed 5 but my three cats suspecting that we were going to move from our comfortable quarters disappeared during the night and some hours were wasted by sadek and all the servants of the consulate in trying to ﬁnd them again i was determined not to start without them sadek was furious the camel men impatient the guard of lancers sent by the consul to accompany some distance had been ready on their horses long time and everybody at hand was calling out puss puss puss in the most endearing tones of voice and searching every possible nook after four hours of expressive language in persian hindustani beluchi and english at nine the cats were eventually discovered one had hidden under huge pile of wood all of which we had to remove to get him out the second had found most comfortable sanctum in benn room and the third having ascertained that his companions had been discovered walked out unconcerned and entered the travelling box of his own accord i was sorry to leave sistan too with its ancient ruins its peculiar inhabitants mixture of all kinds its quaint city so strikingly picturesque especially at sunset when owing to the moisture in the air beautiful warm colours appeared in the sky and the thousands of camels and sheep moving like so many phantoms in clouds of dust returned to their homes the sad dingling of their bells sounded musical enough in the distance and one saw horsemen dashing full gallop towards the city before the gates were closed every man carrying gun far to the west in the background stood the kwajah mountain so famous in the history of sistan all this after the dreary long salt desert journey had seemed heavenly to and i was more than sorry to leave the place had i been russian instead of an englishman i would not have continued my journey on the morning of my departure on coming out of the consulate gate the ﬁrst thing i saw was dead body being washed and prepared interment by relatives in the ouse adjoining the consulate wall the russians believe the sight of dead body an at the beginning of journey gul khan the consul assistant accompanied far the mountain to inspect which i had to make detour we passed south of and after wading through numberless water channels and skirting large pools of water crossed tiny anonymous village of six domed huts and then came to very large one rejoicing in the name of dadi my fast camels carrying loads had gone ahead and we who had started later on horses caught them up some sixteen miles onward where there was third little village the inhabitants of which were and unkempt the women and children stampeded at our approach the houses were and were taller than seven feet except the house of the head village man which was and had domed the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https the hamun halmund extended far south kandak the ah mountain was an island but now the whole country around it is dry except some small swamps and pools on the edges of which thousands of sheep could be seen grazing it took very powerfu l sight indeed to see what the animals were grazing on one idea of always picture pasture sheep certainly not fulﬁlled and after minute inspection one saw the poor brutes feeding on tiny stumps of dried grass yellowish in colour and hardly distinguishable from the sand on which it grew in clusters not more than half an inch high where the hamun had been its bed was now of whitish colour from salt deposits the mountain occasionally also called rising it does directly from the ﬂat is most attractive and interesting more particularly because of its elongated shape and its ﬂat top which gives it quite unique appearance seen from the east it stretches about three miles and half or even four at its base is 900 feet high and about three miles on top of the plateau the summit even when the beholder is only half mile away from it appears like ﬂat straight line against the great boulder that stands up higher on the being the only interruption to this uniformity the black rocky sides of the mountain are very fact almost perpendicular at the upper porti on but the lower part has accumulations of clay mud and sand extending in gentle slope in fact roughly speaking the silhouette of the mountain has the appearance of the section of an inverted silhouette of kuh i kwajah major sykes in the royal geographical society journal describes this mountain resembling in shape an apple but surely if there ever was anything in the world that had resemblance whatever to an apple it was this mount ain it would be curious to know what major sykes calls an apple the diagram here appended of the outline of the mountain and indeed the photograph given by major sykes in the royal geographical society journal february 1902 page 143 will i think be sufﬁcient to convince the least observan t on this point major sykes is also less than 500 feet out in his estimate of the height of the hill the summit is 900 feet above the 400 feet stated by him the altitude at the base is feet and at the summit feet we rounded the mountain to the southward to ﬁnd place at which we could climb to the top we saw very ancient fort perched on the summit of the mountain commanding the ruins of or the city of roars of laughter quaint and picturesque city built on the steep slope of the south escarpment of the mountain sketch map of summit of by henry savage landor in the centre of this city was large and high quadrangular wall like citadel and it had houses all round it can be seen by the view photograph i took of it from the fort above view from which high point of vantage will be described at the end of this chapter we went along the outer wall of the city on level with the plain at the hill base but we abandoned it this wall went up the mountain side to the north some high columns could be seen which appeared to have formed part of high tower the sides of the hill on which the city was built were very precipitous but steep tortuous track existed leading to the city on the east side the two gates of the city being the other the rear of the city and it were facing the mountain side behind on the side high accumulat ions of sand formed an extensive tongue projecting very far out into the plain the rocky upper portion of the mountain was black towards the east but getting yellowish in the southern part where there were high sand accumulations up to about of the height of the mountain with deep channels cut into them by water we came to narrow gorge which divides the mountain in two and by which along very stony path between high vertical rocks the summit of the table mountain could be reached we left our horses in charge of lancer and mahommed azin the head village man of man who said he was descendant of the kayani family and who professed to know everything about everything khan and i gradually climbed to the higher part of the mountain i say gradually because there was great deal to interest and puzzle one on the way up this path to the summit had been forme rly strongly fortiﬁed shortly after entering the gorge where we had dismounted was strange wall cut in the hard rock by very sharp pointed instrument one could still distinctly see the narrow grooves made by it then there were curious heads of the same rock with side hollows that looked if caused by the constant friction or some horizontal wooden or stone implement i was much puzzled by these and could not come to deﬁnite conclusion of what could have been their use even our guide universal knowledge the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https he offered explanation beyond telling that they had been made by man which i had long before discovered myself small reservoir was found near this spot and nearly at the top of the hillock ditch had been excavated near the easiest point of access and another ditch could be seen all round the low land round the mountain has most certainly been inundated at various epochs forming shallow temporary swamp but not permanent lake has been asserted by some and from what one saw one was tempted to believe that the plain around must have been dryer in the days of its glory than it has been in this century dead h ouses and z iara t on k uh i wajah f amil y t omb ight c omp artments on k uh i wajah on reaching the summit we found ourselves on an undulating plateau covered with graves but these graves unlike all others which i had seen in persia had not only the charac teristic points of the zaidan ones in which the body was encased in the tomb above the level of the ground but were in compartments and contained whole families the ﬁrst grave we examined was made of huge boulders and was six yards long four yards wide and had four sections each occupied by skeleton and covered over with ﬂat slabs of stone each compartment was about 1½ feet high 2½ feet broad and 6 feet long near this family grave was quarry of good stone from which stones grinding wheat had been cut at the foot was reservoir one was rather surprised on reaching the summit of to ﬁnd it so undulating on approaching the mountain from the plain one was specially impressed by its straight upper outlines against the sky the summit is actually concave like basin with numerous hillocks all round and one portion judging by sediments left would appear to have contained lake in the centre of the plateau are two extensive artiﬁcial camps dug into the earth and rock and having stone sides on hillock to the west of one of these ponds stands tomb with less than ten graves side by side from this point eastwards however is the most interesting portion of this curious plateau numerous groups of graves are to be seen at every few yards and two ses one with large dome partly collapsed on the north side the other still in the most perfect state of preservation the photograph facing page 240 gives good idea of them the larger and more important had central hall 4½ yards square and each side of the square had an outer wing each with one door and one window above it each wing projected three yards from the central hall to the east in the central hall there was very greasy stone that looked if some oily substance had been deposited on it possibly something used in preparing the dead next to it was vessel water outside all round the walls of this and radiating in all directions were graves all above ground and close together was possible to construct them while on the hillocks to the south of the were hundreds of compartments the dead some in perfect condition others fallen through some showing evident signs of having been broken through by sacrilegious very likely in search of the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https i akaha the c ity of r oars of l aughter the g andun p iran z iara t on k uh i wajah on the top of hillock higher than the others was tomb of section s all occupied lot of large stones were heaped on the top of this important spot and surmounting all and planted ﬁrmly in them was slender upright stone pillar 6½ feet high it had inscription upon it nor any sign of any kind and had been roughly chipped off into an elongated shape near this grave which was the most extensive of its kind that i had observed on the plateau was very peculiar ruined house with four rooms each four yards square and each room with two doors and all the rooms communicating it was badly damaged its shape was most unusual we then proceeded to the ziarat pilgrimage place famous all over persia and afghanistan i was fortunate enough to take good photograph of its exterior see opposite which will represent its appearance to the reader better than description high rectangular building plastered all over with mud front arch or alcove giving access to small door and two domed low stone buildings one on either side and another ruined building with wall around it behind the ziarat few yards to the left of the entrance one looked at it was coarse upright stone pillar the inside of the ziarat was more interesting than the outside it was very large whitewashed single room with high vaulted ceiling and in the centre rose from the ﬂoor to height of three feet gigantic tomb six yards in length with gabled top it measured one yard and half across at the head and one yard at its foot and had two stone pillars some ﬁve feet high standing one at each extremity to these two end pillars was tied rope from which hung numberless rags strips of cloth and hair behind the head of the tomb along the wall stretched platform four and half feet wide on which rested two brass candlesticks of primitive shape kalyan and great number of rags of all sizes ages and degrees of dirt the scrolls and inscriptions on the wall were very quaint primitive represent ations of animals in couples male and female being the most indulged in by the pilgrims goats and dogs seemed favourite subjects portrayal male and female goa ts dog lock of human hair and another of goat hair hung on the wall to the right of the entrance and on two sticks laid across another mass of rags white blue yellow and red hundreds more were strewn upon the ground and the cross bars of the four windows of the ziarat were also of these cloth offerings among other curious things noticeable on the altar platform were number of stones scooped into water this ziarat goes by the name of gandun piran and is said to be some centuries old in the spring equinox pilgrimages are made to this ziarat from the neighbouring city and villages when offerings of wheat are contributed that the donor may be at peace with the gods and expect plentiful crops these pilgrimages take very much the form of our day outing on bank holiday and sports of various kinds are indulged in by the horsemen it is the custom of devout people when visiting these ziarats to place stone on the tomb white one if obtainable and we shall ﬁnd this curious custom extending all over beluchistan and i believe into great portion of afghanistan directly in front of the ziarat was the priests house with massive broad stone walls and nine rooms the ceilings fallen through in most rooms were not usual but cylindrical could still be seen very plainly in the better one of the central room this house had separate building behind stables and an outer oven baking bread the dwelling was secluded by the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https top of is even now favourite spot people to be laid to their eternal rest and near this ziarat were to be found great many graves which were quite modern these modern tombs more elaborate than the old ones rose to about ﬁve feet above the ground had mud and stone perforated balustrade above them all round and three steps by which the upper part could be reached they seldom however had more than three bodies in each tomb we found on the ground very curious large hollowed stone like big mortar which seemed very ancient then further were more old graves in rows of ﬁve six eight and more when one peeped into the broken ones the temptation to take home some of the bleached skulls to add to the collection of one national museum and to let scientists speculate on their exact age was great but i have horror of desecrating graves i took one most beautifully preserved meaning to overcome my scruples but after going some distance with it wrapped up in my handkerchief i was seized with remorse and i had to go and lay it back again in the same spot where it had centuries lain undisturbed i examined several skulls that were in good condition and the following were their principal characteristics they possessed abnormally broad and the forehead was very slanting backwards and was extremely narrow across the temples and broad at its highest portion the back portion of the skull in which the anim al qualities of the brain are said by phrenologists to reside was also abnormally developed when compared to european skulls the top section above an imaginary plane intersecting it horizontally above the ear was well formed except that in the back part there was strange deep depression on the right side of the skull and an abnormal development on the left side this peculiarity was common to great many skulls and was their most marked characteristic evidently the brains of the people who owned them must have constantly been working on particular line which caused this development more than that of other portions of the skull b ird s ye v iew of k ala i akaha the c ity of r oars of l aughter the upper jaw was rather contracted and mean compared to the remaining characteristics of the skull slanting very far forwards where it ended into quite small curve in which the front teeth were set the teeth themselves were extremely powerful and healthy the bumps behind the ear channels were well marked the whole skull however seen from above was more fully developed on its right side than on the left also the same abnormal development on the right side could be noticed under the skull at the sides where it joins the spinal column in general way these skulls reminded one of the formation of the skulls of the present beluch another smaller ziarat partly ruined was to be found south of the one we had inspected the tomb itself being of less gigantic proportions and now almost entirely buried in sand the two end pillars however remained standing upright the northern one being nevertheless broken in half the door of this ziarat was to the south of the building and had window above it the walls had stone foundation some 2 feet high above which the remainder of the wall was entirely of mud with perforated window to the west the tomb itself was 8 feet long by 4 feet wide small square receptacle was cut in the northern wall we had now come to the kuk fort above the city of on the south of the mountain with the exception of large round tower 40 feet in diameter at the base there remained very little to be seen of this sections of other minor towers and wall existed but all was confused mass of debris sand and mud from this point splendid view was obtained of the city of just below of which photograph from this bird eye aspect will be found facing 246 of this volume there was an extensive courtyard in the centre enclosed by high wall and having tower in the centre of each of the two sides of the quadrangle belt of buildings was enclosed between this high wall and second wall which had two towers one at each angle looking north towards the cliff of the mountain from which we observed outside this wall two rows of what from our high point of vantage appeared to be graves could be seen while to the east were other buildings and cliff dwellings extending almost to the bottom of the hill where tower marked the limit of the city from this point tortuous track could be seen along the gorge winding its way to the city gate the only opening in the high third wall most irregularly built along the precipice of the ravine at the foot of the mountain this wall turned sharp corner and describing roughly semicircle protected the city also to the west at the most point there seemed to be the principal gate of the city with massive high tower and with road encased between two high walls leading to it the semicircle formed by the mountain behind which was of most precipitous nature was enclosed at its mouth by fourth outer wall with an inner ditch making the fortress of practically impregnable the legend about city furnished by the through gul khan was very interesting in ancient days there was in that city deep well the abode of certain godly virgins to whom people went from far and near blessings visitors used to stand listening near the well and if the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https were accepted the virgins laughed heartily whereby the city gained the name of roar of laughter silence on the part of the sanctimonious maidens was sign that the prayers were not granted the sistan historical authorities seem to think this origin of the name plausible there were however other amusing if less reliable legends such the one our friend mahommed azin gave which is too quaint to be omitted in the time of alexander the great he told us aristotles the famous had produced an animal which he had placed in fort which fort mahommed azin seemed rather vague about whoever gazed upon the animal was seized with such convulsions of laughter that he could not stop until he died when alexander was the west maghr eb zemin continued mahommed azin he had seen this wonderful of laughter produced by aristotles and some seventy or eighty thousand soldiers had actually died of laughter which they could not repress on seeing it plato only who was wise man devised ruse to overcome the terrible effects of looking at the anim al he brought with him which he placed in front of the brute and sure enough the demon which had caused the hilarious death of many others in its turn was seized by hysterical laughing at itself and of course could not stop and died too mahommed azin was somewhat uncertain whether the animal itself had resided in the fortress of the mountain or whether the owner of the animal had visited the place or whether the place had been named merely in honour of the legend of the animal of laugh ter all i can say is that when mahommed with grave face had ﬁnished his inimitable story gul khan and i were also seized with such uncontrollable ﬁts of hilarity that notwithstanding our mournful surroundings of graves and we too very nearly went to swell the number of victims of mahommed azin animal of laughter although without the pleasure of having made its personal acquaintance mahommed azin positively ﬁnished us up when he gravely added that it was most dangerous to recount the legend he had told us he had known people die of laughter by merely listening to it there was some truth in that we nearly did not only at the story but at the himself is famous spot in persian history it is said that the great persian hero rustam ﬁrst exploit was to capture this city and slay its king kuk after whom the fort standing above kakaha is named in more modern days kakaha which from ancient times had been place of shelter retreating princes hard driven by the enemy has become noteworthy its seven years resistance to the attacks of nadir troops when the kayani king having abandoned his capital had taken refuge in the impregnable city of chapter xxv villages between and last of the of patan g black sand roofs are spacious residence built nine characteristics of spherical sand protections against the northerly winds we were benighted on the mountain and did not reach the village of till nearly nine our friend and guide having lost his way in the dark and having taken us round the country good many more miles than was necessary it is true the night was rather black and it was not easy to see where the low of his village were the distance in direct line from to the foot of the mountain was 4 miles and the village of was about 15 miles from the village of dadi we had passed being 9 miles off and sanchuli 14¾ miles from the city and only quarter of mile from to the south of the latter village was we spent the night at mahommed azin the head village man and guide being so entertaining in his conversation that he kept us up till all hours of the morning he professed to be one of the only two surviving members of the kayani family which formerly reigned over sistan his cousin being the other according to his however could not always claim to be models of family had good deal of power in sistan up to about forty years ago 1860 they were now very poor mahommed azin had features and bore himself like man of superior birth but he was very bitter in his speech against fate and things in general it was nevertheless wonderful how man living in small village secluded from everybody and everywhere had heard of ﬂying machines of submarine boats of balloons that ferenghis made his ideas of them were rather amusing but he was very intelligent and quick at grasping how they worked when i explained to him surgery interested him intensely and after that politics the ruski and inglis he was sure would have great deal of trouble over sistan he could not quite make up his mind to which was the bigger nation when he heard ruski accounts of themselves he certainly thought the ruski were the greater people but when he listened to the inglis and what they could he really believed they must be stronger who you think is the most powerful he inquired of of course the inglis without doubt then you think that your king will grant pension so that i can live in luxury and without working to the end of my days the king does not usually grant pensions to lazy people pensions are granted to people who have done work the country well then you see exclaimed mahom med azin in thorough unreasonable persian fashion you say your king is greater than the ruski king and he would not grant pension i the last of the kayanis he was sure the ruski potentate would at once if he knew the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https left husena at on january 11th striking south warmal there were good many wretched villages in succession half mile or so apart from one another such dubna luftulla and husena baba the ground was covered with white salt which resembled snow husena baba was quite large and important village the inhabitants came out in great force to greet us although wood was extremely scarce at this village nearly all the houses had ﬂat roofs supported on rough rafters matting on layer of reeds prevented the upper coating of mud from falling through i came across several horses laden with bundles of long reeds which they dragged behind them and which they had carried probably from the naizar where they were plentiful we had altered our course from south to east and here i parted with useful gul khan and the escort who had to return to the consulate i mounted my riding camel and started off this time on my way to warmal again we saw thousands of sheep grazing on the ﬂat desert of dried mud and salt cracked in innumerable places by the sun here and there close examination showed tiny tufts of dried grass some two inches in circumference and not more than half an inch tall and at an average distance of about ten feet from one another it was astounding to that so many animals could ﬁnd sufﬁcient nourishment subsistence on so scant y diet but although not very fat the sheep seemed to be in pretty good condition to the west we had high ridge of patang between these mountains and our track in the distance an extensive marsh could be distinguished with high reeds in profusion near its humid banks to the east some miles of f were dolehtabad village then tuti and sakawa near lutok before us and stretching several miles plateau rose to very great height above the horizon otherwise everything was ﬂat and uninteresting all around us some very curious walls of black mud mixed with organic matter built to shelter sheep from the ﬁerce north winds while proceeding from one village to another can be seen in the lut these black dashes on the white expanse of salt and sand have about the same effect on the picturesqueness of the scenery coarse scrawls with blunt pen on ﬁne page of calligraphy you see them here and there scattered about all facing north like so many black dashes in the otherwise delicate tones of grey and white of the soil when we had gone some miles on this ﬂat hard stretch of ground where the heat was terrible we had to make detour round large marsh then beyond it stood ﬁve parallel banks of sand 25 feet high with horizontal layers of ed stone up to half the height of the dunes the dunes were about 200 yards apart in the afternoon we arrived at warmal where water seemed plentiful and good here too in the centre of most villages and towns of persia pond of stagnant ﬁlthy water could be seen the pond at warmal was of unusually ample proportions and extended through the whole length of the village which was built on both sides of this dirty pond numerous canals branched off from this main reservoir and in fact had one had little imagination one might have named this place the venice of sistan at sunset swarms of mosquitoes rose buzzing from the putrid water but from picturesque point of view the effect of the buildings reﬂected in the water was quite pretty to facilitate transit from one side of the village to the other primitive bridg of earth had been constructed across the pond but the central portion of it was under water it was necessary to remove one in order to make use of the convenience characteristic of warmal were the quaint balconies or terraces in shape either quadrangular or rectangular that were attached to or in close proximity of each house they were raised platforms of mud from 2 to 4 feet above the ground with balustrade of bricks on these terraces the natives seek refuge during the summer nights to avoid being suffocated by the stiﬂing heat inside their houses difference in the construction and architecture of some of the roofs of the houses could be noted here the roofs were oblong instead of perfectly circular and when one examined how the bricks were laid it seemed extraordinary that the vaults stood up at all these were the only roofs in persia i had seen constructed on this particular principle the bricks were laid round the vaults of the roof at an angle of and the other third in vertical position there was the usual upper central aperture and occasionally one or two side ones the natives were very civil and obliging and usual they all crowded round to converse sahib said one old man you must come to settle here why should i settle here it

have seen some built on this principle and several centuries old standing in good preservation and good new the type of natives was quite different again from that in other places already visited and was most interesting the men like most men of the desert had elongated faces with long regular noses slightly convex and somewhat drooping the nostrils were rather swollen and lacking character and not sharply cut at the bridge the nose was very narrow but broad in its lower portion and quite rounded which looked better in proﬁle than full face the nostrils drooped considerably towards the point of the nose and were high up where joining the cheek the faces of these fellows formed long smooth oval with marked and vivid dark intelligent eyes small but showing the entire iris the lips were the most defective part of their faces being unduly prominent thick and the hair grew in very normal way on their faces and they possessed very good arched eyebrows slightly coarse but and in most cases meeting at the root of the nose in men the beard was thick and curly but did not grow to any great length on the skull the hair was and was soaked in oil so that it had the appearance or being perfectly straight ample trousers the usual long shirt and afghan boots which are not unlike european military boots made up the attire of the masculine members of the community the women had on smaller scale very similar features to those of the men and at distance their oval faces appeared quite handsome but on closer inspection the lineaments were much too elongated to be attractive they had somewhat pulled appearance both men and women were tall slender and of very wiry build after sunset the women with their heads wrapped up in sort of white chudder thrown gracefully behind the shoulders and reaching down to the feet began to prowl about in great state of excitement carrying big balls of ﬂour paste and small wicker work plates like shields covered over by cloth they lighted big ﬁre in one of the small domed ovens and after beating the paste on the wicker shields till it had spread into thin layer they quickly took it up with their hands and kneeling over the blazing furnace stuck the paste against the roof of the oven they used long leather gloves the purpose while being baked the bread was constantly sprinkled with water from bowl close at hand nearly each house has its own outer oven but the one i was near seemed to be used by several families judging by string of clamouring women who did they not let the others know how impatiently with all necessaries in hand to bake bread their men the respective husbands and sons squatted around on their heels languidly smok ing their pipes and urging their women to be quick deal of chaff seemed to take place during this daily operation but the women were quite in earnest and took themselves and the process very seriously they seemed much concerned if one piece got too much burnt or another not enough to the east by of warmal about mile and half off were four sand mounts standing prominent against the and great number of sand hills of confused formation the several which i had observed in the morning on our

desert there were to the east and west about one mile apart at the most northern end of the western range round tower could be seen on the summit of hillock having crossed over the low hill range before us we descended into long ﬂat sandy stretch with tamarisk shrubs in abundance in an arc of circle from north to south there extended sand accumulations in various guises the highest being some lofty conical hills due east of our course to the west in the distance we were encircled by the patang kuh and the mukh surk ranges which also extended from north to the project gutenberg ebook of

came ﬁrst to ruined tower then to burial ground with single graves and graves in sets of two and three very similar in shape to those we had seen on the kwajah these too were above ground but were made of mud instead of stone most of the graves had been broken through the graveyard was situated on sand hillock in the distance to the east and t of rustam city there spread from the north long stretch of ruins which probably were part of the continuation of the great zaidan number of many six being counted in high wall could be perceived still standing this must evidently have been fort and had what appeared to be the wall of tower at its end other extensive ruins could just be observed further and also to the where high tower stood prominent against the sky when close to rustam city we went through walled parall elogram enclosing tower great portion of the wall had collapsed but it appeared to have been an outpost north of the city the next thing was an ancient dry canal which came from the east by t and we then found ourselves before rustam abode the photograph given in the illustration was taken we approached the city and gives good idea of the place it appeared beyond the foreground of sand and salt the place was in most wonde rful preservation considering its age there were four high towers to the north the two central towers which protected the city gate being close together and more massive than the corner ones which were circular and tapering towards the summit the wall of the city was castellated and stood some 30 feet high the city gate protected by an outer screen was to the east and was it led directly into the main street of the city i can not better than enumerate the characteristics of the city in the order in which i noticed them on my visit to it path like narrow platform was visible all round up inside the wall well another on the top which gave access from one tower to another there were steps to reach the summit of the towers but merely inclined planes on entering the city only came at once upon rustam domed structure with great many lower annexes on its western and southern sides wall adjoining the city gate enclosed rustam quarters and had large entrance cut into it leading to the dwelling the various ﬂoors were reached by series of tunnelled passages on inclined planes rustam favourite room was said to have been the top one represented in the photograph facing page 266 where the outside of the two top storeys of the building can be seen the domed room was well preserved and had sort of raised portion to sit upon the ceiling was nicely ornamented with frieze and design of inverted angles the room had four windows and number of slits in the north wall ventilating purposes it was regular house commanding ﬁne view all round above the city wall of the great expanse of desert with its ancient cities to the east and distant blue mountains to the west there were number of receptacles some of which had been used burning lights and ﬁve doors leading into other rooms these rooms however were not so well fact they had mostly collapsed their side walls alone remaining wood had been used in the construction of the building and all the ceilings were vaulted rustam compound to use the handy word of the east occupied about of the area of the town and ﬁlled the entire corner besides the higher building it contained great many side structures with domes unfortunately only and showing the same peculiarity all the other domes in the city they had all collapsed on the north side while the southern part was preserved in the photograph facing page 268 this is shown very clearly this was of course due to the potent northerly winds rustam tall house and high walled enclosures can be seen in this photograph some domes of great proportions showing just above the high enclosing the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https spacious court commanded by raised passage from north to ently soldiers to patrol within the enclosure and in fact rustam premises form ed regular strong citadel within the city on the ground ﬂoor now considerably below the level of the street outside was long room like in the north wall it had most wonderful arrangement of ventilating chambers which made the room deliciously cool thes contrivances were like slits in the wall with channels where great draught was set up by the natural inﬂow and outﬂow of cooler and hotter air from above and under ground and from in and out of the sun great many receptacles could be noticed in the lower portion of the wall and also some low mangers if sheep had been kept here to supply meat the inmates of the citadel in time of siege next to this with an entrance on the main street was rustam reception great big room with domes less than 18 feet high inside but now fallen through in two places there were doors on the south and north and eleven receptacles specially constructed lamps these receptacles were rather quaint in their simple design recept acle light all round rustam palace the city wall was double and strengthened with outside battlements the same thing was noticeable in two portions of the city wall to the west and south sides the city wall was irregular in shape and impressed one having been built at various epoc hs and the city had the appearance of having been enlar ged in comparatively recent times there was moat outside the wall but in many places it had got ﬁlled up with sand glance at the plan which i drew of the city will give an idea of its shape the r emains of the t wo u pper s toreys of r ustam s h ouse on the north side of the main street opposite rustam house was large stable unroofed and showing in the wall number of mange rs which appeared if large number of horses had been kept besides these there were in the western portion of the city quantities of domed roofs very small few still perfect but mostly fallen in on the northern side the houses directly under the shelter of the northern wall were in the best preservation and many of them were still almost entirely above ground they were quadrangular or rectangular in shape made of mud and with low door on the south side the larger ones had ventilating channels with perforated slits in the north wall like those in rustam but all the houses were extremely average of 12 feet by 12 feet in the southern portion of the city where exposed to the wind the dwellings were in sand and hardly more than the domes remained above ground there were however one or two higher buildings presumably some of the better dwellings inhabited by rustam ofﬁcers portion of the south walls which curiously enough had quadrangular towers instead of tapering circular ones had collapsed and so had the corresponding portion of the north wall the city wall was of great interest and even on the west side where it was of less strength was constructed in successive tiers each of less than man height and each with path extending all along so that it could be remanned continuously in time of attack when one man of the higher platform fell another could replace him immediately from the platform directly below the towers were much higher than the wall the city gate was of great strength the two front towers being strengthened inwardly by third quadrangular tower raised block under the gateway was said to be the execution place this city historians declare was destro yed by bahram who caused it to be burnt but there is evidence whatever in the buildings to show that conﬂagration ever occurred in this place at all in fact it is rather difﬁcult to understand how buildings entirely of mud could be burned the city it is said was abandoned only about century ago when the sarbandi entered it by treachery and drove out the rais the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https s c ity showing rustam house in citadel also domed roofs blown in from the north few hundred feet to the south outside the city wall are the remains of the stable of rustam legendary gigantic horse part of the high wall still stands up on the top of the section of vault but the greater portion of the building which was evidently of great proportions is now buried in sand the exact spot is pointed out where the manger stood and so is the point where the heel ropes of this famous horse were tied this circumsta nce misled one traveller into stating in 1872 that two hills one mile apart to the denoted the places where the manger and the spot where the head of this famous horse were tied this error has been copied faithfully by subsequent travellers including very recent ones see journal of the royal geographical society february 1902 page 142 there seemed little doubt that the huge building of which the wall reproduced in the illustration made part was stable and that it must have been of special importance could be seen by the elaborate cross pattern decorations on its outer face the fragment of the wall stands over 50 feet high and to all appearance some twenty more feet of it are under ground buried by the sand it had strong supports at its base the stable was most peculiarly shaped ending in sharp point at one end another dry canal was noticeable to the west of the ruins which went from south to north with branch canal going due west and west were to be seen other ruined cities one of which with two high quadrangular towers was approximately three miles distant to the west on two hills were fortresses but between these and rustam city lay an immense graveyard about one mile from with graves above single ones but also few family ones in adjoining compartments we went along due west another ruined city was pointed out zorap very ancient place where bahram is said to have impaled the body of firamurz rustam son we crossed two more dry canals of some magnitude running parallel which showed that in former days this now barren part of sistan must have been under ﬂourishing cultivation in fact further on we came upon traces of houses and of extensive irrigation the soil having quite different appearance to the usual lut where left untouched by human tools plan of s her i ustam we then came across what at ﬁrst seeme d confused commotion of sand and mud but its formation was very curious and looked if it covered an underlying city of great size the surface sand seemed to reproduce to certain extent the form of the structures that were down below such quadrangular buildings walls domes etc it was not the natural formation of sand on natural ground in one particular place whole city wall with towers could be traced just showing above ground so perfectly rectangular that although covered by sand it would seem certain that fortress must be buried under this spot all around these particular suspected buried cities the sand is absolutely ﬂat and there would be other plausible reason this most extraordinary irregular accumulation of sand reproducing forms of walls domes and towers against all the general rules of local sand accumulations unless such obstacles existed below to compel the sand to accumulate in resemblance to them this theory the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https too by the fact that here and there some of the higher buildings actually may be seen to project above ground the sand mixed with salt had on getting wet become solid mud baked hard by the sun anybody interested in sand and its movements its ways and process of accumulation could not better than take trip to this part of sistan little one may care about sand one is bound to get interested in its ways and one point in its favour is that with certain amount of logic and observation one can always understand why it has assumed certain formation rather than pleasing feature not always existing in all geological formations of the scenery one goes through the great expanse of irregular surface soil with its innumerable obstacles and undulations was of course bound to give curious results in the sand accumulations south of it where the sand could deposit itself in more undisturbed fashion and was affected by purely natural causes of course sand hills not accumulate in the ﬂat desert unless some mere pebble tamarisk shrub ridge or stone is the primary cause of the accumulation in the present case i think the greater number of sand hills had been caused by tamarisk shrubs arresting the sand along its ﬂight southwards to enumerate and analyse each sand were thousands and take volumes i will limit myself to the various most characteristic types of which i give diagrams the absolutely conical type was here less noticeable being too much exposed to the wind which gradually corroded one side of each hill more than the other whatever their shape the highest point of the sand hills was in any case always to the the lower to the can be seen by the diagram there were single hills and composite ones there were hills hills and then came the sand dunes such those on the right of our track like long parallel walls of sand extending great distances from east to west view of s her i ustam from r ustam s h ouse west portion of city under the lee of wall one sand hill 80 feet high quite and with solitary tamarisk tree on its top rising some 40 feet above all the others was quite landmark along this route it marked point from which to the east of our track we found more uniformity in the shape of the sand mounds which were lower and all to the west of the track curiously enough there were hardly any sand hills at all this was due i think to the fact that tamarisk shrubs did not seem to ﬂourish on the latter side and therefore did not cause the sand to accumulate several miles further however at spot protected by high sand dunes tamarisk trees were found growing some being 4 to 6 feet high and seeming quite luxuriant after the usual desert shrubs which hardly ever rise above two to three feet sadek had purchased at warmal two big bottles of milk my use but we had found good water on the way and the heat of the sun was great he could not resist the temptation and had drunk it all when i claimed it he professed that my cats had stolen it long jolting ride on the jumbaz camel produced the marvellous result that although the cats had drunk the milk sadek himself was attacked by indigestion caused by it he seemed to suffer internal agony and lay on his camel hump doubled up with pain he felt so very ill that he requested to take him on my camel and to let him exchange places with my driver to my sorrow i consented in moment of temporary relief from the aching of his digestive organs he entered into one of his favourite geographical discussions having the twentieth time eradicated from his brain the notion that london and russia were not suburbs of bombay he now wanted to know whether dunia by which gloriﬁed name the persians call the united states of america were inside the walls of london city or outside he had an idea that the earth was ﬂat and that london bombay and russia were together on the extreme edge of it the stars he believed to be lighted up nightly one woul d candles or parafﬁn lamps fortunately while explaining to his extraordinary theory of how it was that the moon never appeared alike on two successive nights he was again seized with another fearful attack and tumbled of f the camel sadek was most unfortunate with animals he was hated by them all when he went near horses they would kick buck and neigh if wolf had been at hand mules stampeded at his sight cats bolted if he were about to beat them and camels were restless and made most fearful noises of disapproval and distress at his approach when he tried to get on and off the kneeling camel would suddenly spring up again causing him to fall and when he did get on the saddle the vicious brutes would assume most unusual and uncomfortable jerky motion which bumped him to such an extent that he could not stand it long and had to get off the animals evidently did it purposely to get rid of him when i got on any of them they went beautifully hence whenever sadek wished to ride comfortably he always requested to change seats with my driver who occupied the front seat on the hump of my the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https of s her i ustam from r ustam s h ouse section of city we had glorious sunset on that even ing not unlike an aurora borealis in brilliant rays of light radiating from central point the sun had already disappeared behind the blue mountain chain and each bright vermilion ray had like ﬁsh bone or like peacock feather myriads of cross in the shape of lighter sprays of light there was brilliant yellow glow which tinted the blue sky and made it appear of various gradations from bright yellow at the lower portion to various delicate shades of green in the centre blending again into pure deep cobalt blue high up in the sky and on this glorious background the feathery vermilion sprays shot up to half way across the celestial vault other smaller sprays of vivid yellow light ﬂared up in crescent nearer the mountain edge it was quite glorious sight unimpeded by the grand spread of sand in the foreg round and patch or two of humble tamarisks the rapidity with which night descends upon the desert is we noticed several times quite amazing there was hardly any twilight at all in few seconds this beautiful spectacle vanished by enchantment and was converted into most mournful sight the vermilion feathery sprays now deprived of the sun light upon them were converted into so many gigantic black rather funereal the emerald green sky became of dead leaden white the deep blue fringed with red and yellow of the radiant mountains had now turned into sombre grey about four miles before reaching girdi track branches off which avoids that place altogether and rejoins the track again one mile south of girdi thus saving considerable detour our march that day had been from warmal to mahommed altitude feet eight miles and from that place to miles the track between the two latter stations was perfectly level and on jumbaz camels going at good pace the journey had occupied eight hours and half on arriving at girdi altitude feet the beluch sawar whom i had taken guide from mahommed raza chah and my beluch driver had most touching scene on meeting some beluch of caravan travelling in the opposite direction to mine and camping at girdi the night the men hastily dismounted from their camels put their heads together and pressed each the other right hand holding it on the heart it is my brother cried my camel man and then followed another outburst of effusion on the brother part who seized my hand in both his and shook it heartily considerable time the others followed suit there is nothing that an afghan or beluch likes better than good hearty chapter xxvii desolate renowned and persian customs and its salt river colours in salt loftiest mountain picturesquely situated post natural pyramid of three coveted countries evolution of sand sand the most british post girdi chah altitude feet desolate spot in desolate region remains impressed in the minds of visitors merely and only the vileness of its water sadek brought glass of it inspection and it was so thick with salt and dirt that it resembled in colour and density mixture of milk and coffee in ﬂavour i not know what it was like because i would not drink it but i induced sadek to try it and let know and he said that it tasted like salt sand and bad eggs mixed together unluckily sadek had omitted to ﬁll the skins with good water at warmal and after our long march of 36 miles we should have been in bad plight had not the beluch men in charge of the other caravan offered us some good water from their supply to drink and cook with the post station at girdi has high wall round it with two rooms sawars and one adjoining their families and grain shop there are four watch towers at the corners of the wall of bricks and path on the top to go from one tower to the other canal has been cut to drain much rain water the only water obtainable here possible into small pond but the pond was nearly dry and only had in it some ﬁlthy salt water densely mixed with camel refuse it was of ghastly green with patches of brown and some spots of putrefaction in circular crowns of whitish colour the surface was coated with deposit of sand dirt and salt few yards from the british consular stood small hut in which two persian customs soldiers were stationed they were picturesquely attired in peaked white turbans long yellow the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https belts with powder and bullet pouches and various other adjuncts they were armed with long matchlocks these men and the postal sawars complained of the terrible wonder although they seemed painfully worn and thin it had not actually caused them any special illness so far they generally laid in small supply of better water from the well six miles of on our way in that direction when we left the next morning we again saw in the distance to the east and four or ﬁve ruined cities tamarisk was plentiful and grew to quite good height we passed the of nawar with its well of fairly good water the well was some three feet in diameter and water had been struck ﬁfteen feet below the surface the shelter with low mud enclosure round it was very similar to the one at mahommed at each one was generally greeted by beluch cat with pointed ears who came out in the hopes of getting meal then by picturesque beluch sawars with luxuriant black hair and beard and white turbans and cloaks this being minor station there were only two sawars and animals whereas at stations like girdi there were duffadar in charge four sawars two attendants two camels and two horses some three miles of nawar more ruins could be seen small tower and three large square towers with north and south walls in great part blown down but with eastern and western walls standing up to great height separate domed building could also be observed little way of perhaps one of the most interesting natural sights on the journey to the beluchistan frontier was the great salt we struck on that march six miles from nawar it was by far the largest river i had seen in persia its channel being some 100 yards wide in places it came from the mountains to the where thick salt deposits are said to exist and at the point where we crossed it its course was tortuous and the river made sharp detour to the all along the watercourse extensive sediments of salt lined the edge of the water and higher up near the mountains the water is said to be actually bridged over by salt deposits several inches thick most interesting incrustations of salt were visible under the water especiall y at the side of the stream where with the reverberation of the sun rays most beautiful effects of colour were obtained in the salt crystals the following were the colours they appeared from the edges of the stream downwards brown light green emerald green dark green yellow warm yellow deep yellow then the deep green of the limpid water the river banks on which we travelled were about 60 feet high above the actua l stream and owing to huge diagonal crack across our track we had to deviate nearly half mile in order to ﬁnd way where my camels could get across the shela proceeds along tortuous channel in direction enters afghan territory and loses itself we shall see in the afghan desert it is said that when which is now but rarely the is inundated the overﬂow of water from the lake so formed ﬁnds its way by natural channel into the shela which it swells and the joint waters ﬂow far and ﬁll the shela hamun or zirreh in afghanistan which is at lower level than the when i saw the lake in afghanistan however it was absolutely dry the shela river had very large pools of deep water almost all along that part of it which is in sistan territory but there was hardly any water ﬂowing at all so that nowadays in dry weather it loses itself in the sand long before reaching the depression in afghan territory where by the great salt deposits it is evident that lake may have formerly existed but not now after leaving the shela we were travelling again on the sandy lut and not blade of vegetation of any kind could be seen we came to two tracks one going the other due south we followed the latter we got some miles further south region of tamarisks began and they got bigger and bigger we went along where some shelter existed from the north winds the shrubs had developed into quite big trees some measuring much 20 feet in height desert this seemed to us quite forest near the well of salt water half way 12 miles between the two postal stations the tamarisks were quite thick sixteen miles from nawar however some great sand dunes like waves of sea extending from east to west were again found together with undulations of sand and gravel and here tamarisks again became scarce the track had been marked with cairns of stones at the sides where the wind had full sway the long sand banks parallel to one another and very regular in their formation appeared exactly like the waves of stormy ocean the track went towards the where one has to get round the point of afghanistan which projects west far the mountains we were steering into what appeared at ﬁrst double row of mountains in mountain mass generally called the to the west however on getting nearer we could count many four different ranges and two more to the east of us the last range beyond all of the four western ones had in its some very high peaks which i should roughly estimate at about eight to ten thousand feet above the plain due west there were also some high points rising approximately from six to seven thousand feet and in front of these and nearest to the observer low hill range high range like whale back and not above feet above the plain had conical hill on the highest part of its summit the loftiest mountains were observed from south to and they too had low hill barrier before them many of the peaks were very sharply pointed and highest of all stood strange looking mountain with deep cut on its westerly side and pointed peak standing by it the sand under foot had given place here to gravel and large pebbles yellow red grey white and green all well rounded if they had been rolled by water many mile the underlying sand was cut into many channels by the action of water we were some four miles off the mountainous mass tamarisk was scarce and undersized we were gradually rising on slightly inclined plain and on examining the ground one could not help thinking with what terriﬁc force the torrents must come they come from the mountain sides which they drain before losing themselves in the sand during abnormally rainy weather doubt good deal of this drainage forms an actual stream which goes to swell the river shela its channel comes from hormak and ﬂows ﬁrst in then in an almost due easterly the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https had intended stopping at hormak miles from girdi our previou s halting place and we had been on the saddle from 9 in the morning till when we came across lot of afghans with their camels and they told us that we were on the wrong track the and well it was very dark and we could not see where we were going the sand had covered up the track we were among lot of confused sand hills and the high mountains stood directly in front like formidable black barrier their contour line just distinguishable against the sky the camel driver who had made dischar ge the postal sawar guide because he was certain he knew the road well himself was now at loss the afghans collected round us and yelled at the top of their voices that hormak was to the west of us and the camel man insisted that the post house must surely be on the high track on which we certainly seemed to have got again i had ridden ahead and after an anxious hour sadek with all the luggage and the second camel man arrived and we decided to leave the track and try our luck among the mountains to the west now to ﬁnd little mud house hidden in some sheltered spot among rocks and hills on dark night is not the easiest of matters the camels stumbled among the big boulders when once we had got off the track and we had to dismount and walk luck would have it after going about half an hour we came to nice spring of water of which in the stillness of the night we could plainly hear the gurgling guided by it and few feet above it in sheltered position we struck the the has of course been built here one mile away from the high track because of this spring there is direct track to it which branches off the main track about 3 miles north but we had missed this the night was very cold were at feet above sea we lighted big ﬁre in the middle of the small mud room there was outlet the smoke except the door in few minutes the place got unbearably hot and i had to clear out but sadek and my camel men who were regular salamanders seemed to enjoy it and found it quite comfortable there were two rooms one occupied by the four postal sawars the other by ﬁve persian customs employees the two camels and two horses the postal service were kept in the mud walled enclosure hormak when the sun rose proved to be one of the most picturesquely situated stations on the entire route between and nushki it stood on hill of sand and gravel in the centre of basin of high mountains which screened it all round there was an opening to the east which gave glimpse of the desert extending into afghanistan this station being not far from the border our track was to the and wound round between handsome mountains strange high pyramid of rock stood on our way and the sides of the mountains where cut by the water showed the interesting process of petriﬁcation in its various stages in the strata of the mountains in hills of conical formation the centre was the ﬁrst to become solidiﬁed and where subsequent rain storms had washed away the coating around that had not yet become petriﬁed curious rocky pillars were left standing bare on the landscape we altered our course to due south along river bed and had high sand hills to our right now that we were approaching beluchistan the track was well deﬁned and about 16 feet broad with sides marked by row of stones to the west of the track were series of high sand walls facing west 300 feet high and some most peculiar red pointed conical hills rose above them on the east side of these walls it was after reaching these peculiarly coloured hills that the track began gradual descent the highest point on the track was feet we passed strange mount shaped like mushroom and the same formation could be noticed on smaller scale in many other smaller hills the lower portion of which had been corroded by wind or water or both until the petriﬁed centre of the hill remained like stem support ing rounded cap of earth above it from the west there descended another water channel quite dry we next found ourselves in large basin one mile across and with an outlet to the at which spot square mountain stared us in the face similar fortress also of natural formation was to the west and between these two the robat track was traced another outlet existed to the to the west north east and there were great many and to the high rugged mountains strong gale was blowing and the sky was black and leaden with heavy clouds we were caught in several heavy showers we proceeded along broad ﬂat valley amid high and much black mountains the innumerable sharp pointed peaks of which resembled the teeth of saw at their foot between them and our track stretched long screen of sand this case facing instead of west the alteration in the direction being undoubtedly due to the ef fect of the mountains on the direction of the wind to the east there were rocks of bright cadmium yellow colour some 45 feet high with deposits of sand and gravel on them thick again 45 feet the mountains behind these rocks showed similar formation the yellow rock however rising to 120 feet with rock above it of colour getting greenish towards the top where more exposed to the wind the valley along which we were travelling averaged about 200 yards wide from the sand hills on one side to those on the other and was at an incline the eastern portion being much lower than the western the yellow rocks at the side bore marks of having been subjected to the corrosive action of water which must occasionally ﬁll this gully to great height during torrential rains we came to most interesting malek siah ziarat which in theory marks the point where the three coveted countries persia afghanistan and beluchistan meet the actual frontier however is on the summit of the watershed short distance to the east of the ziarat this ziarat was ﬁne one of the beluch pattern not covered over by building such those instance that we had found on there seemed to be fate against photographing these ziarats it was only under the greatest disadvantages that i was ever able to photograph them on this particular occasion i had hardly time to produce my camera before downpour such i had seldom experienced made it impossible to take decent picture of the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https was central tomb 15 feet long of big round white stones supported on upright pillars of brown and green stone and white marble pillar at each end circular white marble slabs were resting on the tomb itself and few feet from this tomb all round was wall 3 feet high of upright pillars of brown and green stone forming an oblong that measured 20 feet by 8 feet with walled entrance at its extremity an additional wall like crescent protected the end of the oblong and due east in line were three stone cairns with bundles of upright sticks ﬁxed into them on which hung rags of all colours plan of siah ziarat to the west of the tomb between it and the enclosing wall was great collection of long sticks and tree must have been brought here from great at

deposit some very quaint little dolls made with much symbolic anatomical detail extending west in the direction of mecca from the main ziarat were nine more stone cairns most of them having panache of sticks and being divided into sets of three each with higher wall in the shape of crescents between second wall of round stones protected the side of the ziarat where it met the entrance way into the inner wall there was much used sacriﬁcial slab where sheep were beheaded to the of the ziarat were number of cairns and small stone shelter in which lived hermit this old fanatic came out to greet us with unintelligible howls carrying his vessel alms and long stick to which rag was attached he touched us all on the head with it which was meant blessing and we gave him some silver pieces which he said he did not want himself but the ziarat he wore chains like prisoner he appeared to be in an advanced stage of idiocy and abrutissement caused by his lonely life in his 5 feet cubic stone cabin among the desolate siah mountains having at this place rounded the most westerly point of the afghan frontier we turned due east on tortuous but well deﬁned track at this point began the actual british road and being from this point under british supervision it was well kept and made extremely easy camel and horse trafﬁc three miles from the ziarat the sand hills began to get smaller and smaller to the west but still remained high to the east one was particularly struck by the peculiar formation of the mountains to the west they formed continuous rugged irregularly topped chain with sharp pointed peaks whereas to the east we had isolated single domed hills all well rounded and smooth where the track turns sharply we entered vast basin with picturesque high mountains to the south and north and series of single mounds in front of them rising from one to two thousand feet above the plain on nearing robat one ﬁnds the scenery plainly illustrating the entire evolution of small sand hill into high mountain we have the tiny mounds of sand only few inches high clogged round tamarisk shrubs then further higher and higher mounds until they spread out so far that two three or more blend together forming low bank and then banks increase to high dunes 40 feet 50 feet 100 feet high these grow higher and higher still the sand below is compressed by the weight above water exercises its petrifying inﬂuence from the base upward and from the centre outward and more sand accumulates on the upper surface until they become actual hill ranges of compact formation in horizontal strata each stratum being slightly less hardened than the underlying and each showing plainly deﬁned the actions of water and sun to which they were exposed when uppermost then above these hills further accumulations have formed which solidifying in turn have in the course of centuries become high mountains they have however never lost the characteristics of the little primary accumulation against the humble tamarisk to which they still bear on lar ge scale the closest resemblance we passed great many parallel sand dunes 100 feet high east and west of our track and went through cut in one of these sand banks beyond which the sand hills had accumulated in somewhat confused fashion upon area they seemed of more ancient formation than those to the west of the track and had great quantity of shingle upon them which gave them black and greenish appearance while those to the west were of light brown colour the shingle in this case i think had not formed on the hillocks themselves but had been washed and blown down from the high mountains to the east we were now in the territory of beluchistan and with bounding the experience of persian saw nice clean square whitewashed bungalow standing on high prominence under the shelter of rugged mountain this was robat the furthermost british post in west beluchistan although still some 463 miles from the nearest railway i looked upon this spot the end of my difﬁcult travelling and taking into consideration the fact that most of that distance had to be performed across barren and practically uninhabited country i found that i was not far wrong in my opinion chapter xxviii the lahr thana and and beluch music songs and musical melodies love and war and beluch chap the project gutenberg ebook of across

robat of eight rooms and spacious court horses shop with grain and provisions is found here and post ofﬁce with the familiar black board outside on which one was rather amused to read the usual postal notices in the english language stuck upon queen victoria death notifying that the ofﬁce would be closed on such and such bank holidays and other public news the quarters of the jemadar and his seven levies of the duffadar and the postmaster were enclosed in the thana with its imposing entrance gate and four towers at the corners beyond the thana was the old resting place built of stone with six rooms but now rather in condition then last but not least of the buildings was the new bungalow with nice portico all round it contained four spacious lofty rooms with chimneys there were windows but not yet with glass in them and this was rather an advantage because the air of the mountains was pure and better than would have been the atmosphere of room each room had bathroom attached to of course the bath had to be brought by the traveller himself saïd k han d uffadar and l evies at the p erso eluch f rontier p ort of r oba t this was one of two types of which are being built by the british government travellers on the route the other kind was of similar architecture but with only two rooms instead of four these bungalow s were solidly built well ventilated and excellent in every course in relation to the country they were in it was not proposed when they were put up to compete in comfort and cuisine with the carlton hotel in london that of ritz in paris or the of new york they were mere traders and travellers accustomed to that particular kind of travelling and the british government ought to be greatly thanked building these shelters at the principal on the route only few are completed yet between robat and nushki but their construction is going ahead fast and within the next year or so if i understood right they would all be ready to accommodate travellers they were great improvement on the old thanas which although comfortable enough were not always quite so clean on account of natives using them after travelling in persia where one climbs down good deal in one ideas of luxury and comfort and is glad to put up even in the most modest hovels it seemed to quite the zenith of luxury and comfort to set foot inside real whitewa shed with mats on the ﬂoor and ﬁre blazing in real chimney news had come that i should arrive that afternoon and the levies with the jemadar in their best clothes all turned out to receive which involved considerable and elaborate compliments after which i was led into the room that had been prepared saïd khan who has been employed by the government to look after the postal arrangements and other political work on the persian side of the frontier was also here parading with the others can be seen in the illustration saïd khan was tall intelligent fearless person wearing handsome black coat mass of gold embroidery on the chest and beautiful silver by the way he wore in sensible fashion slung across his shoulder with his features strong almost ﬁerce mouth ﬁnely chiselled nostrils and eagle eyes he was quite striking ﬁgure the duffadar who stood on his right hand had most honest and face and he too looked very smart in his uniform cartridge bandolier silver sword and enﬁeld riﬂe his men were also armed with this riﬂe which although of old pattern is very serviceable with the exception of saïd khan the people represented in the illustration formed the entire stationary male population of robat but some small black tents could be seen in gully little way off inhabited by nomad beluch on hearing that i was much interested in music the duffadar who was bit of musician himself arranged concert in which all the local talent took part on this and many other later occasions i heard beluch music and singing and saw their dancing and i also heard good deal of persian music while in persia i daresay few words upon the music and dancing of the two countries will not be out of place in many ways they are akin large instrument called the dumbirah or dambura like an italian produced which was handsomely carved and inlaid in silver it had three strings two of which were played bass on the third the air was twanged in double notes the thumb and ﬁrst ﬁnger are held together the ﬁrst ﬁnger slightly forward and an oscillation is given from the wrist to the hand in order to sound the note twice it catches ﬁrst in the thumb then in the ﬁrst ﬁnger the effect obtained is similar to that of the occalilli of honolulu or not unlike mandoline only with the beluch instrument the oscillations are slower the movement of the favourite beluch melodies resembles that of neapolitan tarantella and these airs are generally more lively than melodies of most other asiatic people endless variations are made on the same air according to the ability and temperament of the musician the notes of the two bass strings of the instrument are never altered but always give the same accompaniment on being twanged together with the violin string on which only the actual melody is picked the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https is then the soroz kind of violin made of half pumpkin which forms the sounding board and handle to it with four keys and four strings it is played with bow of horsehair the other instruments in use are the seranghi kind of superior violin such the two central ones represented in the full page illustration it has less than fourteen keys is hollow and uncovered in its upper portion but has skin stretched in the lower half of its sounding case it is also perforated underneath and is played with bow called gazer the rabab is larger wooden instrument of somewhat elongated shape and its lower portion is also covered by tight remainder of the uncovered wood being prettily inlaid with silver and bone this instrument is twanged with the ﬁngers and has eighteen killi or keys twelve with metal strings and six with gut strings the surna or ﬂute is made of bamboo with brass funnel the mouthpiece is very ingenious made of crushed cane fastened into cup which is ﬁrmly applied to the lips thus preventing any wind escaping at the sides it certainly gives very piercing sound when played loud the dohl or drum was also of wood with sheepskins drawn tight at the two ends while wet rolled up all round the rims of the apertures and kept in position by leather strips beluch m usicians at s ibi besides these the beluch shows much ingenuity in improvising musical instruments to accompany his songs out of any article which will give some sound such his riﬂe rod which he balances on bit of string and taps upon with the blade of his knife or two pieces of wood which he uses castanets and failing all these snapping his ﬁngers and keeping time with the melody there is certain weird barbaric charm in beluch melodies and unlike the persian the beluch possesses very keen ear in fact thorough musical ear even according to our rules of harmony to an unthoughtful european there may indeed be certain monotony in beluch melodies but never grating discord which will set one teeth on edge monotony in music or rather repetition of the same melody until it becomes monotonous is rather than one comes to think of fault on the right side if melody is repeated time after time it means that the people themselves like it and appre ciate it there is doubt that anybody with an unspoilt musical ear rather fancies listening over and over again to melody which appeals to we need not go far beluchistan to be convinced of we ourselves have been known to take fancies to songs of so high standard the honeysuckle and the bee and we hum them while soaking in our morning tub we whistle them we go down to breakfast we strum them on the piano after breakfast we hear them rattled outside by barrel organ many times there are forthcoming pennies from windows while we are having lunch we hear them pathetically sung at afternoon parties by hired entertainers bands play them in the restaurants during dinner and we hear them in the theatres in music halls and everywhere that we can not very well blame others the monotony of their melodies since we lar gely follow the same course theirs the beluch plays and sings because it gives him real pleasure and he is quite carried away by his music certain notes and combinations of notes especially such are very high and shrill but in good tune seem to go straight to his heart and he revels in them when singing therefore he prefers to sing in high the furthest strain of his voice having worked himself into state gradual ly descends to low deep notes which by contrast appeal to him and not only give balance and character to his melody but produce quite good harmonious effect the low notes however are never ejaculated but hummed almost buzzed with vibration in the voice which is most melodious the sound is like an indeﬁnite letter the beginning of song is somewhat sudden and startling and usually too loud if the singer had not properly gauged the extent of his voice in relation to the instrumental accompaniment but he soon manages to get in most perfect unison with the melody of the dambura and the violin or other instruments except in cases of singers endowed with extra musical genius when they will go on improvising by the hour using the theme guide they generally sing in minor key with pretty refrains at the end of each bar the most common and favourite air is the above on which elaborate variations are added the beluch singer seldom changes from minor into major or from one key into another but he is very fond of repeating the same melody in all the octaves within the utmost limits of the compass of his voice it is considered feat in singing to hold note an interminable time also to go through the greater portion of the melody without taking breath and it really seemed extraordinary that some of the singers did not break blood vessel in the process the eyes of the performers got so swollen and almost shooting out of the head with holding the notes so long and the veins of the temples and arteries in the neck swelled to such an extent to cause serious the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https one occasion i heard an improvised song with the accompaniment of the soroz violin only this exception in my song was given in deep low nasal voice each note being tremulous and held on several minutes in most plaintive manner some of the love songs were quite pathetic and touching and in the war songs the grievances were poured forth very plaintively with an accompaniment of strings and drums and burst out suddenly into ﬁre and anger at this point when the musicians were carried away by the martial words of the song the instrumental accompaniment became next to diabolical it was very inspiriting doubt and made them feel very the din was certainly such might have turned any man into ﬁghter love songs in which the singer imitated women voices to perfection were really most graceful and sad and quite interesting were the musical recitatives with violin accompaniments which the beluch render in quite masterly way then there was the comic and full of too full and too comic to appeal to european and so fully illustrated that personally i inﬁnitely preferred the more melancholic ones which had more music in them duets and trios were occasionally attempted with quite good results except that there always seemed to be competition to who should start highest and this had occasionally grating ef fect the beluch possess most soft musical voices and graceful quite contrast even in mere conversation to those of their neighbours the persians or the afghans but the character of the beluch songs and music is not dissimilar from the persian and both betray markedly arab origin in persian songs too an andante movement with chorus joining in every few bars frequently occurs but in the persian chorus we generally ﬁnd liking chromatic diminuendos and crescendos which are not so frequent in beluch music persian music is inspiriting there are certain musical notes the vibrations of which seem to go to the heart more than others and on these notes the persian musician will work his melody sad love songs in falsetto voice are prevalent and are sung so high that with the beluch it makes one really quite anxious the safety of the singer the notes are kept on so long and the melody repeated so often that the artery and veins in the singer neck and temples bulge out in most abnormal manner there is actual end to persian melody which terminates with the exhaustion of the singer or abruptly by the sign of the hearers who get tired of it the musicians every now and then join in the chorus and repeat the refrain tenor solo songs by boys are much appreciated and these too are very plaintive with frequent scales in them and certain notes held long at the end of each bar where the chorus join in these sustained notes have modulations in them with inﬁnitesimal fractions of tones ululations with long nasal interminable notes and capricious variations at the fancy of the singer but based on some popular theme are also much liked by persians more than in anything else however the persian like the beluch delights in tremulous notes of which he makes ample use in his melodies the rhythm of persian and beluch music is much alike although far instrumental execution goes the persian surpasses the beluch having greater variety in his orchestra and the instruments being more perfectly constructed the santurie instance kind of zither with eighteen sets of three strings each is most harmonious instrument from which beautiful ef fects can be obtained by the player the thar sort of guitar has four keys and is played with plectrum and the kermanche cynthour tchogor the tchaminioho latter circular instrument covered by skin with one metal and two gut strings on long metal stand is played with bow dumbuk drum with only one skin pasted round its single aperture the lower part being solid the ﬂute pure and proper with ﬁve apertures on one side and one on the other on which very low clear notes are obtained and pretty tremolo other instruments of minor importance are all employed in persia the persians are masters at playing the drum most marvellous effects are obtained by them they hold the drum on the left leg with the left arm resting on it and tap it with the tips of their ﬁngers round its edge broader notes it is struck with the palm of the hand soft gentle notes well the rumbling sound in good time with the air they accompany are extracted from the instrument so fast in its vibrations to produce continuous sound that one would never believe came from drum beluch d ance at s ibi metallic castanets are used both by the persian and beluch in the dancing and it is usually the or more play the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https of the songs and melodies i heard in persia reminded very forcibly of spanish melodies which like these are undoubtedly of arab origin whatever fault one may ﬁnd with persian or beluch music one can not say that the performers not play with an immense deal of feeling and entrain quality the primary one to my mind in music often lacking in musicians nearer home but never in orientals the dancing both persian and beluch is not so interesting it is usually executed by effeminate boys generally dressed in long pleated coat with tight belt and wearing number of metal bells attached to the ankles the persian is probably the more lascivious of the two in his movements and having begun by throwing his long shock of hair backwards twirls round gracefully enough keeping good time with the music this is merely feat of endurance resembling the dancing or spinning dervishes of egypt and generally ends by the dancer suddenly squatting down upon the ﬂoor with his ﬂowing gown fully expanded in circle around him the skill of the dancer is shown most in successive dances such the slow progression by merely twisting the feet to right and left occasionally varied by raising one foot directly above the other then throwing the head far back and the body in strained curve with arms raised ﬂuttering like ﬂying bird while the song to which he dances imitates nightingale contortions and suggestive waist movements are much indulged in persian dancing well throwing the body backwards with the hands almost touching the ground behin d and walking while in this unlike an exaggerated form of the of our american cousins each dance is closed by the dancer throwing himself down upon his knees in front of the musicians or in turn before each of the spectators beluch dancing was very similar although much simpler the two photographs reproduced in the illustrations which i took at sibi show one row of beluch musicians the other beluch boy in the act of dancing sort of dance in which with extended arms he gradually ﬂuttered round keeping time with the music in some of the quicker movements he either snapped his ﬁngers or used wooden castanets or held the pleated skirt of his coat fully extended like butterﬂy wings there was very little variation to his dancing which like the persian was more feat of endurance and speed than graceful performance the ankle did most of the work the b eluch fghan b oundar y c airn and m alek iah m ount ains in b ackground somewhat more wild and primitive was the chap which i witnessed at camp in beluchistan it consisted in swinging the body from right to left lifting up now one leg and then the other and waving the head to and fro in most violent manner the beluch get much excited over this dance which requires some degree of stubborn tenacity and the spectators urge the dancer to continue when he shows signs of getting tired all superﬂuous clothing is discarded in most alarming manner at various stages of this performance and the arms are ﬂapped vigorously against the naked body which is made to sound like drum the performance is not allowed to stop until the dancer is quite exhausted when he simply collapses in the arms of one of his friends the musical accompaniment to this dance verges on the diabolical the rhythm of what melody there is being interspersed with abundant howls yells and snapping of ﬁngers from the enthusiastic crowd all round chapter xxix an excellent quaint

straight line with neat stone borders on either side and one got so tired of seeing that line in front of one nose that one welcomed the smallest change slight ascent or its endless monotonous straightness we came by and by to little steep enough camels we could have easily avoided it by leaving the road and making detour at the foot of the hill close to the afghan boundary some caravans from the highest point of the road we looked back to the we saw behind us sand hills that showed traces of being still much at the mercy of the wind furthe r behind still was high pointed peak and

ancient fortress nor could i get any information on the subje ct from the natives and it was too far out of my track to go and visit it on our descent on the side of the hill we came across sand mounds in great numbers the mountains on our right were apparently of volcanic formation they were very highly coloured generally bright red with green summits then there were mountains deep red all over and further on stood one green from top to bottom although there was not thread of vegetation upon it at the foot of the mountains on the edge of the desert were few dried up tamarisks we stopped

of the tents seemed to be mass of rags and dirt among which some primitive implements such wooden pestle and mortar pounding wheat and bowl or two could be detected otherwise they were most miserable the tents seemed mostly in the possession of women children and decrepit old men the younger folks seeking livelier life further aﬁeld it is often in the most humble places however that one ﬁnds unexpected charms on the alarm being given that an intruding stranger was at hand the women hastily shut up all the tents and picturesque old fellow stalked about seeming to become extremely anxious when i was photographing proceeding which he did not quite understand young man on camel was coming towards us singing and inside one of the tents i heard great commotion evidently caused by the approaching voice an old woman in fact peeped out from ﬁssure and gave powerful squeak she leapt out excitedly nearly tearing down the whole tent in the process and crying bitter tears rushed with extended arms towards the camel man the young fellow having hastily dismo unted most touching scene of motherly affection ensued the old man explained to he was her son the poor shrivelled creature threw her arms around his neck and kissed him fondly ﬁrst on one cheek and then upon the other after which having affectionately taken his face betw een her hands she impressed another long long kiss in the middle of his forehead she caressed him to her heart content the boy looking quite pathetically graceful and reverent under the circumstances similar treatment was meted out to him by his sisters and they all shed tears of delight at seeing one another family affection well affection among tribesmen is indeed extraordinarily ef fusive and genuine among beluch of all classes the women i

plateau of mile wide and mile and half long ten peaks could be counted to the high mountains were before us to the and long range beyond them sand dunes shaped like the back of whale were to the east and remarkable spherical mount directly in front of the ten peaks we arrived at saindak chapter xxx an excursion into salt deposits of curious formation of hill and how they are march through the water of godar and their looks the excursion which i made into afghan territory to the salt deposit of or and lower depression to the east of it was of great interest to there are great many theories regarding these former salt lakes and it is not easy to say which is right and which is wrong the general belief is that these lakes were formed by the overﬂow of the halmund swamp into the shela river which carried sufﬁcient water not only to ﬁll up the zirreh but to overﬂow when this was full into the next depression east of the zirreh there is doubt that to great extent this was the case but these lakes were i think also fed more directly by several small streams descending from the mountains to the south and west of the zirreh which form the very probably also from the north by the halmund river itself both lakes were dry and seemed to have been so some time the forming now great expanse of solid salt some 26 miles long by 5 or 6 wide extends in long oval from west to east the other lake was somewhat smaller to the south of these salt deposits in the zones between them and the present afghan boundary and forming the southern fringe of the afghan desert the soil is covered with gravel and stones washed down from the mountain sides very stony indeed is the desert towards the end then further appear brown earth shale and sand to the north of the lakes was long line of bright yellow sand extending from west to east and broad enough towards the north to reach the bank of the river halmund another shiny patch which at ﬁrst from distance i had mistaken another smaller lake turned out on examination to be stretch of polished shale which shone in the sun and appeared like bluish water stunted tamarisk grows in some parts but not in the immediate neighbourhood of the salt deposits we have here instead belt of myriads of small conical also spreading from west to east quite low to the west and getting higher several miles towards the east in the part of the desert curiously enough between the zone of conical hills and the salt deposits and parallel to both lies row of sand and salt mounds of whitish colour to the of the lakes the rise to great height and eventually form high ridge which some reason or other is cut perpendicularly on its western side possibly the result of volcanic commotion of similar origin probably was the gigantic crack caused by an earthquake which we shall examine later on near nushki in fact both the crack at nushki and the collapse of the west side of this hill range well great portion of that deep crack in the earth crest in which the shela ﬂows have very likely been formed by the same cause they are within the same zone of volcanic formation in the particular case of this hill range in afghanistan the collapse did not appear to to be due to the action of water but to sudden crumbling which had caused very sharp vertical cut sand h ills to the north of the salt wastes was another long belt of yellow sand extending some 40 miles upon which there was absolutely vegetation while intervening between the salt and this sand ﬂat were numerous sand barchans like horseshoes with gradual slope on the windward side north and crescent hollow with steep but not quite vertical bank on the lee the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https noticed all over persia and in beluchistan well here that these sand barchans or barchanes will only form on level on extensive plains all single sand hills however whether barchans conical al or of more irregular shapes are invariably caused by primary obstacle however small arresting the sand various are the theories with regard to the formation of these barchans and especially with regard to the formation of the hollow on the lee side the explanation from my own observation least the merit of simplicity the wind on meeting the back of the barchan is diverted on the two sides of it these two currents come into violent collision again on the where the air being more or less still considerable portion of the wind is forcibly driven back towards the barchan corroding its side in double rotatory way each such circle having diameter the radius of the barchan crescent containing them in fact in many barchans the sand ripples on the windward slopes cross the direction of the wind at right angles line of sand formed in the centre of the barchan crescent in the opposite direction to the wind is often to be seen during wind storms or soon after i have also seen barchans the inner crescent of which showed beyond doubt that when there is prevalent wind from one side only the above explanation although less scientiﬁcally obscure and elaborate than most applies and i think it may eventually be found quite the most probable the diagram here given will illustrate and i hope make quite clear the meaning of my words in the centre of the crescent can be noticed the action of the parting wind currents c ara van of d onkeys in fghanist an north of kirtaka was very pointed high conical hill and not far from it small replica of fujisan in japan so much were the lines like those of the japanese mountain great many of the drain channels from the mountains to the south extended very far into the desert and some far the it is also very probable that in the days when sistan was most populous region with uninterrupted towns and villages along and near the halmund numerous canals may have intersected the zirreh region and rendered it very fertile plain history would indeed point forcibly towards such hypothesis ample proof that the

at gumbaz it would be most interesting if one could get at the actual history of this part of the world and gain an insight into its former prosperity and civilisation it is quite probable that alexander in his progress through beluchistan and sistan must have come through this country even with new craterus at its of course march elephants camels and horses through that country and this has led some critics to doubt that alexander could have done so or to believe that if he did so he must have been deceived by his guides who tried to bring him far possible from water but those critics forget that in alexander days this portion of country was extremely civilised fertile and supplied with plent y of else how can we account the innumerable ruins we ﬁnd there and the many canals irrigation sir charles mcgregor goldsmid bellew major macmahon napier and one or two others who have visited the country north of the zirreh can fully testify to the amazing remains of former prosperity in sistan and afghanistan sir charles mcgregor gives an amusing receipt those who wish to know what the water at godar is like without having the trouble of going there take the ﬁrst looking water you can ﬁnd mix salt with it until it tastes nasty it looks then impregnate it with gas from london street lamp and add little shake vigorously and it is ready use major mcmahon also

vegetation but most beautifully coloured stones could be found such red and brown jasper and agatescent quartz chalcedony white and brown limestone i was returning towards the beluchistan boundary among the sand hills i came upon about dozen afghans who looked suspiciously at i did at them at ﬁrst i thought they were soldiers and i did not much care to be caught by them and have my goods englishmen being allowed in their requested them to stop some way off and explain what they wanted while i was snapshotting them they had great big white ﬂuffy dog with them who seemed very anxious to have go at the sahib one man was asked to come forward alone which he did with his turban right over his eyes while the others formed line behind and appeared most puzzled to what was going to happen he said they were glad to see in their country and that they were good people and would not injure nor trouble in any way so i gave them small present which seemed to please them much and they became quite friendly they seemed to have some coarse humour about them and were rather boisterous their faces however did not quite appeal to the afghan invariably has slippery treacherous look about his countenance which he can not disguise and which personally i not much admire he seldom looks at one straight in the face can be very sullen when he is not boisterous and i should think would easily seek cause of offence and pick quarrel with any one weaker than himself in order to have ﬁght these fellows were instance most unlike the gentlemanly beluch they shouted at the top of their voices when they spoke and were uncouth in speech and manner i was rather glad when they departed further on i came upon more people and animals but they too were quite peaceful having accomplished my object

see these poor devils stumbling along with the iron rings round their bruised and sore ankles showing through the torn rags which covered their skeleton legs and the agonized expressions on their worn repulsively cruel faces was not an edifying sight they had been broug ht down here to work and prisoners were treated considerately enough i suppose but they seemed very ill and suffering two were robbers the other and murdered man and stolen 400 sheep they were condemned to captivity life i declined to put up in that room especially when i happened to peep in and was nearly choked by the foul odour that emanated from inside and it was very inhabit the unroofed new bungalow in course of construction which i found really very comfortable can be seen by the photograph the thana and bungalow of saindak are built on rather an attractive site under the shelter of the saindak mountain whenever i see mountain i can not resist the temptation to go up it and now after all the thousands of miles of ﬂat country i had traversed i felt this desire more strongly than ever the ascent of the mountain presented difﬁculty except that its rocky sides were somewhat steep i resolved to go up early the next morning before making start with my camels in the meantime during the evening i was instructed by mahommed hussein my camel man in the beluch fashion of making most ingenious device stone of moderate size say 4 inches in diameter and round can be found is made red hot on the ﬁre and upon it coating of water and deposited evenly so to make an envelope of paste one inch thick all over three

stones removed the bread is really most excellent and resembles biscuit beluch p risoners at s aindak at saindak altitude feet there are number of wells mostly very salt but one has quite fair water only slightly brackish the water however had peculiar taste of its own if it had gone through lead deposits and on mentioning this to some beluch they told that lead was in fact found on the mountains just above this camp having drunk two glasses of this water i was taken with bad internal pains but i must in fairness own that i not know whether to attribute this entirely to the water or to indiscreet consumption of an irresistible extra rich which the wonderful sadek now produced much to my surprise and delight from among my provisions travellers however would well to bring their own supply of water from kirtaka if they are coming from robat or from mukak if travelling from quetta the ascent to the summit of the saindak mountain well repays the traveller the exertion of getting there and that not only on account of its geological formation looking over the lower mountains one obtained magniﬁcent view of the afghan desert far the eye could see to the and while to the west lay mountain mass the mirjawa mountains and innumerable sand hills to the towered above everything the active volcano of with its crater it was smoking notwithstanding the ridiculous theory entertained by some that volcanoes can not exist so far south in the northern hemisphere we saw this volcano several days and it threw up considerable volumes of smoke at night it occasionally had quite glow above its crater the volcano i need not say is in persian territory and is some 60 miles distant the crow ﬂies from saindak although in the clear atmosphere it does not appear more than few miles off it is the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https impressive mountain parallel ridges of sand hills facing east were to be seen to the of the saindak mountain and then wide ﬂat plain beyond which four successive mountain ranges formed powerful barrier to the also were high mountains on the top of the mountain we came upon some of the holes that contain lead and surmah or substance much used by women in persia afghanistan beluchistan and india blackening the lashes and lower eyelids surmah was plentiful enough especially betw een two layers of perpendicular rock and also in surface pebbles when split open calcareous rock with galena was to be found besides fragments of calcite gypsum and slag it appeared that the natives must at some time have tried to exploit these mines in primitive manner there were many holes bored all over the top of the mountain and near them bits of coal embedded in slag these excavations were generally bored in mounds of yellow earth or rather the mounds were of that colour because of the earth which had been extracted from the borings the colour of the surrounding earth and rock being grey and black lead ﬁlaments in brittle layers were also noticeable mixed with the earth two inches below the ground one found on digging thick deposit of salt and gypsum my camels with loads had made an early start and on my returning to camp some three hours after their departure i proceeded to catch them up on my excellent mari there was very little of interest on the march we rose over gentle incline travelling due south upon undulating ground to an altitude of feet beyond which we descended into ﬂat basin with broad outlet to the and another by narrow deﬁle in the mountain range we then crossed broader plain about two miles broad with good grazing camels and here again being well out in the open we got magniﬁcent view of the daftan volcano in all its splendour we reached mukak feet in the afternoon the distance from saindak being 13 miles 880 yards and owing to my camels being tired and the small beady plant called regheth cherished by we halted the remainder of the day at this place we found the usual jemadar duffadar and four men and were cordially received by the palawan moonshee nice fellow who wore peaked turban of gigantic size and brown coat beautifully embroidered on the back and sleeves with silk the embroidery he informed took six years to was not fully completed on inquiring the cost of it he said that it would certainly fetch much 10 rupees 13s 4d when quite ﬁnished the pattern on it was most cleverly designed and produced graceful effect on the middle of the sleeves were number of superposed t made of ribbon bands and with delicate ornamentations round them such little squares with radiating threads frieze going all round the arm and parallel lines on the back was large triangle upside down the base at the neck and the point downwards joining at its lower end square the inside of which was most elaborately embroidered the palawan or strong man in charge of this station was man with romantic history of his own and perhaps the british government were very wise to employ him he is said to possess enormous muscular strength being able to perform such amazing feats reducing to dust between his ﬁrst ﬁnger and thumb silver rupee by merely rubbing it once or breaking any coin in two in his hands with the same ease that one would biscuit aïd mahommed that was his name was unfortunately absent on the day i passed through so i was not able to witness his marvellous strength or palming the accounts of his native admirers were not to be taken au pied la lettr mukak had six mud rooms three roofed over and the others unroofed water was plentiful but slightly brackish and salt rivulet few inches broad irrigated patch or two of cultivation below the rest house among low hills we rode away ﬁrst due east from mukak the track at mile distance rising to feet and we remained at this altitude ﬁve miles again on this march we obtained glorious view at of the daftan volcano with its two imposing white domes on the crater sides we had then gone 6½ miles when after rounding some sand hills our track proceeded again due east we had crossed plain one mile broad and four and half miles long where there was good grazing regheth camels but tamarisk at the termination of the plateau which rose some 50 feet higher than the remainder of it we commenced to descend by gentle incline having high hills to our left north and low hills to our right south the track being due east to the we had another long straight monotonous spread of ﬁne sand and gravel in slight undulations and to the very low ranges of sand hills varying in height from 20 feet to 100 feet before us on our left to 100 bearings magnetic stood above the plain pillar mound of enormous height resembling from distance tower and another isolated red mountain with sharp point other smaller rocks of sugar form were scattered about on our left by the roadside an enormous boulder weighing several tons could be seen the presence of which could not easily be accounted unless it had been shot out by volcanic action it was most unlike the formation of the rock in the immedia neighbourhood of it and had all the appearance of having dropped at this place the track again changed its course and now went to my riding camel was taken very ill and even mahommed most affectionate language and the caresses he bestowed on him if the animal had been his dearest relation had appreciable effect upon his health the animal evidently had colic caused doubt by excessive eating of regheth the previous day he seemed to have the greatest trouble in dragging his legs along and every now and then he languidly swung his head round and gave reproachful look which undoubtedly meant ca you see i am ill i wish you would get of well i did get off although walking in the desert is not pleasure at any time and when we arrived at the next well after dreadfully slow march we proceeded to doctor up our patient now doctoring camel is not an easy matter one can not work on his imagination doctors on human beings when camel is ill he is really there was mistake about the symptoms of his complaint and after consultation sadek mahommed and i agreed that strong solution of salt and water should be administered which was easier said than done while the poor brute lay the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https long neck stretched upon the sand moaning groaning and breathing heavily we mixed bag of we half bucket of water and after endless our patient was most the contents down his throat interior of r est h ouse m ukak the r est h ouse at s ahib c hah we had some moments of great anxiety the animal was taken with ﬁt he fell on his side his legs quivered three or four times and one moment we really thought our remedy had killed him the medicine however had the desired effect and about an hour later the camel was again lively cricket and we were able to continue the reader may perhaps gauge what the loss of camel would have been when he is told that between sistan and journey of some 500 camels nor any other mode of conveyance are under ordinary circumstances to be procured we passed conical hill by the roadside which had thick deposits of gypsum on the side of its base while on the side the process of petriﬁcation of the sand was fully illustrated the thin surface layer when moist gets baked by the sun and thus begins its process of solidiﬁcation then another layer of sand is deposited on it by the wind and under goes the same process forming the thin horizontal strata so common in the section of all these hills the lower strata get gradually harder and harder but those nearer the surface can be easily crumbled into sand again by pressure between one ﬁngers these were the main altitudes registered on the day march plain feet 16 miles from mukak feet while mile and half further we had gone low feet on wide plain with undulations the rocky mountain when seen edgewise from distance had appeared like tower now on approaching it on its broad side its silhouette altered its semblance into that of an elongated crouching lion great quantities of gypsum could be seen in layers under the sand and fragments that covered the surface in places the ground was quite white if with snow the track until we had passed the isolated lion mountain about 20 miles from mukak maintained direction of east east and but about mile further it turned sharply northwards in bed of soft sand between sand mounds to the and sand bank facing north the top of which full of humps was not unlike crocodile back to the right we had an open space where one got view of the desert and mountains to the south and then we wended our way in g among sand hills bearing unusual characteristics and travelled across very sandy plain with clusters of regheth here and there this was one of the worst bits of the road the sand was troubl esome and the track absolutely obliterated by it in this portion miles 660 yards from mukak we arrived at sahib chah spot which traveller is ever likely to forget especially if few drops of water from one of the wells are tasted when the road was made it was very difﬁcult to ﬁnd drinkable water in this part and this all over beluchistan and sistan its magic up to the present time been the only successful attempt but i understand from captain are who is in charge of the road that he hopes to ﬁnd or has found water further north on the other side of the hill range and that in future the traveller will be spared the good fortune of visiting this heavenly spot most attractive iron troughs had been brought here and placed near the four wells and wooden windlasses had been erected on the edge of each that were not quite so common at the stations we had already passed this may lead the unwary traveller to believe that the water of these wells must have some special the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https well was fortunately absolutely dry the water of two was so powerful in its lightning effects that unfortunate was the wretch who succumbed to the temptation of tasting it while the water of the fourth well one was told was of quite good drinking kind i had been warned not to touch it but my men and camels drank some and it had equally disastrous effects on men and beasts sadek who was requested to experiment and report on such occasions thought his last hour had come and he and the camel men moaned and groaned the greater part of the night the water seemed not only saturated with salt but tasted of lead and phosphorus and was most violent pur gative the could not be called luxurious the reader is referred to the photograph i took of it facing page it was personally i did not the walls just high enough to screen one from the wind and sand it was in two compartments the wall of one being 4½ feet high and of the other about 7 feet high while 15 feet by 8 feet and 10 feet by 8 feet were the respective dimensions of each section the place lies in the middle of valley amid hills of chalk or gypsum and deep soft sand and is screened by low hill range to the and north while low sand dune protects it on the the new track i believe will go north of the range chapter xxxii sick men and came of photographing sahib the track versus the way of locating positions up hungry and thirsty by sensible mahommed who had come in curious rouble at mythical and chah all my camels well my men had been very sick during the night we had long march before us the following day and i wished to take photograph of the place i resolved not to leave until the sun had risen and in order to avoid delay i despatched all the camels and loads except my camera at four in the morning meaning to walk some ten or ﬁfteen miles and thus give my own camel rest sadek who said it was not right servant to ride when his master walked refused to go on with the caravan and insisted on remaining with when the camels was cutting northerly wind blowing raising clouds of retreated to the shelter to wait the sun to rise and had few hours sleep in solitary blanket i had retained the track had so far been so well deﬁned that i never thought of asking mahommed which way it led out of these hills the sun having risen and the photograph of sahib chah shelter duly taken we proceeded to catch up the camels but few yards from the shelter all signs of the track ceased and even the footprints of my camels had been absolutely obliterated by the high wind of the morning to the east were rather high rocky hills and two passes one going round to the which apparently would take us away from our direction and another which seemed more likely to be the right one to mislead us more we saw what we believed to be faint camel tracks smothered in sand in this direction so on we went sinking in ﬁne sand which kept ﬁlling our shoes and made walking most uncomfortable i climbed to the top of the rocky hill to reconnoitre but higher hills stood all round barring the view and i was none the wiser on we that we were going wrong but unable to ﬁnd where the track was among hundreds of sand hills dunes and high parallel hill ranges it was not easy to discover it there were ﬂat stretches of sand and parallel dunes several hundred feet high stretching from north by to south by and i knew the way must be east we had to go over them down on the other side only to be confronted with others before us like the waves of stormy sea the sun was scorching and when the sand got hot too walking was most unpleasant when we were not on sand while ascending the hill slopes and tops we were on cutting shale sadek who had not yet recovered from his previous night experience at sahib chah was still sick and with the extra exertion somehow or other lost his head altogether after having gone up and down i should not like to say how many times we were confronted by ﬂat valley to the and more mountains to be crossed in the direction we were going to the sadek thereupon maintained that the track must perforce be along the valley to which i would not agree and i insisted on keeping east which i knew would bring us right in the end we climbed hill after hill sadek dragged himself behind with discontented face every few minutes glancing back at the distant ﬂat valley to the to which he pointed sighing good master that road but up and down we continued away from it eastwards range after range of hills being left behind and more ranges standing in front of us sadek who was sweating under the weight of the riﬂe and camera grumbled that he was ill and tired hungry and thirsty and it was very little consolation to think that from this spot the two nearest wells of drinkable water were distant one about eight miles the other over forty miles we had nothing whatever with us to eat or drink after some three hours of i must confess that it was somewhat trying each time we had reached the top of range which we climbed with anxious enthusiasm expecting to get glimpse of the track to ﬁnd our view obstructed by yet another range generally higher than the one on which we stood hours of toiling i was saying we now came to rocky range about double the height of any we had climbed so far sadek on looking at it declined to climb any more he said he knew the track must be in the opposite direction and we should only have to climb all these hills back again he sat down and puffed away at cigarettes to allay his hunger and thirst and soothe his temper while i climbed to the highest point some 480 feet above the point where i had left sadek behold on reaching the summit beyond another range lower to the north along wide undulating plain i did discern whitish streak like chalk line stretching from west to east the the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https signalled the news to sadek and shou ted to him to come up which he most reluctantly did when panting up the hill he still turned round to the and disconsolately exclaimed can be road my good master that is road to the i ordered him to hurry up to my point of vantage and see himself may be road may be not road was his obstinate verdict when the white streak across the plain was triumphantly pointed out to him but sadek can you not see the white perfectly straight line stretching along straighter than anything else around you i can see plenty white lines master mountains mountains by which he meant gypsum strata on the top and foot of hills may be he added sarcastically all roads to shalkot quetta can you not see that the white track leads exactly in the direction where my compass says we must go pfff compass good he exclaimed with an air of amusing superiority and he stooped to pick two pebbles of different colours take one of these in one hand and one in the other he asked of now throw one towards the east and one towards the west i having curiosity sake complied with his request he gravely examined the discarded stones yes sahib your compass speaks truth allah says yours is the right road on requesting an explanation of this novel method of locating positions sadek looked very solemn and with pause if he were about to pour forth words of great wisdom and disregarding altogether the fact that my efforts solely and simply were responsible discovering the track you see my master he said one stone i called good road the other i called road whichever stone you throw ﬁrst is allah wish allah is more right than compass at any rate the method was simple enough and it fortunately happened that allah and my compass seemed in agreement on that occasion so adding these circumstances to the more substantial fact that we could see the track plainly before us we gaily descended from our lofty pinnacle and with renewed vigour climbed the lower and last hill range the last obstacle before us in the trough between the two ranges however the ﬁne sand was extremely nasty almost bad quicksand and we had some trouble in extricating ourselves we sank into it almost up to the waist we then crossed the broad plain in diagonal nearly four miles and at last after some seven hours of anxiety not to speak of hunger and thirst we struck the road again sadek who notwithstanding allah patent method my compass bearings and our combined eyesight was not at all certain in his own heart that we should ﬁnd the road that day was so overcome with joy when he actually recognised my camel footprints upon the sand where not obliterated by the wind that he collapsed upon the ground from fatigue and strain and slept snoring sonorously nearly two hours luck would have it beluch horseman travelling towards had overtaken my camels and much to mahommed astonishment informed him that he had not seen the sahib on the road so mahommed fearing that something had happened had the sense to turn back with two camels to try and ﬁnd us we were very glad of lift when he arrived and even more glad to partake of hearty lunch and long long drink of water which although brackish tasted quite delicious from one of the skins the track was like whitish streak on sombre grey valley with black hills scattered here and there and most peculiar hill on our left towards the north eastwards we could see long ﬂat high table mountain not unlike of sistan on our right were low much hills to the west low sand hillocks and facing us low black hill range standing in front of some high and very pointed peaks to the there was an open space we made diagonal crossing over several sand dunes that stood from 50 to 80 feet high and extended to great length southwards then we approached the hill it was of warm colour with yellow belt of sand at its base and sugar sand hills to the west of it to the east of it rose the plateau yellowish at the two extremities one looked at it from this point and black in the centre on the at was pointed peak perfectly conical it was very long march to h and we had few mild excitements on the road we came across some picturesque beluch clothed in ﬂowing white robes and carrying long matchlocks with fuse wound round the stock they were extremely civil all insisting on shaking hands in most hearty fashion and seeming very jolly after they had gravely gone through the elaborate salutation which always occupies considerable time further on we met cavalcade which included the naib tashildar of mirjawa an afghan in british employ and the duffadar of dalbandin the latter most striking ﬁgure with long curly hair hanging over his shoulders they were with some levies hastening to mirjawa an important place which owing to the ridiculous fashion in which the commission under sir holdich had marked out the frontier was now claimed both by persia and beluchistan making part of their respective territories when i was at the frontier there was much ado about this matter and some trouble may be expected sooner or later anybody who happens to know few facts about the way in which the frontier line was drawn must regret that england should not employ upon such important missions sensible and capable men whose knowledge of the country is thorough it would doubt be very interesting to the public to be told in detail exactly how the frontier was ﬁxed and whether sir holdich who was in charge ever visited the whole frontier line the government maps which existed at the time of the frontier demarcation were too inaccurate to be of any use has been proved over and over again to our sorrow it would also be interesting to know whether the astronomical positions of some of the supposed principal points of the boundary have been accurately tested and whether some points which had been corrected by really efﬁcient the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https been omitted if not suppressed in order to cover certain discrepancies and if so whether it was an expedient to avoid showing the weakness of the maps on which certain names ﬁgure prominently which were taken basis the delineation the facts are too commonly known by all the ofﬁcers in beluchistan and by the foreign ofﬁce in calcutta well by persians to be kept secret it is painful to have to regis ter facts of this kind but i most certainly think it is the duty of any englishman to expose the deeds of men who obtain high sounding posts and can only manage to keep them by intrigue and by suppressing the straightforward work of really able ofﬁcers which does not agree with theirs to the eventual expense and loss of the country at lar ge we went along leaving the plain which we had crossed some ﬁfteen miles we saw to the large white patches like snow these were made of gypsum and white limestone covering the ground curious long low ﬂat hill with hundreds of vertical black streaks at its base and black summit resembled gigantic centipede crawling on the ﬂat desert at the eastern end of the long plain were on the left side of the track and black isolated rounded mounds on the right to the very curious mountain could be seen one side of which was of beautiful white and yellow marble and from this spot we crossed hills of sand and gravel and the track was more tortuous but still travelling in general direction of 1 other mountains there were entirely of white marble and great many beautifully tinted fragments of marble well yellow alabaster were strewn about abundantly upon the ground we travelled among hillocks about seven and half miles then emer ged again into plain with hill range to our left but nothing near us on the south at the entrance of the valley on our left stood curious high natural stone pillar by moonlight but with clouds fast gathering and threatening rain we eventually reached chah at about ten in the evening havin g travelled some 36 miles the distance by road from sahib chah would have been 28 miles 660 yards here we found the remainder of my caravan which had arrived some hours previously chapter xxxiii beluch and the characteristics of wells of good water at and the spear of the sultan big ziarat at hours on the saddle rows of sand effect of chah khan and his good respected at the ziarat mushki hah feet is rather more interesting than other stations we had passed because of the greater number of beluch one saw about here too however one sojourning had to be curtailed unluckily the water was not only which one does not object so but had sulphurous taste with sickening dissimilar from that of an hospital ward when the windows have not been opened several days otherwise it had drawback there were four ﬁlthy pools from which water was obtainable and which reminded us of previous experience at girdi in sistan the water of one well had nasty green coating on the surface the second was of deep yellow colour the other two wells were slightly cleaner but they too were of suspicious of strong tea cluster of dozen palm trees or so had grown near this water and little way beyond on sand and gravel bank was ziarat with low surrounding wall of black stones the ziarat was of an ovoid shape it just missed being circular about 18 feet long and 16 feet broad an entrance had been made to the east and sort of altar constructed to the west by north which is about the accurate direction of mecca from this spot high pole on which ﬂew red white and blue rags was ﬁxed into the altar the one may call it mass of blocks of beautifully coloured marble some pieces resembled the best sienna marble others were capriciously streaked in white and dark brown other large pieces were quite transparent and resembled large blocks of camphor or ice others were more granular like lumps of frozen snow then there were some lovely bits of greenish yellow marble and some brown these beautiful stones and pieces of marble were brought to these ziarats from great distances by devotees stones reduced by nature into queer shapes hollowed instance by the action of sand or water perfectly spherical or strikingly coloured were favourite of ferings at this particular ziarat small marble mortar with pestle and marble hammer occupied the most prominent place ﬂint arrow head was also in evidence further was perched curious doll with string and charm round its neck and some chips of beautiful transparent streaked yellow marble like bits of lemon from the pole hung circle of wood and horns well coarse wooden imitations of horned animals skulls of ferings of palm leaves had also been deposited west of the ziarat was small semicircular mesjid of brown stone with few white marble pieces to the north by and further long heaps of stones extending in north by direction the last one was in the shape of grave with high white stone pillar to the south the new bungalow of which the foundations were just being laid will be erected near this ziarat quite number of beluch were settled at and some lived in small quadrangular mud houses with black tent stretched over the walls to act roof or else they had put up coarse huts made of branches of tamarisk and thatched with palm tree leaves and tamarisk in which they lived in the most abject poverty yet although these residences were often not higher than ﬁve or six feet their owners did not lack pride in beluchistan in england the home of man is his castle the beluch unlike the not let anybody who did not belong to his creed go into it the occupations of the people did not seem to have an excess of variety and consisted mainly of plaiting fuses their matchlocks keeping the threads tightly stretched by means of the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https bow there were but few coarse implements inside their huts and bag or two with grain long matchlock and sword or two lay in corner in most dwellings and that was about all the house of the chief was somewhat more elaborate having trunks of palm trees inserted vertically into the stone wall to strengthen it it had mud and stone enclosing wall and trophies of heads of dumbahs near the ﬂat roof in one room of this dwelling lived the family in the other the animals an enclosure horses was also noticeable two mud huts were next to it the thatched semispherical huts of palm tree leaves and tamarisk were also interesting was the windmill identical with those already seen in sistan on my arrival at two large tents had been placed at my the ﬁrst time i had been under tent on this i received great many callers very amusing incident occurred when i asked an old beluch and his two sons to sit their photographs they put on sarcastic smile and said they would rather die natural death than be taken the old man who said he had heard all about the black boxes he styled cameras and all the mischief they could complained that since one or two sahibs had passed along the route carrying black boxes great many beluch had been taken ill had misfortunes of all kinds and those who actually had the camera pointed at them had died from the effects one sahib had offered him personally bag of silver if he would only sit his picture but sir not i said the father he shook his head and scratched his beard and sir not we echoed the grinning youths never shall we be taken before they knew where they were and without any suspicion on their part i had by dodge of my own taken three photographs of them the best of which is reproduced facing page they were rather characteristic types of the lower class beluch of northern beluchistan they possessed very quick bright shining eyes dark complexions and long noses very broad at the base the mouth was generally the worst feature in their faces the upper lip being drawn very tight over the teeth and giving rather brutal expression to their countenances the men were very powerfully built with ribs well covered with muscle and fat powerful coarse wrists and ankles and hands with short stumpy thumbs windmill at m ushki c hah three b eluch who would not be p hot ographed their attire was simple sort of long white cotton blouse buttoned over the right shoulder and ample trousers of the same material many however wore felt overcoat rather overskin there was other garment underneath white turban was worn wound round the head duffadar six sawars and six camels were stationed at i left on january 21st at my camels with loads having started some hours previously and our way lay eight miles due east ﬁrst over sand hills and undulations then on perfectly straight and level track to the south we had barren waste of ﬂat desert we then veered and ﬁfteen miles off turned slightly further to the to the we had mountain range on nearing kundi we found tamarisk plentiful and good grazing camels some of the tamarisk trees were 10 feet high the march was very cold one gale blowing ﬁercely and penetrating right through our clothes and ﬂesh to the marrow of our bones three wells of good water were found 1¼ miles before reaching kundi the was uninhabited and fast tumbling down in 21 miles yards we had slightly risen to feet the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https point is one which remains well impressed on one mind partly on account of the splendid view obtained of the sultan mountains to the gloomy black mass with the highest peak of light red colour the is most weirdly fantastic mountain range sir charles mcgregor who saw these mountains from distance speaks of them the mountains he had ever seen but the best description is that given by major macmahon who was i believe the ﬁrst european to explore the range approaching it from the north he too was struck by the grotesque shape of its numerous sharp peaks above all by the the spear of the sultan enormous rocky pillar of hard conglom erate roughly resembling slender with tapering summit and precipitous sides that rise on the crest line of the range the ﬁssures macmahon says made by rain and weather action down its sides give it ﬂuted appearance from distance we expecte d to ﬁnd high natural pillar but were not prepared the stupendous size of the reality judging from its width at the base which is over 100 yards in diameter the height must be less than from 500 to 800 feet the sultan in whose honour this range is named is an ancient mythical celebrity who is said to be buried in the vicinity of the mountains his full name is and he is the patron saint of beluch robbers hence these mountains have reputation robber resort the sultan mountains abound in the assafoetida plant and in the summer months traders come in numbers from afghanistan to collect it i was in great hurry to return to engl and and could not afford the detour entailed by going near enough to photograph the spear besid es major macmahon gives capital photograph of it in the royal geographical society journal at kundi big ziarat with many trunks of tamarisk trees some 10 feet high supporting bleached horns has been erected to the hundreds of beautiful pieces of marble and alabaster of all sizes colours and shapes have been deposited here usual but the sand is fast covering the whole ziarat from kundi the track which has come in direction now turned sharply to ten high mud and stone neshans tejia cairns they are called by the been erected to warn the traveller four curious mounds with tufts of high tamarisk trees upon them are to be seen at kundi there is fair grazing camels all along one is specially attracted by the peculiar stones corroded into all sorts of shapes strewn all over the ground we made double march on that day the quaint sultan mountains which we saw all but very ﬂat uninteresting country all round we arrived during the evening at tretoh having been nineteen hours on the saddle it was bitterly cold at night the drop in the temperature being very great immediately after the sun went down at this station too the water tasted very was not necessarily unwholesome we were glad to get into the thana and light up big ﬁre in the centre of one of the mud rooms but sooner had we done this than it got so hot that i had to ﬁnd cooler abode in the new bungalow in course of construction which had not yet roof it was always marvel to how the natives could stand the great heat in the rooms with draught the smoke and heat to get away it positively roasted one alive but my men seemed to revel in it on the other hand they suffered from the cold to degree that was also unaccountable to on many occasions i have heard my moan from pain in his frozen toes and ﬁngers but true enough when out in the open desert the wind was rather penetrating and his clothes barring waistcoat consisted of thin white cotton garments personally i never had occasion to make change in my tropical clothing i could not if i had wanted to nor did i ever once have to use an overcoat seldom know what it is to feel cold we delayed our departure the next morning to see if the gale would abate but at 10 we had to venture out one was rather at the mercy of the wind on the hump of the camel it did blow the wind hampered the camels greatly and was nuisance all round one could only by an effort remain on the saddle the ﬂying sand ﬁlled one eyes and ears and the wind catching the brim of one hat made such hissing noise that one had to ﬁnd more comfortable headgear by wrapping up one head in blanket the desert was here absolutely ﬂat with some grazing camels kirri we were going east amid low sand hillocks and sand banks and the sultan mounta in still on our left in all its glory to the we had another mountain mass lower than the sultan and not nearly so picturesque and before us on going over gentle incline some 35 above the level of the plain about 13 miles from tretoh three long rows of bright yellow shaped stretching several miles from north to south were disclosed these three rows of barchans were parallel and at intervals of about from 300 yards to 500 yards from one another the barchans averaged from 50 to 100 in height another row of them stretched along the foot of the mountain range to the north and extended from to the cause of these extensive parallel rows of barchans was to be found in gaps in the hills to the north between the sultan the next range and two intervening obstacles in the shape of low mound and great rock the sand being blown through the interstices and gradually accumulating in the plain on the south on that march we saw most extraord inary effect of mirage to the east the peculiar gat or gut mountain which looked like gigantic ade could be seen apparently suspended in the air the illusion was perfect and most startling to any one with teetotal habits of course the optical illusion was caused by the different temperatures in the layers of air directly over the earth surface and the one above it where the two layers met they deviated at an angle or practically interrupted what would under ordinary circum stances be direct rays of vision the same effect in other words produced by placing stick vertically in water the real horizon was obliterated well the lower part of the mountain by the white haze caused by the warm lower layer of air some nineteen miles from tretoh where the hill range to the north became low few sand hills were to be seen then where another gap existed in the range yet another long row of barchans stretched southwards mile or so beyond this spot long sand and gravel bank stretched across the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https from to and near chah sandan another similar bank existed ﬁfty feet high parallel to the ﬁrst at chah sandan altitude we were most enthusiastically received by the duffadar who was politeness itself the beluch salutation is somewhat lengthy in the or brahui language spoken in north beluchis tan where i was travelling it sounds thus shar joroz druakha joroz haire meretus murev huaja khana after which the persons greeting seize each other hands and raise them to the forehead bowing low inquiries follow about the mulk or countries one has crossed on one journey and whether the people have treated one kindly the duffadar at chah sandan was an afghan belind khan by name and had the following good points about him he was most sportsmanlike fellow was very bright civil and intelligent and owned chickens that laid delicious eggs he possessed beautiful dog to which he was passionately attached and he and his brother had greater capacity tea than almost any men i have known above all belind khan had intense admiration the british and what they did and captain are his superior ofﬁcer he pronounced him to be the greatest baha dur that ever lived even in my own country afghanistan he exclaimed raising his right hand in the air there is like him this was not pure ﬂattery but it was truly meant and it was most pleasant to ﬁnd that such was the opinion not only of belind khan but of every one of captain are subordinates on the entire length of the road from the frontier to quetta there is thana of three rooms at chah sandan and ziarat to the sultan mountain i took photograph of belind khan making his salaams in the ziarat the altar of which was made of pile of white marble pieces and rounded stones with sticks on which horns and red rag had been ﬁxed chah sandan possessed three wells of excellent water the distance from tretoh to chah sandan was 23 miles 760 yards chapter xxxiv the picturesque gat covered shed at karenghi rirri deadly mesjid or characteri religion of symbol of knife possessed beluch idea of ﬁlter due east of chah sandan was the gat mountain this time there was mirage duly resting upon the desert it was most attractive looki ng mountain and quite one of the most striking sights in the scenery upon the road five miles from chah sandan we again struck high sandbanks and great many conical sand hills ten miles off we went through cut in the hills near which are to be found well of brackish water and great many palm trees of two kinds pish and metah big tamarisks kirri were also abundant and there was good grazing camels regheth being plentiful near the salt well stood gigantic palm tree we had come from chah sandan and from this our nearest point to the gat mountain the track turned one really had to halt to look at the gat it was so impressive two enormous blocks of rock several hundred feet high one roughly speaking of quadrangular shape to the north and one rectangular to the south were joined on the east side by perpendicular wall of solid rock up to about of the height of the mountain these huge blocks had accumu lations of debris and sand forming slanting pad all round except on the west side where there was sort of hollow recess there was large plain with good camel grazing to the bounded from east to south by semicircle of low hills after leaving gat there was nothing of interest on the march another extensive sand bank 50 feet high forming the eastern part of the hilly semicircle above mentioned was crossed then we were in barren valley further on however after going over yet another sand dune extending from north to south we entered one more plain this time absolutely covered with low palm trees from this plain we began to rise in order to cross the hill range that stood before us and here there were innumerable sand hills and sand banks the latter facing north near mirui one found one self among mountains some like huge waves of sand debris and shale one to the left huge mass in horizontal strata while further on was third most perfect cone behind this to the south lay mass of lower pointed conical sand hills mirui being one of the more important stages on the road most comfortable large bungalow has been erected here like the one at robat with four rooms and four bath rooms kitchens etc the water is very good at this place there is shop with the usual supplies caravans and staff consisting of jemadar duffadar one postal moonshee seven sawars four hasildars one havildar the bungalow at mirui is most pictures quely situated among the quaint mountains and the thana some little distance below against the mountain side looks quite formidable it not only has high towers at the corners of the wall but possesses an additional watch tower erected on the top of the mountain commanding ﬁne view of the country around before it surrounded by hills spreads valley from north to south which the track crosses in direction among palms and plentiful high tamarisks the bungalow stood at an altitude of feet the valley where the thana was situated was one hundred feet lower feet and the steep although not high pass by whic h we left the valley feet short led us into second valley with sand bank barring our way directly in front to the the direction of the track change we had high precipitous cliffs on the north and low range of sand hills extending from to two the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https isolated peaks broke the monotony of the horizon line to the to and respectively having crossed third and fourth plain two barren the other at the foot of sandbank with plenty of tamarisk the track which short distance went east turned suddenly to the we had now great expanse of open country before us with abundant tamarisk palm trees and eshwark which made capital grazing camels three high red mounds stood respectively to the south and while almost north the two high pointed conical peaks we had observed on the previous march were again visible on the there was quite high mountain range this was region of sand banks all facing north only one out of the lot spreading in west direction and of sand hills which were also numerous on getting near sotag the sandy ground was so covered with gypsum that some distance it looked just if it had snowed the photograph reproduced in the illustration gives good idea of the scenery in that part some three and half miles from sotag gap in the hills afforded view of an extensive plain to the south with innumerable sand hills and range of high mountains far away beyond from this point the track rises gently over an undulation about 88 feet higher than the plain and on the other side undulations continue and nothing whatever is to be seen except the same range of hills to the south with its peaks assuming pyramidical shapes toward the eastern portion ziara t at c hah s andan belind khan salaaming deser t covered with g ypsum near s otag we passed the salt well of jujiki about half way between the two stations and arrived at the desolate shed of chakal at nine in the evening where the thatched roofs of two out of three of the rooms had been torn down to supply fuel to travellers there is only salt well at this place but some two miles off the road well of good water has been dug near which new bungalow has been erected but we arrived late having done double mirui to sotag 12miles yards sotag to chakal 14 220 total 26miles yards i intended moreover continuing to dalbandin after three hours rest i did not avail myself of the convenience we had carried supply of good water with us there was wood here nor grazing camels but both fuel and food the animals can be obtained at the bungalow chakal was at the identical altitude of mirui feet my camels with loads left at midnight and some two hours later i followed this was most uninteresting march in by east direction with sand hills on either side of the track and high distant mountains to the red stretch of ﬂat sand between extending all along from to when there were more sand hills we came to sand banks which made the track undulating like switchback railway our attention was drawn to curious plant with fruit resembling small oranges lying upon the ground and called by the natives karenghi rirri there were hundreds of these fruit about but mahommed who had great local botanical knowledge advised not to eat them because their poison was deadly and we did not care to experiment in order to test the accuracy of his statement all along this route one ﬁnds great many mesjids or masit the word is pronounced by the beluch the mesjid or masit is sort of temporary praying spot where the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https say their prayers at sunrise or sunset and answers the one may be allowed the an mosque the mesjid may be simple or elaborate small or big according to devoutness patience and materials at hand but its most frequent shape is circular or at least more or less regularly curved and its material stones or if stones are not obtainable sand or mud banked up looking to the west towards mecca is stone higher than the others and in the more elaborate mesjids such the one shown in the illustration proper to ﬁt the knees is made on the western side with stone in the centre to mark the exact direction of mecca revered tomb is duly placed in the centre of the larger mesjids and an entrance way into them bordered with stones is always present to enter the mesjid by stepping over the ledge from any other side would be considered irreverent the interior is always cleared of all stones and made smooth practicable there are mesjids just big enough one man these being frequently made by caravan men to say their prayers and there are large ones the use of several people the prayin g spot to the west is however generally only big enough one at time circular m esjid with t omb and uter k neeling p lace mesjid on the s ite where m an had been k illed between kishingi and morad khan kella then there are the more ornamental constructions which had neatly made wall of white marble enclosed in case of black stones high black pillar to the west and two small white marble ones by its side the entrance in this case was to the east with stone slab across it which was raised when entering the mesjid one mesjid or more are generally to be found near burial places occasionally i have seen large square or rectangular ones but they are not quite so common those of rounded shape in some cases the mesjid consists of mere semicircle facing towards the west the beluch every one knows is suni mussulman and nourishes hatred the shia sect but although very observant of certain rites pertaining to the religion of mahommed the beluch is not bigoted in religious matters and this is probably due to the fact that mullahs saiyads fakirs or other such religious ofﬁcials and fanatics are seldom to be encountered among the beluch in northern beluchistan far south in makran matters are different the people are more fanatical and several religious sects such the rafais sect which proves its faith in the prophet by khwajah and the zikris are found well the biadhiah who are despised heretics by both suni and shia mussulmans and who fully reciprocate the hatred unlike other true mussulmans these biadhiahs indulge in intoxicants and are very slack in religious observances but the whom i mostly came in contact in the not very strict are certainly most reverent and generally not intemperate they have actual mosques wherein to go and pray but worship in the improvised mesjids which i have described in fact the word mesjid merely means place of worship superstition is generally rampant in people leading somewhat wild life of adventure some of the legends of the good and evil gins or spirits and peris fairies are very quaint the belief in the magic power of spells and charms is also deeply rooted captain are told two rathe r amusing instances of superstition one day he was out stalking in the hills near dalbandin when he came across snake ekis carinata the beluch shikars who were with him refused to go on and sat down half an hour waiting the evil which the snake was palpable vanish on another occasion one of his men dropped his knife which by the way he had found on the road the beluch got off his camel and stalked the knife it lay on the ground and when within few feet of it he let ﬂy stone at near it he could this was he explained to hit the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https the pal which was in the knife by which he meant that the knife was possessed and positive proof of it lay in the fact that he had dropped it on less than three separate occasions there was certain humour in the remark made by beluch at isa tahir to captain are when he saw the captain servant with an efﬁcient ﬁlter reduce the ﬁlthily slimy water of the only local pool into water clear crystal he rushed to the captain in state of great concern and anxiety sahib he said you know what your servant is doing he is taking all the colour all the strength and all the smell out of the water that you are going to drink chapter xxxv captain are nushki excellent built and in course of government nushki route and the to quaint ofﬁcial and their amusing incident we arrived very early at dalbandin the march from chakal being very short 18 miles 190 yards and easy here i had the pleasure of meeting captain are political assistant at chagai and ofﬁcer in charge of the road not only has this ofﬁcer devoted all his time and energy to making the road but being man of means he has personally gone to considerable expense to push the road and make it success it would not have been easy to ﬁnd more practical and sensible man to the work and considering the difﬁculties he had to encounter it is marvellous with what little expenditure he has obtained such excellent results it is all very well the usual newspaper generally does not know what he is writing complain of this and complai n of that and declare that something shou ld have been done in exactly the contrary way to the way in which it is done in regard to this road any one with any common sense must see that all that could have been done has been or is being done well the t ype of t hana and n ew b ungalow between n ushki and r oba t the road desert excellent in every way far the frontier and some sort of shelter is to be found at every stage of course the road has only just been opened and all the arrangements the accommodation of travellers are not quite completed but large comfortable bungalows had already been we have robat mirui and dalbandin while smaller buildings of the same type will shortly be completed at mall kuchaki chah yadgar chah sotag and chah sandan in addition to these the erection of bungalows has been taken in hand at chakal tretoh saindak kirtaka and mahommed raza chah and it was anticipated that all these rest houses would be ﬁnished before the close of owing to the great increase in the trafﬁc upon the route the accommodation at mall yadgar chah and karodak has been nearly doubled and two rooms added to the already extensive thana at dalbandin while the tretoh and mukak posts have been much enlar ged and strengthened on the persian territory the sul in sistan has erected small shelters which although necessarily not quite so luxurious those under the direct control of the british authorities are yet quite good enough any one to spend night in we have thus complete belt of extending from quetta to sher in sistan every effort has been made to improve the water supply upon the road and new wells are constantly being sunk true the water all along the route is not of the best but one does not generally expect to ﬁnd delicious sweet spring water in desert one thing is nevertheless certain that the best has been made of given circumstances barring the most trying section of the route in beluchistan territory between mukak and where the water is really foul the majority of wells may be more or less brackish but i have said before not necessarily unwholesome in fact i have ﬁrm belief that brackish water is the water one should drink in the desert to keep healthy and is the remedy provided by nature the purpose of balancing other fects produced by travelling over hot sandy dry barren land brackish water however should not be confounded nor classiﬁed with dirty water there are post ofﬁces at the principal stations such robat saindak mirui dalbandin and nushki and service links robat with quetta the time taken to convey letters being now reduced to 100 hours consular postal service in connection with this continues from robat via birjand to meshed there is service on the very convenient value payable parcel system far robat and sistan but from england the post ofﬁce will not take the responsibility of insured parcels beyond the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https government has granted most important great value to which money can be remitted to or received from either sistan or birjand through the consular treasury under the char ge of the sistan mciver mackenzie of karachi and duncan macbean of the punjab bank quetta are prepared to act forwarding agents indian and persian ﬁrms and the quetta branch of the punjab bank is further in business communication with the imperial bank of persia which we have seen has agencies in the principal cities of west persia and also in meshed another concession most important to the stimulation of trade by this overl and route has been granted by the north western railway in regard to goods despatched from karachi to quetta export to persia by the route from the 1st of april 1901 rebat equal to of the freight paid was given on all goods such tea spices iron kerosene oil sugar brass and copper booked and carried from karachi to quetta export to persia by the sistan route the usual charges are to be paid on forwarding the goods but on producing certiﬁcate from the agency ofﬁce at quetta that the goods have actually been despatched to persia via sistan the amount of the rebate is refunded from the 1st of may 1901 another concession came into effect allowing similar rebate of third of the actual freight paid on all goods received at quetta from persia by the sistan route certiﬁcate from the agency ofﬁce at quetta being required to prove the fact and despatched thence to karachi or kiamari or to railway stations in the punjab and province or to stations on connected lines merchants despatching goods to persia by the should be careful to have each of the original invoices of their goods attested by some qualiﬁed ofﬁcer at the place from which the goods are despatched by doing this they will ﬁnd that their goods will be passed through the persian customs at the frontier with trouble and delay the invoices should be clearly written in the english or french languages the number of travellers along the route is gradually increas ing several ofﬁcers returning to england travelling by it but i was assured that i was the ﬁrst european who had travelled on that route in the opposite direction viz from england to quetta only british subjects and persians it is stated are allowed to travel on this route and some quaint instances of inconceivable ofﬁcial formality on the part of the government of india are cited instance german was allowed to travel by the route from quetta to sistan but another german who wished at the same time to travel from sistan to quetta was arrested at the frontier detained some two months in sistan and permission refused i myself had quite an amusing experience at certain station with travelling police ofﬁcer who was not aware of my coming and seeme d in great state of mind fearing that i should prove to be russian spy the n ushki oba t t rack the only thing to be regretted along this route and one which i think will be perpetual cause of friction and annoyance with the persians and i am sure it would be to us were we in their that we should allow pilgrims to use this trade route in order to visit the sacred shrine of imam raza in meshed the number is so fast increasing that it is proposed i believe to provide special accommodation pilgrims at every stage between quetta and robat now there are pilgrims and pilgrims some are doubt people and deserve to be looked after but the greater number are decrepit sickly fanatics burdened with all sorts of ailments whose wish it is to go and die and be buried in the vicinity of the sacred shrine furth ermore not only the living ones go and breathe their last in meshed or more frequently upon the road but among their personal luggage they try to bring over corpses of relations interment in the holy burial place the passage of corpses to persia through beluchistan is not permitted by the local government but occasional attempts are made to smuggle them through and it is not very easy matter to detect them not even by the smell of the corpses which can be worse than that of the living pilgrims even at best these parties of pilgrims are miserable lot with bundles of ﬁlthy rags when anybody dies on the road invariably made to bring the bodies along that we have had and still have the plague in india is matter we can not very well hide that the passage across the beluchistan and persian deserts should be sufﬁcient disinfectant far individuals go is also theoretically probable but i am not certain that the theory would apply to the ﬁlthy rags and bedding i would not speak so feelingly had i not seen these pilgrims myself now if we choose to allow these creatures to bring infection into other it must be remembered that if they go to the shrine it is generally because they are infected with some complaint or other or actually the purpose of dying ought not to grumble if the russians who see their thickly popula ted territories of transcaspia threatened enforce upon the persian ofﬁcials the necessity of hampe ring the progress of such parties towards meshed nor can we blame them if when the persian authorities are unable to enforce stringent measures they the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https into their own hands whether in strictly legal way or otherwise in order to prevent these sickly hordes from coming towards their frontier i am sure that if the sacred shrine were in british territory and ailing russian pilgrims came over bringing bundles of dead relations with them the outcry in this country would be general and we should soon put stop to it it is the provocation to hinder them is very great while the beneﬁt that we reap by letting these wretches through is rather difﬁcult to detect they are an expense to the government rather than otherwise not to speak of the endless bother and annoyance they give our various ofﬁcials on the road indeed religious people whether mussulman or christian or buddhist can make themselves nuisance religion sake moreover our caravans following directly after these funereal parties have occasionally fared badly at the hands of the alarmed natives in sistan major benn was telling an amusing incident one or two members of one of these fanatical parties died at the consulate the local persian doctor pronounced of plague and the natives were scared to death fear that the infection should spread and one day when major and benn were peacefully riding along the city wall number of people with riﬂes collected upon the ramparts and ﬁred volley with actual bullets over their heads it was explained afterwards that the intention was not to cause the riders any harm but merely to drive away the spirits of infection which hung over the consul who had been with the pilgrims there seems to be belief that the intense cold of the winter the terriﬁc heat of the summer and the torrential rains of the autumn make the nushki route impracticable during the greater part of the year but nothing could be further from the truth one can travel on this route comfortably at almost any time of the year except during the heavy rains when the desert becomes swamp and makes it impossible camels to go on in summer of course one has to travel at night and in winter it is pleasanter travelling during the day chapter xxxvi the advantages afghans driven from owns beluchistan beluchistan is treaties and engagements with the kahn of brahui and nhauri british political connection with kelat treaty of treaty stormed by the of treaty of the death of nasir matters settled in brahui state of marris and reconciliation of the sardars with the khan of reaty of agents at the khan and troops stationed in the sandeman agent to the governor agreement of ransfer of dues and chiefship of chief of las roublesome occupants of zhob few details of how the british government came to make the road may interest the reader after the afghan war was over it was supposed that our boundary extended far north the river halmund but we let things slide many years and took steps to extend our inﬂuence so far and the result was that the amir of afghanis very rightly regarded chagai most important strategical position in fact almost the key to the possession of the place in 1896 commission was sent out to deﬁne the frontier properly and major macmahon most thorough and conscientious ofﬁcer was placed in char ge of the mission on looking at the map one might if unaware of certain important circumstances be led rashly to believe that the natural geographical boundary between beluchistan and afgh anistan is along the course of the river halmund or else that it should follow the watershed of the chain of mountains extending from west to east from the malek siah the lahr kuh the kacha kuh mirjawa or saindak mountains to the mountain mass extending far the sultan mountain one can not at ﬁrst grasp why when two such excellent natural boundaries exist the boundary has been drawn right across the desert between the halmund and these there is nothin g to mark division except the whitewashed pillar put up by the boundary commission this is what would appear but here is what really happened while we were taking trouble to spread our inﬂuence in that portion of the country the afghans claimed theirs considerable portion of what makes part of beluchistan point which it is well not to lose sight of is that after the sistan mission of 1872 when general sir frederick goldsmid assisted by general sir richard pollock acted arbitrators between the persian and afghan governments it was agreed that the mountains close to where the ziarat has been erected should mark the most point common to the two countries this point being given when the afghan boundary commission began its work in march 1894 they found that the afghans claimed great deal more land theirs than was expected the line of boundary to be deﬁned from gomal to the persian frontier was some 800 miles and during the two years which it took to complete the laying down of the boundary line the mission is said to have had very great trouble with the afghan commissioners and here one can hardly forbear comparing the magniﬁcently thorough manner in which this frontier was ﬁxed with the shoddy confused method in which the frontier was demarcated the word can be used in this sir thomas holdich at the same epoch in the case of the frontier 800 miles of frontier line was carefully laid down under the direction of captain now major macmahon to whom great britain may be grateful possessing several hundred square miles of land more than she would have done and mark you these additional square miles in the most impor tant portion to us of beluchistan i am referring to that zone of ﬂat territory north of the mirjawa saindak and the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https which forms southern barrier to the afghan desert and along portion of which we have now built the route strategically more particularly if railw ay is to be constructed the advantages in gaining that strip of land on the north side of the mountainous region can not be and only fearless but extremely tactful and above all able ofﬁcer like macmahon could have scored such an unexpected success against the very shrewd afghan commissioners the latter well knew the political value of the concession and so did the amir at ange red at hearing of the advantages gained by the british comm issioners their own country is said to have treated his representatives in summary way on their return to the afghan capital but the line of boundary was laid in an unmistakable manner the ﬁnal agreements and really accurately drawn maps were signed on may 14th 1896 by both the afghan and british commissioners and there was going back on what had been done one of the important results of this boundary commission was that we deﬁnitely drove the afghans out of chagai north of which place the frontier now extends eastwards to the sarlat mountains the ﬁrst thing that directed attention to these remote regions was nushki little district some 90 miles from place most conveniently situated strategical and trade purposes this was an outlying portion of the khan of kelat territory matter of fact these people were always ﬁghting among themselves they had bitter enmity with one another and their feuds had accumulated on an ever increasing scale centuries they merely acknowledged the khan authority when it suited their ends the government ﬁrst requested the khan or kelat to keep the district in order being frontier district not far from the afghan boundary and notiﬁed him that trouble there might involve trouble with the british government the khan however was helpless and the ultimate result was that the government came to terms with the khan and agreed to give him quit rent of rupees year sum much lar ger than he ever got out of it took over nushki from him one question frequently asked is who owns beluchistan to which one might almost answer yes who does like afghanistan nepal and other such buffer states beluchistan is going through somewhat slow but sure process of absorption beluchistan is mere expression of political geography and the country called by that name has on the west boundary with persia on the north real boundary with afghanistan to the south the arabian sea and to the west the brahuic and lukhi mountains bordering with sindh and the lower dejarath beluchistan may be subdivided follows british beluchistan with the assigned districts of quetta and the bolan territories under the immediate rule of the khan of kelat sarawan and thalawan the lands belonging to the two leading brahui clans the chiefship of las bela makran kharan and the country of the beluch tribes such the marris and bugtis along the punjab and sind borders bori and zhob we have certain treaties engagements and sanads with the khan of kelat and the other chiefs and the i have to use parad oxical be regarded sort of dependent independent state i can ﬁnd better way of describing it we have bought up all the rights held by the chiefs that were worth buying our purposes and while theoretically the country is supposed to be merely under our sphere of inﬂuence we might with our qualities practically consider it absolutely our own the brahui khan of kelat is the most powerful ruler in beluchistan and the city of kelat may be looked upon the beluch capital of beluchistan quetta of course is the capital of british beluchistan the beluch may be roughly divided into two great classes the brahui and the nharui the latter to be subdivided again into the rinds and the numris these classes however are again to be split up into great many tribes of dif ferent names b eluch f amil y the meaning of the word brahui is said to be inhabitants of the desert and of nharui men of the plains the nharui profess to be of arab origin and to have come from the west and they despise the idea that they are akin to the afghans or the turkomans their features and habits would support this view and their language undoubted ly bears traces of strong western inﬂuence if not of actual western origin their being such much ﬁner specimens of men than the average persians may the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https by the fact that during the arab invasion only the ﬁttest and ﬁnest survived to get far this and that of these men the beluch are the present descendants like all nomads the beluch are most wonderful linguists i met great many men who knew three four or ﬁve languages such brahui nharui persian afghan and even hindustani and on experiment they showed remarkable facility picking up and correctly retaining words of any foreign language the theory that the most numerous class in tartar mountaineers is to my mind incorrect they believe themselves to be the aboriginal people of beluchistan and this i think is more likely the case their language is quite different from any of the nharui dialects the nharui tribes are much given to raids and warfare and even last year when i was going through beluchistan small war had just been settled by british force sent to suppress the rebels in conjunction with persian force from kerman on the other side i can not speak of the southern tribes i did not visit them but the brahui with whom i came in contact although very fond of life of adventure i invariably found extremely gentlemanly hospitable and digniﬁed in every way they were men of splendid type who combined determined bravery with the quietest softest most considerate and graceful manner the khan of kelat is the most powerful ruler and with him we have several important treaties from the time of abdullah khan in the eighteenth century kelat had been state independent of the delhi empire and had incorporated several provinces to understand fully the evolution of beluchistan into its present condition i will give hasty historical review of the most important occurrences the political connection of the british government with kelat commenced during the time of the grandson of nasir khan mehrab khan weak ruler who became khan in he was disliked by the chiefs of the various tribes being under the inﬂuence of man of low extraction called daud mahommed whom fateh mahommed the hereditary minister was sacriﬁce fateh son naib mulla mahommed hasan however murdered the intruder and was himself placed in the position his father should have occupied but his hatred the khan never ceased to crave revenge in 1838 this treacherous minister in the khan name but without his knowledge incited the tribes to rise and harm the british troops in their march to restore shah shujia to his dominions sir alexander burns had to be deputed to kalat to prevent hostility and attempt to negotiate treaty the treaty contained the following stipulations 7 art 1 the descendants of nasir khan well his tribe and sons shall continue in future to be masters of the country of kelat kachki khorstan makran kej bela and the port of soumiani in the time of the lamented ahmad shah durani art 2 the english government will never interfere between the khan his dependants and subjects and particularly lend assista nce to shah nawaz fateh khan and the descendants of the mahabbatzai branch of the family but always exert itself to put away evil from his house in case of the shah displeasure with the khan of kelat the english government will exert itself to the utmost to remove the same in manne r which may be agreeable to the shah and according to the rights of the khan art 3 long the british army continues in the country of khorasan the british government agrees to pay to mehrab khan the sum of of company rupees from the date of this engagement by half yearly instalments art 4 in return this sum the khan while he pays homage to the shah and continues in friendship with the british nation agrees to use his best endeavours to procure supplies carriage and guards to protect provisions and stores going and coming from shikarpur by the route of rozan dadar the bolan pass through shal to kuchlak from one frontier to another with assurances of ﬁdelity to the saddozai family and friendship to the british stipulation that all supplies and carriage obtained from the khan must be paid without hesitation treaty was duly concluded on march 28th everything seemed satisfactory and the khan promised to visit quetta to pay his salaams to shah shujia sir alexander burnes who had preceded him was robbed on the way of the draft of the treaty signed by the khan treacherous mulla mahommed hasan did not fail to impress upon the british that the khan had given directions to have the treaty stolen and had furthermore prevented mehrab from proceeding to quetta the hostility of the khan being evident it was resolved to send punitive expedition to kelat to give the khan lesson on the 13th of november 1839 the town was stormed and taken by detachment of general wiltshire brigade mehrab khan was killed and his son ﬂed while the khan minister was made prisoner and his treachery proved shah nawaz youth of fourteen direct descendant in the male line from mahabat was set up by the british the future khan of kelat the provinces of sarawan and kach gandava were annexed to the dominions of the amir of afghanistan mehrab son nasir khan the rightful successor to the rule of kelat headed revolution shah nawaz was deposed the british representative at kelat was killed and nasir khan was eventually established in power by the british the two provinces restored to him and new treaty concluded with him on october 6th this treaty acknowledged nasir khan and his descendants the vassals of the king of cabul allowed if necessary the honourable company or shah shujia troops to be stationed in any positions they deemed advisable in any part of his territory and declared that british resident ofﬁcer advice should always be followed caravans into afghanistan from the indus well from soumiani port were to be protected from attacks and undue exactions imposed on them the british government undertook to afford nasir khan protec tion in case of attack while nasir khan bound himself to provide the support of shah nawaz whom he had deposed this treaty became useless after the retirement from cabul and it was found necessary to negotiate new agreement dated 4th of may 1854 which annulled the treaty of october 6th 1841 enjoined perpetual friendship between the british government and the khan of kelat his heirs the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https and bound nasir khan and successive khans to oppose to their utmost all enemies of the british government with whom he must act in subordinate and not enter without consent into negotiations with foreign states british troops might occupy if necessary any position they thought advisable in the kelat territory and british subjects and merchants from sindh or the coast to afghanistan were to be protected against outrage plunder and exactions transit duty however was to be imposed at the rate of six rupees on each from the coast to the northern frontier and 5 rupees from shikarpur to the same frontier to aid nasir khan his heirs and successors in the fulﬁlment of these obligations and on condition of faithful performance of them the british government bound itself to pay to mir nasir khan his heirs and successors an annual subsidy of company rupees if however the conditions required were not fulﬁlled year by year the government would stop the payment of the annual subsidy when nasir khan died in 1857 his brother his son and his claimed the succession and the latter khudadad khan boy of ten was elected by the chiefs but had it not been the support given him by the british government who four successive years paid him an additional rupees besides the stipulated in the agreement in order to help him to suppress the rebellious marris tribe he could not have maintained his position the leading kelat chiefs dissatisﬁed with their ruler elected sherdil khan khudadad cousin khan of kelat but he was murdered the following year 1864 and the banished ruler reinstated in his former position previous to his banishment in 1862 proper agreement was signed deﬁning the boundary line between british india and the khan territory but it was not till 1887 that matters regarding it were absolutely settled one thing may be said the beluch and that is that barring few squabbles they have in the main been friendly and faithful towards the british on february 20th and march 23rd 1863 convention was entered into with the khan containing an additional clause the extension of telegraph line through such of his dominions lie between the western boundary of the province of mekran under the feudatory rule of the jam of beyla and the eastern boundary of the territory of gwadur the protection only of which line and those employed upon it the khan was to receive an annual payment of rupees the whole sum to be expended among the chiefs and people through whose country the line passed it was particularly stipulated that the sites on which british government buildings were to be erected should remain the property of the khan constant risings took place during the rule of khudadad and the brahui chiefs combined in an open rebellion in the khan being unable to suppress the rising demanded aid of the british mediation took place in jacobabad their conﬁscated lands were restored to the sardars the allowances which they customarily received in the time of mir nasir khan the younger were again granted and the sardars on their side had to return all the property plundered state of chaos followed this arrangement the khan ceased to take an interest in the administration of his country caravans were consta ntly attacked and robbed raids were frequent and compensation was ever paid losses sustained the political agent had to withdraw from kelat and in 1854 the payment of the subsidy was withheld until the khan should stand by his agreement and restore order an attempt was made to keep quiet the marris and bugtis frontier tribes by additional payments to the chiefs in the name of the khan but their attitude was uncertain constant attacks occurred on the frontier and state or absolute anarchy reigned in the khan country when captain sandeman was despatched in 1875 special agent the government to attempt to bring about reconciliation between the khan and the sardars at darbar held at mastung in july 1876 an ofﬁcial reconciliation actually took place between the khan and the leading brahui chiefs on the 8th of december of that same year the khan was received by the viceroy of india at jacobabad and new treaty was concluded which was the actual foundation of the beluchistan agency the new treaty renewed and reafﬁrmed the treaty of 1854 and while the khan of kelat and his successors and sardars bound themselves faithfully to observe the provisions of article 3 of that treaty to oppose all enemies of the british government and in all cases to act in subordinate with the british government the british government on its part engaged to respect the independence of kelat and to aid the khan in case of need in the maintenance of just authority and the protection of his territories from external attacks british agents with suitable escorts were in future to reside permanently at the court of the khan and elsewhere in the khan dominions and representative of the khan would in future be accredited to the government of india the british agent at the court of the khan would in case of dispute with the sardars use his inﬂuence to bring about an amicable settlement and if unsuccessful the dispute was to be submitted to arbitration at the request of the khan and of the sardars and in recognition of the intimate relations existing between the two countries the british government by article 6 of treaty assented to the request of the khan the presence of detachment of british troops in his country on condition that the troops should be stationed in such positions the british government might deem expedient and be withdrawn at the pleasure of the government the agreement further provided the construction of railways and telegraphs through the territories of the khan and free trade between the state of kelat and british territory subject to certain conditions the mutual protection of ﬁscal interests the annual subsidy of the khan successor was increased by this treaty to rupees plus rupees annually the establishment of posts and development of trafﬁc along the trade routes in manner agreeable to the british government in compliance with the agreement british troops were stationed at shalkot quetta and mittri and on february 21st 1877 major sandema n was appointed agent to the governor with three assistants the headquarters to be in quetta afterwards the territories under the political control the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https agent were subdivided into distinct agencies of which kelat was one during the afghan war the khan behaved most loyally towards the british further developments necessitated fresh agreement signed on june 8th 1883 by which the khan of kelat made over the entire management of the quetta district and niabat absolutely and with all the rights and privileges well full revenue civil and criminal jurisdiction and all other powers of administration to the british govern ment the agreement to take effect from april 1st 1883 on condition that in lieu of the annual surplus of revenue hitherto paid to the khan the british government should from march 31st 1884 pay ﬁxed annual rent of without deductions cost of administration the khan transferred all his rights to levy dues or tolls on the trade in either direction through the bolan pass well from kachi to khorassan and to and from british india and the districts of sibi quetta and pishin the latter concession the british government paid the khan the annual sum of net plus ﬁxed yearly sum to be paid by the viceroy of india to the sarawan and kurd sardars their services in the pass the full civil criminal jurisdiction and all other powers of administration within the limits of the said pass and within the land purchased by the british were also ceded to the british government the population of the state of kelat including kharan and makran was estimated by aitchison at about area at square miles the chiefship of kharan lies along the northern border of the state of kelat roughly from near nushki to panjur the principal tribes are the naushirwanis and their chiefs have at various epochs acknowledged the suzerainty of the khan of kelat and the rulers of persia and afghanistan respectively in 1884 sardar azad khan acknowledged allegiance to the khan of kelat and in 1885 settlement was made with him by which he undertook to certain tribal services in consideration of an annual payment of besides kharan the sardar holds lands in panjgur and lays claim to jalk dizak and kohak the two ﬁrst being within the persian boundary we have other important agreements such the one 1861 with the chief of las bela the protection of the telegraph which he receives subsidy of year and number of agreements with the various chiefs of makran mostly relating also to the protection of the telegraph line with subsidies or allowances to each chief to the troublesome marris tribe occupying the country from the nari river and the outskirts of the bolan far the plain of sham near the punjab boundary to the east allowan ces are paid directly tribal services and good behaviour these people have

afghanistan and was occupied by british troops during the afghan war by the treaty of gandamak its administration was put into the hands of british ofﬁcers but the surplus revenue was paid to the amir

chiefs we will now return to matters relating to the most important point the pivot it were of our when nushki was taken over by the british government the leading tribe in the district was the zagar mengal brahui tribe they had settled in nushki approximately century or 150 years ago and were most powerful tribe supposed to number about large proportion of whom lived in registan country of sand to the north and mostly of nushki across the afghan frontier the zagar mengal sardar was in nushki itself and he had right of levying what is termed in beluch sunge transit due on all merchandise passi ng through nushki foreseeing how such right would interfere with trade the british government came to terms with the sardar by which instead of his transit dues he undertook what is called in beluchistan noukri or service old custom by which man supplies number of sawars and is responsible them the next thing was to settle all the tribal feuds three or four tribes were at war cases were carefully inquired into and settled according to beluch law through the medium of tribal jirga council of elders one case led to another and eventually all were settled up to everybody satisfaction in the meantime traders from shikarpur from quetta and kelat began to be attracted to nushki bazaar was started and is fast growing from year to year one hundred thousand rupees have already been spent on it with the result that number of competing traders came in competition resulted in good prices which further attracted trade ﬁrst from the districts to the north in the immediate vicinity of nushki and later from further and further aﬁeld the name of unknown few years at present well known everywhere and the place has indeed become quite an important trade centre from nushki we have seen chain of posts manned by local beluch levies was pushed west far robat on the persian frontier even late 1897 trade in these parts was limited to few articles of local consumption and persian trade was represented by stray caravan from sistan that had forced its way to nushki and frequently lost men camels and goods on the way the venturesome caravans seldom numbered more than one or two year and were at the mercy of mamasani beluch called pasand khan who lived in sistan and levied blackmail on such caravans came through this man was well acquainted with all the marauders who haunted the stretch of country south of the halmund between sistan and chagai pasand khan levied at the rate of twenty krans about 8s 4d per camel and saw the caravans in comparative safety far chagai from which

ziarat itself is circular 25 feet in diameter with mud and stone wall 4 feet high round it it has door to the east and tomb to the west bundle of sticks is laid outside the wall and another much larger with red and white rags upon it at the head of the tomb the latter being covered usual with pieces of white marble and round stones at the head of the grave near the upright sticks was large stone with holes in the centre and also number of wooden drinking cups masses of horns sticks whips ends of broken bottles bits of rope etc these fragments of civilization hardly added to its picturesqueness the tomb lay from north to very curious fact rule the head of the tomb in other ziarats was to the west the tomb however lay in the western portion of the ziarat circle the enclosing wall was adorned with horns of sacriﬁced goats and in fact outside to the south was the sacriﬁcial spot with some large slabs of stone smeared with blood and the usual upright sticks but rags appended to them it had nevertheless some decoration of horns second ziarat was to be found on the top of the these ziarats go in couples the principal one on the summit of hill the other at the foot the latter the convenience of travellers who have not the time or the energy to climb to the higher sacred spot this ziarat was 45 feet long also with time of black rounded an upright white slab of marble the wall of black stones was 1½ feet high below this to the south was third smaller oval ziarat 20 feet long 12 feet wide with many offerings of horns perched on poles to the west and heap of fancy stones together with some implements such mortar pestle and cups fourth ziarat very small with mud tomb on which two mill stones had been deposited was little further on and had solitary rag ﬂying near these ziarats was an extensive beluch to which bodies were brought from very great distances interment there was large rectangular mesjid the ﬁrst i had seen of that shape at the western point of the graveyard and three smaller ones at the other corners and the graves were very nice and tidy formed generally of fragments of yellow marble high stone pillar at the head and one at the foot and little chips of marble along the upper centre of the grave others more elaborate had neat edge and centre line of black stones and coloured end pillars while some consisted of pile of horizontal sticks with an upright one at each end the bodies of more important people such chiefs were given larger tombs often very gaudy and of prismatic shape made of myriads of bits of crystal within black border of stones occasionally trench was dug round the graves it was interesting to note that here too on the one saw family graves which although not in actual compartments like those on the sistan mountain were nevertheless secluded from the others within low boundary stone wall the prismatic graves seldom rose more than 1½ feet above ground but the al tumuli which marked some of the more important burial places were from 3½ to 4 feet high these tumuli were either of mud or of large smooth pebbles and generally had pillars one or two however had pillar to the west to the east of the graveyard the graves which seemed of more recent date had sticks at each end instead of stone pillars and these were connected by string to which halfway between the sticks hung piece of wood ribbon or rag the meaning of this i could not well ascertain and the versions i heard were many and conﬂicting some said these were graves of people who had been recently buried it being customary to erect the stone pillars some months after burial and that the string with dangling rag or piece of wood was merely to keep wolves from digging up dead bodies others said it was to keep evil spirits away but each man gave different explanation and i really could not say which was the true origin of the custom the pillars over man grave some say signify that the man died without leaving issue but i think this is incorrect it would then appear by most graves that the beluch are the most unproliﬁc people on earth which i believe is not the case children graves were usually covered with pieces of white marble or light coloured stone and those of women were generally smaller and less elaborate and with lower pillars than men graves the preparing of corpses interment is rather interesting with men the lower jaw is set so that the mouth is closed tight and is kept in this position by the man own turban which is wound round the chin and over the head the eyes are also gently closed by some relative and the hands placed straight by the sides soon life is pronounced extinct the body is covered over with sheet and the dead man relations go and procure new clothes after which the body is removed from the tent or house and is taken towards well or stream according to circumstances here the body is laid down and carefully washed after which it is wrapped up quite tight in tight that the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https can plainly be distinguished in most cases pillar is put up few stones laid round or the outline of grave drawn on the spot where the body has lain to under go this operation the body is then removed to the burial ground and laid most reverently in the grave beluch m esjid and g ravey ard at d albandin beluch graves are most peculiarly cut into the ground instead of being vertical like ours they are in three sections the higher is vertical and leads to an inclined side channel giving access to lower last chamber in which the body is actually deposited the origin of this i was told is to prevent hyenas and wolves digging up the bodies section of b eluch g rave when once the body is laid in its place of rest dried rose leaves are spread over it in profusion and then the grave is ﬁlled up with stones and plastered with mud the channel between the two chambers is ﬁlled entirely with stones and the upper chamber entirely with earth some few of the graves i saw had fallen through but most were in excellent preservation and appeared to be well looked after by the people that the beluch are provident people we had palpable proof in this cemetery where one saw several graves ready likely future occupants another mesjid circular one seven feet in diameter was further to be noticed to the of the graveyard it had yellow marble pillars of sugar and cylindrical shapes and was enclosed by neat stone wall beluch marriage is practical business transaction by which girl fetches more or less money camels or

resemblance to the usual mussulman form such we have seen in persia with variations and adaptations to suit the customs and circumstances of the people good wife costs lot of money in beluchistan although occasionally in such cases when man has been murdered wife can be obtained on the cheap the murderer instead of paying lump sum in cash settles his account by hand ing over his daughter wife to the murdered man son bad debts and assets can also be settled in similar manner if the debtor has sufﬁcient daughters to make the balance right under normal circumstances however the girl is actually bought up the sum becoming her property in case of divorce when the marriage ceremony takes place and the relations and friends have collected the ﬁrst step is the bridegr oom to hand over the purchase sum either in cash camels or sheep great meal is then prepared when the men sit in semicircle with the bridegroom in the centre enormous quantities of food are consumed such rice saturated with ghi butter piles of chapatis bread and sheep meat man who pays four or ﬁve hundred rupees wife is expected to kill at least twenty or thirty sheep his guests at this entertainment and there is prevailing custom that the bridegroom on this occasion makes gift to the lori or blacksmith of the clothes he has been wearing since his betrothal to the girl the women on their side have similar sort of entertainment by themselves stuff themselves with food to their hearts content and wash it down with water or tea at the end of the meal bowl is passed round and each man and woman rinses mouth and hands the sung or betrothal is regarded most sacred and much rejoicing is gone through several days with music and dancing and ﬁring of guns and this is called the nikkar just preceding the urus or actual marriage ceremony which is performed by mullah the bridegroom having ridden with his friends to neighbouring ziarat to implore allah protection returns and sits down in the centre of the circle formed by the men two of his friends are sent to fetch the girl father who is led down to the assembly the bridegroom again assures him in front of all these witnesses that should he from any fault of his own divorce his wife he will forfeit the premium paid her whereupon the father replies that the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor

through and the mullah asks the woman three times if she agrees to marry the man everything having passed off satisfactorily the happy couple depart to hut or tent placed at their disposal and very discreetly nobody goes near them some considerable length of time it is said that the thoughtfulness of the beluch towards couple will go so far that even if the tribe were stalked by the enemy one would go and warn the happy couple fear of disturbing them the bridegroom stays with his bride several days and if he belongs to some other village or encampment will then return to his home and leave his wife behind months at time beluch wives are said to be quite faithful and at the death of the husband go considerable time without washing this mark of respect the husband is however extensive ly

dak camels i was enabled to remain here one day by sending my own camels with loads ahead i proposing to catch them up by going three marches on january 27th the distance was 54 miles 980 yards and i covered it in nine hours which was quite good going sand mounts and high hill ranges were to the north and south and the track lay with parallel sand ridges to the north three long sand banks from 30 to 50 feet high facing north accumulated by wind coming through gaps in the hills to south high mountains one approaches karodak that is the only entry i ﬁnd in my the march between dalbandin and karodak 16 miles 380 yards here the camel that had been sent ahead to ride to the next house had unluckily bolted and after wasting nearly an hour the beluch were unable to capture him i bade to the jemadar and his men who had politely escorted thus far and had to continue upon the same camel at karodak feet there was small thana surrounded by sand hills with high tamarisks and good grazing camels but the water of the wells was salt we trotted along in terriﬁc wind storm with yellowish dust obscuring everything like fog and went over numerous big stretches of mud and salt cracked by the sun in semic ircles like the scales of ﬁsh low hills could now be perceived to north south and east when the wind slightly abated and the dust settled down after crossing sand ridge extending from north to south we still going another large salt plain disclosed itself before us the old track went from this point towards the south but the new one was in perfectly straight line the ﬁrst time since entering beluchistan one began to see some little vegetation on the hill sides and few high tamarisks could be noticed in the plain itself at yadgar altitude feet we found thana with one duffadar four sepoys ﬁve mari camels and three wells of good water well new bungalow but i only remained just few minutes to change my belongings from captain are camel to mine which was waiting here and speedily proceeded padag where in terrible wind which had risen again after sunset i arrived at eight in the evening at padag feet number of beluch huts 4 to 5 feet high with domes thatched with tamarisk and palm leaves were to be seen most dwellings were in couples enclosed in circular wall protection against the wind well from the observation of intruders although cold wind was blowing ﬁercely at the time and the thermometer was only four degrees above freezing point there were some twenty children playing about perfectly naked and they seemed quite happy and comfortable from padag we went across another plain of salt and mud with sorag grass and drog two plants much cherished by camels to the north of our track was an extensive surface of salt deposits extending from west to east which looked just if the country were covered by snow quantities of eshwerk pretty to look at when in ﬂower but most now found and brug good horses there were three parallel ranges of mountains on our south and lots of tamarisks on the south edge of the salt deposits it was rather curious that to the north of our track the vegetation consisted entirely of drog grass whereas to the south there was only eshwerk few yards from the track to the south we came upon graveyard kabistan with some ﬁfteen or twenty graves water we had seen ﬂowing in two or three channels from the mountain to supply villages and forming pools here and there we passed between two mountains into another plain with dried up karankosh bushes much liked by camels good grazing horses was to be found north and

150 yards it was freezing hard thermometer fahrenheit and the wind bitterly cold my men felt it very much and so did my camels which all became we left mall again very early the following morning i intended to proceed direct to nushki there were two tracks here to nushki the old and the new the old track went in straight line and was in consequence some miles shorter the new track more or less follows the foot of the mountain range probably taking this course the convenience of the several beluch villages to be found in the nushki plain the rocky mountain range to the south got lower we approached nushki and was then crossed by another low range extending from north to south while the longer and higher range stretched from to few miles from nushki we came across some most peculiar and very deep cracks in the earth crust one could plainly see that they were not caused by the erosion of water but by commotion such an earthquake in fact we came soon after to place where the whole sandy plateau had actually collapsed and when we stood on the edge of the portion which still remained unchanged we could see it end abruptly in perpendicular cliffs what was the evident continuation of the valley lay now some hundred or more feet below its former level in this lower valley there were number of beluch villages this crack and depression extends less than 120 miles according to major macmahon who in 1896 went i believe along its entire length into afghan territory and he describes it deﬁned broad line of deep indentation s in places clearly deﬁned deep railway cutting springs of water are to be found along its course the crack extends north from nushki along the foot of the sarlat range and then diagonally across the khwajah amran range cutting the crest of the main range near its highest peak and crossing the lora river ked indentation was traceable at the edge of the plain near mur ghachaman some 18 miles north of chaman macmahon states that the beluch themselves attribute it to three different earthquakes of which accounts have been handed down by their fathers and at the time of which deep ﬁssures appeared that have subsequently extended major macmahon adds that this crack marks the line of gigantic geological fault with sedimentary rocks to the east of it and igneous rocks to the west and he believes rightly i think that the length of this fault line exceeds that of any other fault line yet discovered on the upper plateau on which we travelled tamarisks altogether disappeared the last twenty miles or so and tagaz shrubs varying from one to six feet high were practically the only plant we saw in the underlying plain tamarisk was most plentiful facing us on the mountain side white cliff could be seen from long distance with most regular row of double black marks which looked exactly like windows on approaching nushki we saw some patches of cultivation wheat novelty to us being the ﬁrst crops of any extent we had seen since

to the the population of these villages is formed of the tribes called barechis and rashkhanis the people of badini and jumaldini being entirely rashkhanis the barechis formerly inhabited afghanistan but migrated to the nushki district three generations ago bagag is village generally inhabited by mandais branch of the jumaldini rashkhanis two big villages are to be found south and they are called batto which means mixture owing to the populations being composed of rashkhanis mingals samalaris kharanis and other minor tribes and south of batto are two more villages east and west respectively of each other the one east is harunis separate tribe from either the rashkhanis and the mingals who follow the head chief rind the second village west is ahmed val inhabited by ahmed zai mingals besides these villages the remainder of the population is of nomads it may have been noticed that regarding the village of bagag i said that generally it was inhabited by mandais certain villages are inhabit ed by certain tribes during the summer the people migrating the winter months and other tribes come in the winter and vacate their quarters in the summer the beluch is not much burdened with furniture and can this without inconvenience the crops grown consist of wheat barley and jowari millet where good grazing is obtainable the younger folks are sent out with sheep horses and camels almost each tribe has different style of architecture its dwellings those near nushki are usually rectangular in shape domed over with matting covered with plaster the only opening is the door with small porch over it woode n pillars are necessary to support the central portion of the dome which is never higher than from ﬁve to eight feet the mangers the horses which form an annexe to each fact these

principal articles of furniture one inside but outside the houses the illustration shows how the cloth and threads are kept in tension from every side in primitive but most ef fective manner the women work with extraordinary rapidity and with pattern before them beating each transverse thread home by means of an iron comb held in the hand the pattern on the cloths is of primitive kind generally sets of parallel lines crossing one another at right angles in the same photograph two beluch dwellings can be seen with matting showing through the thatch in many villages however the walls of the houses are made of bricks and only the roof is made of mat plastered over with mud in either case the beluch seems to have liking crawling rather than walking into his house the doorway is invariably very to 5 feet high one is generally sorry to peep into beluch dwelling but i felt it sort of duty to see what there was to be seen nothing or almost nothing large wooden bowl stone grinding wheel with wooden handle to grind wheat into ﬂour wooden drinking cup or an occasional tin enamelled one of foreign importation matchlock and that was all in some of the smarter dwellings such the houses of chiefs few additional articles were to be found such badni sort of jar taking stones which are made red hot baking bread some occasional big brass tash on grand wedding dinners and deg or two or lar

hut small table is to be seen on which are placed all the family clothing blankets darris or carpets and lihaf or mattresses these carpets or rather rugs are generally spread when receiving an honoured guest the beluch diet is wholesome but simple they are fond of plenty of meat when they can get it which is not often and they generally have to be satisﬁed with dry bread the woman who can make the largest and thinnest bread is much honoured among the beluch when they obtain meat it is generally boiled and made into soup called which in the brahui language really means salt water to express ﬂavoured water milk and ghi are dainties seldom indulged in and being mussulmans the beluch imbibe intoxicants but are smokers of strong bitter tobacco it is not uncommon lambs sheep and calves to share the homes and some of the meals of their masters perhaps the most peculiar folks at nushki are the cave dwellers who live in abject misery in holes eroded by water in the cliffs near the river when i visited them most were naked and trembling with cold few rags answered the purpose of blankets the only articles of furniture and comfort were primitive pipe moulded out of chilam or the gaddu it is called by the which occupied prominent place in the dwelling and musical instrument placed in receptacle in the wall of the cave at the entrance of the cave wall had been built protection against the wind and water in another dwelling an assah or long iron rod like crutch the emblem of fakirs was noticeable and by its side an empty tin with wire attached to article which was made to answer to great many uses this cave had small store place food drinking cup and the wooden emblem of which charitable people deposit money the support of these poor wretches the dress of the better class beluch men consists of khuss or sort of loose shirt reaching below the knees and the enormous trousers falling in ample folds but ﬁtting tight at the ankle at an angle on the head they wear conical padded cap embroidered in gold or silver inside great turban of white muslin they also wear shawls or long scarves thrown over the shoulders in fashion not unlike our highlanders either shoes with toes are worn or else sandals felt coats or are donned in winter while the richer people wear handsome coats and waistcoats of cloth embroidered in gold or silver the chiefs possess most beautiful and expensive clothes the women of the poorer classes are garbed in short petticoat usually red or blue and loose shirt long cloth not unlike chudder is thrown over the head and is kept tight round the forehead by band it is fashionable to let it drag on the ground behind women generally go about barefooted better class ladies wear similar clothes but of better material and often richly embroidered occasionally they put on large trousers like persian women the hair is either left to ﬂow loose at the sides of the head or is tied into knot behind necklaces bracel ets and armlets are worn white shells of all sizes from the persian gulf well glass beads playing very important part in women ornaments bracelets cut out of lar ge white are common beluch children are rather quaint with little skull caps much decorated with silver coins one of which larger than the others hangs directly over the forehead the poor little mites are further burdened with bracelets and heavy necklaces of glass beads mothers seem tenderly fond of their children i was much delighted on the morning of january 29th to ﬁnd that all the chiefs of the neighbouring tribes garbed in their gaudy robes had come with their retinues to pay their salaams to i heard the buzzing noise of crowd approaching up the hill and on looking out of the bungalow window beheld most picturesque sight tall ﬁgure in brilliant long gown of red velvet with gold embroideries in front and back walked slowly followed by cluster of venerable old men some in long yellow skin poshteens others in smart waistcoats covered with gold and silver embroidery all wore huge turbans with gold embroidered conical caps inside behind them came mass of armed men with swords and riﬂes on reaching the bungalow fearing that i should still be asleep they became silent and i watched them unseen from behind the blinds i not believe that i have ever in my life gazed upon such ﬁne digniﬁed manly lot of fellows anywhere they seated themselves in perfect circle some twenty yards in diameter directly outsid the bungalow carpets having been spread where the chiefs were to be accommodated the chiefs sat together and the soldiers and guns matchlocks and snider riﬂes squatted down in two semicircles at their the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https opening was left large enough to enter the ring and when i approached all respectfully rose and salaamed and the chiefs coming forward in turn shook heartily by the hand with the usual long beluch salutation each bowing low he did so sitting in the centre of the circle on carpet which had been spread i addressed them in few words which they seemed to appreciate and each chief answered back in simple straightforward and most thoughtful gentlemanly manner mahommed ali the leading chief in red velvet coat was the mingal sardar of the three powerful tribes jumaldini badini and mingal and by his side sat kaim khan with his shield and sword the second sardar of the neighbourhood and brother of the jumaldini sardar jan beg who sat on the left hand side of the chief sardar was thin tall man and alam khan splendid old fellow with ﬁne inlaid sword can be seen standing in the photograph reproduced in the illustration the last of the principal ﬁve badini chiefs was comparatively young man of black complexion long jet black curly hair and garbed in gaudy poshteen sword and belt his name was kasin khan then there was kadar bakhsh uncle of the present mingal sardar man most useful to the british government and beside him his brother attar khan gauher khan nephew of the mingal sardar was picturesque young man with heavily embroidered black coat and black turban he carried his sword in his hand one looked round the circle it was really most impressive and picturesque of all sorts dazzling in the sunlight among the other most important men were adal khan cousin of the badini chief very old fellow curved from age and bai khan his cousin who looked somewhat stronger kaiser khan smart young fellow with curly hair black coat and trousers was the son of the jumaldini chief and young fellow of weak constitution by name abdullah aziz was son and heir of the badini sardar b adini s ardar the s alaam of the b eluch s ardars at n ushki sardar alam khan standing sherdil and mehrullah khan with elaborately embroidered coats and snider riﬂes sat among the elect and the others were soldiers and followers but ﬁne lot of fellows indeed all the same when the formal reception broke up i showed them my repeating riﬂes revolvers and various instruments which interested them greatly and the leading chiefs having been entertained to tea they eventually departed after repeated salaams although the beluch and the afghan shake hands on arrival they seldom so on departing the handshake being them an outward sign to express the joy of seeing friend on surveying the neighbourhood from our high point of vantage at the bungalow we found plenty to interest the observer to the north and directly below the hill could be seen graveyard in two sections the tombs being very high above ground with prismatic tops of white stones whereas the bases were of black pebbles the tombs in the graveyard to the were in bad preservation there was at this spot well known ziarat called kwajah mahommed and the british government has given much pleasure to the natives by sanctioning muﬁ or remission of revenue ever of all the land belonging to this ziarat in order to provide the support of it the people of the district are extremely religious and they have erected mesjids and ziarats on every possible hill in the neighbourhood the most interesting is the ziarat which has curious legend of its own they say that when the arabs attacked ein he killed all his enemies by merely praying to god with their heads which suddenly turned into solid stone he built the ziarat the tomb is made in fact of round stones some of enormous size evidently worn into that shape by water but the natives ﬁrmly believe that they are petriﬁed heads of arabs the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by

country of sand far the eye can see to the south of the bungalow is hill range stretchi ng from to west and suddenly broken by the valley through which runs the stream which then proceeding along the nushki plain from east to west turns in graceful curve round the western side of the hill on which the bungalow is situated and proceeds across the desert in direction where having supplied several villages and irrigated their ﬁelds it eventually exhausts itself in the desert broad river bed can be noticed on the east side of and parallel with the above hill range the east side of these hills has been much worn by water action so much so that actual holes and caves in the soft strata of sand and gravel have been corroded by the water and these holes we have seen are now inhabited by destitute beluch chapter xl the fast growing city of and nushki trade projected great future an extension to sistan routes railway to nushki to curious ateng mountain fast of chiltan and takatu gurghena huts and illages let us take walk through the fast growing city of nushki half dozen years ago there was next to nothing here but now we have beautiful tashil large walled enclosure with portico all round inside and circular towers at the four corners the actual tashil ofﬁce occupying the corner has most appearance with handsome iron clocks that mark each different time but look most imposing all the same and folded in two and carefully arranged in piles upon the ﬂoor by the side of clerks squatting in their midst the tashildar himself sardar mahommed yuzaf khan popalzai is much respected man of afghan birth of the bamezi popalzai durran is or descendants of the tribe reigning in cabul before mahommed zeis took the throne when his ancestors and the saddo zeis were forcibly banished from the country the n ew c ity of n ushki overlooking the tashil buildings the tashildar most intelligent ofﬁce r seems to understand the beluch chiefs thoroughly treats them with extreme private life dealing with them honoured guests and politically government subjects who must adhere to their loyalty to the king there are also within the tashil wall post and telegraph ofﬁce and treasury neat little red brick building with strong iron gates and huge padlocks prisons are on either side of the treasury so that one single sentry may keep an eye on both the prisoners and the local government funds when i visited the place an old man in chains was squatting in the sun outside his cell i inquired what crime he had committed his daughter they said was betrothed to young man and at the time appointed the marriage the old man did not bring the girl to the bridegroom stipulated he had consequently already been here in prison two months to pay his folly and would possibly have to remain some months longer according to beluch is in force such crime deserves severe punishment another cattle most hideously criminal head priso ners were very well cared had nice clean cells given them and were provided with plenty of food and blankets the tashil establishment consisted of one tashildar one sarishtedar clerk who reads papers one judicial moharrir one kanungo revenue clerk three patwaris one accountant in treasury and one treasurer one chaprassi one petition writer one levy moonshee one post and telegraph master one postman one hospital assistant one compounder three servants next to the tashil was the thana and with police thanedar one sergeant and nine punjab constables well levy jemadar with one duffadar and ten sawars there is practical little hospital at nushki with eight beds and dispensary but the health of the place seemed very good and there were patients when i visited it moreover it seems that the beluch prefer to be given medicine and remain in their dwellings except in cases of very severe illness the principal ailments from which they suffer are measles and scurvy which in various stages is most prevalent among the beluch chest complaints are unknown among them while they live out in the open air but when they are forcibly conﬁned to rooms instance prisoners they generally die of pneumonia or develop consumption two caravanserais are found at nushk i one traders from sistan and one caravans from quetta and mosque so that the place is quite little the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https front of the hospital one is rather staggered by ﬁnding an actual tennis court laid down according to the most precise rules and doubt in course of time we may expect golf links and tournaments which will mark further steps towards the anglicisation of that district but personally i was more interested in the local bazaar counting already 150 shops the nushki bazaar is along wide road kept tidy and clean and the place boasts of butcher washerman one tailor marked by smal lpox and one who is not ghi merchants with large round casks outside their doors cloth merchants blacksmiths and grain shops in back indeed nushki boasts already of two streets parallel with the main red ﬂag hoisted over the premises is an eating restaurant natives the merchants are mostly hindoos from sind jemadar and l evies n ushki g iant b eluch r ecruit chaman the land on which the shops have been built has practically been given free by the government on condition that if required back again at future date the builder of the house upon the land reclaimed is entitled an indemnity only to the restitution of the wood employed in the construction of the chief item of expense in nushki constructions cotton goods blue red and white seem to command the greatest sale of any articles in nushki after which the local trade consists of wheat almonds barley carpets from sistan wool kanawes cloth from meshed and cloths imported from england mostly cheap cottons camels dates etc the transit trade of nushki is however very considerable the government returns of the trade that passed through nushki during the year from april 1900 to april 1901 showed an aggregate of against 1 the preceding twelve months while two years before 1899 the returns barely amounted to last year 1901 the trade returns made further jump upwards in the nine months from april to the end of december 1901 the imports amounting to and the exports or an aggregate of which is very satisfactory indeed so much has been written of late about nushki especially in connection with the new railway that i have very little to add i most certainly think that strategically and commercially nushki is bound to become very important centre and far trade goes eventually to supplant quetta altogether owing to its more convenient position the projected railway from quetta to nushki will be great boon to caravans both from afghanistan and persia because the severe cold of quetta makes it very difﬁcult camels to proceed there in winter and camel drivers have great objection to taking their animals there any one looking ahead at the future and not so much at the present it seems however almost pity that the newly sanctioned railway should not join nushki with shikarpur or sibi instead of quetta which would have avoided great and apparently almost useless detour nushki will be found to develop so fast and so greatly that sooner or later it will have to be connected in more direct line with more important trading centres than quetta quetta is not trading centre of any importance and is merely military station leading nowhere into british territory in direct line however even the railway is better than nothing and will certainly have beneﬁcial effect upon the country it will pass through from military point of view the railway far nushki only is practically useless it is only distance of some ninety odd miles through good country with plenty of water and some grazing in england one reads in the papers and hears people talk of this railway the railway and people seem to be under the impression that nushki is on the persian border it should be clearly understood that from nushki to sistan sher the distance through practically desert country and scanty water is over 500 miles to my mind it is in the portion the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https distance where travelling is difﬁcu lt and troops almost impossible that railway is mostly needed i have gone to much trouble and risked boring the reader to give all the differential altitudes upon the portion of the road between robat and nushki and it will be seen that hardly anywhere does the track rise suddenly to more than 50 or 100 feet at most the ground could easily be made solid enough to lay line upon tanks the water supply might be established at various stations and railway could be built with trouble and comparatively small expense again the trade of southern persia robat would i think be fairly good terminus on the beluch frontier but in order to compete with russia in sistan and khorassan it would be very good thing if the government could enter into an arrangement with afghanistan so that if such railway were built it should strike from dalbandin across the desert up to the southern bank of the halmund and have in sistan its terminus this would away almost altogether in small the difﬁculty of the water and would shorten the distance by at least one quarter the idea one often hears that it would be dangerous to construct such railway because it would be to open passage russia into india is too ridiculous to be argued about it might be pointed out that the russians on their side seem not to reciprocate the fear of our invading their country they are pushing their railways from the north far they can towards the persian frontier and it is stated that concession has been obtained by them railway line to meshed but either via robat or the halmund the principal point is that if we not wish to lose southern persia we must push the railway with the utmost speed at least far the frontier anything in such case is better than nothing and most undoubtedly telegraph line should be established without far the consulate matters are much more urgent than we in england think and if warning is not taken we shall only have ourselves to blame the consequences from nushki i went to great extent along the line which is to be followed by the future railway it seemed very sensibly traced avoiding expensive difﬁculties such tunnels much possible but of course this railway has to go over good portion of mountainous country and can not be built on the cheap the t rack between n ushki and k ishingi i left nushki on the 31st following limpid stream of water and we began ascent of the mountains before us to the east leaving behind to the in valley large camp of railway engineers and surveyors after some two miles we reached broad valley and we continued to rise until we had reached the pass feet on the other side we descended only 75 feet to plateau with hill ranges rising on it and barrier of higher mountains behind the vegetation here was quite different from anything we had met in the desert and kotor was plant the beluch say eaten by animal tamarisk seemed to is wonderful plant that ﬂourishes almost everywhere the plain was subdivided into three in the ﬁrst portion four miles wide and one broad the monguli shrub was abundant and like the kotor was pronounced useless plant despised by all beasts in the second plain we found more kotor and in the lot of tamarisk the ground was cut about by numerous dry water and after very easy march of some eleven miles we came to the bungalow of kishingi having ascended from feet at the nushki tashil to feet at the kishingi we had seen great many white pillar posts indicating the line of the future railroad we had now quite different type of and very nice too the two rooms being comfortably enough furnished caravanserai was attached to the bungalow still going east we crossed another narrow valley through which the railway was traced and after going over pass feet we were in valley with lot of johr growing upon plant which the beluch say is deadly to man and beast alike on the top of the pass we saw mesjid and several more were found on descending on the other side well graveyard curious white mesjid was to be seen here shaped like an 8 and erected on the site where beluch had been killed conical mountain to the south the mudonek ateng was famous my camel driver told because beluch fakir is said to have remained on the top of it 25 days without food or water small stone shelter could be seen on the top of the mountain which they say had been the fakir abode during his long fast there is very little of special interest on this part of the route near quetta we rose several miles to higher pass feet and were then on higher ﬂat plateau with high range stretching across it from to west one attention was at once drawn to the by two renowned peaks in british beluchistan the chiltan and further off the takatu mount at their foot on the other side lay quetta in front of these we had the hilti range stretching to ending in mount barag on the north and the two askhan hills this part seemed more populated and we left to the east the tribe of gurghena comprising four villages at intervals of about one mile from one another the last was situated in the wide valley the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https west of the hilti range other villag es could be seen further in the valley extending towards the south which were supplied with water by river ﬂowing along the valley few ghedan or low grass huts were scattered about the valley and some black tents 5½ feet high with one side raised like an awning by means of sticks pen sheep was erected near them with tamarisk branches and sticks we were very thirsty and went to one of these tents the woman who occupied it gave us some water but although in abject poverty angrily refused to accept silver coin in payment saying that beluch can not be paid hospitality water costs nothing god gives water all the people alike and if they were to accept payment misfortune would fall upon them further on we passed the village of paden with cultivation all round and plenty of water the chief had quite an imposing residence with tower and castellated entrance gate and the characteristic cylindrical mangers horses in front of his dwelling but although more elaborate even this house largest i had absolutely devoid of windows except to the east of the tower which i think was more defensive purposes than ventilation sake the village of kardegap was seen next and we arrived at morad khan kella feet four miles from our last camp chapter xli morad khan horrors of high where the railway will be ﬁne old tamarisk turned into like versus kandahar we butcher foreign and horse fair and durbar at in ﬁrst death of faithful lawah end there was ruined fort at morad khan kella and half mile off beluch village with two towers each house had separating wall extending outwardly the beluch is wretched if he is not secluded the ﬁrst thing he ever wants to know is the exact extent of his property then he is quite happy and can live at peace with his neighbours folks live more outside their houses than indoors i suppose such demarcation of property is necessary moreover people and beasts live in friendly intercourse and doubt the beasts which may be the cherished pets of one man may be just the reverse to his neighbours the houses were rectangular and plastered over with mud the people here were not quite so friendly in other villages and one began to feel the effects of nearing civilisation somebody too had been at this people with camera before i hardly had time to take mine out of its case before the whole population which had collected around stampeded in all directions in the utmost confusion only little the mother dropped in the left behind and he was quaint little fellow clad in long coloured gown and picturesque red hood we left morad khan kella feet again on february 2nd along the vast plain which is to be crossed by the future railway from north to south on nearing the killi range we came again to some high sand dunes rising in gentle gradient to 250 feet their lowest point being to the north the highest to the south the plain itself on which we were travelling stretching from to rose gradually to feet on undulating ground with number of sand hills seven high long dunes and some minor ones we then came to ﬂat plain slanting northwards and with high sand accumulati ons to the south near the hill range rivulet of salt water losing itself in the sand was found next and then we had to cross pass feet one obtained beautiful view of the mustang mountains to the with two plains intersected by high mountain range between us and them there were three tracks from this pass one called the mustang track the other the tiri road and one on which we were travelling to kanak the very high peak could be seen in the distance to the the railway will here follow the river which coming from mustang ﬂows to panchepoy then the line will proceed through the gorge in the mountains to the west some few miles from kanak at the entrance of this gorge were curious cuts in the sand evidently caused by water tamarisk was most luxuriant here taleri k anak the new type of rest house between nushki and quetta small graveyard and ziarat formed by much contorted centenarian tamarisk tree of abnormal proportions were also to be seen here the branches had been twisted to form low doorway leading to huge grave in the centre of the enclosing oval formed by the old tree and some other smaller ones large round stones well palm leaves brooms and various implements had been deposited on the grave while suspended to the tree branches over the doorway hung brass and tassels from camel the project gutenberg ebook of across coveted lands by henry savage landor https that day we had come across great many mesjids either single or in sets of three and several other ziarats of special importance in the valley of kanak there were number of beluch towns and villages two at the foot of the shalkot mountain and one in each valley to the south of the track we made our last halt at the ike bungalow of kanak comfortable large black wood verandah with tiny dwelling in the centre whitewashed walls and corrugated iron roof the man who built it was apparently more of mechanical engineer than an architect and every detail is carried out on some highly scientiﬁc principle which impressed one much after the less elaborate but very practical abodes we had inhabited further east here there was gate suspended on long iron rods besides the usual hinges each screw had bolt at the end and on proceeding inside the ceiling was supported on very neat but most wooden bars thicker than three inches most ingenious theory of angles kept up the heavy roof it did heaven only knows in contrast to the other bungalows where we had glass at all here we had glass everywhere one bedroom door was made of the most transparent panes of glass that could be got and so were the two doors of the one leading directly on to the outside verandah the boards of the ﬂoor had shrunk and between the interstices one got view of what went on in the underlying room great deal of space and expense has been devoted to outer show and scientiﬁc detail whereas the rooms were small and unfortunate was the man who tried to occupy the upper room when ﬁre had been lighted in the chimney of the room below the bungalow was however comfortably furnished and from its spacious verandah af forded most magniﬁcent view all round the high chiltan mountains above shalkot were on one side and various picturesque hill ranges stretched across the lar ge plane dotted with beluch village here and there in front of the entrance gate at the bungalow nice pool of water reﬂected in its more or less limpid waters the images of over leaﬂess trees the h orse f air at s ibi b eluchist an whatever remarks one may make about the construction of the bungalow it must be confessed that it photographed well see illustration facing page 438 the altitude of kanak was feet we made an early start on this our last march steering between the handsome takatu mountain and the chiltan between which quetta lies we met number of afghan women in long loose black gowns from neck to foot and silver ornaments round the neck and arms they had austere but handsome features with expressive eyes about six miles from quetta we struck the wide kandahar road at the foot of the takatu mountain from this point we got the ﬁrst glimpse of shalkot or quetta quetta is the english corruption abbreviation or adaptation if you please of the word shalkot one almost wished one could have trembled when one stopped moment to read the ﬁrst notice in english on approaching the town warning of the dreadful things that would happen to any one entering the town carrying camera or found sketching or taking notes it came on to snow we approached the place and shortly after sunset my caravan entered the neat roads of quetta and behold joy heard the ﬁrst time since august last the whistle of railway engine this was on february 3rd i met with unbounded civility and hospitality from everybody in quetta well at chaman our most point on the afghan boundary those who believe in the unpreparedness of england it may be stated that from this point we could with ease lay railroad to kandahar in less than three weeks most charming invitation from the honourable the agent to the governor and chief commissioner in beluchistan yate took almost directly to sibi where the annual horse show and beluch durbar were to take place great many animals were exhibited some very good indeed camel horse and cow races enlivened the show and very weird representation of beluch raid was performed with much entrain at the durbar the leading chiefs were presented by yate with handsome gold and silver embroidered coats waistcoats scarves and turbans and the scene was very impressive one could not help again being struck by the digniﬁed manly behaviour of the beluch on one side and their frank respect the british ofﬁcers respect indeed ﬁner set of men in every way than our political
