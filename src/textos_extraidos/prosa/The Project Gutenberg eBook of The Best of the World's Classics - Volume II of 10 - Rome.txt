god he should the same day if possible go round the farm if not the same day he should so the day after on seeing how the farm is being cultivated and what work has been done or left undone he should call his steward and inquire his account of what work has been done and what remains to be done he should ask whether the work has been completed in good time and whether what is left uncompleted can be ﬁnished he should ﬁnd what wine has been made and what wheat stored when 3 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume ii of 10 rome https has gone into these particulars he should ask an account of the days spent in accomplishing the work if the work does not seem satisfactory and the steward should excuse himself by declaring that he has done his best that the slaves were good nothing that the weather was bad that some slaves had run away that he himself had been called off on public service and should allege other such excuses he should still be strictly called to account he should be asked if on rainy or tempestuous days he had seen that indoor operations had been carried on had the been scoured and lined with pitch had the been done had the grain been taken from the to the granary had manure been thrown from the stables and and piled into heaps had the seed been winnowed had any rope been made had the old rope been repaired and had he seen that the slaves mended their coats and caps he should be reminded that on religious festivals old ditches might have been cleared out the public road mended briers cut down the garden dug over the meadow cleared the trees trimmed thorns pulled up by the roots the grain ground and general clearing up carried through he should also be told that when slaves were sick their rations should be cut down when the matters have been settled to the master satisfaction he should take measures to see that what has not been done be at once accomplished he should then proceed to consider the account of the farm and consideration of the amount of grain which has been prepared fodder he should have returns made of wine and and learn how much has been consumed how much sold how much is left over and may be put on sale if there is deﬁcit any year he should order it to be made up from the outside and whatever is above the needs of the farm sold if there is anything to let out on contract he should order this to be done and concerning the work which he wishes to be thus accomplished he should give his order in writing regards the cattle he should order them to be sold by auction and in the same way should sell the oil if the price of oil has risen likewise the superﬂuous wine and corn of the estate he should also order to be sold bulls blemished cattle blemished sheep wool hides any plow that is old old tools old slaves slaves who are diseased or anything else which is useless the owner of farm must be seller and not purchaser the owner of farm and of slaves must begin to study in early manhood the cultivation and sowing of the land he should however think long time before building his villa but not about farming his property which he should set about at once let him wait until his year and then build provided his whole property is under cultivation so build that neither the villa be disproportionately small in comparison with the farm nor the farm in comparison with the villa it behooves to have country house containing place storing and casks in such numbers that he may look forward with delight to time of scarcity and high prices and this will add not only to his wealth but to his inﬂuence and reputation he must have of the ﬁrst order that his wine may be well made when the olives have been picked let oil be at once made or it will turn out rancid recollect that every year the olives are shaken from the trees in great number by violent storms if you gather them up quickly and have vessels ready to receive them the storm will have done them harm and the oil will be all the greener and better if the olives be on the ground or even on the barn ﬂoor too long the oil made from them will be fetid will be always good and sweet if it be promptly made the following are the duties of steward he must maintain strict discipline and see that the festivals are observed while he keeps his hands off the property of neighbor let him look well to his own the slaves are to be kept from quarreling if any of them commits fault he should be punished in kindly manner the steward must see that the slaves are comfortable and suffer neithe r from cold nor hunger by keeping them busy he will prevent them from running into mischief or stealing if the steward sets his face against evil doing evil will not be done by them his master must call him to task if he let evil doing go unpunished if one slave him any service he should show gratitude that the others may be encouraged to right the steward must not be gadder or 4 5 6 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume ii of 10 rome https but must give all his attention to working the slaves and considering how best to carry out his master instructions it is at times worth while to gain wealth by commerce were it not so perilous or by usury were it equally honorable our ancestors however held and ﬁxt by law that thief should be condemned to restore double usurer quadruple we thus see how much worse they thought it citizen to be than thief again when they praised good man they praised him good farmer or good husbandman men so praised were held to have received the highest praise myself i think well of merchant man of energy and studio us of gain but it is career i have said that leads to danger and ruin however farming makes the bravest men and the sturdiest soldiers and of all sources of gain is the surest the most natural and the least invidious and those who are busy with it have the fewest bad thoughts 3 footnotes cato was rome ﬁrst thoroughly national author he is usually classed the creator of latin prose other roman authors of his time wrote in greek cato bitterly opposed greek learning declaring that when greece should give rome her literature she would

the strength of the bull or of the elephant what one has that one ought to use and whatever you you should it with all your strength what expression can be more contemptible than that of milo 5 of crotona who when he was now an old man and was looking at the exercising themselves on the course is reported to have looked at his arms and weeping over them to have said but these indeed are now dead nay foolish man not these arms so much yourself 7 1 2 3 8 9 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume ii of 10 rome https never derived your nobility from yourself but from your chest and your arms nothing of the kind did sextus ælius ever say nothing of the kind many years before did titus coruncanius nothing lately did publius crassus by whom instructions in jurisprudence were given to their fellow citizens and whose wisdom was progressive even to their latest breath the orator i fear lest he be enfeebled by old age eloquence is gift not of mind only but also of lungs and strength on the whole that melodiousness in the voice is graceful i know not how even in old age which indeed i have not lost and you see my years yet there is graceful style of eloquence in an old man unimpassioned and subdued and very often the elegant and gentle discourse of an eloquent old man wins itself hearing and if you have not yourself the power to produce this effect yet you may be able to teach it to scipio and lælius what is more delightful than old age surrounded with the studious attention of youth shall we not leave even such resource to old age to teach young men instruct them train them to every department of duty an employment indeed than which what can be more noble but my part i thought the cneius and publius scipios 6 and your two grandfathers æmilius and africanus quite happy in the attendance of noble youths nor are any preceptors of liberal accomplishments to be deemed otherwise than happy tho their strength hath fallen into old age and failed altho that very failure of strength is more frequently caused by the follies of youth than by those of old age lustful and intemperate youth transmits to old age an exhausted body cyrus too in xenophon in that discourse which he delivered on his deathbed when he was very old man said that he never felt that his old age had become feebler than his youth had been i recollect when boy that lucius metellus 7 who when four years after his second consulship he had been made pontifex maximus and years held that sacerdotal ofﬁce enjoyed such good strength at the latter period of his life that he felt want of youth there is need to speak about myself and yet that is the privilege of old age and conceded to my time of life you see how in homer nestor very often proclaims his own virtues he was now living in the third generation of men nor had he occasion to fear lest when stating the truth about himself he should appear either too arrogant or too talkative homer says from his tongue speech ﬂowed sweeter than honey which charm he stood in need of strength of body and yet the famous chief of greece nowhere wishes to have ten men like ajax but like nestor and he does not doubt if that should happen troy would in short time perish but i return to myself i am in my year in truth i should like to be able to make the same boast that cyrus did but one thing i can say that altho i have not to be sure that strength which i had either soldier in the punic war or questor in the same war or consul in spain or four years afterward when military tribune i fought battle at thermopylæ in the consulship of marcus acilius glabrio yet you see old age has not quite enfeebled or broken down the does not miss my strength nor the rostra nor my friends nor my clients nor my guests i have never agreed to that old and proverb which advises you to become an old man early if you wish to be an old man long i my part would rather be an old man shorter length of time than be an old man before i was one and therefore one yet has wished to have an interview with to whom i have been denied engaged but i have less strength than either of you two neither even you possess the strength of titus pontius the centurion is he therefore the more excellent man only let there be moderate degree of strength and let every man exert himself much he can and in truth that man will not be absorbed in regretting the want of strength milo at olympia is said to have gone over the course while supporting on his shoulders live ox whether then would you rather have this strength of body or pythagoras strength of intellect bestowed upon you in word enjoy that blessing while you have it when it is gone not lament it unless indeed young men ought to lament the loss of boyhood and those little advanced in age the loss of adolescence there is deﬁnite career in life and one way of nature and that simple one and to every part of life its own peculiar period has 10 11 12 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume ii of 10 rome https assigned so that both the feebleness of boys and the high spirit of young men and the steadiness of now ﬁxt manhood and the maturity of old age have something natural which ought to be enjoyed in their own time i suppose that you hear scipio what your grandfather host masinissa 8 is doing at this day at the age of ninety when he has commenced journey on foot he never mounts at all when on horseback he never dismounts by rain by cold is he prevailed upon to have his head covered that there is in him the greatest hardiness of frame and therefore he performs all the duties and functions of king exercise therefore and temperance even in old age can preserve some remnant of our pristine vigor is there strength in old age neither is strength exacted from old age therefore by our laws and institutions our time of life is relieved from those tasks which can not be supported without strength accordingly so far are we from being compelled to what we can not that we are not even compelled to much we can but so feeble are many old men that they can not execute any task of duty or any function of life whatever but that in truth is not the peculiar fault of old age but belongs in common to bad health how feeble was the son of publius africanus he who adopted you what feeble health or rather health at all had he and had that not been so he would have been the second luminary of the state to his paternal greatness of soul richer store of learning had been added what wonder therefor in old men if they are sometimes weak when even young men can not escape that we must make stand scipio and lælius against old age and its faults must be atoned by activity we must ﬁght it were against disease and in like manner against old age regard must be paid to health moderate exercises must be adopted so much of meat and drink must be taken that the strength may be recruited not opprest nor indeed must the body alone be supported but the mind and the soul much more these also unless you drop oil on them on lamp are extinguished by old age and our bodies indeed by weariness and exercise become opprest but our minds are rendered buoyant by exercise to those of whom cæcilius speaks foolish old men ﬁt characters comedy by these he denotes the credulous the forgetful the dissolute which are the faults not of old age but of inactive indolent drowsy old age petulance and lust belong to the young more than to the old yet not to all young men but to those who are not virtuous so that senile folly which is commonly called dotage belongs to weak old men and not to all four stout sons ﬁve daughters so great family and such numerous dependents did appius manage altho both old and blind he kept his mind intent like bow nor did he languidly sink under the weight of old age he retained not only authority but also command over his family the slaves feared him the children respected him all held him dear there prevailed in that house the manners and good discipline of our fathers on this condition is old age honored if it maintains itself if it keeps up its own right if it is subservient to one if even to its last breath it exercises control over its dependents i like young man in whom there is something of the old so i like an old man in whom there is something of the young and he who follows this maxim in body will possibly be an old man but he will never be an old man in mind i have in hand my seventh book of antiquities i am collecting all the materials of our early history of all the famous causes which i have defended i am now comp leting the pleadings 9 i am employed on law of augurs of pontif fs of citizens i am much engaged also in greek literature and after the manner of the pythagoreans the purpose of exercising my memory i call to mind in the evening what i have said heard and done on each day these are the exercises of the understanding these are the courses of the mind while i am perspiring and toiling over these i not greatly miss my strength of body i attend my friends i come into the senate very often and spontaneously bring forward things much and long thought of and i maintain them by strength of mind not of body and if i were unable to perform these duties yet my couch would afford amusement when reﬂecting on those matters which i was longer able to but that i am able is owing to my past life by person who always lives in these pursuits and labors it is not perceived when old age steals on thus gradually 13 14 15 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume ii of 10 rome https unconsciously life declines into old age nor is its thread suddenly broken but the vital principle is consumed by length of time then follows the third topic of blame against old age that they say it has pleasures oh noble privilege of age if indeed it takes from us that which is in youth the greatest defect listen most excellent youn g men to the ancient speech of archytas 10 of tarentum man eminently great and illustrious which was reported to when i young man was at tarentum with quintus maximus he said that more deadly plague than the pleasure of the body was inﬂicted on men by nature the passions greedy of that pleasure were in rash and unbridled manner incited to possess it that hence arose treasons against one country hence the ruining of states hence clandestine conferences with short that there was crime wicked act to the undertaking of which the lust of pleasure did not impe l but that fornications and adulteries and every such crime were provoked by other allurements than those of pleasure and whereas either nature or some god had given to man nothing more excellent than his mind that to this divine function and gift nothing was so hostile pleasure since where lust bore sway there was room and in the realm of pleasure virtue could by possibility exist and that this might be the better understood he begged you to imagine in your mind any one actuated by the greatest pleasure of the body that could be enjoyed he believed one would doubt but that so long the person was in that state of delight he would be able to consider nothing in his mind to attain nothing by reason nothing by reﬂection wherefore that there was nothing so detestable and so destructive pleasure inasmuch that when it was excessive and very prolonged it extinguished all the light of the soul nearchus of tarentum our host who had remained throughout in friendship with the roman people said he had heard from older men that archytas held this conversation with caius pontius the samnite the father of him by whom in the caudian 11 battle spurius postumius and titus veturius the consuls were overcome on which occasion plato the athenian had been present at that discourse and i ﬁnd that he came to tarentum in the consulship of lucius camillus and appius claudius 12 wherefore i adduce this that we may understand that if we could not by reason and wisdom despise pleasure great gratitude would be due to old age bringing it to pass that that should not be matter of pleasure which is not matter of duty pleasure is hostile to reason hinders deliberation and so to speak closes the eyes of the mind nor does it hold any intercourse with virtue i indeed acted reluctantly in expelling from the senate lucius flaminius brother of that very brave man titus flaminius 13 seven years after he had been consul but i thought that his licentiousness should be stigmatized that man when he was consul in gaul was preva iled on at banquet by courtezan to behead one of those who were in chains condemned on capital charge he escaped in the censorship of his brother titus who had immediately preceded but so proﬂigate and abandoned an act of lust could by means be allowed to pass by and flaccus since with private infamy it combined the disgrace of the empire i have often heard from my elders who said that in like manner they when boys had heard from old men that caius fabricius was wont to wonder that when he was ambassador to king pyrrhus he had heard from cineas the thessalian that there was certain person at athens who profest himself wise man and that he was accus tomed to say that all things which we did were to be referred to pleasure and that hearin g him say so manius curius and titus coruncanius were accustomed to wish that that might be the persuasion of the samnites and pyrrhus 14 himself that they might the more easily be conquered when they had given themselves up to pleasure manius curius had lived with publius decius who ﬁve years before the consulship of the former had devoted himself the commonwealth in his fourth consulship fabricius had been acquainted with him and coruncanius had also known him who well from his own conduct in life from the great action of him whom i mention publius decius judged that there was doubtless something in its own nature excellent and glorious which should be followed its own sake and which scorning and despising pleasure all the worthiest men pursued 16 17 18 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume ii of 10 rome https why i refer to others let now return to myself first of all i always had associates in clubs and clubs were established when i was questor on the idæan worship of the great mother being adopted therefore i feasted with my associates altogether in moderate way but there was kind of fervor peculiar to that time of life and that advances all things will become every day more subdued i did not calculate the gratiﬁcation of those banquets by the pleasures of the body so much by the meetings of friends and conversations well did our ancestors style the reclining of friends at an entertainment because it carried with it union of life by the name conviviu m better than the greeks who call this same thing well by the name of compotatio concœnatio so that what in that kind of pleasures is of the least value that they appear most to approve of my part on account of the pleasure of conversation i am delighted also with seasonable entertainments not only with those of my own age of whom very few survive but with those of your age and with you and i give great thanks to old age which has increased my desire conversation and taken away that of eating and drinking but even if such things delight any person that i may not appear altogether to have declared war against pleasure of which perhaps certain limited degree is even natural i am not aware that even in these pleasures themselves old age is without enjoyment my part the presidencies established by our ancestors delight and that conversation which after the manner of our ancestors is kept up over our cups from the top of the table and the cups in the symposium of xenophon small and dewy and the cooling of the wine in summer and in turn either the sun or the ﬁre in practises which i am accustomed to follow among the sabines i daily join party of neighbors which we prolong with various conversation till late at night far we can but there is not it were so ticklish sensibility of pleasures in old men i believe it but then neither is there the desire however nothing is irksome unless you long it well did sophocles when certain man inquired of him advanced in age whether he enjoyed venereal pleasures reply the gods give something better nay i have run away from them with gladness from wild and furious tyrant to men fond of such things it is perhaps disagreeable and irksome to be without them but to the contented and satisﬁed it is more delightful to want them than to enjoy them and yet he does not want who feels desire therefore i say that this freedom from desire is more delightful than enjoyment but if the prime of life has more cheerful enjoyment of those very pleasures in the ﬁrst place they are but petty objects which it enjoys i have said before then they are those of which old age if it does not abundantly possess them is not altogether destitute he is more delighted with turpio ambivius who is spectator on the foremost bench yet he also is delighted who is in the hindmost so youth having close view of pleasures is perhaps more gratiﬁed but old age is much delighted is necessary in viewing them at distance however of what high value are the following circumstances that the soul after it has served out it were its time under lust ambition contention enmities and all the passions shall retire within itself and the phrase is live with itself but if it has it were food study and learning nothing is more delightful than an old age of leisure i saw caius gallus the intimate friend of your father scipio almost expiring in the employment of calculating the sky and the earth how often did daylight overtake him when he had begun to draw some ﬁgure by night how often did night when he had begun in the morning how it did deligh t him to predict to us the eclipses of the sun and the moon long before their occurrence what shall we say in the case of pursuits less digniﬁed yet notwithstanding requiring acuteness how nævius did delight in his punic war how plautus in his truculentus how in his pseudolus i saw also the old man livy 15 who tho he had brought play upon the stage six years before i was born in the consulship of cento and tuditanus yet advanced in age even to the time of my youth why should i speak of publius licinius crassus study both of pontiﬁcal and civil law or of the present publius scipio who within these few days was created chief pontif f yet we have seen all these persons whom i have mentioned ardent in these pursuits when old men but to marcus cethegus whom ennius rightly called the marrow of 19 20 21 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume ii of 10 rome https with what great zeal did we see him engage in the practise of oratory even when an old man what pleasures therefore arising from banquets or plays or harlots are to be compared with these pleasures and these indeed are the pursuits of learning which too with the sensible and well educated increase along with their age so that is noble saying of solon when he says in certain verse i observed before that he grew old learning many things every which pleasure of the mind certai nly none can be greater i come now to the pleasures of husbandmen with which i am excessively delighted which are not checked by any old age and appear in my mind to make the nearest approach to the life of wise man they have relation to the earth which never refuses command and never returns without interest that which it hath received but sometimes with less generally with very great interest and yet my part it is not only the product but the virtue and nature of the earth itself that delight which when in its softened and subdued bosom it has received the scattered seed ﬁrst of all conﬁ nes what is hidden within it from which harrowing which produces that effect derives its name occatio then when it is warmed by heat and its own compression it spreads it out and elicits from it the verdant blade which supported by the ﬁbers of the roots gradually grows up and rising on jointed stalk is now enclosed in sheath if it were of tender age out of which when it hath shot up it then pours forth the fruit of the ear piled in due order and is guarded by rampart of beards against the pecking of the smaller birds why should i in the case of vines tell of the plantings the risings the stages of growth that you may know the repose and amusement of my old age i assure you that i can never have enough of that gratiﬁcation i pass over the peculiar nature of all things which are produced from the earth which generates such great trunks and branches from so small grain of the ﬁg or from the or from the minutest seeds of other fruits and roots shoots plants twigs quicksets layers not these produce the effect of delighting any one even to admiration the vine indeed which by nature is prone to fall and is borne down to the ground unless it be propt in order to raise itself up embraces with its tendrils it were with hands whatever it meets with which it creeps with manifold and wandering course the skill of the husbandmen pruning with the knife restrains from running into forest of twigs and spreadi ng too far in all directions accordingly in the beginning of spring in those twigs which are left there rises up it were at the joints of the branches that which is called bud from which the nascent grape shows itself which increasing in size by the moisture of the earth and the heat of the sun is at ﬁrst very acid to the taste and then it ripens grows sweet and being clothed with its large leaves does not want moderate warmth and yet keeps off the excessive heat of the sun than which what can be in fruit on the one hand more rich or on the other hand more beautiful in appearance of which not only the advantage i said before but also the cultivation and the nature itself delight the rows of props the joining of the heads the tying up and propagation of vines and the pruning of some twigs and the grafting of others which i have mentioned why should i allude to irrigations why to the diggings of the ground why to the trenching by which the ground is made much more productive why should i speak of the advantage of manuring i have treated of it in that book which i wrote respecting rural affairs concerning which the learned hesiod has not said single word tho he has written about the cultivation of the land but homer who appears to lived many ages before introduces lærtes soothing the regret which he felt his son by tilling the land and manuring it nor indeed is rural life delightful by reason of only and meadows and vineyards and groves but also its gardens and orchards also the feeding of cattle the swarms of bees and the variety of all kinds of ﬂowers nor plantings only give delight but also graftings than which agriculture has invented nothing more ingenious was then their old age to be pitied who amused themselves in the cultivation of land in my opinion indeed i know not whether any other can be more happy and not only in the dischar ge of duty because to the whole race of mankind the cultivation of the land is beneﬁcial but also from the amusement which i have mentioned and that fulness and 22 23 24 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume ii of 10 rome https of all things which are connected with the food of men and also with the worship of the gods so that since some have desire these things we may again put ourselves on good terms with pleasure the of good and diligent master is always well stored the the pantry also the whole farmhouse is richly supplied it abounds in pigs kids lambs hens milk cheese honey then too the countrymen themselves call the garden second dessert and then what gives greater relish to these things is that kind of leisure labor fowling and hunting why should i speak of the greenness of meadows or the rows of trees or the handsome appe arance of vineyards and olive grounds let cut the matter short nothing can be either more rich in use or more elegant in appearan ce than ground well tilled to the enjoyment of which old age is so far from being an obstacle that it is even an invitation and allurement where can that age be better warme d either by basking in the sun or by the ﬁre or again be more healthfully refreshed by shades or waters let the young therefore keep to themselves their arms horses spears clubs swimmings and races to us old men let them leave out of many amusements the tali and tesseræ and even in that matter it may be they please since old age can be happy without these amusements what therefore should i fear if after death i am sure either not to be miserable or to be happy altho who is so foolish even if young to be assured that he will live even till the evening nay that period of life has many more probabilities of death that ours has young men more readily fall into diseases suffer more severely are cured with more difﬁculty and therefore few arrive at old age did not this happen so we should live better and more wisely intelligence and reﬂection and judgment reside in old men and if there had been none of them states could exist at all but i return to the imminence of death what charge is that against old age since you see it to be common to youth also i experienced not only in the case of my own excellent son but also in that of your brothers scipio men plainly marked out the highest distinction that death was common to every period of life yet young man hopes that he will live long time which expectation an old man can not entertain his hope is but foolish one what can be more foolish than to regard uncer tainties certainties delusions truths an old man indeed has nothing to hope yet he is in so much the happier state than young one since he has already attained what the other is only hoping the one is wishing to live long the other has lived long and yet good gods what is there in man life that can be called long allow the latest period let us anticipate the age of the kings of tartessii there dwelt i ﬁnd it recorded man named arganthonius at gades 16 who reigned eighty years and lived but to my mind nothing whatever seems of long duration to whic h there is any end when that arrives then the time which has passed has ﬂown away that only remains which you have secured by virtue and right conduct hours indeed depart from us and days and months and years nor does past time ever return nor can it be discovered what is to follow whatever time is assigned to each to live with that he ought to be content neither need the drama be performed entire by the actor in order to give satisfaction provided he be approved in whatever act he may be nor need the wise man live till the plaudite the short period of life is long enough living well and honorably and if you should advance further you need more grieve than farmers when the loveliness of hath passed that summer and autumn have come spring represents the time of youth and gives promise of the future fruits the remaining seasons are intended plucking and gathering in those fruits now the harvest of old age i have often said is the recollection and abundance of blessings previously secured in truth everything that happe ns agreeably to nature is to be reckoned among blessings what however is so agreeabl to nature an old man to die which even is the lot of the young tho nature opposes and resists and thus it is that young men seem to to die just when the violence of ﬂame is extinguished by ﬂood of water whereas old men die the exhausted ﬁre goes out spontaneously without the exertion of any force and fruits when they are green are plucked by force from the trees but when ripe and mellow drop off so violence takes away their lives from youths maturity from old state which to indeed is so delightful that the nearer i approach to death i 25 26 27 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume ii of 10 rome https it were to be getting sight of land and at length after long voyage to be just coming into harbor of all the periods of life there is deﬁnite limit but of old age there is limit ﬁxt and life goes on very well in it so long you are able to follow up and attend to the duty of your situation and at the same time to care nothing about death whence it happens that old age is even of higher spirit and bolder than youth agreeable to this was the answer given to pisistratus 17 the tyrant by solon when on the former inquiring in reliance on what hope he so boldly withstood him the latter is said to have answered on old age the happiest end of life is the mind and the other senses being unimpaired the same nature which put it together takes asunder her own work in the case of ship or house he who built them takes them down most easily so the same nature which has compacted man most easily breaks him up besides every fastening of glue when fresh is with difﬁculty torn asunder but easily when tried by time hence it is that that short remnant of life should be neither greedily coveted nor without reason given up and pythagoras forbids us to abandon the station or post of life without the orders of our commander that is of god 18 there is indeed saying of the wise solon in which he declares that he does not wish his own death to be unattended by the grief and lamentation of friends he wishes i suppose that he should be dear to his friends but i know not whether ennius does not say with more propriety let one pay honor with tears nor celebrate my funeral with mourning he conceives that death ought not to be lamented when immortality follows besides dying man may have some degree of consciousness but that short time especially in the case of an old man after death indeed consciousness either does not exist or it is thing to be desired but this ought to be subject of study from our youth to be indifferent about death without which study one can be of tranquil mind die we certainly must and it is uncertain whether or not on this very day he therefore who at all hours dreads impending death how can he be at peace in his mind concerning which there seems to be need of such long discussion when i call to mind not only lucius brutus who was slain in liberating his country nor the two decii who spurred on their steeds to voluntary death nor marcus atilius 19 who set out to execution that he might keep promise pledged to the enemy nor the two scipios who even with their very bodies sought to obstruct the march of the carthaginians nor your grandfather lucius paulus 20 who by his death atoned the temerity of his colleague in the disgraceful defeat at cannæ nor marcus marcellus 21 whose corpse not even the most mercile ss foe suffered to go without the honor of sepulture but that our legions i have remarked in my antiquities have often gone with cheerful and undaunted mind to that place from which they believed that they should never return shall then old men be afraid of that which young men and they not only ignorant but mere peasants despise on the whole it seems to indeed satiety of all pursuits causes satiety of life there are pursuits peculiar to boyhood therefore young men regret the loss of them there are also some of early youth does settled age which is called middle life seek after these there are also some of this period neither are they looked by old age there are some ﬁnal pursuits of old age accordingly the pursuits of the earlier parts of life fall into disuse so also those of old age and when this has taken place satiety of life brings on the seasonable period of death indeed i not see why i should not venture to tell you what i myself think concerning death because i fancy i see it so much the more clearly in proportion i am less distant from it i am persuaded that your fathe rs publius scipio and caius lælius men of the greatest eminence and very dear friends of mine are living and that life too which alone deserves the name of life while we are shut up in this prison of the body we are fulﬁlling it were the function and painful task of destiny the soul has been degraded from its above and it were buried in the earth situation uncongenial to its divine and immortal nature but i believe that the immortal gods have shed souls into human bodies that beings might exist who might tend the 28 29 30 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume ii of 10 rome https and by contemplating the order of the heavenly bodies might imitate it in the manner and regularity of their lives nor have reason and argument alone inﬂuenced thus to believe but likewise the high name and authority of the greatest philos ophers i used to hear that pythagoras and the pythagoreans who were all but our neighbors who were formerly called the italian philosophers had doubt that we possess souls derived from the universal divine mind moreo ver the arguments were conclusive to which socrates delivered on the last day of his life concerning the immortality of the who was pronounced by the oracle of apollo the wisest of all men but why say more i have thus persuaded myself such is my belief that since such is the activity of our souls so tenacious their memory of things past and their sagacity regarding things future so many arts so many sciences so many discoveries that the nature which comprizes these qualities can not be mortal and since the mind is ever in action and has source of motion because it moves itself i believe that it never will ﬁnd any end of motion because it never will part from itself and that since the nature of the soul is uncompounded and has not in itself any admixture heterogeneous and dissimilar to itself i maintain that it can not under go dissolu tion and if this be not possible it can not perish and it is strong argument that men know very many things before they are born since when mere boys while they are learning difﬁcult subjects they so quickly catch up numberless ideas that they seem not to be learning them then the ﬁrst time but to remember them and to be calling them to recollection thus did our plato ar gue let if you please revert to my own views one will ever persuade that either your father paulus or two grandfathers paulus and africanus or the father of africanus or his uncle or the many distinguished men whom it is unnecessary to recount aimed at such great exploits might reach to the recollection of posterity had they not perceived in their mind that posterity belonged to them you suppose to boast little of myself after the manner of old men that i should have under gone such great toils by day and night at home and in service had i thought to limit my glory by the same bounds my life would it not have been far better to pass an easy and quiet life without any toil or struggle but i know not how my soul stretching upward has ever looked forward to posterity if when it had departed from life then at last it would begin to live and indeed unless this were the case that souls were immortal the souls of the noblest of men would not aspire above all things to an immortality of glory why need i adduce that the wisest man ever dies with the greatest equanimity the most foolish with the least does it not seem to you that the soul which sees more and further sees that it is passing to better state while that body whose vision is duller does not see it i indeed am transported with eagerness to see your fathers whom i have respected and loved nor in truth is it those only i desire to meet whom i myself have known but those also of whom i have heard or read and have myself written whither indeed i proceed one assuredly should easily force back nor they did with pelias cook again to youth if any god should grant that from this period of life i should become child again and cry in the cradle i should earnestly refuse it nor in truth should i like after having run it were my course to be called back to the from the goal what comfort has life what trouble has it not rather but grant that it has yet it assuredly has either satiety or limitation of its pleasures i am not disposed to lament the loss of life which many men and those learned men too have often done neither i regret that i have lived since i have lived in such way that i conceive i was not born in vain and from this life i depart from temporary lodging not from home nature has assigned it to us an inn to sojourn in not place of habita tion oh glorious day when i shall depart to that divine company and assemblage of spirits and quit this troubled and polluted scene i shall go not only to those great men of whom i have spoken before but also to my son cato than whom never was better man born nor more distinguished pious affection whose body was burned by whereas on the contrary it was ﬁtting that mine should be burned by him but his soul not deserting but oft looking back doubt departed to those regions whither it saw that i myself was destined to come this tho distre ss to i seemed patiently to endure not that i 31 32 33 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume ii of 10 rome https it with indifference but i comforted myself with the recollection that the separation and distance between us would not continue long these reasons scipio since you said that you with lælius were accustomed to wonder at this old age is tolerable to and not only not irksome but even delig htful and if i am wrong in this that i believe the souls of men to be immortal i willingly delude myself nor i desire that this mistake in which i take pleasure should be wrested from long i live but if i when dead shall have consciousness some philosophers imagine i not fear lest dead philosophers should ridicule this my delusion but if we are not destined to be immortal yet it is desirable thing man to expire at his ﬁt time nature prescribes boundary to all other things so does she also to life now old age is the consummation of life just of play from the fatigue of which we ought to escape especially when satiety is super this is what i had to say on the subject of old age to which may you arrive that after having experienced the truth of those statements which you have heard from you may be enabled to give them your approbation ii on the death of his daughter tullia 22 yes my dear servius i could indeed wish you had been with you say at the time of my terrible trial how much it was in your power to help if you had been here by sympathizing with and i may almost say sharing equally in my grief i readily perceive from the fact that after reading your letter i now feel myself considerably more composed not only was all that you wrote just what is best calculated to soothe afﬂiction but you yourself in comforting showed that you too had little pain at heart your son servius however has made it clear by every kindly attention which such an occasion would permit of both how great his respect was myself and also how much pleasure his kind feeling was likely to give you and you may be sure that while such attentions from him have often been more pleasant to they have never made more grateful it is not however only your arguments and your equal may almost call this afﬂiction which comforts but also your authority because i hold it shame in not to be bearing my trouble in way that you man endowed with such wisdom think it ought to be borne but at times i feel broken down and i scarcely make any struggle against my grief because those consolat ions fail which under similar calamities were never wanting to any of those other people whom i put before myself models imitation both fabius maximus example when he lost son who had held the consulship the hero of many famous exploit and lucius paulus from whom two were taken in one week and your own kinsm an gallus and marcus cato who was deprived of son of the rarest talents and the rarest these lived in times when their individual afﬂiction was capable of ﬁnding solace in the distinctions they used to earn from their country however after being stript of all those distinctions which you yourself recall to and which i had won myself by unparalleled exertions only that one solace remained which has been torn away my thoughts were not diverted by work my friends or by the administration of affairs of state there was pleasure in pleading in the courts i could not bear the very sight of the senate house i felt was indeed too true that i had lost all the harvest of both my industry and my success but whenever i wanted to recollect that all this was shared with you and other friends i could name and whenever i was breaking myself in and forcing my spirit to bear these things with patience i always had refuge to go to where i might ﬁnd peace and in whose words of comfort and sweet society i could rid of all my pains and griefs whereas now under this terrible blow even those old wounds which seemed to have healed up are bleeding 34 35 36 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume ii of 10 rome https it is impossible now to ﬁnd such refuge from my sorrows at home in the business of the state in those days i did in that consolation of home which was always in store whenever i came away sad from thoughts of state to seek peace in her happiness and so i stay away both from home and from public life because home now is more able to make up the sorrow i feel when i think of our country than our country is my sorrow at home i am therefore looking forward all the more eagerly to your coming and long to see you early may possibly be greater alleviation can be offered than meeting between us friendly intercourse and conversation i hope however that your return is to take place i hear it is very shortly myself while there are abundant reasons wanting to see you soon possible my principal one is in order that we may discuss together beforehand the best method of conduct present circumstances which must entirely be adapted to the wishes of one man only man nevertheless who is and generous and also i think i have thoroughly ascertained to not at all and to you extremely friendly but admitting this it is still matter much deliberation what is the not say of action but of keeping we ought by his good leave and favor to adopt farewell iii of brave and elevated spirits 23 spirit altogether brave and elevated is chieﬂy discernible by two characters the ﬁrst consists in low estimate of mere outward circumstances since it is convinced that man ought to admire desire or court nothing but what is virtuous and becoming and that he ought to succumb to man nor to any perturbation either of spirit or fortune the other thing is that possest of such spirit i have just mentioned you should perform actions which are great and of the greatest utility but extremely arduous full of difﬁculties and danger both to life and the many things which pertain to life in the latter of those two characters consist all the glory the majesty and i add the utility but the causes and the efﬁcient means that form great men is in the former which contains the principles that elevate the soul and gives it contempt temporary considerations now this very excellence consists in two particulars you are to deem that only to be good is to be virtuous and that you be free from all mental irregularity we are to look upon it the character of noble and an elevated soul to slight all those considerations that the generality of mankind account great and glorious and to despise them upon ﬁrm and durable principles while strength of mind and greatness of resolution are discerned in bearing those calamities which in the course of man life are many and various so not to be driven from your natural disposition nor from the dignity of wise man it is not consistent that he who is not subdued by fear should be subjugated by passion nor that he who has shown himself invincible by toil should be conquered by pleasure wherefore we ought to watch and avoid the love of money nothing so truly characterizes narrow groveling disposition to love riches and nothing is more noble and more exalted than to despise riches if you have them not and if you have them to employ them in beneﬁcence and liberality an inordinate passion glory i have already observed is likewise to be guarded against it deprives us of liberty the only prize which men of elevated sentiments ought to contend power is so far from being desirable in itself that it sometimes ought to be refused and sometimes to be resigned we should likewise be free from all disorders of the mind from all violent passion and fear well languor voluptuousness and anger that we may possess that tranquillity and security which confer alike consistency and dignity now many there are and have been who courting that tranquillity which i have mentioned here have withdrawn themselves from public affairs and taken refuge in retirement among these some of the noblest and most prominent of our philosophers 37 38 39 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume ii of 10 rome https some persons of strict and grave dispositions were unable to bear with the manners either of the people or their rulers and some have lived in the country amusing themselves with the management of their private affairs their aim was the same that of the powerful that they might enjoy their liberty without wanting anything or obeying any person the essence of liberty is to live just you please but since most persons are of opinion that the achievements of war are more glorious than civil affairs this judgment needs to be restricted many generally is the case with high minds and enterprising spirits especially if they are adapted to military life and are fond of warlike achievements have often sought opportunities of war from their fondness glory but if we are willing to judge truly many are the civil employments of greater importance and of more renown than the military tho themistocles is justly his name is now more illustrious than that of solon and his glorious victory at salamis is mentioned preferably to the policy of solon by which he ﬁrst conﬁrmed the power of the one shoul d not be considered more illustrious than the other the one availed his country only the other is lastingly advantageous because by it the laws of the athenians and the institutions of their ancestors are prese rved now themistocles could not have stated any respect in which he beneﬁted the areopagus but solon might with truth declare that themistocles had been advantaged by him the war was carried on by the counsels of that senate which was constituted by solon we may make the same observation with regard to pausanias 24 and lysander among the lacedæmonians all the addition of empire which their conquests are supposed to have brought to their country is not to be compared to the laws and economy of lycurgus indeed owing to these very causes they had armies more subordinate and courageous in my eyes marcus scauru s who ﬂourished when i was but boy was not inferior to caius marius 25 nor after i came to have concern in the government quintus catulus 26 to cneius pompey an army abroad is but of small service unless there be wise administration at home nor did that good man and great general africanus perform more important service to his country when he razed numantia than did that private citizen nasica 27 when at the same period he killed tiberius gracchus an action which it is true was not merely of civil nature it approaches to military character being the result of force and courage but it was an action performed without an army and from political considerations now all that excellence which springs from lofty and noble nature is altogether produced by the mental and not by the corporeal powers meanwhile the body ought to be kept in such action and order that it may be always ready to obey the dictates of reason and wisdom in carrying them into execution and in persevering under hardships but with regard to that honestas we are treating of it consists wholly in the thoughtful application of the mind by which the civilians who preside over public affairs are equally serviceable to their country they who wage wars it often happens that by such counsels wars are either not entered into or they are brought to termination sometimes they are even undertaken the third punic war was by the advice of marcus cato whose authority was powerful even after he was dead wisdom in determining is therefore preferable to courage in ﬁghting but in this we are to take care that we are not swayed by an aversion to ﬁghting rather than by consideration of expediency now in engaging in war we ought to make it appear that we have other view than peace but the character of brave and resolute man is not to be rufﬂed with adversity and not to be in such confusion to quit his post we say but to preserve presence of mind and the exercise of reason without departing from his purpose and while this is the characteristic of lofty spirit so this also is that of powerful intellect namely to anticipate futurity in though t and to conclude beforehand what may happen on either side and upon that what measures to pursue and never be surprized so to say i had not thought of that such are the operations of genius capacious and elevated of such one relies on its own prudence and counsel but to rush 40 41 42 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume ii of 10 rome https into the ﬁeld and to encounter an enemy with mere physical force has somewhat in it that is barbarous and brutal when the occasion however and its necessity compel it we should resist with force and prefer death to slavery or dishonor iv of scipio death and of friendship 28 should i say that i am not distrest by the loss of scipio philosophers may determine with what propriety i should so but assuredly i should be guilty of falsehood i am distrest at being bereaved of such friend one i consider will ever be to again and i can conﬁdently assert one ever was but i am not destitute of remedy i comfort myself and especially with this consolation that i am free from that error by which most men on the decease of friends are wont to be tormented i feel that evil has happened to scipio it has befallen myself if indeed it has happened to any now to be above measure distrest at one own troubles is characteristic of the man who loves not his friend but himself in truth far he is concerned who can deny that his end was glorious unless he had chosen to wish immortality of which he had not the slightest thought what did he fail to obtain which it was lawful man to wish man who soon he grew up by his transcendent merit far surpassed those sanguine hopes of his countrymen which they had conceived regarding him when mere boy who never stood the consulship yet was made consul twice on the ﬁrst occasion before his time on the second at the proper age regarded himself tho the commonwealth almost too late who by overthrowing two cities 29 most hostile to our empire put an end not only to all present but all future wars what shall i say of his most engaging manners of his dutiful conduct to his mother his generosity to his sisters his kindness to his friends his uprightness toward all these are known to you and how dear he was to the state was displayed by its mourning at his death the authority of the ancients has more weight with either that of our own ancestors who paid such sacred honors to the dead which surely they would not have done if they thought those honors did in way affect them or that of those who once lived in this country and enlightened by their institutions and instructions magna græcia 30 which now indeed is entirely destroyed but then was ﬂourishing or of him who was pronounced by the oracle of apollo to be the wisest of men who did not say ﬁrst one thing and then another is generally done but always the same namely that the souls of men are divine and that when they have departed from the body return to heaven is opened to them and the speediest to the most virtuous and just this same opinion was also held by scipio he indeed very few days before his death if he had presentiment of it when philus and manilius were present and many others and you also scævola had gone with three days descanted on the subject of government of which discussion the last was almost entirely on the immortality of souls which he said he had learned in sleep through vision from africanus if this be the fact that the spirit of the best man most easily ﬂies away in death from the and chains of the body whose passage to the gods can we conceive to have been readier than that of scipio wherefore to be afﬂicted at this his departure i fear would be the part rather of an envious person than of friend but yet i so enjoy the recollection of our friendship that i seem to have lived happily because i lived with scipio with whom i had common anxiety on public and private affairs and with whom my life both at home and abroad was associated and there existed that wherein consists the entire strength of friendship an entire agreement of inclinations pursuits and sentiments that character wisdom therefore which fannius little while ago mentioned does not so delight especially since it is undeserved the hope that the recollection of our friendship will last forever and it is 43 44 45 46 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume ii of 10 rome https more gratifying to because scarcely in the history of the world are three or four pairs of friends mentioned by name and i indulge in the hope that the friendship of scipio and lælius will be remembered i can only urge you to prefer friendship to all human possessions there is nothing so suited to our nature so well adapted to prosperity or adversity but ﬁrst of all i am of opinion that except among the virtuous friendship can not exist i not analyze this principle too closely they who inquire with too great nicety into those things perhaps with truth on their side but with little general advantage they maintain that there is good man but the wise man be it so yet they deﬁne wisdom to be such mortal has ever attained to whereas we ought to contemplate those things which exist in practise and in common life and not the subjects of ﬁctions or of our own wishes i would never pretend to say that caius fabricius marius curius and titus coruncanius whom our ancestors esteemed wise were wise according to the standard of these moralists wherefore let them keep to themselves the name of wisdom both invidious and unintelligible and let them allow that these were good they will not even that they will declare that this can not be granted except to wise man let us therefore proceed with our dull genius they say those who so conduct themselves and so live that their honor their integrity their justice and liberality are approved so that there is not in them any covetousness or licentiousness or boldness and that they are of great consistency those men whom i have mentioned us consider these worthy of the appellation of good men they have been accounted such because they follow far men are able nature which is the best guide of good life i seem to myself to have this view that we are so formed by nature that there should be certain social tie among all stronger however each approaches nearer us accordingly citizens are preferable to foreigners and relatives to strangers with the nature herself has created friendly feeling tho this has not sufﬁcient strength in this respect friendship is superior to relationship because from relationship benevolence can be withdrawn and from friendship it can not with the withdrawal of benevolence the very name of friendship is done away while that of relationship remains now how great the power of friendship is may be best gathered from this consideration that out of the boundless society of the human race which nature herself has joined together frien dship is matter so contracted and brought into so narrow compass that the whole of affection is conﬁned to two or at any rate to very few now friendship is nothing else than complete union of feeling on all subjects divine and human accompanied by kindly feeling and attachment than which indeed i am not aware whether with the exception of wisdom anything better has been bestowed on man by the immortal gods some men prefer riches others good health others inﬂuence others again honors many prefer even pleasures the last indeed is the characteristic of beasts while the former are ﬂeeting and uncertain depending not so much on our own purpose on the ﬁckleness of fortune whereas those who place the supreme good in virtue therein admirably but this very virtue itself both begets and constitutes friendship nor without this virtue can friendship exist at all now let us deﬁne this virtue according to the usage of life and of our common language and let us not measure it certain learned persons by pomp of language and let us include among the good those who are so paulli the catos the galli the scipios and the phili with these men ordinary life is content and let us pass over those who are nowhere found to exist among men of this kind therefore friendship ﬁnds facilities so great that i can scarcely describe them in the ﬁrst whom can life be worth living ennius says who does not repose on the mutual kind feeling of some friend what can be more delightfu l than to have one to whom you can speak on all subjects just to yourself where would be the great enjoyment in prosperity if you had not one to rejoice in it equally with yourself and adversity would indeed be difﬁcult to endure without some one who would bear it even with greater regret than yourself in short all other objects that are sough t after are 47 48 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume ii of 10 rome https suited to some one single that you may spend them power that you may be courted honors that you may be extolled pleasures that you may enjoy them good health that you may be exempt from harm and perform the functio ns of the body whereas friendship comprizes the greatest number of objects possible wherever you turn yourself it is at hand shut out of place never out of season never irksome and therefore we not use ﬁre and water they say on more occasions than we friendship and i am not now speaking of commonplace or ordinary friendship tho even that brings delight and beneﬁt but of real and true friendship such belonged to those of whom very few are recorded prosperity friendship renders more brilliant and adversity more supportable by dividing and communicating it and while friendship embraces very many and great advantages she undoubtedly surpasses all in this that she shines with brilliant hope over the future and never suffers the spirit to be weakened or to sink besides he who looks on true friend looks it were upon kind of image of himself wherefore friends tho absent are still present tho in poverty they are rich tho weak yet in the enjoyment of health and what is still more difﬁcult to assert tho dead they are alive so entirely does the honor the memory the regret of friends attend them from which circumstance the death of the one seems to be happy and the life of the other praisew orthy nay should you remove from nature the cement of kind feelings neither house nor city will be able to stand even the cultivation of the land will not continue if it be not clearly perceived how great is the power of friendship and concord it can be distinctly inferred from quarrels and dissensions what house is there so established or what state so ﬁrmly settled that may not utterly be overthrown by hatred and dissension from which it may be determined how much advantage there is in friendship they relate indeed that certain learned man of agrigentum 31 promulgated in greek verses the doctrine that all things which cohere throughout the whole world and all things that are the subjects of motion are brought together by friendship and are dispelled by discord and this principle all men understand and illustrate by their conduct therefore if at any time any act of friend has been exhibited either in under going or in sharing dangers who is there that does not extol such an act with the highest praise now if such be the inﬂuence of integrity that we love it even in those whom we have never seen and what is much more even in an enemy what wonder if men feelings are affected when they seem to discover the goodness and virtue of those with whom they may become connected by intercourse altho love is conﬁrmed by the reception of kindness and by the discovery of an earnest sympathy and by close familiarity which things being added to the ﬁrst emotion of the mind and the affections there is kindled large amount of kindly feeling and if any imagine that this proceeds from sense of weakness so that there shall be secured friend by whom man may obtain that which he wants they leave to friendship mean and indeed if i may so speak anything but respectable origin when they make her to be born of indigence and want were this the case then in proportion man judged that there were the least resources in himself precisely in that degree would he be best qualiﬁed friendship whereas the fact is far otherwise just man has most conﬁdence in himself and he is most completely fortiﬁed by worth and wisdom so that he needs one assistance and feels that all his resources reside in himself in the same proportion he is most highly distinguished seeking out and forming friendships what did africanus want of nothing whatever nor indeed did i need aught from him but i loved him from admiration of his excellence he in turn perhaps was attached to from some high opinion which he entertained of my character and association fostered our affection but altho many and great advantages ensued yet it was not from any hope of these that the causes of our attachment sprang we are beneﬁcent and liberal not to exact favor in return we are not usurers in kind actions but by nature are inclined to liberality thus i think that friendship is to be desired not attracted by the hope of reward but because the whole of its proﬁt consists in love only from such opinions they who after the fashion of beasts refer everything to pleasure widely differ and great wonder since they can not look 49 50 51 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume ii of 10 rome https to anything lofty magniﬁcent or divine who east all their thoughts on an object so mean and contemptible therefore let us exclude such persons altogether from our discourse and let us ourselves hold this opinion that the sentiment of loving and the attachment of kind feelings are produced by nature when the evidence of virtue has been established and they who have eagerly sought the draw nigh and attach themselves to it that they may enjoy the friendship and character of the individual they have begun to love and that they may be commensurate and equal in affection and more inclined to confer favor than to claim any return and let this honorable struggle be maintained between them so not only will the greatest advantages be derived from friendship but its origin from nature rather than from sense of weakness will be at once more impressive and more true if it were expediency that cemented friendships the same when changed would dissolve them but because nature can never change therefore true friendships are eternal listen then my excellent friends to the discussion which was very frequentl y held by and scipio on the subject of friendship altho he indeed used to say that nothing was more difﬁcult than that friendship should continue to the end of life it often happened either that the same course was not expedient to both parties or that they held different views of politics he remarked also that the characters of men often changed in some cases by adversity in others by old age becoming oppressive and he derived an authority such notions from comparison with early life because the strongest attachments of boys are constantly laid aside with the prætexta even if they should maintain it to manhood yet sometimes it is broken off by rivalry dowried wife or some other advantage which they can not both attain and even if men should be carrie d on still further in their friendship yet that feeling is often undermined should they fall into rivalry preferments there is greater enemy to friendship than covetousness of money in most men and even in the best an emulous desire of high ofﬁces and glory in consequence of which the most bitter enmities have often arisen between the dearest friends great dissensions and those in most instances justiﬁable arise when some request is made of friends which is improper instance that they should become either the ministers of their lust or their supporters in the perpetration of wrong and they who refuse to so it matters not however virtuously yet are accused of discarding the claims of friendship by those persons whom they are unwilling to oblige but they who dare to ask anything of friend by their very request seem to imply that they would anything the sake of that friend by the complaining of such persons not only are intimacies put an end to but endless animosities are engend ered all these many causes like so many fatalities are ever threatening friendship so that he said to escape them all seemed to him proof not merely of wisdom but even of good fortune let this therefore be established primary law concerning friendship that we expect from our friends only what is honorable and our friends sake what is honorable that we should not wait till we are asked that zeal be ever ready and reluctance far from us but that we take pleasure in freely giving our advice that in our friendship the inﬂuence of our friends when they give good advice should have great weight and that this be employed to admonish not only candidly but even severely if the case shall require and that we give heed to it when so employed to certain persons whom i understand to have been esteemed wise men in greece i am of opinion that some strange notions were entertained by them but there is nothing which they not follow up with too great subtlety among the rest that excessive friendships should be avoid ed lest it should be necessary one to feel anxiety many that every one has enough and more than enough of his own affairs that to be needlessly implicated in those of other people is vexatious that it was most convenient to hold the reins of friendship loose possible so either to tighten or slacken them when you please they argue that the main point toward happy life is freedo m from care which the mind can not enjoy if one man be it were in travail others 52 53 54 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume ii of 10 rome https they tell us that some are accustomed to declare still more unfeelingly topic which i have brieﬂy touched upon just above that friendships should be cultivated the purpose of protection and assistan ce and not kind feeling or affection and therefore the less man possesses of independence and of strength in the same degree he most earnestly desires friendships that thence it arises that women seek the support of friendship more than men and the poor more than the rich and persons in distress rather than those who are considered prosperous admirable philosophy they seem to take away the sun from the world who withdraw friendship from life we receiv nothing better from the immortal gods nothing more delightful what is this freedom from care appearances indeed ﬂatterin g but in many eases in reality to be disdained nor is it reasonable to undertake any honorable matter or action lest you should be anxious or to lay it aside when undertaken if we ﬂy from care we must ﬂy from virtue also it is impossible that she can without some degree of distress feel contempt and detestation qualities opposed to herself just malice temperance proﬂigacy and bravery cowardice accordingly you see that upright men are most distrest by unjust actions the brave with the cowardly the virtuous with the proﬂigate and therefore this is the characteristic of mind both to be well pleased with what is excellent and to be distrest with what is contrary wherefore if trouble of mind befall wise man and assuredly it will unless we suppose that all humanity is extirpated from his mind what reason is there why we should altogether remove friendship from life lest because of it we should take upon ourselves some troubles what difference is there setting the emotions of the mind aside i not say between man and beast but between man and stone or log or anything of that kind they not deserve to be listened to who would have virtue to be callous and made of iron it were which indeed is in other matters so in friendship also tender and susceptible so that friends are loosened it were by happy events and drawn together by distresses wherefore the anxiety which has often to be felt friend is not of such force that it should remove friendship from the world any more than that the virtues because they bring with them certain cares and troubles should therefore be discarded when it produces friendship i said above should any indication of virtue shine forth to which congenial mind may attach and unite this happens affection must necessarily arise what is so unmeaning to take delight in many vain things such preferments glory magniﬁcent buildings clothing and adornment of the body and not to take an extreme delight in soul endued with virtue in such soul can either love or so to speak love in return there is nothing more delightful than the repayment of kindness and the interchange of devoted ness and good ofﬁces now if we add this which may with propriety be added that nothing so allures and draws any object to itself congeniality does friendship it will of course be admitted true that the good must love the good and unite them to them selves just if connected by relationship and nature nothing is more apt to seek and seize on its like than nature wherefore this certainly is clear fannius and scævola in my opinion that among the good liking the good is it were inevitable and this indeed is appointed by nature herself the very fountain of friendship but the same kind disposition belongs also to the multitude virtue is not inhuman or cruel or haughty since she is accustomed to protect even whole nations and to adopt the best measures their welfare which assuredly she would not did she shrink from the affection of the vulgar and to myself indeed those who form friendships with view to advantage seem to away with its most endearing bond it is not so much the advantage obtained through friend the mere love of that friend which delights and then only what has proceeded from friend becomes delightful if it has proceeded from zealous affection and that friendship should be cultivated from sense of necessity is so far from being the case that those who being endowed with power and wealth and especially with virtue in which is the strongest support of friendship have least need of another are most liberal and generous yet i am not sure whether it is requisite that friends should never stand in any need wherein would any devotedness of mine to 55 56 57 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume ii of 10 rome https have been exerted if scipio had never stood in need of my advice or assistance at home or abroad wherefore friendship has not followed upon advantage but advantage on friendship persons therefore who are wallowing in indulgence will not need to be listened to if ever they shall descant upon friendship which they have known neither by experience nor by theory who is there by the faith of gods and men who would desire on the condition of his loving one and himself being loved by none to roll in afﬂuence and live in superﬂuity of all things this is the life of tyrants in which undoubtedly there can be conﬁdence affection steady dependence on attachment all is perpetually mistrust and is room friendship who can love either him whom he fears or him by whom he thinks he himself is feared yet are they courted solely in hypocrisy time because if perchance it frequently happens they have been brought low then it is perceived how destitute they were of friends and this they say tarquin 32 exprest that when going into exile he found out whom he had faithful friends and whom unfaithful ones since then he could longer show gratitude to either party altho i wonder that with such haughtiness and impatience of temper he could ﬁnd one at all and the character of the individual whom i have mentioned could not obtain true friends so the riches of many men of rank exclude all faithful friendship not only is fortune blind herself but she commonly renders blind those whom she embraces he who therefore shall have shown himself in both cases regards friendship worthy consistent and stedfast such one we ought to esteem of class of persons extremely almost godlike now the foundation of that stedfastness and constancy which we seek in friendship is sincerity nothing is stedfast which is insincere besides it is right that one should be chosen who is frank and and congenial in his sentiments one in fact who is inﬂuenced by the same motives all of which qualities have tendency to create sincerity it is impossible wily and tortuous disposition to be sincere nor in truth can the man who has sympathy from nature and who is not moved by the same considerations be either attached or steady to the same requisites must be added that he shall neither take delight in bringing forward charges nor believe them when they arise all of which causes belong to that consistent principle of which now some time i have been treating thus the remark is true which i made at ﬁrst that friendship can exist only among the good it is the part of good man whom at the same time we may call wise man to observe these two rules in friendship ﬁrst that there shall be nothing pretended or simulated even to hate openly better becomes the ingenuous man than by his looks to conceal his sentiments in the next place that not only does he repel charges when brought against his friends by any one but is not himself suspicious ever fancying that some inﬁdelity has been committed by his friend to all this there should be added certain suavity of conversation and manners affording it does inconsiderable zest to friendship now solemnity and gravity on all occasions certainly carry with them dignity but friendship ought to be easier and more free and more pleasant and tending more to every kind of politeness and good nature footnotes from the cato major an essay on old age translated by cyrus edmonds this work is composed in the

rhine 34 cæsar those reasons which i have mentioned had resolved to cross the rhine but to cross by ships he neither deemed to be sufﬁciently safe nor considered consistent with his own dignity or that of the roman people therefore altho the greatest difﬁculty in forming bridge was presented to him on account of the breadth rapidity and depth of the river he nevertheless considered that it ought to be attempted by him or that his army ought not otherwise to be led over he devised this plan of bridge he joined together at the distance of two feet two piles each foot and half thick sharpened little at the lower end and proportioned in length to the depth of the river after he had by means of engines sunk these into the river and ﬁxt them at the bottom and then driven them in with rammers not quite perpendicularly like stake but bending forward and sloping so to incline in the direction of the current of the river he also placed two other piles opposite to these at the distance of forty feet lower down fastened together in the same manner but directed against the force and current of the river both these moreover were kept ﬁrmly apart by beams two feet thick the space which the binding of the piles occupied laid in at their extremities between two braces on each side and in consequence of these being in different directions and fastened on sides the one opposite to the other so great was the strength of the work and such the arrangement of the materials that in proportion the greater body of water dashed against the bridge so much the closer were its parts held fastened together these beams were bound together by timber laid over them in the direction of the length of the bridge and were then covered with laths and hurdles and in addition to this piles were driven into the water obliquely at the lower side of the bridge and these serving buttresses and being connected with every portion of the work sustained the force of the stream and there were others also above the bridge at moderate distance that if trunks of trees or vessels were ﬂoated down the river by the barbarians the purpose of destroying the work the violence of such things might be diminished by these defenses and might not injure the bridge within ten days after the timber began to be collected the whole work was completed and the whole army led over cæsar leaving strong guard at each end of the bridge hastens into the territories of the sigambri in the mean time ambassadors from several nations come to him whom on their suing peace and alliance he answers in courteous manner and orders hostages to be brought to him but the sigambri at the very time the bridge was begun to be built made preparations ﬂight by the advice of such of the tenchtheri and usipĕtes they had among them and quitted their territories and conveyed away all their possessions and concealed themselves in deserts and woods cæsar having remained in their territories few days and burned all their villages and houses and cut down their corn proceeded into the territories of the ubii and having promised them his assistance if they were ever harassed by the suevi 35 he learned from them these particulars that the suevi after they had by means of their scouts found that the bridge was being built had called council according to their custom and sent orders to all parts of their state to remove from the towns and convey their children wives and all their possessions into the woods and that all who could bear arms should assemble in one place that the place thus chosen was nearly the center of those regions which the suevi possest that in this spot they had resolved to await the arrival of the 62 63 64 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume ii of 10 rome https and give them battle there when cæsar discovered this having already accomplished all these things on account of which he had resolved to lead his army over to strike fear into the germans take vengeance on the sigambri and free the ubii from the invasion of the suevi having spent altogether eighteen days beyond the rhine and thinking he had advanced far enough to serve both honor and returned into gaul and cut down the bridge ii the invasion of britain 36 the interior portion of britain is inhabited by those of whom they say that it is handed down by tradition that they were born in the island itself the maritime portion by those who had passed over from the country of the belgæ 37 the purpose of plunder and making war almost all of whom are called by the names of those states from which being sprung they went thither and having waged war continued there and began to cultivate the lands the number of the people is countless and their buildings exceedingly numerous the most part very like those of the gauls the number of cattle is great they use either brass or iron rings determined at certain weight their money tin is produced in the midland regions in the maritime iron but the quantity of it is small they employ brass which is imported there in gaul is timber of every description except beech and ﬁr they not regard it lawful to eat the hare and the cock and the goose they however breed them amusement and pleasure the climate is more temperate than in gaul the cold being less severe the island is triangular in its form and one of its sides is opposite to gaul one angle of this side which is in kent whither almost all ships from gaul are directed looks to the east the lower looks to the south this side extends about 500 miles another side lies toward spain 38 and the west on which part is ireland less is reckoned than britain by one half but the passage from it into britain is of equal distance with that from gaul in the middle of this voyage is an island which is called mona 39 many smaller islands besides are supposed to lie there of which islands some have written that at the time of the winter solstice it is night there thirty consecutive days we in our inquiries about that matter ascertained nothing except that by accurate measurements with water we perceived the nights to be shorter there than on the continent the length of this side their account states is 700 miles the third side is toward the north to which portion of the island land is opposite but an angle of that side looks principall y toward germany this side is considered to be 800 miles in length thus the whole island is about miles in circumference the most civilized of all these nations are they who inhabit kent which is entirely maritime district nor their customs differ much from gallic most of the inland inhabitants not sow corn but live on milk and ﬂesh and are clad with skins all the britains indeed dye themselves with wood which occasions bluish color and thereby have more terrible appearance in ﬁght they wear their hair long and have every part of their body shaved except their head and upper lip ten and even twelve have wives common to them and particularly brothers among brothers and parents among their children but if there be any issue by these wives they are reputed to be the children of those by whom respectively each was ﬁrst espoused when vir gin the horse and charioteers of the enemy contended vigorously in skirmish with our cavalry on the march yet so that our men were conquerors in all parts and drove them to their woods and hills but having slain great many they pursued too eagerly and lost some of their men however the enemy after some time had elapsed when our men were off their guard and occupied in the fortiﬁcation of the camp rushed out of the 65 66 67 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume ii of 10 rome https and making an attack upon those who were placed on duty before the camp fought in determined manner and two cohorts being sent by cæsar to their relief and these severally the ﬁrst of two legions when these had taken up their position at very small distance from each other our men were disconcerted by the unusual mode of battle the enemy broke through the middle of them most courageously and retreated thence in safety that day laberius durus tribune of the soldiers was slain the enemy since more cohorts were sent against them were repulsed in the whole of this method of ﬁghting since the engagement took place under the eyes of all and before the camp it was perceived that our men on account of the weight of their arms inasmuch they could neither pursue the enemy when retreating nor dare quit their standards were little suited to this kind of enemy that the horse also fought with great danger because they the britons generally retreated even designedly and when they had drawn off our men short distance from the legions leapt from their chariots and fought on foot in unequal and to them advantageous battle but the system of cavalry engagement is wont to produce equal danger and indeed the same both to those who retreat and those who pursue to this was added that they never fought in close order but in small parties and at great distances and had detachments placed in different parts and then the one relieved the other and the vigorous and fresh succeeded the wearied the following day the enemy halted on the hills distance from our camp and presented themselves in small parties and began to challenge our horse to battle with less spirit than the day before but at noon when cæsar had sent three legions and all the cavalry with trebonius the lieutenant the purpose of foraging they ﬂew upon the foragers suddenly from all quarters so that they did not keep off even from the standards and the legions our men making an attack on them vigorously repulsed them nor did they cease to pursue them until the horse relying on relief they saw the legions behind them drove the enemy precipitately before them and slaying great number of them did not give them the opportunity either of rallying or halting or leaping from their chariots after this retreat the auxiliaries departed nor after that time did the enemy ever engage with us in very lar ge numbers cæsar discovering their design leads his army into the territories of cassivelau nus 40 to the river thames which river can be forded in one place only and that with difﬁculty when he had arrived there he perceives that numerous forces of the enemy were marshaled on the other bank of the river the bank also was defended by sharp stakes 41 ﬁxt in front and stakes of the same kind ﬁxt under the water were covered by the river these things being discovered from some prisoners and deserters cæsar sending forward the cavalry ordered the legions to follow them immediately but the soldiers advanced with such speed and such ardor tho they stood above the water by their heads only that the enemy could not sustain the attack of the legions and of the horse and quitted the banks and committed themselves to ﬂight cassivelaunus we have stated above all hope rising out of battle being laid aside the greater part of his forces being dismissed and about charioteers only being left used to observe our marches and retire little from the road and conceal himself in intricate and woody places and in those neighborhoods in which he had discovered we were about to march he used to drive the cattle and the inhabitants from the ﬁelds into the woods and when our cavalry the sake of plundering and ravaging the more freely scattered themselves among the ﬁelds he used to send out charioteers from the woods by all the roads and paths and to the great danger of our horse engaged with them and this source of fear hindered them from straggl ing very extensively the result was that cæsar did not allow excursions to be made to great distance from the main body of the legions and ordered that damage should be done to the enemy in ravaging their lands and kindling ﬁres only so far the legionar y soldiers could by their own exertion and marching accomplish it 68 69 70 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume ii of 10 rome https the mean time the trinobantes 42 almost the most powerful state of those parts from which the young man mandubratius embracing the protection of cæsar had come to the continent of gaul to meet him whose father imanuentius had possest the sovereignty in that state and had been killed by cassivelaunus he himself had escaped death by ﬂight send ambassadors to cæsar and promise that they will surrender themselves to him and perform his command they entreat him to protect mandubratius from the violence of cassivelaunus and send to their state some one to preside over it and possess the government cæsar demands forty hostages from them and corn his army and sends mandubratius to them they speedily performed the things demanded and sent hostages to the number appointed and the corn the trinobantes being protected and secured from any violence of the soldiers the cenimagni the segontiăci the ancalites the bibrŏci and the cassi sending embassies surrender themselves to cæsar 43 from them he learns that the capital town of cassivelaunus was not far from that place and was defended by woods and morasses and very large number of men and of cattle had been collected in it now the britons when they have fortiﬁed the intricate woods in which they are wont to assemble the purpose of avoiding the incursion of an enemy with an entrenchment and rampart call them town thither he proceeds with his legions he ﬁnds the place admirably fortiﬁed by nature and art he however undertakes to attack it in two directions the enemy having remained only short time did not sustain the attack of our soldiers and hurried away on the other side of the town great amount of cattle was found there and many of the enemy were taken and slain in their ﬂight iii overcoming the nervii 44 cæsar having sent his cavalry on before followed closely after them with all his forces but the plan and order of the march were different from that which the belgæ had reported to the nervii 45 he was approaching the enemy cæsar according to his custom led on the van six legions unencumbered by baggage behind them he had placed the of the whole army then the two legions which had been last raised closed the rear and were guard the our horse with the slingers and archers having passed the river commenced action with the cavalry of the enemy while they from time to time betook themselves into the woods to their companions and again made an assault out of the wood upon our men who did not dare to follow them in their retreat further than the limit to which the plain and open parts extended in the mean time the six legio ns which had arrived ﬁrst having measured out the work began to fortify the camp when the ﬁrst part of the of our army was seen by those who lay hidden in the woods which had been agreed on among them the time commencing action soon they had arranged their line of battle and formed their ranks within the woods and had encouraged one another they rushed out suddenly with all their forces and made an attack upon our horse the latter being easily routed and thrown into confusion the nervii ran down to the river with such incredible speed that they seemed to be in the woods the river and close upon us almost at the same time and with the same speed they hastened up the hill to our camp and to those who were employed in the works cæsar had everything to at one time the standard to be displayed which was the sign when it was necessary to rim to arms the signal to be given by the trumpet the soldiers to be called off from the works those who had proceeded some distance the purpose of seeking materials the rampart to be summoned the order of battle to be formed the soldiers to be encouraged the watchword to be given great part of these arrangements was prevented by the shortness of time and the sudden approach and charge 71 72 73 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume ii of 10 rome https the enemy under these difﬁculties two things proved of advantage ﬁrst the skill and experience of the soldiers because having been trained by former engagements they could suggest to themselves what ought to be done conveniently receive information from others and secondly that cæsar had forbidden his several lieutenants to depart from the works and their respective legions before the camp was fortiﬁed these on account of the near approach and the speed of the enemy did not then wait any command from cæsar but of themselves executed whatever appeared proper cæsar having given the necessary orders hastened to and fro into whatever quarter fortune carried him to animate the troops and came to the tenth legion having encouraged the soldiers with further speech than that they should keep up the remembrance of their wonted valor and not be confused in mind but valiantly sustain the assault of the enemy the latter were not farther from them than the distance to which dart could be cast he gave the signal commencing battle and having gone to another quarter the purpose of encouraging the soldiers he ﬁnds them ﬁghting such was the shortness of the time and so determined was the mind of the enemy on ﬁghting that time was wanting not only afﬁxing the military insignia but even putting on the helmets and drawing off the covers from the shields to whatever part any one by chance came from the works in which he had been employed and whatever standards he saw ﬁrst at these he stood lest in seeking his own company he should lose the time ﬁghting the army having been marshaled rather the nature of the ground and the declivity of the hill and the exigency of the time than the method and order of military matters required while the legions in the different places were withstanding the enemy some in one quarter some in another and the view was obstructed by the very thick hedges intervening we have before remark ed neither could proper reserves be posted nor could the necessary measures be taken in each part nor could all the commands be issued by one person therefore in such an unfavorable state of affairs various events of fortune followed at the same time our horsemen and infantry who had been with those who i have related were routed by the ﬁrst assault of the enemy they were betaking themselves into the camp met the enemy face to face and again sought ﬂight into another quarter and the who from the decuman gate and from the highest ridge of the hill had seen our men pass the river victors when after going out the purposes of plundering they looked back and saw the enemy parading in our camp committed themselves precipitate ly to ﬂight at the same time there arose the cry and shout of those who came with the and they affrighted were carried some one way some another by all these circumstances the cavalry of the treviri were much alarmed whose reputation courage is extraordinary among the gauls and who had come to cæsar being sent by their state auxiliaries and when they saw our camp ﬁlled with large number of the enemy the legions hard prest and almost held surrounded the horsemen slingers and numidians ﬂeeing on all sides divided and scattered they despairing of our affairs hastened home and related to their state that the romans were routed and conquered and that the enemy were in possession of their camp and cæsar proceeded after encouraging the tenth legion to the right wing where he perceived that his men were hard prest and that in consequence of the standa rds of the twelfth legion being collected together in one place the crowded soldier s were hindrance to themselves in the ﬁght that all the centurions of the fourth cohort were slain and the killed the standard itself lost almost all the centurions of the other cohorts either wounded or slain and among them the chief centurion of the legion sextius baculus very valiant man who was so exhausted by many and severe wounds that he was already unable to support himself he likewise perceived that the rest were slackening their efforts and that some deserted by those in the rear were retiring from the battle and avoiding the weapons that the enemy on the other hand tho advancing from the lower ground were not relaxing in front and were at the same time 74 75 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume ii of 10 rome https hard on both ﬂanks he perceived also that the affair was at crisis and that there was not any reserve which could be brought up having therefore snatched shield from one of the soldiers in the rear he himself had come without shield he advanced to the front of the line and addressing the centurions by name and encouraging the rest of the soldiers he ordered them to carry forward the standards and extend the companies that they might the more easily use their swords on his arrival hope was brought to the soldiers and their courage restored while every one his own part in the sight of his general desired to exert his utmost energy the impetuosity of the enemy was little checked cæsar when he perceived that the seventh legion which stood close by him was also hard prest by the enemy directed the tribunes of the soldiers to effect junction of the legions gradually and make their charge upon the enemy with double front which having been done since they brought assistance the one to the other nor feared lest their rear should be surrounded by the enemy they began to stand their ground more boldly and to ﬁght more courageously in the mean time the soldiers of the two legions which had been in the rear of the army guard the upon the battle being reported to them quickened their pace and were seen by the enemy on the top of the hill and titus labienus having gained possession of the camp of the enemy and observed from the higher ground what was going on in our camp sent the tenth legion relief to our men who when they had learned from the ﬂight of the horse and the sutlers in what position the affair was and in how great danger the camp and the legion and the commander were involved left undone nothing which tended to despatch by their arrival so great change of matters was made that our men even those who had fallen down exhausted with wounds leaned on their shields and renewed the ﬁght then the tho unarmed seeing the enemy completely dismayed attacked them tho armed the horsemen too that they might by their valor blot out the disgrace of their ﬂight thrust themselves before the legionary soldiers in all parts of the battle but the enemy even in the last hope of safet y displayed such great courage that when the foremost of them had fallen the next stood upon them prostrate and fought from their bodies when these were overthrown and their corpses heaped up together those who survived cast their weapons against our men thence from mound and returned our darts which had fallen short between the armies so that it ought not to be concluded that men of such great courage had injudiciously dared to pass very broad river ascend very high banks and come up to very disadvantageous place since their greatness of spirit had rendered these actions easy altho in themselves very difﬁcult this battle being ended and the nation and name of the nervii being almost reduced to annihilation their old men who togeth er with the boys and women we have stated to have been collected together in the fenny places and marshes on this battle having been reported to them since they were convinced that nothing was an obstacle to the conquerors and nothing safe to the conquered sent ambassadors to cæsar by the consent of all who remained and surrendered themselves to him and in recounting the calamity of their state said that their senators were reduced from 600 to three that from men they were reduced to scarcely 500 who could bear arms whom cæsar that he might appear to use compassion toward the wretched and the suppliant most carefully spared and ordered them to enjoy their own territories and towns and commanded their neighbors that they should restrain themselves and their dependents from offering injury or outrage to them iv the battle of pharsalia and the death of pompey 46 76 77 78 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume ii of 10 rome https 48 pompey because he was encamped on hill drew up his army at the very foot of it ever in expectation may be conjectured that cæsar would expose himself to this disadvantageous situation cæsar seeing likelihood of being able to bring pompey to an action judged it the most expedient method of conducting the war to decamp from that post and to be always in motion with this hope that by shifting his camp and removing from place to place he might be more conveniently supplied with corn and also that by being in motion he might get some opportunity of forcing them to battle and might by constant marches harass pomp ey army which was not accustomed to fatigue 47 these matters being settled when the signal marching was given and the tents struck it was observed that shortly before contrary to his daily practise pompey army had advanced farther than usual from his entrenchments so that it appeared possible to come to an action on equal ground then cæsar addrest himself to his soldiers when they were at the gates of the camp ready to march out we must defer says he our march at present and set our thoughts on battle which has been our constant wish let us then meet the foe with resolute souls we shall not hereafter easily ﬁnd such an opportunity he immediately marched out at the head of his troops pompey also was afterward known at the unanimous solicitation of his friends had determined to try the fate of battle he had even declared in council few days before that before the battalions came to battle cæsar army would be put to the rout when most people exprest their surprize at it i know says he that i promise thing almost incredible but hear the plan on which i proceed that you may march to battle with more conﬁdence and resolution i have persuaded our cavalry and they have engaged to execute it soon the two armies have met to attack cæsar right wing on the ﬂank and enclosing their army on the rear throw them into disorder and put them to the rout before we shall throw weapon against the enemy by this means we shall put an end to the war without endangering the legions and almost without blow nor is this difﬁcult matter we far outnumber them in cavalry at the same time he gave them notice to be ready battle on the day following and since the opportunity which they had so often wished was now arrived not to disappoint the opinion generally entertained of their experience and valor cæsar observing his former custom had placed the tenth legion on the right the ninth on the left altho it was very much weakened by the battles at dyrrachium 48 he placed the eighth legion so close to the ninth almost to make one of the two and ordered them to support each other he drew up on the ﬁeld eighty cohorts making total of thousand men he left two cohorts to guard the camp he gave the command of the left wing to antonius of the right to sulla and of the center to cn domitius he himself took his post opposite pompey at the same time fearing from the disposition of the enemy which we have previously menti oned lest his right wing might be surrounded by their numerous cavalry he rapidly drafted single cohort from each of the legions composing the third line formed of them fourth line and opposed them to pompey cavalry and acquainting them with his wishes admonished them that the success of that day depended on their courage at the same time he ordered the third line and the entire army not to charge without his command that he would give the signal whenever he wished them to so but our men when the signal was given rushed forward with their javelins ready to be launched but perceiving that pompey men did not run to meet their charge having acquired experience by custom and being practised in former battles they of their own accord repressed their speed and halted almost midway that they might not come up with the enemy when their strength was exhausted and after short respite they again renewed their course and threw their javelins and instantly drew their swords cæsar had ordered them nor did pompey men fail in this crisis they received our javelins stood our charge and maintained their ranks and having launched their javelins had recourse to their swords at the same time pompey horse according to their orders rushed out at once from his left wing and his whole host of archers poured after them 79 80 81 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume ii of 10 rome https cavalry did not withstand their charge but gave ground little upon which pompey horse prest them more vigoro usly and began to ﬁle off in troops and ﬂank our army when cæsar perceived this he gave the signal to his fourth line which he had formed of the six cohorts they instantly rushed forward and charged pompey horse with such fury that not man of them stood but all wheeling about not only quitted their post but galloped forward to seek refuge in the highest mountains by their retreat the archers and slingers being left destitu and defenseless were all cut to pieces the cohorts pursuing their success wheeled about upon pompey left wing while his infantry still continued to make battle and attacked them in the rear at the same time cæsar ordered his third line to advance which till then had not been engaged but had kept their post thus new and fresh troops having come to the assistance of the fatigued and others having made an attack on their rear pompey men were not able to maintain their ground but all ﬂed 49 nor was cæsar deceived in his opinion that the victory he had declared in his speech to his soldiers must have its beginning from those six cohorts whic h he had placed fourth line to oppose the horse by them the cavalry were routed by them the archers and slingers were cut to pieces by them the left wing of pompey army was surrounded and obliged to be the ﬁrst to ﬂee but when pompey saw his cavalry routed and that part of his army on which he reposed his greatest hopes thrown into confusion despairing of the rest he quitted the ﬁeld and retreated straightway on horseback to his camp and calling to the centurions whom he had placed to guard the prætorian gate with loud voice that the soldiers might hear secure the camp says he defend it with diligence if any dang er should threaten it i will visit the other gates and encourage the guards of the camp having thus said he retired into his tent in utter despair yet anxiously waiting the issue cæsar having forced the pompeians to ﬂee into their entrenchment and thinking that he ought not to allow them any respite to recover from their fright exhorted his soldiers to take advantage of fortune kindness and to attack the camp tho they were fatigued by the intense heat the battle had continued till midday yet being prepared to under go any labor they cheerfully obeyed his command the camp was bravely defend ed by the cohorts which had been left to guard it but with much more spirit by the thracians and foreign auxiliaries the soldiers who had ﬂed refuge to it from the ﬁeld of battle affrighted and exhausted by fatigue having thrown away their arms and military standards had their thoughts more engaged on their further escape than on the defense of the camp nor could the troops who were posted on the battlements long withstand the immense number of our darts but fainting under their wounds quitted the place and under the conduct of their centurions and tribunes ﬂed without stopping to the high mountains which adjoined the camp in pompey camp you might see arbors in which tables were laid large quantity of plate set out the ﬂoors of the tents covered with fresh sods the tents of lucius lentulus and others shaded with ivy and many other things which were proofs of excessive luxury and conﬁdence of victory so that it might readily be inferred that they had apprehensions of the issue of the day they indulged themselves in unnecessary pleasures and yet upbraided with luxury cæsar army distrest and suffering troops who had always been in want of common necessaries pompey soon our men had forced the trenches mounting his horse and stripping off his general habit went hastily out of the back gate of the camp and galloped with all speed to larissa nor did he stop there but with the same despatch collecting few of his ﬂying troops and halting neither day nor night he arrived at the seaside attended by only thirty horse and went on board victualing bark often complaining we have been told that he had been so deceived in his expectation that he was almost persuaded that he had been betrayed by those from whom he had expected victory they began the ﬂight cæsar having possest himself of pompey camp urged his soldiers not to be too intent on plunder and lose the opportunity of completing their conquest having obtained their consent he began to draw lines round the mountain the pompeians distru sting the position there was water on the mountain abandoned it and all began to retreat 82 83 84 85 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume ii of 10 rome https larissa which cæsar perceiving divided his troops and ordering part of his legions to remain in pompey camp sent back part to his own camp and taking four legions with him went by shorter road to intercept the enemy and having marched six miles drew up his army but the pomp eians observing this took post on mountain whose foot was washed by river cæsar having encouraged his troops tho they were greatly exhausted by incessant labor the whole day and night was now approaching by throwing up works cut off the communication between the river and the mountain that the enemy might not get water in the night soon the work was ﬁnished they sent ambassadors to treat about capitulation few senators who had espoused that party made their escape by night at break of day cæsar ordered all those who had taken post on the mountain to come down from the higher grounds into the plain and pile their arms when they did this without refusal and with outstretched arms prostrating themselves on the ground with tears implored his mercy he comforted them and bade them rise and having spoken few words of his own clemency to alleviate their fears he pardoned them all and gave orders to his soldiers that injury should be done to them and nothing taken from them having used this diligence he ordered the legions in his camp to come and meet him and those which were with him to take their turn of rest and go back to the camp and the same day went to larissa in that battle more than two hundred privates were missing but cæsar lost about thirty centurions valiant ofﬁcers crastinus also of whom mention was made before ﬁghting most courageously lost his life by the wound of sword in the mouth nor was that false which he declared when marching to battle cæsar entertained the highest opinion of his behavior in that battle and thought him highly deserving of his approbation of pompey army there fell about ﬁfteen thousand but upward of four thousand were made prisoners even the cohorts which were stationed in the forts surrendered to sulla several others took shelter in the neighboring states one hundred and eighty stands of colors and nine eagles were brought to cæsar lucius domitius ﬂeeing from the camp to the mountains his strength being exhausted by fatigue was killed cæsar thought he ought to postpone all business and pursue pompey whither soever he should retreat that he might not be able to provide fresh forces and renew the war he therefore marched on every day far his cavalry were able to advance and ordered one legion to follow him by shorter journeys proclamation was issued by pompey at amphipolis 50 that all the young men of that province grecians and roman citizens should take the military oath but whether he issued it with an intention of preventing suspicion and to conceal long possible his design of ﬂeeing farther or to endeavor to keep possession of macedonia by new levies if nobody pursued him it is impossible to judge he lay at anchor one night and calling together his friends in amphi polis and collecting sum of money his necessary expenses upon advice of cæsar approach set sail from that place and arrived in few days at mitylene 51 here he was detained two days and having added few galleys to his ﬂeet he went to cilicia and thence to cyprus there he is informed that by the consent of all the inhabitants of antioc h 52 and roman citizens who traded there the castle had been seized to shut him out of the town and that messengers had been dispatched to all those who were reported to have taken refuge in the neighboring states that they should not come to antioch that if they did so it would be attended with imminent danger to their lives the same thing had happened to lucius lentulus who had been consul the year before and to publius lentulus consular senator and to several others at rhodes 53 who having followed pompey in his ﬂight and arrived at the island were not admitted into the town or port and having received message to leave that neighborhood set sail much against their will the rumor of cæsar approach had now reached those states pompey being informed of these proceedings laid aside his design of going to syria and having taken the public money from the farmers of the revenue and borrowed more from some private friends and having put on board his ships large quantity of brass 86 87 88 the project gutenberg ebook of the

alexandria and to be protec ted in his calamity by his powerful assistance in consideration of the friendship and amity which had subsisted between his father and him but pompey deputies having executed their commission began to converse with less restraint with the king troops and to advise them to act with friendship to pompey and not to think meanly of his bad fortune in ptolemy army were several of pompey soldiers of whom gabinius 56 had received the command in syria and had brought them over to alexandria and at the conclusion of the war had left with ptolemy the father of the young king the king friends who were regents of the kingdom during the minority being informed of these things either induced by fear they afterward declared lest pompey should corrupt the king army and seize on alexandria 57 and egypt or despising his bad fortune in adversity friends common ly change to enemies in public gave favorable answer to his deputies and desired him to come to the king but secretly laid plot against him and dispatched achillas captain of the king guards man of singular boldness and lucius septimius military tribune to assassinate him being kindly addrest by them and deluded by an acquaintance with septimius because in the war with the pirates the latter had commanded company under him he embarked in small boat with few attendants and was there murdered by

genesis of catiline 59 of the city of rome i understand the founders and earliest inhabitants were the trojans who under the conduct of æneas were wandering about exiles from their country without any settled abode and with these were joined the aborigines savage race of men without laws or government free and owning control how easily these two tribes tho of different origin dissimilar language and opposite habits of life formed union when they met within the same walls is almost incredible but when their state from an accession of population and territory and an improved condition of morals showed itself tolerably ﬂourishing and powerful envy is generally the case in human affairs was the consequence of its prosperity the neighboring kings and people accordingly began to assail them in war while few only of their friends came to their support the rest struck with alarm shrunk from sharing their dangers but the romans active at home and in the ﬁeld prepared with alacrity their defense they encouraged one another and hurried to meet the enemy they protected with their arms their liberty their country and their homes and when they had at length repelled danger by valor they lent assistance to their allies and supporters and procured friendships rather by bestowing favors than by receiving them they had government regulated by laws the denomination of their government was monarchy chosen men whose bodies might be enfeebled by years but whose minds were vigorous in understanding formed the council of the state and these whether from their age or from the similarity of their duty were called fathers but afterward when the monarchical power which had been originally established the protection of liberty and the promotion of the public interest had degenerated into tyranny and oppression they changed their plan and appointed two magistrates with power only annual they conceived that by this method the human mind would be least likely to grow overbearing through want of control at this period every citizen began to seek distinction and to display his talents with greater freedom with princes the meritorious are greater objects of suspicion than the undeserving and to them the worth of others is source of alarm but when liberty was secured it is almost incredible how much the state strengthened itself in short space of time so strong passion distinction had pervaded it now the ﬁrst time the youth soon they were able to bear the toils of war acquired military skill by actual service in the camp and took pleasure rather in splendid arms and military steeds than in the society of mistresses and convivial indulgence to such men toil was unusual place was difﬁcult or inaccessible armed enemy was formida ble their valor had overcome everything but among themselves the grand rivalry was glory each sought to be ﬁrst to wound an enemy to scale wall and to be noticed while performing such an exploit distinction such this they regarded wealth honor and true nobility they were covetous of praise but liberal of money they desired competent 91 92 93 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume ii of 10

cities which tho fortiﬁed by nature they carried by assault by these two virtues intrepidity in war and equity in peace they maintained themselves and their state of their exercise of which virtues i consider these the greatest proofs that in war punishment was oftener inﬂicted on those who attacked an enemy contrary to orders and who when commanded to retreat retired too slowly from the contest than on those who had dared to desert their standards or when prest by the enemy to abandon their posts and that in peace they governed more by conferring beneﬁts than by exciting terror and when they received an injury chose rather to pardon than to revenge it but when by perseverance and integrity the republic had increased its power when mighty princes had been vanquished in war when barbarous tribes and populous states had been reduced to subjection when carthage the rival of rome dominion had been utterly destroyed and sea and land lay everywhere open to her sway fortune then began to exercise her tyranny and to introduce universal innovation to those who had easily endured toils dangers and doubtful and difﬁcult circumstances ease and wealth the objects of desire to others became burden and trouble at ﬁrst the love of money and then that of power began to prevail and these became it were the sources of every evil avarice subverted honesty integrity and other honorable principles and in their stead inculcated pride inhumanity contempt of religion and general venality ambition prompted many to become deceitful to keep one thing concealed in the breast and another ready on the tongue to estimate friendships and enmities not by their worth but according to interest and to carry rather specious countenance than an honest heart these vices at ﬁrst advanced but slowly and were sometimes restrained by correction but afterward when their infection had spread like pestilence the state was entirely changed and the government from being the most equitable and praiseworthy became rapacious and insupportable at ﬁrst however it was ambition rather than avarice that inﬂuenced the minds of vice which approaches nearer to virtue than the other of glory honor and power the worthy is desirous the worthless but the one pursues them by just methods the other being destitute of honorable qualities works with fraud and deceit but avarice has merely money its object which wise man has ever immoderately desired it is vice which if imbued with deadly poison enervates whatever is manly in body or mind it is always unbounded and insatiable and is abated neither by abundance nor by want but after lucius sulla having recovered the government by force of arms proceeded after fair commencement to pernicious termination all became robbers and plunderers some set their affections on houses others on lands his victorious troops knew neither restraint nor moderation but inﬂicted on the citizens disgraceful and inhuman outrages their rapacity was increased by the circumstance that sulla in order to secure the attachment of the forces which he had commanded in asia had treated them contrary to the practise of our ancestors with extraordinary indulgence and exemption from discipline and pleasant and luxurious quarters had easily durin g seasons of idleness enervated the minds of the soldiery then the armies of the roma n people ﬁrst became habituated to licentiousness and intemperance and began to admire statues pictures and sculptured vases to seize such objects alike in public ediﬁces and private dwellings to spoil temples and to cast off respect

tongue or their hand maintained by perjury or civil bloodshed all in ﬁne whom wickedness poverty or guilty conscience disquieted were the associates and intimate friends of catiline and if any one yet of unblemished character fell into his society he was presently rendered by daily intercourse and temptation similar and equal to the rest but it was the young whose acquaintance he chieﬂy courted their minds ductile and unsettled from their age were easily ensnared by his stratagems the passions of each according to his years appeared excited he furnished mistresses to some bought horses and

house of catiline were guilty of crimes against nature but this report arose rather from other causes than from any evidence of the fact depending on such accomplices and adherents and knowing that the load of debt was everywhere great and that the vetera ns of sulla 60 having spent their money too liberally and remembering their spoils and former victory were longing civil war catiline formed the design of overthrowing the government there was army in italy pompey was ﬁghting in distant part of the world 61 he himself had great hopes of obtaining the consulship the senate was wholly off

stone arches but its appe arance is disgusting and horrible by reason of the ﬁlth darkness and stench when lentulus had been let down into this place certain men to whom orders had been given strangled him with cord thus this patrician who was of the illustrious family of the cornelii and who had ﬁlled the ofﬁce of consul at rome met with an end suited to his character and conduct on cethegus statilius gabinius and cœparius punishment was inﬂicted in similar manner during these proceedings at rome catiline out of the entire force which he himself had brought with him and that which manlius had previously collected formed two legions ﬁlling up the cohorts far his numbers would allow and afterward any volunteers or recruits from his confederates arrived in his camp he distributed them equally throughout the cohorts and thus ﬁlled up his legions in short time with their regular number of men tho at ﬁrst he had not had more than two thousand but of his whole army only about fourth part had the proper weapons of soldiers the rest chance had equipped them carried darts spears or sharpened stakes antonius 65 approached with his army catiline directed his march

https opportunity of ﬁghting yet hoped himself shortly to ﬁnd one if his accomplices at rome should succeed in their objects slaves meanwhile of whom vast numbers had at ﬁrst ﬂocked to him he continued to reject not only depending on the strength of the conspiracy but thinking it impolitic to appear to share the cause of citizens with runagates when it was reported in his camp however that the conspiracy had been discovered at rome and that lentulus cethegus and the rest whom i have named had been put to death most of those whom the hope of plunder or the love of change had led to join in the war fell away the remainder catiline conducted over rugged mountains and by forced marches into the neighborhood of pistoria with view to escape covertly by crossroads into gaul but quintus metellus celer who with force of three legions had at that time his station at picenum suspected that catiline from the difﬁculties of his position would adopt precisely the course which we have just described when therefore he had learned catiline route from some deserters he immediately broke up his camp and took his post at the very foot of the hills at the point where catiline descent would be in his hurried march into gaul 66 nor was antonius far distant he was pursuing tho with large army yet through plainer ground and with fewer hindrances the enemy in retreat catiline when he saw that he was surrounded by mountains and by hostile forces that his schemes in the city had been unsu ccessful and that there was hope either of escape or of succor thinking it best in such circumstances to try the fortune of battle resolved upon engaging speedily possible with antonius when he had spoken he ordered after short delay the signal battle to be sounded and led down his troops in regular order to the level ground having then sent away the horses of all the cavalry in order to increase the men courage by making their danger equal he himself on foot drew up his troops suitably to their numbers and the nature of the ground plain stretched between the mountains on the left with rugged rock on the right he placed eight cohorts in front and stationed the rest of his force in close order in the rear from among these he removed all the ablest centurions the veterans and the stoutest of the common soldiers that were regularly armed into the foremost ranks he ordered caius manlius to

action could be commenced by the troops both sides with loud shout rushed together in furious charge they threw aside their missiles and fought only with their swords the veterans calling to mind

birth and former dignity rushed into the thickest of the enemy where he was slain ﬁghting to the last when the battle was over it was plainly seen what boldness and what energy of spirit had prevailed throughout the army of catiline almost everywhere every soldier after yielding up his breath covered with his corpse the spot which he had occup ied when alive few indeed whom the prætorian cohort had dispersed had fallen somewhat differently but all with wounds in front catiline himself was found far in advance of his men among the dead bodies of the enemy he still breathed and exprest in his countenance the ﬁerceness of spirit which he had shown during his life of his whole army neither in the battle nor in ﬂight was any citizen made prisoner they had spared their own lives more than those of the enemy nor did the army of the roman people obtain joyful or bloodless victory all their bravest men were either killed in the battle or left the ﬁeld severely wounded of many who went from the camp to view the ground or plunder the slain some in turning over the bodies of the enemy discovered friend others an acquaintance others relative some too recognized their enemies thus

way and appealing to the faith of gods and men he declared that their ﬂight would avail them nothing if they deserted their post if they passed the bridge and left it behind them there would soon be more of the enemy in the palatium and capitol than in the janiculum that reason he advised and charged them to demolish the bridge by their sword by ﬁre or by any means whatever that he would stand

his supply at home depriving hims elf of his own support ii hannibal crossing of the alps 70 218 from the druentia by road that lay principally through plains hannibal arrived at the alps without molestation from the gauls who inhabit those regions then tho the scene had been previously anticipated from report by which uncertainties are wont to be exaggerated yet the height of the mountains when viewed so near and the snows almost mingling with the sky the shapeless huts situated on the cliffs the cattle and beasts of burden withered by the cold the men unshorn and wildly drest all things animate and inanimate stiffened with frost and other objects more terrible to be seen than described renewed their alarm to them marching up the ﬁrst acclivities the mountaineers appeared occupying the heights overhead who if they had occupied the more concealed valleys might by rushing out suddenly to the attack have occasioned great ﬂight and havoc hannibal orders them to halt and having sent forward gauls to view the ground when he found there was passage that way he pitches his camp in the widest valley he could ﬁnd among places all rugged and precipitous then having learned from the same gauls when they had mixed in conversation with the mountaineers from whom they differed little in language and manners that the pass was only beset during the day and that at night each withdrew to his own dwelling he advanced at the dawn to the heights if designing openly and by day to force his way through the deﬁle the day then being passed in feigning different attempt from that which was in preparation when they had fortiﬁed the camp in the same place where they had halted soon he perceived that the mountaineers had descended from the heights and that the guards were withdrawn having lighted show greater number of ﬁres than was proportioned to the number that remained and having left the baggage in the camp with the cavalry and the principal part of the infantry he himself with party of soldiers consisting of all the most courageous of his troops rapidly cleared the deﬁle and took posts on those very heights which the enemy had occupied at dawn of light the next day the camp broke up and the rest of the army began to move forward the mountaineers on signal being given were now assembling from their forts to their usual station when they suddenly behold part of the enemy overhanging 108 109 110 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume ii of 10 rome https from above in possession of their former position and the others passing along the road both these objects presented at the same time to the eye and the mind made them stand motionless little while but when they afterward saw the confusion in the pass and that the marching body was thrown into disorder by the tumult which itself created principally from the horses being terriﬁed thinking that whatever terror they added would sufﬁce the destruction of the enemy they scramble along the dangerous rocks being accustomed alike to pathless and circuitous ways then indeed the carthaginians were opposed at once by the enemy and by the difﬁculties of the ground and each striving to escape ﬁrst from the danger there was more ﬁghting among themselves than with their opponents the horses in particular created danger in the lines which being terriﬁed by the discordant clamors that the groves and reechoing valleys augmented fell into confusion and if by chance struck or wounded they were so dismayed that they occasioned great loss both of men and baggage of every description and the pass on both sides was broken and precipitous this tumult threw many down to an immense depth some even of the armed men but the beasts of burden with their loads were rolled down like the fall of some vast fabric tho these disasters were shocking to view hannibal however held his place little and kept his men together lest he might augment the tumult and disorder but afterward when he saw the line broken and that there was danger that he should bring over his army preserved to purpose if deprived of their baggage he hastened down from the higher ground and tho he had routed the enemy by the ﬁrst onset alone he at the same time increased the disorder in his own army but that tumult was composed in moment after the roads were cleared by the ﬂight of the mountaineers and presently the whole army was conducted through not only without being disturbed but almost in silence he then took fortiﬁed place which was the capital of that district and the little villages that lay around it and fed his army three days with the corn and cattle he had taken and during these three days the soldiers were neither obstructed by the mountaineers who had been daunted by the ﬁrst engagement nor yet much by the ground he made considerable way he then came to another state abounding mountainous country with inhabitants where he was nearly overcome not by open war but by his own arts of treachery and ambuscade some old men governors of forts came deputies to the carthaginian professing that having been warned by the useful example of the calamities of others they wished rather to experience the friendship than the hostilities of the carthaginians they would therefore obediently execute his commands and begged that he would accept of supply of provisions guides of his march and hostages the sincerity of their promises hannibal when he had answered them in friendly manner thinking that they should neither be rashly trusted nor yet rejected lest if repulsed they might openly become enemies having received the hostages whom they proffered and made use of the provisions which they of their own accord brought down to the road followed their guides by means among people with whom he was at peace but with his line of march in close order the elepha nts and cavalry formed the van of the marching body he himself examining everything around and intent on every circumstance followed with the choicest of his infantry when they came into narrower pass lying on one side beneath an overhanging emin ence the barbarians rising at once on all sides from their ambush assail them in front and rear both at close quarters and from distance and roll down huge stones on the army the most numerous body of men prest on the rear against whom the infantry facing about and directing their attack made it very obvious that had not the rear of the army been well supported great loss must have been sustained in that pass even it was they came to the extremity of danger and almost to destruction while hannibal hesitated to lead down his division into the deﬁle because tho he himself was protection to the cavalry he had not in the same way left any aid to the infantry in the rear the mountaineers charging obliquely and on having broken through the middle of the army took possession of the road and one night was spent by hannibal without his cavalry and baggage 111 112 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume ii of 10 rome https the standards being moved forward at daybreak when the army proceeded slowly over all places entirely blocked up with snow and languor and despair strongly appeared in the countenances of all hannibal having advanced before the standards and ordered the soldiers to halt on certain eminen ce whence there was prospect far and wide pointed out to them italy and the plains of the po extending themselves beneath the alpine mountains and said that they were now surmounting not only the ramparts of italy but also of the city of rome that the rest of the journey would be smooth and that after one or at most second battle they would have the citadel and capital of italy in their power and possession the army then began to advance the enemy now making attempts beyond petty thefts opportunity offered but the journey proved much more difﬁcult than it had been in the ascent the declivity of the alps being generally shorter on the side of italy is consequently steeper nearly all the road was precipitous narrow and slippery so that neither those who made the least stumble could prevent themselves from falling nor when fallen remain in the same place but rolled both men and beasts of burden one upon another they then came to rock much more narrow and formed of such perpendicular ledges that soldier carefully making the attempt and clinging with his hands to the bushes and roots around could with difﬁculty lower himself down the ground even before very steep by nature had been broken by recent falling away of the earth into precipice of nearly thousand feet in depth here when the cavalry halted if at the end of their journey it was announced to hannibal wondering what obstructed the march that the rock was impassable having then gone himself to view the place it seemed clear to him that he must lead his army by however great circuit through the pathless and untrodden regions around it but this route also proved impracticable while the new snow of moderate depth remained on the old which had not been remov ed their footsteps were planted with ease they walked upon the new snow which was soft and not too deep but when it was dissolved by the trampling of so many men and beasts of burden they then walked on the bare ice below and through the dirty ﬂuid formed by the melting snow here there was wretched struggle both on account of the slippery ice not affording any hold to the step and giving way beneath the foot more readily by reason of the slope and whether they assisted themselves in rising by their hands or their knees their supports themselves giving way they would tumble again nor were there any stumps or roots near by pressing against which one might with hand or foot support oneself so that they only ﬂoundered on the smooth ice and amidst the melted snow the beasts of burden sometimes also cut into this lower ice by merely treading upon it at others they broke it completely through by the violence with which they struck in their hoofs in their struggling so that most of them if taken in trap stuck in the hardened and deeply frozen ice at length after the men and beasts of burden had been fatigued to purpose the camp was pitched on the summit the ground being cleared that purpose with great difﬁculty so much snow was there to be dug out and carried away the soldi ers being then set to make way down the cliff by which alone passage could be effected and it being necessary that they should cut through the rocks having felled and lopped number of large trees which grew around they make huge pile of timber and soon strong wind ﬁt exciting the ﬂames arose they set ﬁre to it and pouring vinegar on the heated stones they render them soft and crumbling they then open way with iron instruments through the rock thus heated by the ﬁre and soften its declivities by gentle windings so that not only the beasts of burden but also the elephants could be led down it four days were spent about this rock the beasts nearly perishing through hunger the summits of the mountains are the most part bare and if there is any pasture the snows bury it the lower parts contain valleys and some sunny hills and rivulets ﬂowing beside woods and scenes more worthy of the abode of man there the beasts of burden were sent out to pasture and rest given three days to the men fatigued with forming the passage they then descended into the plains the country and the dispositions of the inhabitants being now less rugged 113 114

having crossed the alps in ﬁfteen days what number of forces hannibal had when he had passed into italy is by means agreed upon by authors those who state them at the highest make mention of hundred thousand foot and twenty thousand horse those who state them at the lowest of twenty thousand foot and six thousand horse lucius cincius alim entus who relates that he was made prisoner by hannibal would inﬂuence most an authority did he not confound the number by adding the gauls and ligurians including these who it is more probable ﬂocked to him afterward some authors assert he says that eighty thousand foot and ten thousand horse were brought into italy and that he had heard from hannibal himself that after crossing the rhone he had lost thousand men and an immense number of horses and other beasts of burden among the taurini 71 the next nation to the gauls he descended into italy iii hannibal and scipio at zama 72 202 hannibal had by this time arrived at adrumetum 73 from which place after employing few days there in refreshing his soldiers who had suffered from the motion by sea he proceeded by forced marches to zama roused by the alarming statements of messengers who brought word that all the country round carthage was ﬁlled with armed troops zama is distant from carthage ﬁve days journey some spies whom he had sent out from this place being intercepted by the roman guard and brought before scipio he directed that they should be handed over to the military tribunes and after having been desired fearlessly to survey everything he conducted them through the camp wherever they chose then asking them whether they had examined everything to their satisfaction he assigned them an escort and sent them back to hannibal hannibal received none of the circumstances which were reported to him with feelings of joy they brought word that it happened masinissa had joined the enemy that very day with six thousand infantry and four thousand horse but he was principally dispirited by the conﬁdence of his enemy which doubtless was not conceived without some ground accordingly tho he himself was the originator of the war and by his coming had upset the truce which had been entered into and cut off all hopes of treaty yet concluding that more favorable terms might be obtained if he solicited peace while his strength was unimpaired than when vanquished he sent message to scipio requesting permission to confer with him their armed attendants having retired to an equal distance they met each attended by one interpreter being the greatest generals not only of their own times but of any to be found in the records of the times preceding them and equal to any of the kings or generals of any nation whatever when they came within sight of each other they remained silent short time thunderstruck it were with mutual admiration at length hannibal thus began since fate hath so ordained it that i who was the ﬁrst to wage war upon the romans and who have so often had victory almost within my reach should voluntarily come to sue peace i rejoice that it is you above all others from whom it is my lot to solicit it to you also amidst the many distinguished events of your life it will not be esteemed one of the least glorious that hannibal to whom the gods had so often granted victory over the roman generals should have yielded to you and that you should have put an end to this war which has been rendere d remarkable by your calamities before it was by ours in this also fortune would seem to have exhibited disposition to sport with events it was when your father was consul that i ﬁrst took up arms he was the ﬁrst 116 117 118 119 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume ii of 10 rome https general with whom i engaged in pitched battle and it is to his son that i now come unarmed to solicit peace it were indeed most to have been desired that the gods should have put such dispositions into the minds of our fathers that you should have been content with the empire of italy and we with that of africa nor indeed even to you are sicily and sardinia of sufﬁcient value to compensate you the loss of so many ﬂeets so many armies so many and such distinguished generals but what is past may be more easily censured than retrieved in our attempts to acquire the possessions of others we have been compelled to ﬁght our own and not only have you had war in italy and we also in africa but you have beheld the standards and arms of your enemies almost in your gates and on your walls and we now from the walls of carthage distinctly hear the din of roman camp what therefore we should most earnestly deprecate and you should most devoutly wish is now the case peace is proposed at time when you have the advantage we who negotiate it are the persons whom it most concerns to obtain it and we are persons arrangements be they what they will our states will ratify all we want is disposition not averse from peaceful counsels so far relates to myself time i am returning to that country an old man which i left boy 74 and prosperity and adversity have so schooled that i am more inclined to follow reason than fortune but i fear your youth and uninterrupted good fortune both of which are apt to inspire degree of conﬁdence ill compor ting with paciﬁc counsels rarely does that man consider the uncertainty of events whom fortune hath never deceived what i was at trasimenus and at cannæ that you are this day invested with command when you had scarcely yet attained the military age tho all your enterprises were of the boldest description in instance has fortune deserted you avenging the death of your father and uncle you have derived from the calamity of your house the high honor of distinguished valor and ﬁlial duty you have recovered spain which had been lost after driving thence four carthaginian armies when electe d consul tho all others wanted courage to defend italy you crossed over into africa wher having cut to pieces two armies having at once captured and burned two camps in the same hour having made prisoner syphax most powerful king and seized so many towns of his dominions and so many of ours you have dragged from italy the possession of which i had ﬁrmly held now sixteen years formerly in this same country marcu s atilius would have formed one among the few instances of good fortune and valor if when victorious he had granted peace to our fathers when they requested it but by not setting any bounds to his success and not checking good fortune which was elating him he fell with degree of ignominy proportioned to his elevation it is indeed the right of him who grants and not of him who solicits it to dictate the terms of peace but perhaps we may not be unworthy to impose upon ourselves the ﬁne we not refuse that all those possessions on account of which the war was begun should be sardinia spain with all the islands lying in any part of the sea between africa and italy let us carthaginians conﬁned within the shores of africa behold you since such is the pleasure of the gods extending your empire over foreign nations both by sea and land i can not deny that you have reason to suspect the carthaginian faith in consequence of their insincerity lately in soliciting peace and while awaiting the decision the sincerity with which peace will be observed depends much scipio on the person by whom it is sought your senate i hear refused to grant peace in some measure because the deputies were deﬁcient in respectability it is i hannibal who now solicit peace who would neither ask it unless i believed it expedient nor will i fail to observe it the same reason of expedience on account of which i have solicited it and in the same manner i because the war was commenced by brought it to pass that one regretted it till the gods began to regard with displeasure so will i also exert myself that one may regret the peace procured by my means in answer to these things the roman general spoke nearly to the following effect i was aware that it was in consequence of the expectation of your arrival that the carthaginians violated the existing faith of the truce and broke off all hope of peace nor indeed you conceal the fact inasmuch you artfully withdraw from the former conditions of 120 121 122 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume ii of 10 rome https every concession except what relates to those things which have long time been in our own power but it is your object that your countrymen should be sensible how great burden they are relieved from by your means so it is incumbent upon to endeavor that they may not receive the reward of their perﬁdy the concessions which they formerly stipulated by expunging them now from the conditions of the peace tho you not deserve to be allowed the same conditions before you now request even to be beneﬁted by your treachery neither did our fathers ﬁrst make war respecting sicily nor did we respecting spain in the form er case the danger which threatened our allies the mamertines and in the present the destruction of saguntum girded us with just and pious arms that you were the aggressors both you yourselves confess and the gods are witnesses who determined the issue of the former war and who are now determining and will determine the issue of the present according to right and justice to myself i am not forgetful of the instability of human affairs but consider the inﬂuence of fortune and am well aware that all our measures are liable to thousand casualties but i should acknowledge that my conduct would savor of insolence and oppression if i rejected you on your coming in person to solicit peace before i crossed over into africa you voluntarily retiring from italy and after you had embarked your troops so now when i have dragged you into africa almost by manual force notwithstand ing your resistance and evasions i am not bound to treat you with any respect wherefore if in addition to those stipulations on which it was considered that peace would at that time have been agreed upon and what they are you are informed compensation is proposed having seized our ships together with their stores during truce and the violence offered to our ambassadors i shall then have matter to lay before my council but if these things also appear oppressive prepare war since you could not brook the conditions of peace thus without effecting an accommodation when they had returned from the conference to their armies they informed them that words had been bandied to purpose that the question must be decided by arms and that they must accept that fortune which the gods assigned them when they had arrived at their camps they both issued orders that their soldiers should get their arms in readiness and prepare their minds the ﬁnal contest in which if fortune should favor them they would continue victorious not single day but forever before tomorrow night they said they would know whether rome or carthage should give laws to the world and that neither africa nor italy but the whole world would be the prize of victory that the dangers which threatened those who had the misfortune to be defeated were propo rtioned to the rewards of the victors the romans had not any place of refuge in an unknown and foreign land and immediate destruction seemed to await carthage if the troops which formed her last reliance were defeated to this important contest the day following two generals by far the most renowned of any and belonging to two of the most powerful nations in the world advanced either to crown or overthrow on that day the many honors they had previously acquired while the general was busily employed among the carthaginians and the captains of the respective nations among their countrymen most of them employing interpreters among troops intermixed with those of different nations the trumpets and cornets of the romans sounded and such clamor arose that the elephants especially those in the left wing turned round upon their own party the moors and numidians masinissa had difﬁculty in increasing the alarm of the terriﬁed enemy and deprived them of the aid of their cavalry in that wing few howe ver of the beasts which were driven against the enemy and were not turned back through fear made great havoc among the ranks of the velites tho not without receiving many wounds themselves when the velite s retiring to the companies had made way the elephants that they might not be trampl ed down they dischar ged their darts at the beasts exposed they were to wounds on both sides those in the van also keeping up continual dischar ge of javelins until driven out of the roman line by the weapons which fell upon them from all quarters these elephants also 123 124 125 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume ii of 10 rome https to ﬂight even the cavalry of the carthaginians posted in their right wing lælius when he saw the enemy in disorder struck additional terror into them in their confusion the carthaginian line was deprived of the cavalry on both sides when the infantry who were now not match the romans in conﬁdence or strength engaged in addition to this there was one circumstance triﬂing in itself but at the same time producing important consequences in the action on the part of the romans the shout was uniform and on that account louder and more terriﬁc while the voices of the enemy consisting they did of many nations of different languages were dissonant the romans used the stationary kind of ﬁght pressing upon the enemy with their own weight and that of their arms but on the other side there was more of skirmishing and rapid movement than force accordingly on the ﬁrst charge the romans immediately drove back the line of their opponents then pushing them with their elbows and the bosses of their shields and pressing forward into the places from which they had pushed them they advanced considerable space tho there had been one to resist them those who formed the rear urging forward those in front when they perceived the line of the enemy giving way which circumstance itself gave great additional force in repelling them on the side of the enemy the second line consisting of the africans and carthaginians were so far from supporting the ﬁrst line when giving ground that on the contrary they even retired lest their enemy by slaying those who made ﬁrm resistance should penetrate to themselves also accordingly the auxiliaries suddenly turned their backs and facing about upon their own party ﬂed some of them into the second line while others slew those who did not receive them into their ranks since before they did not support them and now refused to receive them and now there were in manner two contests going on together the carthaginians being compelled to ﬁght at once with the enemy and with their own party not even then however did they receive into their line the terriﬁed and exasperated troops but closing their ranks drove them out of the scene of action to the wings and the surrounding plain lest they should mingle these soldiers terriﬁed with defeat and wounds with that part of their line which was ﬁrm and fresh but such heap of men and arms had ﬁlled the space in which the auxiliaries little while ago had stood that it was almost more difﬁcult to pass through it than through close line of troops the spearmen therefore who formed the front line pursuing the enemy each could ﬁnd way through the heap of ﬁrms and men and streams of blood threw into complete disorder the battalions and companies the standards also of the principes had begun to waver when they saw the line before them driven from their ground scipio perceiving this promptly ordered the signal to be given the spearmen to retreat and having taken his wounded into the rear brought the principes and triarii to the wings in order that the line of spearmen in the center might be more strong and secure thus fresh and renewed battle commenced inasmuch they had penetrated to their real antagonists men equal to them in the nature of their arms in their experience in war in the fame of their achievements and the greatness of their hopes and fears but the romans were superior both in numbers and courage they had now routed both the cavalry and the elephants and having already defeated the front line were ﬁghting against the second hannibal after performing this it were his last work of valor

contributes an equal share to human society but the one is born to command the other to obey the other philosophers deal with us gently and coaxingly just our accustomed family physicians usually with our bodies treating them not by the best and shortest method but by that which we allow them to employ whereas the stoics adop t manly course and not care about its appea ring attractive to those who are entering upon it but that it should quickly possible take us out of the world and lead us to that lofty eminence which is so far beyond the scope of any missile weapon that it is above the reach of fortune herself but the way by which we are asked to climb is steep and uneven what then can heights be reached by level path yet they are not so sheer and precipitous some think it is only the ﬁrst part that has rocks and cliffs and apparent outlet just many hills seen from long way off appear abruptly steep and joined together because the distance deceives our sight and then we draw nearer those very hills which our mistaken eyes had made into one gradually unfold themselves those parts which seemed precipitous from afar assume gently sloping outline when just now mention was made of marcus cato you whose mind revolts at injustice were indignant at cato own age having so little understood him at its having allotted place below vatinius to one who towered above both cæsar and pompey it seemed shameful to you that when he spoke against some law in the forum his toga was torn from him and that he was hustled through the hands of mutinous mob from the rostra far the arch of fabius 77 enduring all the bad language spitting and other insults of the frantic rabble i then answered that you had good cause to be anxious on behalf of the commonwealth which publius clodius on the one side vatinius and all the greatest scoundrels on the other were putting up sale and carried away by their blind covetousness did not understand that when they sold it they themselves were sold with it i bade you have fears on behalf of cato himself because the wise man can neither receive injury insult and it is more certain that the immortal gods have given cato pattern of wise man to us than that they gave ulysses or hercules to the earlier ages these our stoics have declared were wise men unconquered by labors despisers of pleasure and superior to all terrors cato did not slay wild beasts whose pursuit belongs to huntsmen and countrymen nor did he exterminate fabulous creatures with ﬁre and sword or live in times when it was possible to believe that the heavens could be supported on the shoulders of one man in an age which had thrown off its belief in antiquated superstitions and had carried material knowledge to its highest point he had to struggle against that monster ambition against that boundless lust power which the whole world divided among three men could not satisfy he alone withstood the vices of state sinking into ruin through its own bulk he upheld the falling commonwealth far it could be upheld by one man hand until at last his support was withdrawn and he shared the crash which he had so long averted and perished together with that from which it was impious to separate cato did not outlive freedom nor did freedom outlive cato think you that the people could any wrong to such man when they tore away his prætorship or his toga when they bespattered his sacred head with the rinsings of their mouths the wise man is safe and injury or insult can touch him consider now whether any thief or false accuser or headstrong neighbor or rich man enjoying the power conferred by childless old age could any injury to this man from whom neither war nor an enemy whose profession was the noble art of battering city walls could take away anything amid the ﬂash of swords on all sides and the riot of the plundering soldiery amid the ﬂames and blood and ruin of the fallen city amid the crash of temples falling upon their gods one man was

now wickedness is not stronger than virtue therefore the wise man can not be hurt only the bad attempt to injure the good good men are at peace among themselves bad ones are equally mischievous to the good and to one another if man can not be hurt by one weaker than himself and bad man be weaker than good one and the good have injury to dread except from one unlike themselves then injury takes

that not even they altho they were styled sons of gods and fathers of gods to come could exercise the same power over their own fortunes which they did over those of others the emperor augustus lost his children and his grandchildren and after all the family of cæsar had perished was obliged to prop his empty house by adopting son yet he bore his losses bravely tho he were already personally

adopted yet he himself pronounced panegyric upon his son from the rostra and stood in full view of the corpse which merely had curtain on one side to prevent the eyes of the high priest resting upon the dead body and did not change his countenance tho all the romans wept he gave sejanus who stood by his side proof of how patiently he could endure the loss of his relatives see you not what numbers

can it be to lengthen that which however much you add to it will never be much more than nothing we can only make our lives long by one expedient that is by being satisﬁed with their length you may tell of men whose length of days has been celebrated by tradition you may assign hundred and ten years apiece to them yet when you allow your mind to conceive the idea of eternity there will be

an answer there is fear that you should suddenly forget your own character indeed excess of happiness makes men greedy and our desires are never so moderate to be bounded by what they have obtained great successes become the to greater ones and those who have obtained more than they hoped entertain even more extravagant hopes than before yet by all your countrymen we hear it admitted that they are now happy and moreover that nothing can be added to the blessings that they enjoy except that they should be eternal many circumstances force this admission from them altho it is the one which men are least willing to make we enjoy profound and prosperous peace the power of the law has been openly asserted in the sight of all men and raised beyond the reach of any viole nt interference the form of our government is so happy to contain all the essentials of liberty except the power of destroying itself it is nevertheless your clemency which is most especially admired by the high and low alike every man enjoys or hopes to enjoy the other blessings of your rule according to the measure of his own personal good fortune whereas from your clemency all hope alike one has so much conﬁdence in his innocence not to feel glad that in your presence stands clemency which is ready to make allowance human errors since i have made mention of the gods i shall state the best model on which prince may

harshly pursue us to our ruin in that case what king will be safe whose limbs will not be torn asunder and collected by the if on the other hand the gods are placable and kind and not at once avenge

of the world is more beauteous and pleasant to the eyes on ﬁne calm day or when everything is shaken with frequen t thunder and when lightning ﬂashes on all sides yet the appearance of peaceful and constitutional reign is the same that of the calm and brilliant sky cruel reign is disordered and hidden in darkness and while all shake with terror at the sudden explosions not even he who caused all this disturbance escapes unharmed it is easier to ﬁnd excuses private men who obstinately claim their rights possibly they may have been injured and their rage may spring from their wrongs besides this they fear to be despised and not to return the injuries which they have received looks like weakness rather than clemency but one who can easily avenge himself if he neglects to so is certain to gain praise goodness of heart those who are born in humble station may with greater freedom exercise violence go to law engage in quarrels and indulge their angry passions even blows count little

augustus when an old man or when growing old in his youth he was hasty and passionate and did many things upon which he looked back with regret one will venture to compare the rule of the blest augustus to the mildness of your own even if your youth be compared with his more than ripe old age he was gentle and placable but it was after he had dyed the sea at actium with roman blood after he had wrecked both the enemy ﬂeet and his own at sicily after the holocaust of perusia and the proscriptions but i not call it clem ency to be wearied of cruelty true clemency cæsar is that which you display which has not begun from remorse at its past ferocity on which there is stain which has never shed the blood of your countrymen this when combined with unlimited power shows the truest and love of the human race of one self not corrupted by any low desires any extravagant ideas or any of the bad examples of former emperors into trying by actual experiment how great tyranny you would be allowed to exercise over his countrymen but inclining rather to blunting your sword of empire you cæsar have granted us the boon of keeping our state free from bloodshed and that of which you boast that you have not caused one single drop of blood to ﬂow in any part of the world is all the more magnanimous and marvelous because one ever had the power of the sword placed in his hands at an earlier age clemency then makes empires besides being their most trustworthy means of preservation why have legitimate sovereigns grown old on the throne and bequeathed their power to their children and grandchildren while the sway of despotic usurpers is both hateful and ed what is the difference between the tyrant and the their outward symbols of authority and their powers are the it be that tyrants take delight in cruelty whereas kings are only cruel good reasons and because they can not help it nothing can be imagined which is more becoming to sovereign than clemency by whatever title and right he may be set over his fellow citizens the greater his power the more beautiful and admirable he will confess his clemency to be there is reason why power should any harm if only it be wielded in accordance with the laws of nature nature herself has conceived the idea of king you may learn from various animals and especially from bees among whom the king cell is the roomiest and is placed in the most central and safest part of the hive moreover he does work but employs himself in keeping the others up to their work if the king be lost the entire swarm disperses they never endure to have more than one king at time and ﬁnd out which is the better by making them ﬁght with one another moreover the king is distinguished by his statelier appearance being both larger and more brilliantly colored than the other bees the most remarkable distinction however is the following bees are very ﬁerce and their size are the most pugnacious of creatures and leave their stings in the wounds which they make but the king himself has sting nature does not wish him to be savage or to seek revenge at so dear rate and so has deprived him of his weapon and disarmed his rage she has offered him pattern to great sovereigns she is wont to practise herself in small matters and to scatter abroad tiny models of the hugest structures we ought to be ashamed of not learning lesson in behavior from these small creatures man who has so much more power of doing harm than they ought to show correspondingly greater amount of would that human beings were subject to the same law and that their anger destroyed itself together with its instruments so that they could only inﬂict wound once and would not make use of the strength of others to carry out their hatreds their fury would soon grow faint if it carried its own punishment with it and could only give rein to its violence at the risk of death even it is however one can exercise it with safety he must needs feel much fear he hopes to cause he must watch every one movements and even when his enemies are not laying violent hands upon him he must bear in mind that they are plotting to so and he can not have single moment

will render king safe even upon an open plain the one fortiﬁcation which can not be stormed is the love of his countrymen the reason why cruelty is the most hatef ul of all vices is that it goes ﬁrst beyond ordinary limits and then beyond those of humanity that it devises new kinds of punishments calls ingenuity to aid it in inventing devices varying and lengthening men torture and takes delight in their sufferings this accursed disease of the mind reaches its highest pitch of madness when cruelty itself turns into pleasure and the act of killing man becomes enjoyment such ruler is soon cast down from his throne his life is attempted by poison one day and by the sword the next he is exposed to many dangers there are men to whom he is dangerous and he is sometimes destroyed by the plots of individuals and at others by general insurrection whole communities are not roused to action by unimportant outrages on private persons but cruelty which takes wider range and from which one is safe

that are domesticated with mankind there are many circumstances that are deserving of being known among these there are more particularly that most faithful friend of man the dog and the horse we have an account of dog that fought against band of robbers in defending its master and altho it was pierced with wounds still it would not leave the body from which it drove away all birds and beasts another dog in epirus recognized the murderer of its master in the midst of an assemblage of people and by biting and barking at him extorted from him confession of his crime king of the garamantes 87

before it but the dog lay down and regarded them with kind of immovable contempt the noble spirit of the general became irritated by the sluggishness thus manifested by an animal of such vast bulk and he ordered it to be killed the report of this reached the king who accordingly sent another dog and at the same time sent word that its powers were to be tried not upon small animals but upon the lion or the elephant adding that he had originally but two and that if this one were put to death the race would be extinct alexander without delay procured lion which in his presence was instant ly torn to pieces he then ordered an elephant to be brought and never was he more delighted with any spectacle the dog bristling up its hair all over the body began by thundering forth loud barking and then

either preceded or succeeded him he contributed more to painting than all the others together and even went so far to publish some treatise s on the principles of the art the great point of artistic merit with him was his singular charm of gracefulness and this too tho the greatest of painters were his contemporaries in admiring their works and bestowing high eulogiums upon them he used to say that there was still wanting in them that equal of beauty so peculiar to himself and known to the greeks charis others he said had acquired all the other requisites of perfection but in this one point he himself had equal he also asserted his claim to another great point of merit admiring picture by protogenes which bore evident marks of unbounded laboriousness and the most minute ﬁnish he remarked that in every respect protogenes was fully his equal or perhaps his superior except in this that he himself knew when to take his hand off memorable lesson which teaches us that may be productive of bad results his candor too was equal to his talent he acknowledged the superiority of melanthius 95 in his grouping and of asclepiodorus in the niceness of his measurements or in other words the distances that ought to be left between the objects represented circumstance that happened to him in connection with protogenes 96 is worthy of notice the latter was living at rhodes when apelles disembarked there desirous of seeing the works of man whom he had hitherto only known by reputation accordingly he repaired at once to the studio protog enes was not at home but there happen ed to be large panel upon the easel ready painting with an old woman who was left in charge to his inquiries she made answer that protogenes was not at home and then asked whom she should name the visitor here he is was the reply of apelles and seizing brush he traced with color upon the panel an outline of singularly minute ﬁneness upon his return the old woman mentioned to protogenes what had happened the artist it is said upon remarking the delicacy of the touch instantly exclaimed that apelles must have been the visitor that other person was capable of executing anything so exquisitely perfect so saying he traced within the same outline still ﬁner outline but with another color and then took his departure with instructions to the woman to show it to the stranger if he returned and to let him know that this was the person whom he had come to see 165 166 167 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume ii of 10 rome https happened he returned and vexed at ﬁnding himself thus surpassed he took up another color and split both of the outlines leaving possibility of anything ﬁner being executed upon seeing this protogenes admitted that he was defeated and at once ﬂew to the harbor to look his guest he thought proper too to transmit the panel to posterity just it was and it always continued to be held in the highest admiration by in particular i am told that it was burned in the ﬁrst ﬁre which took place at cæsar palace on the palatine hill but in former times i have often stopt to admire it upon its vast surface it contained nothing whatever except the three outlines so remarkably ﬁne to escape the sight among the most elaborate works of numerous other artists it had all the appearance of blank space and yet by that very fact it attracted the notice of every one and was held in higher estimation than any other painting there it was custom with apelles to which he most tenaciously adhered never to let any day pass however busy he might be without exercising himself by tracing some outline or other practise which has now passed into proverb it was also practise with him when he had completed work to exhibit it to the view of the in some exposed place while he himself concealed behind the picture would listen to the criticisms that were passed upon it it being his opinion that the judgment of the public was preferable to his own being the more discerning of the two it was under these circumstances they say that he was censured by shoemaker having represented the shoes with one too little the next day the shoemaker quite proud at seeing the former error corrected thanks to his advice began to criticize the leg upon which apelles full of indignation popped his head out and reminded him that shoemaker should give opinion beyond the piece of advice which has equally passed into proverbial saying in fact apelles was person of great amenity of circumstance which rendered him particularly agreeable to alexander the great who would often come to his studio he had forbidden himself by public edict already stated to be represented by any other artist on one occasion however when the prince was in his studio talking great deal about painting without knowing anything about it apelles quietly begged that he would quit the subject telling him that he would get laughed at by the boys who were there grinding the colors so great was the inﬂuence which he rightfully possest over monarch who was otherwise of an irascible temperament and yet irascible he was alexander conferred upon him very signal mark of the high estimation in which he held him having in his admiration of her extraordinary beauty engaged apelles to paint pancaste most beloved of all his artist while so engaged fell in love with her upon which alexander perceiving this to be the ease made him present of her thus showing himself tho great king in courage still greater one in action redounding less to his honor than any of his victories superior to all

artist made two statues of the goddess and offered them both sale one of them was represented with drapery and this reason was preferred by the people of cos who had the choice the second was offered them at the same price but on the grounds of propriety and modesty they thought ﬁt to choose the other upon this the cnidians purchased the rejected statue and immensely superior has it always been held in general estimation at later period king nicomedes wished to purchase this statue of the cnidians and made them an offer to pay off the whole of their public debt which was very large they preferred however to submit to any extremity rather than part with it and with good reason by this statue praxiteles has perpetuated the glory of cnidos the little temple in which it is placed is open on all sides so that the beauties of the statue admit of being seen from every point of arrangement which was favored by the goddess herself it is generally believed among all nations which the fame

94 95 96 97 98 171 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume ii of 10 rome https that an orator should be good because should the power of speaking be support to evil nothing would be more pernicious than eloquence alike to public concerns and private and i myself who far is in my power strive to contribute something to the faculty of the orator should deserve very ill of the world since i should furnish arms not soldiers but robbers may i not draw an argument from the condition of mankind nature herself in bestowing on man that which she seems to have granted him preeminently and by which she appears to have distinguished us from all other animals would have acted not parent but stepmother if she had designed the faculty of speech to be the promote r of crime the oppressor of innocence and the enemy of truth it would have been better us to have been born dumb and to have been left destitute of reasoning powers than to have received endowme nts from providence only to turn them to the destruction of one another my judgment carries still further i not only say that he who would answer my idea of an orator must be good man but that man unless he be good can ever be an orator to an orator discernment and prudence are necessary but we can certainly not allow discernment to those who when the ways of virtue and vice are set before them prefer to follow that of vice nor can we allow them prudence since they subject themselves by the unforeseen consequences of their actions often to the heaviest penalty of the law and always to that of an evil conscience but if it be not only truly said by the wise but always justly believed by the vulgar that man is vicious who is not also foolish fool assuredly will never become an orator it is to be further considered that the mind can not be in condition pursuing the most noble of studies unless it be entirely free from vice not only because there can be communion of good and evil in the same breast and to meditate at once on the best things and the worst is more in the power of the same mind than it is possible the same man to be at once virtuous and vicious but also because mind intent on so arduous study should be exempt from all other cares even such are unconnected with vice then and then only when it is free and master of itself and when other object harasses and distracts its attention will it be able to keep in view the end to which it is devoted but if an inordinate attention to an estate too anxious pursuit of wealth indulgence in the pleasures of the chase and the devotion of our days to public spectacles rob our studies of much of our time whatever time is given to one thing is lost to another what effect must we suppose that ambition avarice and envy will produce whose excitements are so violent even to disturb our sleep and our dreams nothing indeed is so preoccupied so unsettled so torn and lacerated with such numerous and various passions bad mind when it intends evil it is agitated with hope care and anxiety and when it has attained the object of its wickedness it is tormented with uneasiness and the dread of every kind of punishment man certainly will doubt that it is the object of all oratory that what is stated to the judge may appear to him to be true and just and which of the two let ask will produce such conviction with the greater ease the good man or the bad good man doubtless will speak of what is true and honest with greater frequency but even if from being inﬂuenced by some call of duty he endeavors to support what is fallacious case which i shall show may sometimes occur he must still be heard with greater credit than bad man but with bad men on the other hand dissimulation sometimes fails well through their contempt the opinion of mankind through their ignorance of what is right hence they assert without modesty and maintain their assertions without shame and in attempting what evidently can not be accomplished there appear s in them repulsive obstinacy and useless persev erance bad men well in their pleadings in their lives entertain dishonest expectations and it often happens that even when they speak the truth belief is not accorded them and the employment of advocates of such character is regarded proof of the badness of cause i must however notice those objections to my opinion which appear to be clamored forth it were by the general consent of the multitude was not then demosthenes they ask great orator yet we have heard that he was not good man was not cicero great 172 173 174 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume ii of 10 rome https yet many have thrown censure upon his character to such questions how shall i answer great displeasure is likely to be shown at any reply whatever and the ears of my audience require ﬁrst to be propitiated the character of demosthenes let say does not appear to deserving of such severe reprehension that i should believe all the calumnies that are heaped upon him by his enemies especially when i read his excellent plans the beneﬁt of his country and the honorable termination of his life nor i see that the feeling of an upright citizen was in any respect wanting to cicero proofs of his integrity may be mentioned his consulship in which he conducted himself with so much honor his honorable administration of his province his refusal to be one of the twenty commissioners and during the civil wars which fell with great severity on his times his uprightness of mind which was never swayed either by hope or by fear from adhering to the better party or the supporters of the commonwealth he is thought by some to have been deﬁcient in courage but he has given an excellent reply to this charge when he says that he was timid not in encountering dangers but in taking precautions against them an assertion of which he proved the truth at his death to which he submitted with the noblest fortitude but even should the height of virtue have been wanting to these eminent men i shall reply to those who ask whether they were orators the stoics reply when they are asked whether zeno cleanthes and chrysippus were wise men they say that they were great and deserving of veneration but that they did not attain the highest excellence of which human nature is susceptible pythagoras desired to be called not wise like those who preceded him but lover of wisdom i however in speaking of cicero have often said according to the common mode of speech and shall continue to say that he was perfect orator we term our friends in ordinary discourse good and prudent men tho such epithets can be justly given only to the perfectly wise but when i have to speak precisely and in conformity with the exactness of truth i shall expre ss myself longing to see such an orator he himself also longed to see tho i acknowledge that cicero stood at the head of eloquence and that i can scarcely ﬁnd passage in his speeches to which anything can be added however many i might ﬁnd which i may imagine that he would have pruned the learned have in general been of opinion that he had numerous excellences and some faults and he himself says that he had cut off most of his juvenile exuberance yet since he did not claim to himself tho he had mean opinion of his merits the praise of perfection and since he might certainly have spoken better if longer life had been granted him and more tranquil season composition i may not unreasonably believe that the summit of excellence was not attained by him to which notwithstanding man made nearer approaches if i had thought otherwise i might have maintained my opinion with still greater determination and freedom did marcus antonius declare that he had seen man truly eloquent tho to be eloquent is much less than to be perfect orator does cicero himself say that he is still seeking an orator and merely conceives and imagines one and shall i fear to say that in that portion of eternity which is yet to come something may arise still more excellent than what has yet been seen i take advantage of the opinion of those who refuse to allow great merit to cicero and demosthenes even in eloquence tho demosthenes indeed does not appear sufﬁciently near perfection even to cicero himsel f who says that he sometimes nods nor does cicero appear so to brutus and calvus who certainly ﬁnd fault with his language footnotes quintilian is notable writer who was not inﬂuenced by his great contemporary seneca whom he disliked and harshly

jurisdiction attached to the tribuneship the protection of the commons when he had cajoled the soldiery by donations the people by distribution of corn and men in general by the charms of peace he octavius began by gradations to exalt himself over them to draw to himself the functions of the senate and of the magistrate and the framing of the laws in which he was thwarted by man the boldest spirits having fallen in some or other of the regular battles or by proscription and the surviving nobility being distingu ished by wealth and public honors according to the measure of their promptness to bondage and these innovations had been the cause of aggrandizement to them preferring the present state of things with safety to the revival of ancient liberty with personal peril neither were the provinces averse to that condition of affairs since they mistrusted the government of the senate and people on account of the contentions among the great and the avarice of the magistrates while the protection of the laws was enfeebled and borne down by violence intrigue and bribery moreover augustus supports to his domination raised his sister son claudius marcellus 103 mere youth to the dignity of pontif f and curule ædile aggrandized by two successive consulships marcus agrippa 104 man meanly born but an accomplished soldier and the companion of his victories and

adopted his son assumed colleague in the empire partner in the tribunitian authority and presented to the several armies not from the secret machinations of his mother heretofore but at her open suit over augustus now very aged she had obtained such absolute sway that he banished into the isle of planasia his only surviving grandson agrippa posthumus person destitute indeed of liberal accomplishments and man of clownish brutality with great bodily strength but convicted of heinous offense the emperor strange to say set germanicus the son of drusus over eight legions quartered upon the rhine and ordered that he should be engrafted into his family by tiberius by adoption tho tiberius had then son of his own on the verge of manhood but the object was that he might stand ﬁrm by

had been born since the battle of actium and even most of the old during the civil wars how few were then living who had seen the ancient free state the character of the government thus totally changed traces were to be found of the spirit of ancient institutions the system by which every citizen shared in the government being thrown aside all men regarded the orders of the prince the only rule of conduct and obedience nor felt they any anxiety the present while augustus yet in the vigor of life maintained the credit of himself and house and the peace of the state but when old age had crept over him and he was sinking under bodily his end was at hand and thence new source of hopes and views was few there were who began to talk idly about the blessings of liberty many dreaded civil others longed one while far the greatest part were occupied in circulating various surmises reﬂecting upon those who seem ed likely to be their masters that agrippa was naturally stern and savage and exasp erated by contumely and neither in age nor experience equal to task of such magnitude tiberius indeed had arrived at fulness of years and was distinguished captain but possest the inveterate and inherent pride of the claudian family and many indications of cruel nature escaped him in spite of all his arts to disguise it that even from his early infancy he had been trained up in an imperial house that consulships and triumphs had been accumulated upon him while but youth not even during the years of his abode at rhodes where under the plausible name of retirement he was in fact an exile did he employ himself otherwise than in meditating future vengeance studying the arts of simulation and practising secret and abominable sensualities that to these considerations was added that of his mother woman with the ungovernable spirit peculiar to her sex that the romans must be under bondage to woman and moreover to two youths who would meanwhile oppress the state and at one time or other rend it piecemeal while the public mind was agitated by these and similar discussions the illness of augustus grew daily more serious and some suspected nefarious practises on the part of his wife some months before rumor had gone abroad that augustus having singled out few to whom he communicated his purpose had taken fabius maximus his only companion had sailed over to the island of planasia to visit agrippa that many tears were shed on both sides many tokens of mutual tenderness shown and hopes from thence conceived that the youth would be restored to the household gods of his 180 181

adjacent parts of the sea but the walls and roofs and wherever the most distant prospect could be obtained with sorrowing multitude earnestly asking each other whether they should receive her on landing in silence or with some expression of feeling nor was it clearly determined what course would be most suitable to the occasion when the ﬂeet came slowly in not usual in sprightly trim but all wearing the impress of sadness when she descended from the ship accompanied by her two infants 108 and bearing in her hand the funeral urn her eyes ﬁxt stedfastly upon the earth one simultaneous groan burst from the whole assemblage nor could you distinguish relations from strangers nor the wailings of men from those of women nor could any difference be discerned except that those who came to meet her in the vehemence of recent grief surpassed the attendants of agrippina who were exhausted with continued mourning tiberius had dispatched two prætorian cohorts with directions that the magi strates of calabria with apulians and campanians should pay their last ofﬁces of respect to the memory of his son upon the shoulders therefore of the tribunes and centurions his ashes were borne

other relations are likewise there recorded by name whether by sickness she was prevented or whether her soul vanquished by sorrow could not bear to go through the representation of such an powering calamity i would rather believe her constrained by tiberius and livia who left not the palace that they might seem to grieve alike and that the grandmother and uncle might appear to have followed her example in staying at home the day on which his remains were deposited in the tomb of augustus at one time exhibited the silence of perfect desolation at another the uproar of vociferous lamentation the streets of the city were crowded one general blaze of torches glared throughout the campus martius there the soldiers under arms the magistrates without the insignia of ofﬁce and the people ranged according to their tribes passionately exclaimed that the commonwealth was utterly lost that henceforth there remained hope so openly and so boldly that you would have believed they had forgotten those who ruled over them but nothing pierced tiberius more deeply than the warm interest excited in favor of agrippina while they gave her such titles the ornament of her country the only blood of augustus an unparalleled example of primitive virtue and looking up to heaven and the gods they implored the preservation of her issue and that they might outlive their oppressors there were those who missed the pomp of public funeral and compared with this the superior honors and magniﬁcence displayed by augustus in that of drusus the father of germanicus observing that he himself had traveled in the depth of winter far ticinus and continuing by the corpse had with it entered the city around his bier were crowded the images of the claudii and julii he was mourned in the forum his encomium pronounced on the rostra all the honors invented by our ancestors or added by their posterity were heaped upon him but to germanicus were denied the ordinary solemnities and such were due to every distinguished roman certainly his corpse was burned in foreign country because of the long journey in such manner it was but afterward it was but just to have compensated the scantiness of the ﬁrst ceremony by the increased solemnity of the last his brother met him but one day journey his uncle not even at the gate where were those observances of the ancients the efﬁgies of the dead laid in state on bed hymns composed in memory of departed virtue with encomiums and tears where at least the ceremonial of sorrow all this was known to tiberius and to suppress the reﬂections of the populace he admonished them in an edict that many illustrious romans had died the commonwealth but none so universally and vehemently regretted and that it was to the honor of himself and all others if bounds were observed the same things which became private families and small states became not princes and an imperial people that it was not unseemly to lament in the ﬁrst transport of sorrow nay relief was afforded by weeping but it was now time to recover and compose their minds thus the deiﬁed julius upon the loss of an only daug hter 112 thus the deiﬁed augustus upon the premature death of his grandsons had both concealed their sorrow more ancient examples were unnecessary how often had the roman people sustained with equanimity the slaughter of their armies the death of their generals and entire destruction of illustrious were mortal the commonwealth was should therefore resume their customary vocations and because the spectacle of the megalesian games was at hand he added that they should even lay aside their grief amusements 186 187 188 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume ii of 10 rome https vacation ended public affairs were resumed drusus departed the army in illyricum the minds of all men impatiently looking vengeance upon piso and amidst many complaints that while he was roaming at large through the delightful regions of asia and greece he was undermining by contemptuous and artful delay the evidences of his crimes it was generally known that martina that notorious trafﬁcker in sorceries and sent i have above related by cneius sentius to rome had died suddenly at brundusium that poison lay concealed in knot of her hair iii the death of seneca 113 65 the next death added by nero was that of plautius lateranus consul elect and with such precipitation that he would not allow him to embrace his children nor the usual brief interval to choose his mode of death he was dragged to the place allotted the execution of slaves and there by the hand of statius the tribune slaughtered in his death he maintained the most invincible silence not charging his executioner with participation in the design which he suffered the destruction of seneca followed to the inﬁnite joy of the prince not because he had ascertained that he was party to the conspiracy but that he might assail him with the sword since poison had failed natalis only had named him and his disclosure amounted but to this that he had been sent by piso 114 to visit seneca then indisposed to complain that he was refused admittance and to represent that it would be better if they maintained their friendship by intercourse that to this seneca replied that talking to each other and frequent interviews were to the service of neither but upon the safety of piso his own security rested granius silvanus tribune of pretorian cohort was ordered to represent this to seneca and to demand of him whether he admitted the words of natalis and his own answers seneca had that very day either from chance or design returned from campania and rested at villa of his four miles from rome thither arrived the tribune toward evening and beset the villa with his men and then he sat at table with pauline his wife and two friends delivered his orders from the emperor seneca replied that natalis had in truth been sent to him and in the name of piso complained that he was debarred from visiting him and that he had excused himself on the score of illness and his love of retirement but he had motive to declare that he preferred the safety of private man to his own security nor was his disposition prone to ﬂattery man better knew than nero who had experienced more frequent proofs of the freedom than the servility of seneca when this answer was by the tribune reported to nero in presence of poppæa 115 and tigellinus who composed the cabinet council the raging tyrant asked whether seneca meditated voluntary death the tribune averred that he had manifested symptoms of fear and neither in his words nor looks did he detect any indication of regret he was therefore commanded to return and tell him he was doomed to die fabius rusticus writes that the tribune did not return by the road he went but turning off went to fenius captain of the guards and stating to him the emperor orders asked whether he should obey him and was by him admonished to execute them thus displaying that want of spirit which by some fatality prevailed universally silvanus too was one of the conspirators and yet was contributing to multiply the atrocities he had conspired to avenge he avoided however seeing and speaking to seneca but sent in centurion to apprize him of his ﬁnal doom 189 190 191 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics

services he bequeathed them that which alone was now left him but which yet was the fairest legacy he had to leave example of his life and if they kept it in view they would reap the fame due to honorable acquirements and inviolable friendship at the same time he endeavored to repress their tears and restore their fortitude now by soothing language and now in more animated strain and in tone of rebuke asking them where were the precepts of philosophy where the rules of conduct under impending evils studied so many years who was unapprized of the ferocious disposition of nero nor could anything else be expected after he had murdered his mother and brother than that he should proceed to destroy his nursing father and preceptor after these and similar reasonings addrest to the company in general he embraced his wife and after brief but vigorous effort to get the better of the apprehensions that prest upon him at that moment he besought and implored her to refrain from surrendering herself to endless grief but endeavor to mitigate her regret her husband by means of those honorable consolations which she would experience in the contemplation of his virtuous life paulina on the contrary urged her purpose to die with him and called the hand of the executioner when seneca unwilling to impede her glory and also from affection he was anxious not to leave one who was dear to him above everything exposed to the hard usage of the world thus addrest her i had pointed out to you how to soften the ills of life but you prefer the renown of dying i will not envy you the honor of the example tho both display the same unﬂinching fortitude in encountering death still the glory of your exit will be superior to mine after this both had the veins of their arms opened with the same stroke the blood ﬂowed slowly from the aged body of seneca attenuated it was too by scanty sustenance he had the veins of his legs and hams also cut and unable to bear up under the excessive torture lest by his own sufferings he should overpower the resolution of his wife and by witnessing her anguish be betrayed into impatience himself he advised her to retire into another chamber his eloquence

cœlius where by reason of shops in which were kept such goods minister aliment to ﬁre the moment it commenced it acquired strength and being accelerated by the wind it spread at once through the whole extent of the circus neither were the houses secured by enclosures nor the temples environed with walls nor was there any other obstacle to intercept its progress but the ﬂame spreading every way impetuously invaded ﬁrst the lower regions of the city then mounted to the higher then again ravaging the lower it bafﬂed every effort to extinguish it by the rapidity of its destructive course and from the liability of the city to conﬂagration in consequence of the narrow and intricate alleys and the irregularity of the streets in ancient rome 118 add to this the wailings of terriﬁed women the

labored to assist others these dragging the feeble those waiting them some hurrying others lingering altogether created scene of universal confusion and embarrassment and while they looked back upon the danger in their rear they often found themselves beset before and on their sides or if they had escaped into the quarters adjoin ing these too were already seized by the devouring ﬂames even the parts which they believed remote and exempt were found to be in the same distress at last not knowing what to shun or where to seek sanctuary they crowded the streets and lay along in the open ﬁelds some from the loss of their whole substance even the means of their daily sustenance others from affection their relations whom they had not been able to snatch from the ﬂames suffered themselves to perish in them tho they had opportunity to escape neither dared any man offer to check the ﬁre so repeated were the menaces of many who forbade to extinguish it and because others openly threw ﬁrebrands with loud declarations that they had one who authorized them whether they did it that they might plunder with the less restraint or in consequence of orders given nero who was at that juncture sojourning at antium 119 did not return to the city till the ﬁre approached that quarter of his house which connected the palace with the gardens of mæcenas 120 nor could it however be prevented from devouring the house and palace and everything around but the relief of the people thus destitute and driven from their dwellings he opened the ﬁelds of mars and the monumental ediﬁces erected by agrippa 121 and even his own gardens he likewise reared temporary houses the reception of the forlorn multitude and from ostia and the neighboring cities were brought up the river household necessaries and the price of grain was reduced to three sesterces the measure all which proceedings tho of popular character were thrown away because rumor had become universally current that the very time when the city was in ﬂames nero going on the stage of his private theater sang destruction of troy assimilating the present disaster to that catastrophe of ancient times at length on the sixth day the conﬂagration was stayed at the foot of esquilliæ by pulling down an immense quantity of buildings so that an open space and it were void air might check the raging element by breaking the continuity but ere the consternation had subsided the ﬁre broke out afresh with little violence but in regions more spacious and therefore with less destruction of human life but more extensive havoc was made of the temples and the porticoes dedicated to amusement this conﬂagration too was the subject of more censorious remark it arose in the æmilian possessions of tigellinus and nero seemed to aim at the glory of building new city and calling it by his own name of the fourteen sections into which rome is divided four were still standing entire three were leveled with the ground and in the seven others there remained only here and there few remnants of houses shattered and consumed it were easy task to recount the number of tenements and temples which were lost but the following most venerable antiq uity and sanctity were consumed that dedicated by servius tullius to the moon the temple and great altar consecrated by evander the arcadian to hercules while present the chapel vowed by romulus to jupiter stator the palace of 122 with the temple of vesta and in it the tutelar gods of rome moreover the treasures accumulated by so many victories the beautiful productions of greek artists ancient writings of authors celebrated genius and till then preserved entire were consumed and tho great was the beauty of the city in its renovated form the older inhabitants remembered many decorations of the ancient which could not be replaced in the modern city there were some who remarked that the commencement of this ﬁre showed itself on the fourteenth before the calends of july the day on which the senones set ﬁre to the captured city others carried their investigation so far to determine that an equal number of years months and days intervened between the two ﬁres to proceed nero appropriated to his own purposes the ruins of his country and founded upon them palace in which the and in those luxurious times common 195 196 197 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the

expansive prospects the projectors and superintendents of this plan were severus and celer men of such ingenuity and daring enterprise to attempt to conquer by art the obstacles of nature and fool away the treasures of the prince they had even undertaken to sink navigable canal from the lake avernus to the mouth of the tiber over an arid shore or through opposing mountains nor indeed does there occur anything of humid nature supplying water except the pomptine marshes the rest is either craggy rock or parched soil and had it even been possible to break through these obstructions the toil had been intolerable and disproportioned to the object nero however who longed to achieve things that exceeded credibility exerted all his might to perforate the mountains adjoining to avernus and to this day there remain traces of his abortive project but the rest of the old site not occupied by his palace was laid out not after the gallic ﬁre without discrimination and regularity but with the lines of streets measured out broad spaces left transit the height of the buildings limited open areas left and porticoes added to protect the front of the clustered dwellings these porticoes nero engaged to rear at his own expense and then to deliver to each proprietor the areas about them cleared he moreover proposed rewards proportioned to every man rank and private substance and ﬁxt day within which if their houses single or clustered were ﬁnished they should receive them he appointed the marshes of ostia receptacle of the rubbish and that the vessels which had conveyed grain up the tiber shou ld return laden with rubbish that the buildings themselves should be raised to certain portion of their height without beams and arched with stone from the quarries of gabii or alba that stone being proof against ﬁre that over the water springs which had been improperly intercepted by private individuals overseers should be placed to provide their ﬂowing in greater abundance and in greater number of places the supply of the public that every housekeeper should have in his yard means extinguishing ﬁre neither should there be but every house should be enclosed by its own walls these regulations which were favorably received in consideration of their utility were also source of beauty to the new city yet some there were who believed that the ancient form was more conducive to health from the narrowness of the streets and the height of the buildings the rays of the sun were more excluded whereas now the spacious breadth of the streets without any shade to protect it was more intensely heated in warm weather such were the provisions made by human counsels the gods were next addrest with expiations and recourse had to the sibyl books by admonition from them to vulcan ceres and proserpina supplicatory sacriﬁces were made and juno propitiated by the matrons ﬁrst in the capitol then upon the nearest shore where by water drawn from the sea the temple and image of the goddess were besprinkled and the ceremony of placing the goddess in her sacred chair and her vigil were celebrated by ladies who had husbands but not all the relief that could come from man not all the bounties that the prince could bestow nor all the atonements which could be presented to the gods availed to relieve nero from the infamy of being believed to have ordered the conﬂagration hence to suppress the rumor he falsely charged with the guilt and punished with the most exquisite tortures the persons commonly called christians 123 who were hated their enormities christus the founder of that name was put to death criminal by pontius pilate procurator of judea in the reign of tiberius but the pernicious superstition represt time broke out again not only through judea where the mischief originated but through the city of rome also whither all things horrible and disgraceful ﬂow from all quarters to common receptacle and where they are encouraged accordingly ﬁrst those were seized who confest they were christians next on their information vast multitude were convicted not so much on the charge of burning the city of hating the human race and in their deaths they were also made the subjects of sport they were covered with the hides of wild beasts and worried to death by dogs or nailed to crosses or set ﬁre to and when day declined burned to serve nocturnal lights

opposite hill far the ﬁrst gates of the citadel on the right side of the ascent range of porticoes had been built in ancient times going out upon the roof of those the besieged threw shower of stones and tiles the assailants had weapons but their swords and to fetch engines and missiles seemed tedious delay they threw brands into the portico that jutted near them they followed up the ﬁre and would have forced their way through the gate of the capitol which the ﬁre had laid hold of if sabinus had not placed barrier in the very approach in lieu of wall the statues those honorable monuments of our ancestors which were pulled down wherever they could be found they then assaulted the capitol in two different quarters near the grove of the asylum and where the tarpeian rock is ascended by hundred steps both attacks were unforeseen that by the asylum was the nearer and most vigorous nor could they be stopt from climbing up the contiguous buildings which being raised high under the idea of undisturbed peace reach the basement of the capitol here doubt exists whether the ﬁre was thrown upon the roofs by the storming party or the besieged the latter being more generally supposed to have done it to repulse those who were climbing up and had advanced some way the ﬁre extende d itself thence to the porticoes adjoining the temples soon the eagles that supported the cupola caught ﬁre and

bent on victory and seeing their darts fall on the military shell and glide off without effect at last they rolled down their on the heads of the besiegers the moment it dispe rsed and overwhelmed the party among which it fell but it also drew after it in its fall the battlements and upper parts of the rampart an adjoining tower at the same time yielded to the effect of stones which struck it and left breach at which the seventh legion in the form of wedge endeavored to force their way while the third hewed down the gate with axes and swords the ﬁrst man that entered according to all historians was caius volusius common soldier of the third legion he gained the summit of the rampart and bearing down all resistance in the view of all beckoned with his hand and cried aloud that the camp was captured the rest of the legion followed him with resistless fury the vitellians being and throwing themselves headlong from the works the whole space between the camp and the walls of cremona was ﬁlled with slain 131 and now new form of difﬁculty was presented by the high walls of the city and towers of stone the gates secured by iron bars and troops brandishing their arms the inhabitants large and numerous body all devoted to vitellius and conﬂux of people from all parts of italy at the stated fair which was then held the latter was regarded by the garrison an aid from the incre ase of numbers but inﬂamed the ardor of the besiegers on the score of booty antonius ordered his men to take combustibles and set ﬁre to the most elegant ediﬁces without the city if peradventure the inhabitants seeing their mansions destroyed would be induced to abandon the adverse cause in the houses that stood near the walls of height to overlook the works he placed the bravest of his troops and from those stations beams tiles and ﬁrebrands were thrown down to drive the defenders of the walls from their posts the legions under antonius now formed military shell while the rest poured in volley of stones and darts when the spirit of the besieged gradually gave way the men highest in rank were willing to make terms themselves lest if cremona was taken by storm they should receive quarter and the conquerors disdaining vulgar lives shou ld fall on the tribunes and centurions from whom the largest booty was to be expected the common men usual careless about future events and safe in their obscurity still held out roaming about the streets or lurking in private houses they did not sue peace even when they had given up the contes the principal ofﬁcers took down the name and images of vitellius cæcina he was still in conﬁnement they released from his fetters and desired his aid in pleading their cause with the conqueror he heard their petition with disdain swelling with insolence while they importuned him with tears the last stage of human misery when so many brave and gallant men were obliged to sue to traitor protection they then hung out from the walls the ﬁllets and badges of supplicants when antonius ordered cessation of hostilities the garrison brought out their eagles and standards mournful train of soldiers without their aims their eyes riveted to the ground followed them the conquerors gathered round them and ﬁrst heaped reproaches upon them and threatened violence to their persons but afterward when they saw the passiveness with which they received the insults and that the vanquished abandoning all their former pride submitted to every indignity the thought occurred that these very men lately conquered at bedriacum and used their victory with moderation but when cæcina came forth decorated with his robes and preceded by his lictors who opened way him through the crowd the indignation of the victors burst 207 208 209 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume ii of 10 rome https ﬂame they reproached him his pride his cruelty and even his treachery so detested is villainy antonius opposed the fury of his men and sent him under escort to vespasian meanwhile the common people of cremona in the midst of so many soldiers were subjected to grievous oppressions and were in danger of being all put to the sword if the rage of the soldiery had not been assuaged by the entreaties of their leaders antonius called them to an assembly when he spoke of the conquerors in lofty terms and of the vanquished with humanity of cremona he said nothing either way but the army adding to their love of plunder an inveterate aversion to the people were bent on the extirpation of the inhabitants in the war against otho they were deemed the abettors of vitellius and afterward when the thirteenth legion was left among them to build an amphitheater with the usual insolence of the lower orders in towns they had assailed them with offensive ribaldry the spectacle of gladiators exhibited there by cæcina inﬂamed the animosity against the people their city too was now the second time the seat of war and in the heat of the last engagement the vitellians were thence supplied with refreshments and some of their women led into the ﬁeld of battle by their zeal the cause were slain the period too of the fair had given to colony otherwise afﬂuent an imposing appearance of accumulated wealth antonius by his fame and brilliant success eclipsed all the other commanders the attention of all was ﬁxt on him alone he hastened to the baths to wash off the blood and on observing that the water was not hot enoug h he said that they would soon grow hotter the expression was caught up casual word among slaves had the effect of throwing upon him the whole odium of having given signal setting ﬁre to cremona which was already in ﬂames forty thousand armed men had poured into it the number of drudges and followers was still greater and more abandoned to lust and cruelty neither age nor dignity served protection deeds of lust were perpetrated amidst scenes of carnage and murder was added to rape aged men and women that had passed their prime and who were useless booty were made the objects of brutal sport if mature maiden or any one of comely appearance fell in their way after being torn piecemeal by the rude hands of contending rufﬁans they at last were the occasion of their turning their swords against each other while eagerly carrying off money or massy gold from the temples they were butchered by others stronger than themselves not content with the treasures that lay open to their view some forced the owners to discover their hidden wealth and dig up their buried riches numbers carried ﬂaming torches and soon they had brought forth their booty in their wanton sport set the gutted houses and plundered temples on ﬁre in an army differing in language and manners composed of roman citizens allies and foreign auxiliaries all the diversities of passions were exhibited each had his separate notions of right and wrong nor was anything unlawful four days did cremona minister to their rapacity when everything else sacred and profane was leveled in the conﬂagration the temple of memphitis alone remained standing outside of the walls saved either by its situation or the inﬂuence of the deity such was the fate of cremona two hundred and years from its foundation it was built during the consulship of tiberius sempronius and publius cornelius at the time when hannibal threatened an irruption into italy bulwark against the gauls inhabiting beyond the po or any other power that might break in over the alps the colony might be expected grew and ﬂourished in the number of its settlers from the contiguity of rivers the fertility of its soil from alliances and intermarriages with the neighboring people never having suffered from foreign wars but sad sufferer from civil dissensions antonius shrinking from the infamy of this horrible transaction the detestation it excited was increasing issued an edict forbidding all manner of persons to detain the citizens of cremona prisoners of war at the same time the booty was rendered valueless by resolution adopted throughout italy not to purchase the captives taken on that occasion the soldiers then began to murder them however when this was known the prisoners were eagerly ransomed by their friends and relations the survivors in short time returned to cremona the temples and public places were rebuilt at the

provincial frugality are happily united i remember he was used to relate that in his early youth he should have engaged with more ardor in philosophical speculation than was suitable to roman and senator had not the prudence of his mother restrained the warmth and vehemence of his disposition his lofty and upright spirit inﬂamed by the charms of glory and exalted reputation led him to the pursuit with more eagerness than discretion reason and riper years tempered his warmth and from the study of wisdom he retained what is most difﬁcult to he learned the rudiments of war in britain

into wanton pastime avail himself licentiously or slothfully of his tribunitial title or his inexperience to spend his time in pleasures and absences from duty but he employed himself in gaining knowledge of the country making himself known to the army learning from the experienced and imitating the best neither pressing to be employed through vainglory nor declining it through timidity and

threatened them with punishment if they persisted i ordered them to be at once punished i was persuade d whatever the nature of their opinions might be contumacious and inﬂexible obstinacy certainly deserved correction there were others also brought before possest with the same infatuation but being roman citizens i directed them to be sent to rome but this crime spreading is usually the case while it was actually under prosecution several instances of the same nature occurred an anonymous information was laid before containing charge against several persons who upon examination denied they were christians or had ever been so they repeated after an invocation to the gods and offered religious rites with wine and incense before your statue which that purpose i had ordered to be brought together with those of the gods and even reviled the name of christ whereas there is forcing it is said those who are really christians into any of these compliances i thought it proper therefore to dischar ge them some among those who were accused by witness in person at ﬁrst confest themselves christians but immediately after denied it the rest owned indeed that they had been of that number formerly but had now some above three others more and few above twenty years ago renounced that error they all worshiped your statue and the images of the gods uttering imprecations at the same time against the name of christ they afﬁrmed the whole of their guilt of their error was that they met on stated day before it was light and addrest form of prayer to christ to divinity binding themselves by solemn oath not the purposes of any wicked design but never to commit any fraud theft or adultery never to falsify their word nor deny trust when they should be called upon to deliver it up after which it was their custom to separate and then reassemble to eat in common harmless meal from this custom however they desisted after the publication of my edict by which according to your commands i forbade the meeting of any assemblies after receiving this account i judged it so much the more necessary to endeavor to extort the real truth by putting two female slaves to the torture who were said to ofﬁciate in their religious rites but all i could discover was evidence of an absurd and extravagant superstition i deemed it expedient therefore to adjourn all further proceedings in order to consult you it appears to be matter highly deserving your consideration more especially great numbers must be involved in the danger of these prosecutions which have already extended and are

your immortal writings will greatly contribute to render his name immortal he was at that time with the ﬂeet under his command at misenum 141 on the 24th of august about one in the afternoon my mother desired him to observe cloud which appeared of very unusual size and shape he had just taken turn in the sun and after bathing himself in cold water and making light luncheon gone back to his books he immediately arose and went out upon rising ground from whence he might get better sight of this very uncommon appearance cloud from which mountain was uncertain at this distance but it was found afterward to come from mount vesuvius 142 was ascending the appearance of which i can not give you more exact description of than by likening it to that of it shot up to great height in the form of very tall trunk which spread itself out at the top into sort of branches occasioned i imagine either by sudden gust of air that impelled it the force of which decreased it advanced upward or the cloud itself being prest back again by its own weight expand ed in the manner i have mentioned it appeared sometimes bright and sometimes dark and spotted according it was either more or less impregnated with earth and cinders this phenomenon seemed to man of such learning and research my uncle extraordinary and worth further looking into he ordered light vessel to be got ready and gave leave if i liked to accompany him i said i had rather go on with my work and it so happened he had himself given something to write out he was coming out of the house he received note from rectina the wife of bassus who was in the utmost alarm at the imminent danger which threatened her her villa lying at the foot of mount vesuvius there was way of escape but by sea she earnestly entreated him therefore to come to her assistance he accordingly changed his ﬁrst intention and what he had begun from philosophical he now carries out in noble and generous spirit he ordered the galleys to put to sea and went himself on board with an intention of assisting not only rectina but the several other towns which lay thickly strewn along that beautiful coast hastening then to the place from whence others ﬂed with the utmost terror he steered his course direct to the point of danger and with so much calmness and presence of mind to be able to make and dictate his observations upon the motion and all the phenomena of that dreadful scene he was now so close to the mountain that the cinders which grew thicker and hotter the nearer he approached fell into the ships together with pumice stones and black pieces of burning rock they were in danger too not only of being aground by the sudden retreat of the sea but also from the vast fragments which rolled down from the mountains and obstructed all the shore here he stopt to consider whether he should turn back again to which the pilot advising him fortune said he favors the brave steer to where pomponianus is pomponianus was then at stabiæ 143 separated by bay which the sea after several insensible windings forms with the shore he had already sent his baggage on board tho he was not at that time in actual danger yet being within sight of it and indeed extremely near if it should in the least increase he was determined to put to sea soon the wind which was blowing dead should go down it was favorable however carrying my uncle to pomponianus whom he found in the greatest consternation he embraced him tenderly encouraging and urging him to keep up his spirits and the more effectually to soothe his fears by seeming unconcerned himself ordered bath to be got ready and then after having bathed sat down to supper with great cheerfulness or at least what is just heroic with every appearance of it meanwhile broad ﬂames shone out in several places from mount vesuvius which the darkness of the night contributed to render still brighter and clearer but my uncle in order to soothe the apprehensions of his friend assured him it was only the burning of the 223 224 225 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume ii of 10 rome https which the country people had abandoned to the ﬂames after this he retired to rest and it is most certain he was so little disquieted to fall into sound sleep his breathing which on account of his corpulence was rather heavy and sonorous was heard by the attendants outside the court which led to his apartment being now almost ﬁlled with stones and ashes if he had continued there any time longer it would have been impossible him to have made his way out so he was awoke and got up and went to pomponianus and the rest of his company who were feeling too anxious to think of going to bed they consulted together whether it would be most prudent to trust to the houses which now rocked from side to side with frequent and violent concussions tho shaken from their very foundations or ﬂy to the open ﬁelds where the calcined stones and cinders tho light indeed yet fell in large showers and threatened destruction in this choice of dangers they resolved the ﬁelds resolution which while the rest of the company were hurried into by their fears my uncle embraced upon cool and deliberate consideration they went out then having pillows tied upon their heads with napkins and this was their whole defense against the storm of stones that fell round them it was now day everywhere else but there deeper darkness prevailed than in the thickest night which however was in some degree alleviated by torches and other lights of various kinds they thought proper to go farther down upon the shore to see if they might safely put out to sea but found the waves still running extremely high and boisterous there my uncle laying himself down upon which was spread him called twice some cold water which he drank when immediately the ﬂames preceded by strong whiff of sulfur dispersed the rest of the party and obliged him to rise he raised himself up with the assistance of two of his servants and instantly fell down dead suffocated i conjecture by some gross and noxious vapor having always had weak throat which was often inﬂamed soon it was light again which was not till the third day after this melancholy accident his body was found entire and without any marks of violence upon it in the dress in which he fell and looking more like man asleep than dead my uncle having left us 144 i spent such time was left on my studies it was on their account indeed that i had stopt behind till it was time my bath after which i went to supper and then fell into short and uneasy sleep there had been noticed many days before trembling of the earth which did not alarm us much this is quite an ordinary occurrence in campania but it was so particularly violent that night that it not only shook but actually overturned it would seem everything about us my mother rushed into my chamber where she found rising in order to awaken her we sat down in the open court of the house which occupied small space between the buildings and the sea i was at that time but eighteen years of age i know not whether i should call my behavior in this dangerous juncture courage or folly but i took up livy and amused myself with turning over that author and even making extracts from him if i had been perfectly at my leisure just then friend of my uncle who had lately come to him from spain joined us and observing sitting by my mother with book in my hand reproved her her calmness and at the same time my careless security nevertheless i went on with my author tho it was now morning the light was still exceedingly faint and doubtful the buildings all around us tottered and tho we stood upon open ground yet the place was narrow and conﬁned there was remaining without imminent danger we therefore resolved to quit the town crowd followed us and to mind distracted with terror every suggestion seems more prudent than its own prest on us in dense array to drive us forward we came out being at convenient distance from the houses we stood still in the midst of most dangerous and dreadful scene the chariots which we had ordered to be drawn out were so agitated backw ard and forward tho upon the most level ground that we could not keep them steady even by supporting them with large stones the sea seemed to roll back upon itself and to be driven from its banks by the convulsive motion of the earth it is certain at least the shore was considerably enlar ged and several sea 226 227 228 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume ii of 10 rome https were left upon it on the other side black and dreadful cloud broken with rapid zigzag ﬂashes revealed behind it variously shaped masses of ﬂame these last were like but much larger upon this our spanish friend whom i mentioned above addressing himself to my mother and with great energy and urgency if your brother he said if your uncle be safe he certainly wishes you may be so too but if he perished it was his desire doubt that you might both survive him why therefore you delay your escape moment we could never think of our own safety we said while we were uncertain of his upon this our friend left us and withdrew from the danger with the utmost precipitation soon afterward the cloud began to descend and cover the sea it had already surrounded and concealed the island of capreæ 145 my mother now besought urged even commanded to make my escape at any rate which i was young i might easily herself she said her age and corpulency rendered all attempts of that sort impossible however she would willingly meet death if she could have the satisfaction of seeing that she was not the occasion of mine but i absolutely refused to leave her and taking her by the hand compelled her to go with she complied with great reluctance and not without many reproaches to herself retarding my ﬂight the ashes now began to fall upon us tho in great quantity i looked back dense dark mist seemed to be following us spreading itself over the country like cloud let us turn out of the i said while we can still see fear that should we fall in the road we should be prest to death in the dark by the crowds that are following us we had scarcely sat down when night came upon us not such we have when the sky is cloudy or when there is moon but that of room when it is shut up and all the lights put out you might hear the shrieks of women the screams of children and the shouts of men some calling their children others their parents others their husbands and seeking to recognize each other by the voices that replied one lamenting his own fate another that of his family some wishi ng to die from the very fear of dying some lifting their hands to the gods but the greater part convinced that there were now gods at all and that the ﬁnal endless night of which we have heard had come upon the world among these there were some who augmented the real terrors by others imaginary or wilfully invented i remember some who declared that one part of misenum had fallen that another was on ﬁre it was false but they found people to believe them it now grew rather lighter which we imagined to be rather the forerunner of an approaching burst of ﬂames in truth it was than the return of day however the ﬁre fell at distance from us then again we were immersed in thick darkness and heavy shower of ashes rained upon us which we were obliged every now and then to stand up to shake off otherwise we should have been crusht and buried in the heap i might boast that during all this scene of horror not sigh or expression of fear escaped had not my support been grounded in that miserable tho mighty consolation that all mankind were involved in the

the green nor of the blue party at the games in the circus nor partizan either of the parm ularius or the scutarius at the gladiators ﬁghts from him too i learned endurance of labor and to want little and to work with my own hands and not to meddle with other people affairs and not to be ready to listen to slander from diognetus 163 not to busy myself about triﬂing things and not to give credit to what was said by and jugglers about incantations and the driving away of demons and such things and not to breed quails ﬁghting not to give myself up passionately to such things and to endure freedom

skin and whatever else of the kind belongs to the grecian discipline from rusticus 164 i received the impression that my character required improvement and discipline and from him i learned not to be led astray to sophistic emulation nor to writing on speculative matters nor to delivering little hortatory orations nor to showing myself off man who practises much discipline or does benevolent acts in order to make display and to abstain from rhetoric and poetry and ﬁne writing and not to walk about in the house in my outdoor dress nor to other things of the kind and to write my letters with

reason and to be always the same in sharp pains on the occasion of the loss of child and in long illness and to see clearly in living example that the same man can be both most resolute and yielding and not peevish in giving his instruction and to have had before my eyes man who clearly considered his experience and his skill in expounding philosophical principles the smallest of his merits and

all so that intercourse with him was more agreeable than any ﬂattery and at the same time he was most highly venerated by those who associated with him and he had the faculty both of discovering and ordering in an intelligent methodical way the principles necessary life and he never showed anger or any other passion but was entirely free from passion and also most affectionate and he could express approbation without noisy display and he possessed much knowledge without ostentation from alexander 167 the grammarian to refrain from and not in reproachful way to chide those who uttered any barbarous or solecistic or sounding expression but dexterously to introduce the very expression which ought to have been used and in the way of answer or giving conﬁrmation or joining in an inquiry about the thing itself not about the word or by some other ﬁt suggestion from fronto 168 i learned to observe what envy and duplicity and hypocrisy are in tyrant and that generally those among us who are called patricians are rather deﬁcient in paternal af fection from alexander the platonic not frequently nor without necessity to say to any one or to write in letter that i have leisure nor continually to excuse the neglect of duties required by our relation to those with whom we live by alleging urgent occupations from catulus 169 not to be indifferent when friend ﬁnds fault even if he

there is the same law all polity administered with regard to equal rights and equal freedom of speech and the idea of kingly government which respects most of all the freedom of the governed i learned from him also consistency and undeviating steadiness in my regard philosophy and disposition to good and to give to others readily and to cherish good hopes and to believe that i am loved by my friends and in him i observed concealment of his opinions with respect to those whom he condemned and that his friends had need to conjecture what he wished or did not wish but it was quite plain from maximus 170 i learned and not to be led aside by anything and cheerfulness in all circumstances well in illness and just admixture in the moral character of sweetness and dignity and to what was set before without complaining i observed that everybody believed that he thought he spoke and that in all that he did he never had any bad intention and he never showed amazement and surprize and was never in hurry and never put off doing thing nor was perplexed nor dejected nor did he ever laugh to disguise his vexation nor on the other hand was he ever passionate or suspicious he was accustomed to acts of beneﬁcence and was ready to forgive and was free from all falsehood and he presented the appearance of man who could not be diverted from right rather than of man who had been improved i observed too that man could ever think that he was despised by maximus or ever venture to think himself better man he had also the art of being humorous in an agreeable way in my father 171 i observed mildness of temper and unchangeable resolution in the things which he had determined after due deliberation and vainglory in those things which men call honors and love of labor and perseverance and

reason of any urgent circumstances always found him the same i observed too his habit of careful inquiry in all matters of deliberation and his persistency and that he never stopt his investigation through being satisﬁed with appearances which ﬁrst present themselves and that his disposition was to keep his friends and not to be soon tired of them nor yet to be extravagant in his affection and to be satisﬁed on all occasions and cheerful and to foresee things long way off and to provide the smallest without display and to check immediately popular applause and all ﬂattery and to be ever watchful over the things which were necessary the administration of the empire and to be good manager of the expenditure and patien tly to endure the blame which he got such conduct and he was neither

thoughts or action nor love of novelty to the gods i am indebted having good grandfathers good parents good sister good teachers good associates good kinsmen and friends nearly everything good further i owe it to the gods that i was not hurried into any offense against any of them tho i had disposition which if opportunity had offered might have led to something of this kind but through their favor there never was such concu rrence of circumstances put to the trial further i am thankful to the gods that i was not longer brought up with my grandfather concubine and that i preserved the ﬂower of my youth and that i did not make proof of my virility before the proper season but even deferred the time that i was subjected to ruler and father who was able to take away all pride from and to bring to the knowledge that it is possible man to live in palace without wanting either guards or embroidered dresses or torches and statues and show but that it is in such man power to bring himself very near to the fashion of private person without being this reason either meaner in thought or more remiss in action with respect to the things which must be done the public interest in manner that beﬁts

not been stupid nor deformed in body that i did not make more proﬁciency in rhetoric poetry and the other studies in which i should perhaps have been completely engaged if i had seen that i was making progress in them that i made haste to place those who brought up in the station of honor which they seemed to desire without putting them off with hope of my doing it some time after because they were then still young that i knew apollonius rusticus maximus that i received clear and frequent impressions about living according to nature and what kind of life that is so that so far depended on the gods and their gifts and help and inspirations nothing hindered from forthwith living according to nature tho i still fall short of it through my own fault and through not observing the admonitions of
