world with few of which i am acquainted and with great many of which i am not of course all hotels are interesting from one point of view or another in fact the surest way to ﬁx an audience attention is to introduce your hero or to display your opening chorus in the lobby or along the façade of hotel the life the movement and colour the drifting individualities the pretence the bluff the the independence the ennui the darting or lounging servants the very fact that of those before your eyes seven out of ten are drawn from distant and scattered places are sufﬁcient in themselves to invest the smallest hostelry with glamour it is not of this general interest that i would now speak nor is it my intention at present to glance at the hotels wherein quaintness is specialized whether intentionally or there are thousa nds of them and all of them well worth the discriminating traveller attention concerning some of the old inns at and at mont books have been written these depend their charm on mingled gift of the unusual and the picturesque there are i have said thousands of them and of their cataloguing should one embark on so wide sea there could be end and again i must convenience exclude the altogether the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https like the tour of paris simpson of the strand 1 and dozen others that will spring to every traveller memory where the personality of the host or of chef or even waiter is at once magnet the attraction of visitors and reward their coming these too are many in the interest to which i would draw attention the hotel building or an institution has little part it is indeed façade mise en scène before which play the actors that attract our attention and applause the set may be modernly elaborate peacock alley of the waldorf or the templed lobby of the francis or it may present the severe and elizabethan simplicity of the veranda of the norfolk at matter is quite inessential to the spectator his appre ciation is only slightly and indirectly inﬂuenced by these things sunk in his velvet or of puffs hard and silently at his cigar watching and listening the pageant and the conversation eddy by of such hotels i number that gaudy and polysyllabic hostelry the grand hôtel du louvre et la paix at marseilles i am indifferent to the facts that it is situated on that ﬁne thoroughfare the rue cannebière which the proud and untravelled native devoutly believes to be the ﬁnest street in the world that it possesses of gilded and painted repoussé work so elaborate and wonderful that it surely must be intended to represent tinsmith dream of heaven that its concier ge is the most impressive human being on earth except ludwig von kampf whom i have never seen that its head waiter is sadder and more elderly and forgiving than any other head waiter and that its hushed and cathedral atmosphere has been undisturbed through immemorial years that is to be expected and elsewhere to be duplicat ed in greater or lesser degree nor in the lofty courtyard or the equally lofty halls and is there ever much bustle and movement people sit quietly or move with circumspection servants glide the fall of book or teaspoon the sudden closing of door are events to be remarked once day however huge gong sounds the glass doors of the inner courtyard are thrown open with ﬂourish

people and from the top by means of hooked ladder are decanted boxes trunks and appurtenances of various sorts in these people and in these boxes trunks and appurtenances are the real interest of the grand hôtel du louvre et la paix of the marvellous rue cannebière of marseilles at marseilles land ships many ships from all the scattered ends of the earth and from marseilles depart trains the north where is home or the way home many peoples and since the arrival of ships is uncertain and the departure of trains ﬁxed it follows that everybody descends little or greater period at the grand hôtel du louvre et la paix they come lean and quiet and little yellow from hard climates with the names of strange places on their lips and they speak familiarly of things their clothes are generally of ancient cut and the wrinkles and camphor aroma of long packing away are yet discernible often they are still wearing sun helmets or double terai hats pending descent on piccadilly hatter two days hence they move slowly and languidly the ordinary piercing and dominant english enunciation has fallen to modulation their eyes while observant and alert look tired it is though the far countries have sucked something from the pith of them in exchange great experiences that nevertheless seem of little value though these men having met at last face to face the ultimat of what the earth has to offer in the way of danger hardship difﬁculty and the things that try men souls having unexpectedly found them all to fall short of both the importance and the ﬁnal signiﬁcance with which has always invested them were now just little at loss therefore they stretch their long lean frames in the wicker chairs they sip the long drinks at their elbows puff slowly at their long lean cheroots and talk spasmodically in short sentences of quite different type are those going fellows full of northern health and energy full of the eagerness of anticipation full of romance skilfully concealed the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https authoritative clear voiced their exit from the bus is followed by rain of alls bags new tin boxes new gun cases all lettered enormous kit doomed to diminution they overﬂow the place ebb towards their respective rooms return scrubbed and ruddy correctly clad correctly unco nscious of everybody else sink into more wicker chairs the quiet brown and yellow men continue to puff at their cheroots quite eclipsed after time one of them picks up his battered old sun helmet and goes out into the street the eyes of the newcomers follow him they fall silent and their eyes under cover of pulled moustache furtively glance towards the lean man companions then on that ofﬁce falls great silence broken only by the occasional rare remarks of the quiet men with the cheroots the youngsters are listening with all their ears though from their appearance one would suspect that fact not syllable escapes them these quiet men have been there they have seen with their own eyes their lightest word is satur ated with the mystery and romance of the unknown their easy matter everyday knowledge is richly wonderful it would seem natural these men to question these men of that which they desire so ardently to know but that is done you know so they sit tight and pretend they are not listening and feast their ears on the wonderful kabul peshawur annam nyassaland kerman serengetti tanganika and many others on these beautiful syllables must their imaginations feed that which is told is nothing at all adventure there is none romance there is none mention of high emprise there is none adventure romance high emprise have to these men somehow lost their importance perhaps such things have been to them too well mention the morning egg perhaps they have found that there is genuine adventure real romance except over the edge of the world where the rainbow stoops the bus rattles in and rattles out again it takes the young men down past the inner harbour to where lie the tall ships waiting they and their cargo of exuberance of hope of energy of thirst the bubbl adventure the rainbow romance sail away to where these wares have market and the quiet men glide away to the north their wares have been marketed the sleepy ﬁerce passionate sunny lands have taken all they had to bring and have given in exchange indif ference profound realization that the length of days are nothing at all supreme agnosticism to the ultimate value of anything that single man can sublime faith that it must be done the power to concentrate patience illimitable contempt danger disregard of death the intention to live ﬁnal weary estimate of the fact that mere things are unimportant here there matter how quaintly or fantastically they are dressed or named and corresponding emptiness of anticipation the items are only random few of the price given by the ancient lands that which the northern races bring to them what other alchemical changes have been wrought only these lean and weary men could they dared look so far within themselves and even if they dared they would not tell footnotes 1 in old days before the improvements ii the f arewell we boarded ship ﬁlled with great and what seemed to us an unappeasable curiosity to what we were going to see it was not very big ship in spite of the grandiloquent descriptions in the advertisements or the lithograph wherein she cut grandly and evenly through huge waves to the manifest discomﬁture of inﬁnitesimal sailing craft the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https she was manned entirely by germans the room stewards waited at table cleaned the public saloons kept the library rustled the baggage and played in the band that is why we took our music between meals our staterooms were very tiny indeed each was provided with an electric fan totally inadequate and rather aggravating electric fan once we had entered the red sea just at this moment we paid it little attention we were still in full enjoyment of sunny france where in our own experience it had rained two months steadily indeed at this moment it was raining raining steady cold sodden drizzle that had not even the grace to pick out the surface of the harbour in the jolly dancing staccato that goes far to lend attraction to genuinely earnest rainstorm down the long quay splashed cabs and omnibuses their drivers glistening in wet capes to dischar ge under the open shed at the end various hasty individuals who marshalled long lines of porters with astonishing impedimenta and drove them up the roughs lounged aimlessly little bent old woman with shawl over her head searched here and there occasionally she would ﬁnd twisted splinter of wood torn from the piles by hawser or gouged from the planking by heavy freight or kicked from the ﬂoor by the hoofs of horses this she deposited carefully in small covere d market basket she was entirely intent on this minute and rather pathetic task quite unattending the greatness of the ship or the many people the great hulk swallowed or spat forth near us against the rail leaned young englishman whom later every man on that ship came to recog nize and to avoid an insuf ferable bore now however the angel of good inspiration stooped to him he tossed copper piece down to the bent old woman she heard the clink of the fall and looked up bewildered one of the waterside roughs slouched forward the englishman shouted warning and threat indicating in pantomime whom the coin was intended to our surprise that wharf rat smiled and waved his hand reassuringly then took the old woman by the arm to show her where the coin had fallen she hobbled to it with haste eloquent of the horrible marseillaise alleys picked it up joyously with delightful grace kissed her ﬁnger towards the ship apparently we all of us had few remaining french coins and certainly we were all grateful to the young englishman his happy thought the sous descended fast the woman could get to where they fell so numerous were they that she had time to express her gratitude except in broken snatches or gesture in interrupted attitudes of the most complete thanksgiving the day of miracles her had come and from the humble poverty that valued tiny and infrequen t splinters of wood she had suddenly come into great wealth everybody was laughing but in very kindly sort of way it seemed to and the very wharf rats and gamins wolﬁsh and ﬁerce in their everyday life of the water front seemed to take genuine pleasure in pointing out to her the of those her dim old eyes had not seen silver pieces followed these were too wonderful she grew more and more excited until several of the passengers leaning over the rail began to murmur warningly fearing harm after picking up each of these silver pieces she bowed and gestured very gracefully waving both hands outward lifting eyes and hands to heaven kissing her ﬁngers trying by every means in her power to express the dazzling wonder and joy that this unexpected marvel was bringing her when she had done all these things many times she hugged herself ecstatically very ssed and frenchman standing near seemed to be little afraid she might hug him his fear had perhaps some grounds she shook hands with everybody all around and showed them her wealth in her kerchief explaining eagerly the tears running down her face now the was drawn aboard and the band struck up the usual lively air at the ﬁrst notes the old woman executed few feeble little jig steps in sheer exuberance then the solemnity of the situation sobered her her great wealthy powerful kind friends were departing on their long voyage over mysterious seas again and again very earnestly she repeated the graceful slow wave of the arms outward the eyes raised to heaven the hands clasped ﬁnally over her head the brown strip the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https silently widened between us it was strangely like stage roofed sheds of the quay the motionless groups the central ﬁgure of the old woman depicting emotion suddenly she dropped her hands and hobbled away at great rate disappearing ﬁnally into the maze of the street beyond concluding that she had decided to get quickly home with her great treasure we commended her discretion and gave our attention to other things the drizzle fell uninterruptedly we had edged sidewise the requisite distance and were now gathering headway in our long voyage the quail was beginning to recede and to diminish back from the street hastened the ﬁgure of the little old woman she carried large white cloth of which she had evidently been in quest this she unfolded and waved vigorously with both hands until we had passed quite from sight she stood there signalling her farewell long after we were beyond distinguishing her ﬁgure we could catch the ﬂutter of white thus that ship company embarking each on his great adventure far from home and friends received their farewell very genuine farewell from one poor old woman ventured the opinion that it was the best thing we had bought with our french money iii t said the time of times to approach port said is just at the fall of dusk then the sea lies in opalescent patches and the low shores fade away into the gathering night the slanting masts and yards of the dhows silhouette against sky of the deepest translucent green and the heroic statue of lesseps standing ever at the gateway he opened points always to the mysterious east the rhythmical accustomed chug of the engines had fallen to quarter speed leaving an uncanny stillness throughout the ship silently we slipped between the long piers drew up on the waterside town seized the buoy and came to rest all around us lay other ships of all sizes motionless on the inky water the reﬂections from their lights seem ed to be thrust into the depths like stilts and the few lights from the town reﬂected shiveringly across along the water all was dark and silent we caught the loom of buildings and behind them dull glow from ﬁre and guessed tall minarets and heard the rising and falling of chanting numerou s small boats hovered near ﬂoating in and out of the patches of light we ourselves cast waiting permission to swarm at the our patronage we went ashore passed through wicket gate and across the dark buildings to the heart of the town whence came the dull glow and the sounds of people here were two streets running across one another both brilliantly lighted both thronged both lined with little shops in the latter one could buy anything in any language with any money in them we saw cheap straw hats made in germany hung side by side with gorgeous and beautiful stuffs from the orient shoddy european garments and eastern jewels cheap celluloid combs and curious embroideries the crowd of in the streets were compounded in the same curiously mixed fashion few europeans generally in white and then variety of arabs egyptians somalis berbers east indians and the like each in his own gaudy or graceful costume it speaks well the accuracy of feeling anyway of our various midways pikes and the like of our world expositions that the streets of port said looked like midways raised to the nth power along them we sauntered with pleasing feeling of on all sides we were gently and humbly the shopkeepers by the sidewalk vendors the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https guides by by jugglers by magicians all and respectful all yielding water to rebuf f but quick water to glide back again the vendors were of the colours of the rainbow and were heavily hung with long necklaces of coral or amber with scarves with strings of silver coins with sequinned veils and silks girt with many dirks and knives furnished out in concealed pockets with scarabs bracelets sandalwood boxes or anything else under the broad canopy of heaven one might or might not desire their voices were soft and pleasing their eyes had the beseeching quality of good dog their anxious and deprecating faces were ready at the slightest encouragement to break out into the friendliest and most intimate of smiles wherever we went we were accompanie d by retinue straight out of the arabian nights patiently awaiting the moment when we should tire should seek out the table of sidewalk café and should in our relaxed mood be ready to unbend to our royal purchases at that moment we were too much interested in the town itself the tiny shops with their smiling and insinuating oriental keepers were fascinating in their displays of carved woods jewellery perfumes silks tapestries silversmiths work ostrich feathers and the like to either side the main street lay long narrow dark alleys in which ﬂared single lights across which ﬂitted mysterious ﬁgures from which ﬂoated stray snatches of music either palpitatingly barbaric or ridiculously modern there the authority of the straight soudanese policemen ceased and it was not safe to wander unarmed or alone besides these motley variegations of the east and west the main feature of the town was the street car it was an structur of spacious dimensions though benches and canopy had been erected rather haphazard on small dancing platform the track is absurdly narrow in gauge and consequence the ediﬁce swayed and swung from side to side single mule was attached to it loosely by about ten feet of rope it was driven by gaudy ragamufﬁn in turban various other gaudy ragamufﬁns lounged largely and picturesquely on the widely spaced benches whence it came or whither it went i not know its orbit swung into the main street turned corner and disappeared apparently europeans did not patronize this picture sque wreck but drove elegantly but mysteriously in small open cabs conducted by totally incongruous turbaned drivers we ended ﬁnally at an imposing corner hotel where we dined by an open window just above the level of the street dozen upturned faces besought us silently during the meal at glance of even the mildest interest dozen long brown arms thrust the spoils of the east upon our consideration with us sat large benign swedish professor whose erudition was encyclopaedic but whose kindly humanity was greater utter ing deep cavernous chuckles the professor bargained red coral necklace the moment was the matter of interest the professor inspected it carefully and handed it back i doubt if id iss coral said he simply the present owner of the beads went frantic with proof and vociferation with the swiftness and precision of much repetition he ﬁshed out match struck it applied the ﬂame to the alleged coral and blew out the match cast the necklace on the pavement produced mysteriously small hammer and with it proceeded frantically to pound the beads evidently he was accustomed to being doubted and carried his materials proof around with him then in one motion the hammer disappeared the beads were snatched up and again of fered unharmed inspection are those good tests genuineness we asked the professor aside to that he replied regretfully i not know i know of coral only that is the hard calcareous skeleton of the marine coelen terate polyps and that this red coral iss called of sclerobasic group and other facts of the kind but i not know if it iss supposed to resist impact and heat possibly he ended shrewdly it is the common imitation which does not resist impact and heat at any rate they are pretty how much he demanded of the vendor egyptian waiting patiently until our conference should the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https twenty shillings he replied promptly the professor shook with one of his cavernous chuckles too much he observed and handed the necklace back through the window the egyptian would by means receive it keep keep he implored thrusting the mass of red upon the professor with both hands how much you give one shilling announced the professor ﬁrmly the coral necklace lay on the edge of the table throughout most of our leisurely meal the vendor argued pleaded gave it up disappeared in the crowd returned dramatically after an interval the professor ate calmly chuckled much and from time to time repeated ﬁrmly the words one shillin finally at the cheese he reached out swept the coral into his pocket and laid down two shillings the egyptian deftly gathered the coin smiled cheerfully and produced glittering veil in which he tried in vain to enlist billy interest coffee and cigars we moved to the terrace outside here an orchestra played the peoples of many nations sat at little tables the peddlers fakirs jugglers and tellers swarmed postal cards seemed sufﬁcient to set small boy up in trade and to imbue him with all the importance and insistence of merchant with jewels other ragamufﬁns tried to call our attention to some sort of with poor downy little chickens grave turbaned and polite indians squatted legged at our feet begging to give us look into the future by means of the only genuine troupe of acrobats went energetically and hopefully through quite meritorious performance few feet away deftly triumphant juggler did very easily and directly beneath our watchful eyes some really wonderful tricks gorgeous swarm of insinuating smiling peddlers of small things dangled and spread their wares where they thought themselves most sure of attention beyond our own little group we saw slowly passing in the lighted street outside the portico the variegated and picturesque loungers across the way phonograph bawled our stringed orchestra played the dollar princess from somewhere over in the dark and mysterious alleyways came the regular beating of the magniﬁcent and picturesque town car with its gaudy ragamufﬁns swayed by in train of its diminutive mule suddenly our persistent and amusing entourage vanished in all directions standing idly at the portico was very straight black soudanese on his head was the usual red fez his clothing was of trim khaki his knees and feet were bare with blue puttees between and around his middle was drawn close and smooth sash at least foot and half in breadth he made ﬁne upstanding egyptian ﬁgure and was armed with pride short sheathed club and great scorn word spoke he nor command but merely jerked thumb towards the darkness and into the darkness our horde melted away we were left feeling rather lonesome near midnight we sauntered down the street to the quay whence we were rowed to the ship by another turbaned ﬁgure who sweetly begged just copper or so poor boatman we found the ship in the process of coaling every porthole and doorway closed and heavy canvas hung to protect far possible the clean decks two barges were moored alongside two blazing braziers lighted them with weird red and ﬂickering ﬂames in their depths cast in black and red shado ws toiled ﬁgures from their depths mounting single steep plank came an unbroken procession of natives naked save wisp of cloth around the loins they trod closely on each other heels carrying each his basket atop his head or on one shoulde r mounted dischar ged their loads into the side of the ship and descended again to the depths by way of another plank the lights ﬂickered across their dark faces their gleaming teeth and eyes somehow the the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https heap of screeching shouti ng and gesticulation but somehow also it went forward rapidly dozens of unattached natives lounged about the gunwales with apparently nothing to but to look picturesque shore boats moved into the narrow circle of light drifted to our gangway and dischar ged huge crates of vegetables sacks of unknown stuffs and returning passengers vigilant police boat hovered near to settle disputes generally with the blade of an oar long time we leaned over the rail watching them and the various reﬂected lights in the water and the very clear unwavering stars then the coaling ﬁnished and the portholes once more opened we turned in iv suez some time during the night we must have started but so gently had we slid along it fractional speed that until i raised my head and looked out i had not realized the fact i saw high sandbank this glided monotonously by until i grew tired of looking at it and got up after breakfast however i found that the sandbank had various attractions all of its own three camels laden with stone and in convoy of ﬁgures shufﬂed down the slope at picturesque angle two cowled women in black veiled to the eyes in gauze heavily sewn with sequins barefooted with massive silver anklets watched us pass hindu workmen in turban and furnished picturesque note but did not seem to be injuring themselves by naked small boys raced us short distance the banks glided by very slowly and very evenly the wash sucked after us like water in slough after duck boat and the sky above the yellow sand looked extremely blue at short and regular intervals up the miniature sandhills heavy piles or had been planted these we at ﬁrst could guess reason soon however we had to pass another ship and then we saw that one of us must tie up to avoid being drawn irresistibly by suction into collision with the other the craft sidled by separated by only few feet so that we could look across to each other decks and exchange greetings the day grew this interest grew likewise dredgers in the canal rusty tramps ﬂying unfamiliar ﬂags of strange tiny countries big freighters often with greek or turkish characters on their sterns small dirty steamers of suspicious business passenger ships like our own returning from the tropics with languid ﬁgures reclining in canvas chairs gunboats of this or that nation bound on mysterious affairs once converted into troopship from whose every available porthole hatch deck and shroud laughing brown english faces shouted chaff at our german these either tied up us or were tied up by us the only craft that received consideration on our part were the various picturesque arab dhows with their single masts and the long yards slanting across them since these were very small our suction dragged at them cruelly usual thing four vociferous ﬁgures clung desperately to rope passed around one of the ashore while an old man shrieked syllables at them from the dhow itself they never by any chance thought of mooring her both stem and stern the dhow generally changed ends rapidly shipping considerable water in the process it must be very trying to get so excited in hot climate the high sandbanks of the early part of the day soon dropped lower to afford us wider view in its broad general features the country was quite simply the desert of arizona over again there were the same high distant and mountains fragile and pearly the same low broken ces the same wide sweeps the same wonderful changing effects of light colour shadow and mirage the same occasional strips of green marking the watercourses and oases to smaller detail we saw many interesting diver gences in the foreground constantly recurred the bedouin brush shelters each the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https picturesque ﬁgure or so in ﬂowing robes and its grumpy camels twice we saw travelling caravans exactly like the bible pictures at one place single burnoused arab leaning on his elbows reclined full length on the of sandhill glittering in the mirage we made out distant little white towns with slender palm trees at places the water from the canal had overﬂowed wide tracts of country here along the shore we saw thousands of the water already familiar to us well such strangers gaudy kingﬁshers ibises and rosy ﬂamingoes the canal itself seemed to be in continual state of repair dredgers were everywhere some of the ordinary shovel type others working by suction and dischar ging far inland by means of weird huge pipes that appa rently meandered at will over the face of nature the control stations were beautifully french and neat painted yellow each with its gorgeous bougainvilleas in ﬂower its signal masts its brightly painted extra buoys standing in row its wharf its impassive arab ﬁshermen thereon we reclined in our canvas chairs had lemon squashes brought to us and watched the entertainment steadily and slowly unrolled before us we reached the end of the canal about three of the afternoon and dropp ed anchor off the shores our binoculars showed us white houses in apparen tly single rank along narrow sand spit with sparse trees and railroad line that was the town of suez and seemed so little interesting that we were not particularly sorry that we could not go ashore far in the distance were mountains and the water all about us was the light clear green of the sky at sunset innumerable dhows and swarmed down ﬁlled with eager salesmen of curios and ostrich plumes they had not much time in which to bargain so they made it up in vociferation one very tall and digniﬁed arab had sailor of his craft the most extraordinary creature just above the lower limit of the human race he was of dull coal black without single high light on him anywhere though he had been papered had prominent teeth like those of baboon in wrinkled wizened monkey face across which were three tattooed bands and possessed little ed spare ﬁgure bent and wiry he clambered up and down his mast fetching things at his master behest leapt nonchalantly our rail or his own spar the case might be across the staggering abyss clung so well with his toes that he might almost have been classiﬁed with the quadrumana and between times squatted humped over on the rail watching us with bright elﬁsh alien eyes at last the big german sailors bundled the whole variegated horde overside it was time to go and our anchor chain was already rumbling in the hawse pipes they tumbled hastily into their boats and at once swarmed up their masts whence they feverishly continued their interrupted bargaining in fact so fully embarked on the tides of commerce were they that they failed to notice the tides of nature widening between us one old man in especial at the very top of his mast jerked hither and thither by the sea continued imploringly to offer an utterly ridiculous carved wooden camel long after it was impossible to have completed the transaction should anybody have been moonstruck enough to have desired it our ship prow swung and just at sunset the lights of suez were twinkling out one by one we headed down the red sea the red sea suez is indeed the gateway to the east in the mediterranean often the sea is rough the winds cold passengers are not yet acquainted and hug the saloons or the leeward side of the deck once through the canal and all is changed by magic the air is hot and languid the ship company down to the very scullions appear in immaculate white the the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https and transoms even are put in white coverings electric fans hum everywhere the run on lemon squashes begins and many quaint and curious customs of the tropics obtain example it is etiquette that before eight one may wander the decks at will in one pyjamas converse affably with fair ladies in pigtail and kimono and be not abashed but on the stroke of eight bells it is also etiquette to disappear very promptly and to array one self the day and it is very improper indeed to see or be seen after that hour in the rather extreme negligée of the early morning also it becomes the universal custom or perhaps i should say the necessity to slumber an hour after the noon meal certainly sleep descending on the tropical traveller is armed with bludgeon passengers crew steerage deck animal and bird fall down then in an enchantment i have often wondered who navigates the ship during that sacred hour or indeed if anybody navigates it at all perhaps that time is sacred to the genii of the old east who close all prying mortal eyes but in return lend guiding hand to the most pressing of mortal affairs the deck of the ship is curious sight between the hours of one and three the tropical siesta requires couching of the form you sit down in your chair with fade slowly into deep restful slumber and yet it is slumber wherein certain small pleasant things persist from the world outside you remain dimly conscious of the rhythmic throbbing of the engines of the beat of soft warm air on your cheek at three or thereabout you rise gently back to life and sit erect in your chair without stretch or yawn in your whole anatomy then is the one time of day display of you have any to display ship games explorations to the forecastle watch ﬂying ﬁsh or arab dhows anything until time then the glowing sunset the opalescent sea and the soft afterglow of the the bugle summoning you to dress that is mean job nothing could possibly swelter worse than the tiny cabin the electric fan is an aggravation you reappear in your fresh whites somewhat warm and ﬂustered in both mind and body turn around the deck cools you off and dinner restores your with the soft warm tropic air breathing through all the ports the electric fans drumming busily the men all in clean white the ladies the very few precious ladies in soft low gowns after dinner the deck near cool it will be and heads bare to the breeze of our progress and glowing cigars at ten or eleven the groups begin to break up the canvas chairs to empty soon reappears pyjamaed ﬁgure followed by steward carrying mattress this is spread under its owner direction in dark corner forward with sigh you in your turn plunge down into the sweltering inferno of your cabin only to reappear likewise with steward and mattress the latter if you are wise you spread where the wind of the ship going will be full upon you it is strong wind and blows upon you heavily so that the sleeves and legs of your pyjamas ﬂop but it is soft warm wind and beats you with mufﬂed ﬁngers in temperate clime can you ever enjoy this peculiar effect of strong breeze on your naked skin without even the faintest surface chilly sensation so habituated has one become to feeling cooler in draught that the absence of chill lends the night an unaccustomedness the more weird in that it is unanalyzed so that one feels deﬁnitely that one is in strange far country this is intensiﬁed by the fact that in these latitudes the moon the great glorious calm tropical moon is directly the centre line of the of being with us in our temperate zone always more or less declined to the horizon this too lends the night an exotic quality the more effective in that at ﬁrst the reason it is not apprehended night in the tropics is always more or less broken one awakens and sleeps again motionless ﬁgures cigarettes glowing are lounging against the rail looking out over molten sea the moonlight lies in patterns across the deck shivering slightly under the throb of the engines or occasionally swaying slowly forward or slowly back the ship course changes but otherwise motionless here the sea is always calm you raise your head look about sprawl in new position on your mattress fall asleep on one of these occasions you ﬁnd unexpectedly that the night has become gray dawn and that the kindly old quartermaster is bending over you sleepily the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https you stagger to your feet and collapse into the nearest chair then to the swish of water the sailors sluice the decks all around and under you you fall into really deep sleep at six this is broken by another tropical institution consisting merely of clear tea and biscuits i never could get to care it but nowhere in the tropi cs could i head it off matter how tired i was or how dead sleepy i had to receive that confounded throwing things at the native who brought it did good at all he merely dodged admonition did good nor prohibition in strong terms i was but one white man of the whole white race and i had right to possess idiosyncrasies running counter to dastur the custom however the early hours are proﬁtable hours in the tropics it did not drive to homicide the ship company now developed our two prize members fortunately us sat at our table the ﬁrst was the swedish professor aforementioned he was large benign paternal broad in mind thoroughly human and beloved and yet profoundly erudite he was our iconoclast in the way of food he performed small but illuminating dissections on his plate and announced triumphantly results that were not bit in accordance with the menu single bone was sufﬁcient to take the pretension out of any ﬁsh our other particular friend was with whom later we travelled in the interior of africa is very celebrated hunter and explorer an old africander his face seamed and tanned by many years in hard climate several days we did not recognize him although he sat fairly alongside but put him down shy man and let it go at that he never stayed the long table dinners but fell upon the ﬁrst solid course and made complete meal from that when he had quite ﬁnished eating all he could he drank all he could then he departed from the table and took up remote and inaccessible position in the corner of the he was engaged in growing the beard he customarily wore in the most ﬁerce outstanding beard that terriﬁed the intrusive into submission and yet bwana possesses the kindest blue eyes in the world full of quiet patience great understanding and inﬁnite gentleness his manner was abrupt and uncompromising but he would anything in the world one who stood in need of him from women he ﬂed yet billy won him with inﬁnite patience and in the event they became the closest of friends withal he possessed pair of the most powerful shoulders i have ever seen on man of his frame and in the depths of his mild blue eyes ﬂickered ﬂame of resolution that i could well imagine ﬂaring up to something formidable slow to make friends but staunch and loyal gentle and forbearing but ﬁerce and implacable in action at once loved and most terribly feared shy wild animal but straightforward and undeviating in his human relations most remarkably quiet and unassuming but with tremendous vital force in his deep eyes and jaw informed with the widest and most understanding humanity but unfor giving of evildoers and with the most direct and absolute courage bwana was to the most interesting man i met in africa and became the best of my friends the only other man at our table happened to be our sins the young englishman mentioned throwing the ﬁrst coin to the old woman on the pier at marseilles we will call him brown and because he represents type he is worth looking upon moment he was of the super sort bubbling over with vitality in and out of everything bounding up at odd and languid moments to an extraordinary extent he was afﬂicted with the spiritual blindness of his class quite genuinely quite seriousl y he was unconscious of the human signiﬁcance of beings and institutions belonging to foreign country or even to class other than his own his own kind he treated complete and understandable human creatures all others were merely objective we to certain extent happened to fall in the former category he was pleasant to us is he was pleasant to us in his way but had not insight enough to guess at how to be pleasant to us in our way but soon he got out of his own class or what he conceived to be such he considered all people outsiders he did not credit them with prejudices to rub with feelings to hurt indeed hardly with ears to overhear provided the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https was an outsider he had not the slightest hesitancy in saying exactly what he thought about any one anywhere alway s in his high clear english voice matter what the time or occasion natural corollary he always rebuf fed beggars and the like brutally and was always quite sublimely doing little things that thoroughly shocked our sense of the other fellow rights human being in all this he did not mean to be cruel or inconsiderate it was just the way he was built and it never entered his head that such people had ears and brains in the rest of the ship company were dozen or so other englishmen of the upper classes either army men on shooting trips or youths going out with some idea of settling in the country they were pleasant lot good people to know anywhere but of unusual interest it was only when one went abroad into the other nations that inscribable human interest could be found there was the greek scutari and his bride languorous rather opulent beauty with large dark eyes all men and luxurious manner of lying back and fanning herself she talked in half dozen languages changing from one to the other without break in either her ﬂuency or her thought her little

complexion and hard ﬂesh in striking and agreeable contrast to most of his compatriots the latter were trying to drink all the beer on the ship but she had been stocked an voyage of which this was but the second week they were not making noticeable headway however they did not seem to be easily discouraged the herr doktor was most polite and attentive but we did not talk german nor much swahili and he had neither english nor much french we had our difﬁculties i have heard billy in talking to him scatter fragments of these four languages through single sentence several days we drifted down warm ﬂat sea then one morning we came on deck to ﬁnd ourselves close aboard number of volcanic islands they were compose d entirely of red and dark purple lava blocks rugged quite without vegetation save occasional patches of stringy green in gully and uninhabited except lighthouse on one and ﬁshing shanty near the shores of another the high mournful mountains with their dark shadows seemed to brood over hot desolation the rusted and battered stern of wrecked steamer stuck up at an acute angle from the surges shortly after we picked up the shores of arabia note the advantages of half ignorance from early childhood we had thought of arabia the burning desert of course of the red sea bordered by shifting sands alone if we had known the we had not been half would have missed the profound surprise of discovering that in reality the red sea is bordered by high and rugged mountains leaving just space enough between themselves and the shore sloping plain on which our glasses could make out occasional palms perhaps the shifting sands of the burning desert lie somewhere beyond but somebody might have mentioned these great mountains after examining them attentively we had to confess that if this sort of thing continu ed farther north the children of israel must the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https very hard time of it mocha shone white glittering and low with the red and white spire of mosque rising brilliantly above it vi aden it was cooler and change we had turned into our bunks when pound ed on our stateroom door in the name of the eternal east said he come on deck we slipped on kimonos and joined the row of scantily draped and interested ﬁgures along the rail the ship lay quite still on perfect sea of moonlight bordered by low ﬂat distant shore on one side and nearer mountains on the other strong ﬂare centred from two ship reﬂectors overside made focus of illumination that subdued but could not quench the soft moonlight with which all outside was silvered dozen boats striving against current or clinging best they could to the ship side glided into the light and became real and solid or dropped back into the ghostly white unsubstantiality of the moon they were long narrow boats with small ﬂush decks fore and aft we looked down on them from almost directly above so that we saw the thwarts and the ribs and the things they contained astern in each stood men bending gracefully against the thrust of long sweeps about their waists were squares of cloth wrapped twice and tucked in otherwise they were naked and the long smooth muscles of their slender bodies rippled under the skin the latter was of beautiful ﬁne texture and chocolate brown these men had keen intelligent clear faces of the greek order though the statues of garden had been stained brown and had come to life they leaned on their sweeps thrusting slowly but strongly against the little wind and current that would drift them back in the body of the boats crouched sat or lay picturesque mob some pulled spasmodically on the very long limber oars others squatted doing nothing some huddled shapelessly underneath white cloths that completely covered them slept soundly in the bottom we took these merchandise until one of them suddenly threw aside his covering and sat up others again poised in proud and graceful attitudes on the extreme prows of their bobbing craft especially decorative were two clad only in immense white turbans and white cloths about the waist an old arab with white beard stood midships in one boat quite motionless except the slight swaying necessary to preserve his equilibrium his voluminous white draperies ﬂuttering in the wind his dark face just distinguishable under his burnouse most of the men were somalis however their keen small faces slender but graceful necks slim torsos bending to every movement of the boat and the white or gaudy draped nether garments were decorative the ﬁgures on an egyptian tomb one or two of the more barbaric had made neat headdresses of white clay plastered in the form of after an interval small and fussy tugboat steamed around our stern and drew alongside the gangway three passengers disembarked from her and made their way aboard the main deck of the craft under an awning was heavily encumbered with trunks tin boxes hand baggage tin gun cases and all sorts of impedimenta the tugboat moored itself to us fore and aft and proceeded to think about dischar ging perhaps twenty men in accurate replica of those in the small boats had charge of the job they had their own methods after long interval devoted strictly to nothing some unfathomable impulse would incite one or two or three of the natives to tackle trunk at it they tugged and heaved and pushed in the manner of ants making off with particularly large ﬂy or the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https trove tossing it up the steep gangway to the level of our decks the trunks once safely bestowed all interest all industry died we thought that ﬁnished it and wondered why the tug did not pull out of the way but always after an interval another bright idea would strike another native or natives disappear beneath the canvas awning over the tug deck to emer ge shortly carrying almost anything from parasol to heavy chest on close inspection they proved to be very small people the impression of graceful height had come from the slenderness and justness of their proportions the smallness of their bones and the upright grace of their carriage after standing alongside one we acquired ﬁne respect their ability to handle those trunks at all moored to the other side of the ship we found two huge lighters from which bales of goods were being hoisted aboard two camels and dozen diminutive mules stood in the waist of one of these craft the camels were sniffy and supercilious and scornful camels always are and everybody promptly hated them with the hatred of the abysmally inferior spirit something that scorn s it is the usual attitude of the human mind towards camels we waited upwards of an hour in the hope of seeing those camels hoisted aboard but in vain while we were so waiting one of the deck passeng ers below us somali in white clothes and gorgeous cerise turban decided to turn in he spread square of thin matting atop one of the hatches and began to unwind yards and yards of the ﬁne silk turban he came to the end of he sank to the deck the turban spread open by the resistance of the air ﬂuttered down to cover him from head to foot apparently he fell asleep at once he did not again move nor alter his position he well an astonishingly large proportio n of the other somalis and abyssinians we saw carried queer triangular wound in his head it had long since healed was an inch or so across and looked though piece of the skull had been removed if conscientious enemy had leisure and an icepick he would just about that sort of job how its recipient had escaped instant death is mystery at length about three despairing of the camels we turned in after three hours sleep we were again on deck aden by daylight seemed to be several sections of town tucked into pockets in bold raw lava mountains that came down fairly to the water edge between these pockets ran narrow shore road and along the road paced haughty camels hitched to diminu carts on contracted round bluffs towards the sea were various low bungalow build ings which we were informed comp rised the military and civil ofﬁcers quarters the real aden has been built inland short distance at the bottom of cup in the mountains elaborate stone reservoirs have been constructed to catch rain water there is other natural water supply whatever the only difﬁculty is that it practically never rains so the reservoirs stand empty the water is distilled from the sea and the haughty camels and the little carts the distributing the lava mountains occupy one side of the spacious bay or gulf the foot of the bay and the other side are ﬂat with one or two very distant white villages and many heaps of glittering salt big houses we waited patiently at the rail an hour more to see the camels slung aboard by the crane it was worth the wait they lost their impassive and immemorial dignity completely sprawling groaning positi vely shrieking in dismay when the solid deck rose to them and the sling had been loosened however they regained their poise instantaneously their noses went up in the air and they looked about them with challenging unsmiling superiority though to dare any one of us to laugh their native attendants immediately squatted down in front of them and began to feed them with convenient lengths of what looked like our common marsh the camels did not even then manifest the slightest intere st in the proceedings indeed they would not condescend to reach out three inches the most luscious held that far from their aristocratic noses the attendants had actually to thrust the fodder between their jaws i am glad to say they condescended to chew the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https the indian ocean leaving aden and rounding the great promontory of cape guardafui we turned south along the coast of africa off the cape were strange oily cross rips and currents on the surface of the sea the rose in ﬂocks before our bows high mountains of peaks and ﬂat table tops thrust their summits into clouds and along the coast the breakers spouted like whales the ﬁrst time too we began to experience what our preconceptions had imagined tropical heat heretofore we had been hot enough in all conscience but the air had felt though wafted from an opened furnace and scorching now although the temperature was lower 2 the humidity was greater swooning languor was abroad over the spellbound ocean relaxing mist of enchantment my glasses were constantly clouding over with ﬁne coating of water drops exposed metal rusted overnight the folds in garments accumulated mildew in an astonishingly brief period of time there was never even the suggestion of chill in this dampness it clung and enveloped like grateful garment and seemed only to lack sweet perfume at this time by good fortune it happened that the moon came full we had enjoyed its waxing during our voyage down the red sea but now it had reached its greatest phase and hung over the slumbering tropic ocean like lantern the lazy sea stirred beneath it and the ship glided on its lights fairly subdued by the splendour of the waters under the awnings the ship company lounged in lazy attitudes or promenaded slowly talking low voiced cigars glowing in the splendid dusk overside in the furrow of the disturbed waters the phosphorescence ﬂashed perpetually beneath the shadow of the ship the days passed by languidly and all alike on the chart outside the door the procession of tiny german ﬂags on pins marched steadily an inch at time towards the south otherwise we might well have imagined ourselves midgets aﬂoat in pond and getting nowhere somewhere north of the father neptune in ancient style had come aboard and ducked the lot of were treated to the spectacle of how the german sheep reacts under joke each nation has its type of fool and all the joyousness of mankind differ on the bulletin board one evening appeared notice to the effect that the following morning limited number of sportsmen would be permitted ashore the day each was advised to bring his own lunch riﬂe and drinks the reason alleged was that the ship must round certain cape across which the sportsmen could march afoot in sufﬁcient time to permit them little shooting now aboard ship were dozen english four americans and thirty or forty germans the americans and english looked upon that bulletin smiled gently and went to order another round of lemon squashes it was meek mild little joke enough but surely the bulletin board was far it could possibly go next morning however we observed of our german friends in khaki and sun helmet very busy with lunch boxes bottles of beer riﬂes and the like they said they were going ashore per bulletin we looked at each other and hied us to the upper deck there we found one of the boats slung overside with our old friend the quartermaster ostentatiously stowing kegs of water boxes and the like when we inquired gently does the expedition start at ten said he it was now within ﬁfteen minutes of that hour we were at the time fully ten miles off shore and forging ahead full speed parallel with the the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https pointed out this fact to the quartermaster but found to our sorrow that the poor old man had suddenly gone deaf we therefore refrained from asking several other questions that had occurred to why the cape was not shown on the map somebody said one of the americans cowboy going out second class on the look new cattle country is goat it sure looks to like it was these yere steamboat people they ca expect to rope nothing on such raw deal this to which the english assented though in dif ferent idiom but now up the companion ladder struggled eight individuals herded by the second mate they were armed to the teeth and thoroughly equipped with things i had seen in german catalogues but in whose existence i had never believed dozen sailors eagerly helped them with their multitudinous effects not thought gave they to the fact that we were ten miles off the coast that we gave indication of slackening speed that it would take the rest of the day to row ashore that there was cape us to round that if there all the other hundred improbabilities peculiar to the situation under directio n of the mate they deposited their impedimenta beneath tarpaulin and took their places in solemn rows amidships across the thwarts of the boat slung overside the importance of the occasion sat upon them heavily they were going slay wild beasts they looked upon themselv es of bolder sterner stuf f than the rest of us when the procession ﬁrst appeared our cowboy face single instant had ﬂamed with amazed incredulity then mask of expressionless stolidity fell across his features which in line thereafter varied one iota what are they going to with them murmured one of the englishmen at loss i reckon said the cowboy that they look on this the easiest way to drown them all to onct then from behind one of the other boats suddenly appeared huge german sailor with hose the devoted imbeciles in the shore boat were drenched by rst back and forth and up and down the heavy stream played while every other human being about the ship shrieked with joy did the victims rise up in body and capture that hose nozzle and turn the stream to sweep the decks did they duck shelter did they at least know enough to scatter and run they did none of these things but sat there in meek little rows like mannikins until the boat was half full of water and everything awash then when the sailor shut off the stream they continued to sit there until the mate came to order them out why i can not tell you perhaps that is the german idea of how to take joke perhaps they were afraid worse things might be conse quent on resistance perhaps they still hoped to go ashore one of the englishmen asked just that question what he demanded disgustedly what is the matter with the beggars our cowboy may have had the correct solution he stretched his long legs and jumped down from the rail nothing stirring above the ears said he it is customary in books of travel to describe this part of the journey somewhat follows skirting the low and uninteres ting shores of africa we at length reached etc low and uninteresting shores through the glasses we made out distant mountains far beyond nearer hills the latter were with dense forests whence rose mysterious smokes along the shore we saw an occasional cocoanut plantation to the water edge and native huts and villages of thatch canoes of strange models lay drawn up on shelving beaches queer of brush reached out considerable distances from the coast the white surf pounded on yellow the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https about these things was the jungle hemming in the plantations and villages bordering the lagoons creeping down until it fairly overhung the yellow beaches though conqueror through all the country beyon d it were to dispute dominion with old ocean himself it looked from the distance like thick soft coverlet thrown down over the country rather inequalities through the glasses we were occasionally able to peep under the edge of this coverlet and see where the fringe of the jungle drew back in little pocket or to catch the sheen of mysterious dark rivers slipping to the sea up these dark rivers by way of the entrances of these tiny pockets the imagination then could lead on into the dimness beneath the sunlit upper surfaces towards the close of one afternoon we changed our course slightly and swung in on long slant towards the coast we did it casually too casually so very important an action now at last we were about to touch the mysterious continent then we saw clearer the ﬁne big groves of palm and the luxuriance of the tropical vegetation against the greenery bold and white shone the buildings of mombasa and after little while we saw an inland glitter that represented her narrow deep bay the stern of wrec k against the low green cliffs and strange squat trees without leaves straight past all this we glided at half speed then turned sharp to the right to enter long wide expanse like river with green banks twenty feet or so in height grown thickly with the tall cocoanut palms these gave way at times into broad low lagoons at the end of which were small beaches and boats and native huts among more cocoanut groves through our glasses we could see the black men watching us quite motionless squatted on their heels it was like suddenly entering another world this gliding from the open sea straight into the heart of green land the ceaseless wash of waves we had left outside with the ocean our engines had fallen silent across the hushed waters came to us strange chantings and the beating of an occasional shrill shout from the unknown jungle the sun was just set and the tops of the palms caught the last rays all below was dense green shadow across the surface of the water glided canoes of shapes strange to us we passed ancient ruins almost completely dismantled their stones half smothered in green rank growth the wide bay stretched on before us far the waning light permitted us to see ﬁnally losing itself in the heart of mystery steadily and conﬁdently our ship steam ed forward until at last when we seemed to be aﬂoat in lake we dropped anchor and came to rest darkness fell utterly before the usual quarantine regulations had been carried through active and efﬁcient agents had already taken charge of our affairs so we had only to wait idly by the rail until summoned then we jostled our way down the long gangway passed and repassed by natives carrying baggage or returning more baggage steppe d briskly aboard very bobby little craft clambered over huge pile of baggage and stowed ourselves best we could ﬁgure in long white robe sat astern tiller ropes in hand two blacks far up towards the prow manipulated pair of tremendous sweeps with vast heaving jabbering and shouting our boat disengaged itself from the swarm of other craft we ﬂoated around the stern of our ship and were immediately suspended in blackness dotted with the stars and their reﬂections and with various twinkling scattered lights to one of these we steered and presently touched at stone quay with steps at last we set foot on the land to which so long we had journeyed and towards which our expectations had grown so great we experienced the pleasure that touches the souls of men landing on strange shores footnotes 2 degrees in daytime and degrees at the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https mombasa single light shone at the end of the stone quay and another inside big indeterminate building at some distance we stumbled towards this and found it to be the biggest shed ever constructed out of corrugated iron bearded sikh stood on guard at its open entrance he let any one and every one enter with never ﬂicker of his expressionless black eyes but allowed one to go out again without the closest scrutiny dutiable articles that lacked the blue customs plaster we entered the place was vast and barnlike and dim and very very hot east indians stood behind the counters another babu sat at little desk ready to give his clerical attention to what might be required we saw european but next morning found that one passed his daylight hours in this inferno of heat the moment we let our main baggage go and occupied ourselves only with getting through our smaller effects this accomplished we stepped out past the sikh into the grateful night we had guide slender and wiry individual clad in tarboush and long white robe in vague general way we knew that the town of mombasa was across the island and about four miles distant in what direction or how we got there we had not the remotest idea the guide set off at brisk pace with which we tried in vain to keep step he knew the ground and we did not and the night was black dark commands to stop were of avail whatever nor could we get hold of him to restrain him by force when we put on speed he put on speed too his white robe glimmered ahead of us just in sight and in the darkness other white robes passing and crossing glimmered also at ﬁrst the ground was rough so that we stumbled outrageously billy and soon fell behind and i heard their voices calling plaintively us to slow down bit if i ever lose this nigger i never ﬁnd him again i shouted back but i can ﬁnd you the best you can we struck smoother road that led up hill on long slant apparently miles we followed thus the individual ahead still deaf to all commands and the curdling threats i had now come to uttering all our personal baggage had long since mysteriously disappeared ravished away from us at the customs house by ragged horde of blacks it began to look though we were stranded in africa without baggage or effects billy and were all the time growing fainter in the distance though evidently they too had struck the long slanting road then we came to dim solitary lantern glowing feebly beside bench at what appeared to be the top of the hill here our guide at last came to halt and turned to grinning face samama hapa he observed there that was the word i had been frantically searching my memory stop the others struggled in we were very warm up to the bench led tiny car track the rails not over two feet apart like the toy railroads children use this did not look much like grownup transportation but it and the bench and the dim lantern represented all the visible world we sat philosophically on the bench and enjoyed the soft tropical night the air was tepid heavy with unknown perfume black band of velvet across the eyes musical with the subdued undertones of thousand thousand night insects at points overhead the soft blind darkness melted imperceptibly into the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https long interval we distinguished distant faint rattling that each moment increased in loudness shortly came into view along the narrow tracks most extraordinary vehicle it was small square platform on wheels across which ran bench seat and over which spread canopy it carried also dim lantern this rumbled up to us and stopped from its stern hopped two black boys obeying smiling invitation we took our places on the bench the two boys immediately set to pushing us along the narrow track we were off at an astonishing speed through the darkness the night was deliciously tepid and i have said absolutely dark we made out the tops of palms and the dim loom of great spreading trees and could smell sweet soft odours the boys pattered alongside whenever the grade was easy one hand resting against the rail or pushed mightily up little hills or clung alongside like monk eys while we rattled and swooped and plunged down hill into the darkness subsequently we learned that huge ﬂat beam projecting amidships from beneath the seat operated brake which we above were supposed to manipulate but being quite ignorant to the ethics and mechanics of this strange system we swung and swayed at times quite breathlessly after about ﬁfteen minutes we began to pick up lights ahead then to pass garden walls with trees whose brilliant ﬂowers the lantern revealed ﬁtfully at last we made out white stucco houses and shortly drew up with ﬂourish before the hotel itself this was stucco affair with deep verandas sunken in at each story it fronted wide white street facing public garden and this we subsequently discovered was about the only clear and open space in all the narrow town antelope horns were everywhere hung on the walls and teakwood with rests on which comfortably to elevate your feet above your head stood all about we entered bare and partook of tropical fruits quite new to mangoes custard apples pawpaws and the small red eating bananas too delicate export overhead the punkahs swung back and forth in lazy hypnotic rhythm we could see the two blacks at the ends of the punkah cords outside on the veranda their bodies swaying lithely in alternation they threw their weight against the light ropes other blacks in the long white robes and exquisitely worked white skull caps of the swahili glided noiselessly on bare feet serving after dinner we sat out until midnight in the teakwood chairs of the upper galler y staring through the arches into the black mysterious night it was very hot and we rather dreaded the necessary mosquito veils likely to prove stuffy the mosquitoes are few in mombasa but they are very at midnight the thermometer stood f our premonitions to stufﬁness were well justiﬁed after restless night we came awake at daylight to the sound of ﬁne row of some sort going on outside in the streets immediately we arose threw aside the lattices and hung out over the sill the road stretched before us opposite was public square grown with brilliant ﬂowers and ﬂowering trees we could not doubt the cause of the trouble an indian on bicycle hurrying to his ofﬁce had knocked down native child said child quite naked sat in the middle of the white dust and howled to rend the whenever he felt himself observed if however the attention of the crowd happened the moment to be engrossed with the babu the injured one sat up straight and watched the row with interested rolling pickaninny eyes native policeman made the centre of whirling vociferating group he was chap straight and soldierly dressed in red tarboosh khaki coat bound close around the waist by yards and yards of broad red webbing loose short drawers of khaki bare knees and feet and blue puttees between his manner was inﬂexible the babu jabbered excitedly telling in all probability how he was innocent of fault was late his work etc in vain he had to go also the kid who now seeing himself again an object of interest recommenced his howling then the babu began frantically to indicate members of the crowd whom he desired to retain witnesses evidently not pleased with the prospect of appearing in court those indicated promptly ducked and ran the policeman promptly pursued and collared them one the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https he was policeman and he ran well the moment he laid hands on fugitive the latter collapsed whereupon the policeman dropped him and took after another the joke of it was that the one so abandoned did not try again to make off but stayed though he had been tagged at some game finally the whole lot still vociferating moved of f down the white road over an hour we hung from our window sill thoroughly interested and amused by the varied life that deployed before our eyes the morning seemed deliciously cool after the hot night although the thermometer stood high the sky was very blue with big piled white clouds down near the horizon dazzling sun shone on the white road the white buildings visible up and down the street the white walls enclosing their gardens and the greenery and colours of the trees within them from what we could see from our window we immediately voted tropical vegetation quite up to advertisement whole trees of gaudy red or yellow or bright orange blossoms ﬂowering vines ﬂowering shrubs peered over the walls or through the fences and behind them rose great mango es or the slenderer shafts of bananas and cocoanut palms up and down wandered groups of various sorts of natives month later we would have been able to identify their different tribes and to know more about them but now we wondered at them strange and picturesque peoples they impressed us in general being ﬁne lot of men they were of good physique carried themselves well and looked about them with certain dignity and independence ﬁne free pride of carriage and of step this fact alone differentiated them from our own negroes but further their features were in general much ﬁner and their skins of clear mahogany beautiful in its satiny texture these were the long white robes and ﬁne openwork skull caps they were the local race the swahili had we but known it the original zanzibari who furnished livingstone stanley speke and the other early explorers with their men others however were much less civilized we saw one cook tour from the jungle consisting of six savages their hair twisted into innumerable points their ear lobes stretched to hang fairly to their shoulders wearing only rather neglectful blanket adorned with polished wire carrying war clubs and bright spears they followed with eyes and mouths open very city cousin in the usual white garments swinging jaunty light bamboo cane the cane seems to be distinguishing mark of the leisured class it not only means that you are not working but also that you have earthly desire to work about this time one of the hotel boys brought the inevitable tea and biscuits of early morning this once it was very welcome our hotel proved to be on the direct line of freighting there are horses or draught animals in mombasa the ﬂy is too deadly therefore all hauling is done by hand the tiny tracks of the unique street car system run everywhere any one would wish to go branching off even into private grounds and to the very front doors of bungalows situated far out of town each resident owns his own street car just elsewhere man has his own carriage there are of course public cars also each with its pair of boys to push it and also number of rather decrepit rickshaws natural corollary to the passenger trafﬁc the freighting also is handled by the blacks on large ﬂat trucks with short guiding poles these men are quite naked save small loin cloth are beautifully shaped and glisten all over with perspiration shining in the sun so ﬁne is the texture of their skins the softness of their rippling the play of this shining perspiration is like beautiful polish they rush from behind slowly and steadily and patiently and unwaveringly the most tremendous loads of the heaviest stuffs when the hill becomes too steep them they turn their backs against the truck and by placing one foot behind the other few inches at time they edge their burden up the slope the steering is done by one man at the pole or tongue in front this individual also sets the key to the song by which in africa all heavy labour is carried forward he cries his wavering chant the toilers utter antiphony in low gruff tones at distance one hears only the wild high syncopated chanting but the affair draws slowly nearer the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https catches the undertone of the responses these latter are cast in the regular swing and rhythm of ef fort but the steersman throws in his bit at odd and irregular intervals thus headman shrill hay ah mon pushers gruf f in rhythm t unk or headman and wavering minor chant pushers undertone these wild and barbaric the distance near at hand dying into distance dogged toilsome came to be to us one of the typical features of the place after breakfast we put on our sun helmets and went forth curiously to view the town we found it roughly divided into four old portuguese the arabic the european and the native the portuguese comprises the outer fringe next the water of the inner bay it is very narrow of street with whitewashed walls balconies and wonderful carven and studded doors the business of the town is done here the arabic quarter lies back of maze of narrow alleys winding aimlessly here and there between high white buildings with occasionally the minarets and towers of mosque this district harboured besides the upper swahilis and arabs large number of east indians still back of this are thousands of the low grass or mud and wattle huts of the natives their roofs thatched with straw or palm these are apparently arranged on little system the small european popul ation lives atop the sea bluffs beyond the old fort in the most attractive bungalows this the most desirable location of all has remained open to them because heretofore the ﬁerce wars with which mombasa the island of blood has been swept have made the exposed seaward lands impossible idle occupation can be more fascinating than to wander about the mazes of this ancient town the variety of race and occupation is something astounding probably the one human note that everywhere persisting draws the whole together is furnished by the water mombasa has water system whatever the entire supply is drawn from numberless picturesque wells scattered everywhere in the crowded centre and distributed mainly in standard oil cans suspended at either end of short pole by dint of constant daily exercise hauling water up from depth and carrying it various distances these men have developed the most beautifully powerful ﬁgures they proceed at half trot the slender poles with forty pounds at either end seeming fairly to cut into their naked shoulders muttering word of warning to the loiterers at every other semeelay matter in what part of mombasa you may happen to be or at what hour of the day or night you will meet these industrious little men trotting along under their burdens everywhere also are the women carryin g themselves proudly erect with free swing of the hips they wear invariably single sheet of cotton cloth printed in blue or black with the most astonishing borders and spotty designs this is drawn tight just above the breasts leaving the shoulders and arms bare their hair is divided into perhaps dozen parts running lengthwise of the head from the forehead to the nape of the neck after the manner of the stripes on watermelon each part then ends in tiny twisted pigtail not over an inch long the lobes of their ears have been stretched until they hold thick round disks about three inches in diameter ornamented by concentric circles of different colours with red bull eye centre the outer edges of the ears are then further decorated with gold clasps set closely together many bracelets necklaces and armlets complete the they are big women with soft velvety skins and proud and haughty counterparts of the men in the white robes and caps by the way it may be good place here to remark that these garments and the patterned squares of cloth worn by the women are invariably most spotlessly clean these we learned were the swahilis the ruling class the descendants of the slave traders beside them are all sorts and conditions your true savage pleased his own the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https to dress and personal adornment the bushmen generally shaved the edges of their wool to leave nice natural skull cap wore single blanket draped from one shoulder and carried war club the ear lobe seemed always to be stretched sometimes sufﬁciently to have carried pint bottle indeed white marmalade jars seemed to be very popular wear one ingenious person had acquired dozen of the sort of safety pins used to fasten curtains to their rings these he had snapped into the lobes six on side we explored some time one of the swahilis attached himself to us so unobtrusively that before we knew it we had accepted him guide in that capacity he realized an ideal he never addressed word to us nor did he even stay in sight we wandered along at our sweet will dawdling slowly we pleased the guide had apparently quite disappeared look where we would we could in manner discover him at the next corner we would pause undecided to what to there in the middle distance would stand our friend smiling when he was sure we had seen him and were about to take the turn properly he would disappear again convoyed in this pleasant fashion we wound and twisted up and down and round and about through the most appalling maze we saw the native markets with their vociferating sellers seated on tables behind piles of fruit or vegetables while an equally vociferating crowd surged up and down the aisles gray parrots and little monkeys perched everywhere about billy gave one of the monkeys banana he peeled it exactly man would have done smelt it critically and threw it back at her in the most insulting fashion we saw also the rows of hindu shops open to the street with their gaudily dressed children of blackened eyelids their stolid dirty proprietors and their women marvellous in bright silks and massive bangles in the thatched native quarter were more of the ﬁne swahili women sitting on the earth under low verandas engaged in different handicrafts and chickens and many amusing naked children we made friends with many of them communicating by laughter and by signs while our guide stood unobtrusively in the middle distance waiting us to come on just at sunset he led us out to great open space with tall palm in the centre of it and the gathering of multitude of people mollah was clambering into high scaffold built of poles whence shortly he began to intone allah allah il allah the cocoanut palms cut the sunset and the boabab fat lazy boababs more monstrous than ever we called our guide and conferred on him the muniﬁcent sum of sixteen and half cents with which apparently much pleased he departed then slowly we wandered back to the hotel par t ii the shimba hills ix tropical jungle many months later and after adventures elsewhere described 3 besides others not relevant the moment an englishman and i returned to mombasa we came from some hundred odd miles in the interior where we had been exploring the sources and the course of the tsavo river now our purpose was to penetrate into the low hot wooded country along the coast known the shimba hills in quest of rare beast called the sable antelope these hills could be approached in one of two crossing the harbour and then marching two days afoot or by voyaging up to the very end of one of the long arms the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https sea that extend many miles inland the latter involved dhows dependence on uncertain winds favourable tides and heap of good luck it was less laborious but most uncertain at this stage of the plan the hotel manager came forward with the offer of gasoline launch which we gladly accepted we embarked about noon storing our native carriers and effects aboard dhow hired the occasion this we purposed towing very neatly uniformed swahili bearing on his stomach brass label big door harbour police duck ﬁsts over what he called overloading the boat he knew very little about boats but threw very competent duck ﬁsts we did know something about boats we braved unknown consequences by disregarding him utterly consequences perhaps to his own health when everything was aboard that dhow was pretty well down but still well aﬂoat then we white men took our places in the launch this was long narrow affair with engine she possessed speed gears she had either to plunge ahead full speed or come to stop there were compromises her steering was managed by tiller instead of wheel so that mere touch sufﬁced to swerve her ten feet from her course the dhow was in respects built on such nervous lines she did occasionally some fancy and splashing curves the pilot of the launch turned out to be yankee who had been catching wild animals barnum and bailey circus while waiting his ship he being proverbial handy yankee had taken on this job he became quite interested in telling us this and at times forgot his duties at the tiller then that would take wild swoop the clumsy old dhow astern would try vainly with much spray and dangerous careening to follow the compromise course would all but upset her the spray would ﬂy the safari boys would take their ducking the boat boys would yell and dance and lean frantically against the two long sweeps with which they tried to steer in this wild and untrammelled fashion we careered up the bay too interested in our own performances to pay much attention to the scenery the low shores with their cocoanut groves gracefully rising above the mangrove tangle slipped by and the distant blue shimba hills came nearer after while we turned into narrower channel with good many curves and quite unknown depth of water down this we whooped at the full speed of our horsepower engine occasional natives waist deep and ﬁshing stared after us the yankee ventured guess to how hard she would hit on mudbank she promptly proved his guess rank underestimate by doing so we fell in heap on the bottom the dhow bore down on us with majestic momentum the boat boys leaned frantically on their sweeps and managed just to avoid us the dhow also rammed the mudbank dozen reluctant boys hopped overboard and pushed us off we pursued our merry way again on either hand now appeared ﬁsh weirs of plaited coco ﬁbre which being planted in the shallows helped us materially to guess at the channel naked men up to their shoulders in the water attended to some mysterious need of the nets or emer ged dripping and sparkling from the water with baskets of ﬁsh atop their heads the channel grew even narrower and the mudbanks more frequ ent we dodged dozen in our headlong course our local guide swahili in tarboosh and beautiful saffron robe showed signs of strong excitement we were to stop he said around the next bend and at this rate we never could stop the yankee remarked superﬂuously that it would be handy if this blistered engine had clutch adding an afterthought that matter how long he stayed in the tropics his nose peeled we asked what we should if we our prospective he replied that the thing did have reverse while thus conversing we shot around corner into complete everything was shut off hastily and an instant later we and the dhow smashed up high and dry on cozy mud beach we drew deep breath and looked around us mangrove thicket to the edge of the slimy ooze trees was all we could see we gave our attention to the business of getting our men our effects and the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https the ooze proved to be just above knee deep the porters had fearful and ﬂoundering time and received much obvious comment from us perched in the bow of the launch finally everything was debarked and i took off our boots but our gunbearers expressed such horror at the mere thought of our plunging into the mud that we dutifully climbed them and were carried the hard shell beach was hundred feet away occupying little recess where the persistent tough mangroves drew back from it led narrow path through the thicket we waved and shouted farewell to the crews of the launch and the dhow the path hundred feet was walled in by the mangroves through which scuttled and rattled the big land crabs then suddenly we found ourselves in tropical paradise the tall coco palms rose tufted above everything the fans of the younger palms waved below bananas thrust the banners of their broad leaves wherever they could ﬁnd space creepers and vines ﬂung the lush luxuriance of their greenery over all the earth and into the depths of all the shadows in direction could one see unobstructed farther than twenty feet except straight up and there one could see just far the tops of the palms it was like being in green hot steamy lovely room very birds that ought really to have been at home in their cages ﬂuttered about we had much vigorous clearing to to make room our tents by the time the job was ﬁnished we were all pretty hot several of the boys made vain attempts to climb nuts but without success we had brought them with us from the interior where cocoanuts not grow and they did not understand the method they could swarm up the tall slim stems all right but could not manage to get through the spikes of the dead leaves tried and failed to the great amusement of the men but to the greater amusement of myself i was wise person and lay on my back on canvas cot so it was not much bother to look up and enjoy life not to earn absolutely the stigma of laziness i tried to shoot some nuts down this did not work either the soft spongy stems closed around the bullet holes then little wizened monkey of swahili porter having watched our futile performances with interest nonchalantly swarmed up in some mysterious manner he wriggled through the defences and perched in the top whence he dropped to us dozen big green nuts our men may not have been much of success at climbing nuts but they were passed masters at the art of opening them three or four clips from their awkward swordlike pangas and we were each presented with clean beautiful natural goblet brimming full of refreshing drink about this time ﬁne ﬁgure of man drifted into camp he was very very digniﬁed very venerable he was pure swahili though of the savage branch of that race and had none of the negro type of countenance in fact so like was he in face hair short square beard and genial dignity to certain of mine that it was very hard to remember that he had on only small strip of cloth that he was cherishing great treasure piece of soap box he had salvaged from the shore and that his skin was red chocolate i felt inclined to talk to him to an intellectual equal especially he had ﬁne resonant bass voice that in itself lent his remarks some importance however i gave him two ordinary wood screws showed him how they screwed in and out and left him happy after supper the moon rose casting shadows of new and unknown shapes through this strangely new and unknown forest thin white mist ascending everywhere from the soil tempered but could not obscure the white brilliance the thermometer stood now only at but the dripping tropical in which our camp was pitched considerably raised the sensible heat bird with most diabolical shrieking note cursed in the shadows another creature began softly and continued to repeat in diminishing ener gy until it seemed to have run down like piece of clockwork our way next morning led some time through this lovely but damp jungle then we angled up the side of hill to emer ge into the comparatively open country atop what we westerners would call hog back long narrow spurlike ridge mounting slowly the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https general elevation of the main hills here were high green bushes with little free open passages between them and occasionally openings running down the slopes on one side or the other before us some miles distant were the rounded blue hills we climbed steadily it was still very early morning but already the day was hot pretty soon we saw over the jungle to the gleaming waters of the inlet and then to the sea our hog back led us past ridge of the hills and before we knew it we had been deposited in shallow valley three or four miles wide between parallel ridges the said valley being at considerable elevation and itself diversiﬁed with rolling hills ravines meadow land and wide ﬂats on many of the ridges were scattered cocoanut palms and occasional mango groves while many smokes attested the presence of natives these we found in shambas or groups of little farms huddled all together with wilderness and brush and trees or the wide open green grass lawn between the houses were very large and they were constructed quite ingeniously from coco branches each branch made one mat the leaves were all brought over to the same side of the stem and then plaited the result ing mat was then six or seven feet long by from twelve to sixteen inches broad and could be used variety of purposes indeed we found melville chapter in typhee to the various uses of the cocoanut palm by means exaggerated the nuts leaves and ﬁbre supplied every conceivable human want the natives were pleasant friendly lot in fact so like was their cast of countenance to that of the d people we were accustomed to see that we had great difﬁculty in realizing that they were mere savages lack of the contrary notwithstanding under huge mango tree two were engaged in dividing sheep sixty or seventy others stood solemnly around watching it may have been religious ceremony all i know but the affair looked to be about two parts business to sixty of idle and cheerful curiosity we stopped and talked to them little chaffed the pretty were really marched on about noon our elegant guide stopped struck an attitude and pointed with his silver headed rattan cane this said he is where we must camp we marched through little village family party sat beneath the veranda of ﬁne very old wrinkled couple two stalwart beautiful youths youn g mother suckling her baby two young girls and eight or ten miscellaneous and naked youngsters the rest of the village appeared to be empty i imagined this to be the caretaker family and the youngsters to belong to others we stopped and spoke were answered cheerfully suggested that we might like to buy chickens and offered price instantly with whoop of joy the lot of them were afoot the fowl waited further intimations of troublous times but ﬂed squawking they had been there before so had our hosts inside minute they had returned each with broad grin after due payment we proceeded on few hundred yards and pitched camp beneath two huge mango trees besides furnishing one of the most delicious of the tropical fruits the mango is also one of the most beautiful of trees it is tall spreads very wide and its branches sweep to within ten feet of the ground its perfect symmetry combined with the size and deep green of its leaves causes it to resemble from short distance beautiful green hill beneath its umbrella one ﬁnds dense shade unmottled by single ray of sunligh t so that one can lie under it in full conﬁdence parenthetically even single ray of this tropical sunlight is to the unprotected very dangerous thing but the leaves of the mango have this peculiarity which distinguishes it from all other that they grow only at the very ends of the small twigs and branches these of course grow only at the ends of the big limbs it follows that from beneath the mango looks like lofty green dome veritable pantheon of the the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https made our camp under one of these trees gave ourselves all the space we could use and had plenty left tents and cook camp with crowding it was one of the pleasantest camps i ever saw our green dome overhead protected us absolutely from the sun high sweet grass grew all about us the breeze wandered lazily up from the distant indian ocean directly before our tent door the slope fell gently away through sparse cocoanut grove whose straight stems panelled our view then rose again to the clear outline of straight ridge opposite the crest of this was sentinelled by tall scattered cocoanut trees the bursting star pyrotechnic effect of their tops being particularly ﬁne against the sky after ﬁve hours tropical march uphill we were glad to sit under our green dome to look at our view to enjoy the little breeze and to drink some of the cocoanuts our friends the villagers brought in footnotes 3 the land of footprints the sable about three i began to feel rested and ambitious therefore i called up our elegant guide and memba sasa and set out on my ﬁrst hunt sable was rather more done up by the hard morning and so did not go along the guide wore still his red tarboosh his dark short jacket his saffron yellow nether was not exactly his silver rattan cane the only change he made was to tuck up the skirt leaving his long legs bare it hardly seemed altogether suitable costume hunting but he seemed to know what he was about we marched along ridges and down into ravines and across gulleys choked with brush horrible thickets alternated with and occasionally surrounded open green meadows hanging against the side hills we proceeded the country became rougher the ravines more precipitous we struggled up steep hills fairly bucking our way through low growth that proved all but impenetrable the idea was to ﬁnd sable feeding in one of the little open glades but whenever i allowed myself to think of the many adverse elements of the game the chances seemed very slim it took to get from one glade to the next there were thousands of glades the sable is rare shy animal that likes dense cover fully well if not better than the open sheer rank bull luck alone seemed the only hope and i felt my strength going in that vicious struggle against heavy brush and steep hills i began to have very strong doubts indeed to that sable it was cruel hard work in this climate one hailed car or rickshaw to an errand two streets away and considered onese lf quite hero if one took leisurely stroll along the cliff heads at sunset here i was after uphill march bucking into brush and through country that would be considered difﬁcult going even in canada at the end of twenty minutes my every garment was not wringing but dripping wet so that when i carried my riﬂe over my arm water ran down the barrel and off the muzzle in steady stream after bit of this my knees began to weaken and it became question of saving energy of getting along somehow and of leaving the actual hunting to memba sasa and the guide if they had shown sable i very much doubt if i could have hit it however we did not see one and i staggered into camp at dusk pretty well exhausted from the most grateful hot bath and clean clothes i derived much refreshment shortly the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https sitting in my canvas chair sipping cocoanut and describing the condition of affairs to who was naturally very curious to how the trick was done now i concluded i know just about what i can and what i can not three days more of this sort of work will feed up if we not run across sable in that time i afraid we get any two days will said he we called up the guide and questioned him closely he seemed quite conﬁdent and asserted that in this country sable were found when they were found at all which was not often they must be discovered in the small grassy openings we began to understand why so very few people get sable we dismissed the guide and sat quietly smoking in the warm soft evening the air was absolutely still save various night insects and birds and the weird calling of natives across the valleys far out towards the sea thunderstorm ﬂashed and after long interval the rumblings came to us so very distant was it that we paid it little attention save an interesting background to our own still evening almost between sentences of our slow conversation however it rushed up to the zenith blotting out the stars the tall palms began to sway and rustle in the forerunning breeze then with swoop it was upon us tempest of fury we turned in and all night long the heavy deluges of rain fell roaring like surf on an unfriendly coast by morning this had fallen to light steady drizzle in which we started off quite happily in this climate one likes to get wet the ground was sodden and deep with muck within mile of camp we saw many fresh buf falo tracks this time we went downhill and still downhill through openings among batches of great forest trees the new leaves were just coming out in pinks and russets so that the effect at little distance was almost precisely that of our autumn foliage in its duller phases so familiar were made some of the low rounded knolls that an instant we were respectively back in the hills of surrey or michigan and told each other so thus we moved slowly out from the dense cover to the grass openings far over on another ridge called my attention to something and indeterminate in another country i should have named it charred log on an old pine burning that was precisely what it looked like we glanced at it casually through our glasses it was sable buck lying down right out in the open he was black and sleek and we could make out his sweeping scimitar horns memba sasa and the swahili dropped ﬂat on their faces while and i crawle d slowly and cautiously through the mud until we had gained the cover of shallow ravine that ran in the beast general direction noting carefully certain small thicket landmark we stooped and moved fast we could down to that point of vantage there we cautiously parted the grasses and looked the sable had disappeared the place where he had been lying was plainly to be identiﬁed and there was cover save tiny bush between two and three feet high we were quite certain he had neither seen nor winded us either he had risen and ﬂed forward into the ravine up which we had made our stalk or else he had entered the small thicket agreed to stay on watch where he was while i slipped back and examined the earth to leeward of the thicket i had hardly crawled ten yards however before the gentle snapping of ﬁngers recalled to his side he behind that bush he whispered in my ear i looked the bush was hardly large enough to conceal setter dog and the sable is somewhat larger than our elk nevert heless insisted that the animal was standing behind it and that he had caught the toss of its head we lay still some time while the soft warm rain drizzled down on us our eyes riveted on the bush and then we the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https momentary ﬂash of curved horns the sable tossed his head it seemed incredible even then that the tiny bush should conceal so large beast matter of fact we later found that the bush grew on slight elevation behind which was depression in this the sable stood patiently enduring the drizzle we waited some time in hopes he would move forward foot or so but apparently he had selected his loaﬁng place with care and liked it the danger of shift of wind was always present finally i slipped back over the brink of the ravine moved three yards to the left and crawled up through the tall dripping grass to new position behind little bush cautiously raising my head i found i could see plainly the sable head and part of his shoulders my position was cramped and out of balance offhand shooting but i did my best and heard the loud plunk of the hit the sable made off at fast though rather awkward gallop wheeled an instant hundred yards farther on received another bullet in the shoulder and disappeared over the brow of the hill we raced over the top to get in another shot and found him stone dead he was ﬁne beast in coat with white markings on the face ears and horns sweeping up and back scimitar fashion he stood four feet and six inches at the shoulder and his horns were the second best ever shot in british east africa this beast has been described by heller new subspecies and named rooseveltii his description was based upon an immature buck and doe shot by kermit roosevelt the determination of subspecies on so slight evidence seems to unscientiﬁ c in the extreme while the immature males exhibit the general brown tone relied on by heller the mature buck differs in essential from the tropical sable i ﬁnd the alledged subspecies is not accepted by european scientists xi march along the coast with most comfortable feeling that my task was done that suddenly the threatening clouds of killing work had been cleared up i was now privileged to loaf and invite my soul on this tropical green hilltop while poor put in the days trying to ﬁnd another sable every morning he started out before daylight i could see the light of his lantern outside the tent and i stretched myself in the luxurious consciousness that i should hear deprecating but insistent hodie from my boy until i pleased to invite it in the afternoon or evening would return quite exhausted and dripping with only the report of new country traversed sable tracks of sable old signs even of sable gradually it was borne in on how lucky i was to have come upon my magniﬁcent specimen so promptly and in such favourable circumstances leisurely breakfast alone with the sun climbing then the writing of notes little reading and perhaps stroll to the village or along the top of the ridge at the heat of noon siesta with cool cocoanut at my elbow the view was beautiful on all sides our great tree full of birds the rising and dying winds in the palms like the gathering oncoming rush of the rains from mountain to mountain sounded the wild ululations of the natives conveying news or messages across the wide jungle towards sunset i wandered out in the groves enjoying the many bright ﬂowers the tall sweet grasses and the against the sky piles of cocoanuts lay on the ground covered each with leaf plaited in peculiarly individual manner to indicate ownership small boys like little black imps clung naked up the slim trunks of the palms watching above the under growth in all directions crossing and recrossing ran maze of beaten paths each led somewhere but it would require the memory of native to keep all their destinations in the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https used to follow some of them to their ending in little houses on the tops of knolls or beneath mangoes and would talk with the people they were very grave and very polite and seemed to be living out their lives quite correctly according to their conceptions again it was borne in on that these people are not stumbling along the course of evolution in our footsteps but have gone far in their path we have in ours that they have reached at least comp lete correspondence with their environment we with our own 4 if had not returned by the time i reach ed camp i would seat myself in my canvas chair and thence dispense justice advice or medical treatment if none of these things seemed demanded i smoked my pipe to one afternoon came old digniﬁed man with the heavy beard the noble features the high forehead and the blank statue eyes of the blind homer he was led by very small very naked boy at some twenty feet distance he squatted down before quite ﬁve minutes he sat there silent while i sat in my camp chair smoked and waited at last he spoke in rolling deep bass voice rich and delight to hear jambo greeting said he jambo i replied mildly again silence i had begun reading and had all but gotten his presence jambo bwana greeting master he rolled out jambo i repeated the same digniﬁed unhasting pause jambo bwana greeting great master jambo quoth i and went on reading the sun was dropping but the old man seemed in hurry jambo bwana sana greeting most mighty master he boomed at last jambo said this would seem to strike the superlative and i expected now that he would state his business but the old man had one more shot in his locker jambo bwana kabeesa sana greeting mightiest possible master it came then in due course he delicately hinted that gift of tobacco would not come amiss returned triﬂe earlier than usual to admit that his quest was hopeless that his physical forces were the time being at an end and that he was willing to go home accordingly very early next morning we set out by the glimmer of lantern hoping to get good start on our journey before the heat of the day became too severe we did gain something but performed several unnecessary loops and semicircles in the maze of beaten paths before we ﬁnally struck into one that led down the slope towards the sea shortly after the dawn came up like thunder in its swiftness followe d almost immediately by the sun our way now led along the wide ﬂat between the seashore and the shimba hills in which we had been hunting road ten feet wide and innocent of wheels ran with obstinate directness up and down the slight contours and through the bushes and cocoanut groves that lay in its path so mathematically straight was it that only when perspective closed it in or when it dropped over the summit of little rise did the eye lose the effect of its interminability the country through which this road led was various bushy veld with sparse trees dense jungle cocoanut groves tall and cool in the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https of the latter were the thatched native villages to the left always ran the blue shimba hills and far away to the right somewhere we heard the grumbling of the sea every hundred yards or so we met somebody even thus early the road was thronged by far the majority were the almost naked natives of the district pleasant people with good features they carrie d things these things varied from great loads balanced atop to dainty impromptu baskets woven of and containi ng each single cocoanut they smiled on us returned our greeting and stood completely aside to let us pass other wayfarers were of more importance small groups of bearded dignitaries either upper swahili or pure arabs strolled slowly along apparently with limitless leisure but evidently bound somewhere nevertheless they replied to our greetings with great dignity once also we overtook small detachment of sudanese troops moving they were scattered over several miles of road soldier most impressive and neat in khaki and red tarboosh and sash then two or three of his laughing sleek women clad in the thin patterned glittering with gold ornam ents then half dozen ragged porters carrying ofﬁcial but battered painted wooden kit boxes or bags or miscellaneous curious plunder then more troopers and so on miles they all drew aside us most respectfully and the soldiers saluted very smart and military under the mangoes near the villages we came upon many open markets in full swing each vendor squatted on his heels behind his wares while the purchasers or traders wandered here and there making offers the actual commerce compared with the amount of laughing joking shrieking joy of the occasion one to thousand generally three or four degenerate looking dirty east indians slunk about very crafty very insinuating very ready and skilful to take what advantages they could i felt strong desire to kick every one of them out from these joyful concourses of happy people generally we sat down while in these markets and talked to the people little and perhaps purchased some of the delicio us fruit they had small delicate variety of banana most wonderful the like of which i have seen nowhere else we bough t forty of these coin worth about eight cents besides fruit they offered cocoanuts in all forms grain woven baskets small articles of ﬁsh the latter were farther from the sea than they should have been these occasional halts greatly refreshed us more of that endless road all this time we were very hot the sun mounted the country fairly steamed from the end of my riﬂe barrel which i carried across my forearm steady trickle of water dripped into the road we neither of us had dry stitch on us and our light garments clung to us thoroughly wet through at ﬁrst we tried the military method and marched ﬁfty minutes to rest ten but soon discovered that minutes work to ﬁve minutes off was more practical the sheer weight of the sun was terriﬁc after we had been exposed to it any great length of across several wide open entered the steaming shade of the jungle with gratitude at the end of seven hours however we most unexpectedly came through dense cocoanut grove plum p on the banks of the harbour at kilindini here after making arrangements the transport of our safari when it should arrive we entrusted ourselves to small boy and cranky boat an hour later clad in tropical white with cool drinks at our elbows we sat in on the veranda of the mombasa club the clubhouse is built on low cliff at the water edge it looks across the blue waters of the bay to headland crowned with and beyond the headland to the indian ocean the cool trades sweep across that veranda we idly watched lone white oarsman pulling strongly against the wind through the tide rips evidently bent on exercise we speculated on the incredible folly of wanting exercise and forgot him an hour later huge saffron yellow squall rose from china the way ﬁlled the world with an unholy light lashed the reluctant sea to and swooped screamin g on the police boats to rescue the idiot oarsman much minor exciteme nt the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https to and fro we continued to sit in our lounging chairs one hand on our cool long drinks footnotes 4 fuller discussion see the land of footprints xii the fire we were very tired so we turned in early w unfortunately our rooms were immediately over the billiard room where bibulous and cosmopolitan lot were earnestly endeavouring to bolster up by further proof the ﬁction that white man can not retain his health in the tropics the process was pretty rackety and while it could not keep us awake it prevented us from falling thoroughly asleep at length and suddenly the props of noise fell away from and i sank into grateful profound abyss almost at once however i was dragged back to consciousness mohammed stood at my bedside bwana he proffered to my rather angry inquiry all the people have gone to the ﬁre it is very lar ge ﬁre i thought you would like to see it i glanced out of the window at the reddening sky thrust my feet into pair of slippers and went forth in my pyjamas to see what i could see we threaded our way through many narrow dark and deserted streets beneath balconies that overhung past walls over which nodded tufted palms until loud and increasing murmuring told us we were nearing the centre of disturbance shortly we came to the outskirts of the excited crowd and beyond them saw the red furnace glow semeelay semeelay warned mohammed authoritatively and the bystanders seeing white face gave passage all of picturesque mombasa was swahilis somalis savages whole lot they moved restlessly in the narrow streets they hung over the edges of balconies they peered from barred windows interested dark faces turned up everywhere in the ﬂickering light one woman ﬁne erect biblical ﬁgure stood silhouetted on ﬂat housetop and screamed steadily i thought she must have at least one baby in the ﬁre but it seems she was only excited the ﬁre was at present conﬁned to two buildings in which it was raging ﬁercely its spread however seemed certain and it was surrounded by warehouses of valuable goods moving was in full swing frantic white man stood at the low doorway of one of these stores hastening the movements of an unending string of porters each emer ged bearing case on his shoulder the white man urged him to trot i followed up the street to see where these valuables were being taken and what were the precautions against theft around the next corner it seemed each excited perspiring porter trotted up he heaved his burden from his head or his shoulders and promptly scampered back another load they were loyal and zealous men but their headpieces were deﬁcient inside the burdens that they saved from the ﬁre happened to be cases of gin in bottles at least it was in bottles until the process of saving had been completed then it trickled merrily down the gutter i went back and told the frantic white man about it he threw up both hands to heaven and the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https dodging from street to street mohammed and i succeeded in circling the whole disturbance and so came at length to public square here was vast throng and very good place so i climbed atop rescued bale of cotton the better to see mombasa has water system but wonderful corps of water these were in requisition to man they disappeared down through the wide gates of the customs enclosure their naked muscular bodies gleaming with sweat their standard oil cans dangling merrily at the ends of slender poles moment later they emerged the cans full of salt water from the bay the poles seeming fairly to butt into their bare shoulders they teetered along at their rapid swaying burdened gait the moment they entered the square they were seized upon from dozen different sides there was system at all every owner of property was out himself and intended to get much of the precious water he could the poor carriers were pulled about jerked violently here and there besough t commanded to bring their loads to one or the other of the threatened premises vocife rations accusations commands arose to screams one old graybeard occupied himself by standing on tiptoe and screeching maji maji maji at the top of his voice though that added anything to the visible supply the water of the moment disappeared in swirl of excited contestants he was attending strictly to business looking neither to right nor to left pushing forward steadily he could gasping mech anically his customary warning semeelay semeelay somehow eventually he and his comrades must have got somew here after an interval he returned with empty buckets then every blessed fool of property owner took whack at his bare should ers he passed shrieking hysterically haya haya pesi pesi and the like to men already doing their best it was grand sight in the meantime the ﬁre itself was roaring away the old graybeard suddenly ceased crying maji and darted forward to where i stood on the bale of cotton with great but somewhat ﬂurried respect he begged to descend i did so somewhat curious to what he might be up to the cotton was at least two hundred feet from the ﬁre immediately he began to tug and heave the bale was almost beyond his strength but after incredible exertions he lifted one side of it poised it moment got his shoulder under it and rolled it over once then he darted away and resumed his raucous cry water i climbed back again thrice more at intervals he repeated this performance the only result was to daub with mud every possible side of that bale i hope it was his property you must remember that i was observing the heavy artillery of the attack on the conﬂagration individual campaigns were everywhere in progress i saw one man standing on the roof of threatened building he lowered slowly hand over hand small at the end of string this was ﬁlled by friend in the street whereupon the man hauled it up again slowly hand over hand and solemnly dashed its contents into the mouth of the furnace thousands of other men on roofs in balconies on the street were doing the same thing some had ordinary cups which they ﬁlled block away the limit of efﬁciency was pail nobody did anything in concert with anybody else the sight of these thousands of little midgets each with his teacup or his teapot or his tin pail throwing each his mite of which he had to walk street or the ravening roaring furnace of ﬂame was pathetic or comical you please they did not seem to have show in the world nevertheless to my vast surprise the old system of the east triumphed at last the system of the east is that if you get enough labour you can accomplish anything little by little those thousands of tea kettles of water had their aggregate effect the ﬂames fed themselves out and died down leaving the contiguous buildings unharmed save little scorching in two hours all was safe and i returned to the hotel having enjoye d myself hugely i had however in the interest and excitement forgotten how deadly is the fever of mombasa midnight in pyjamas did the business and shortly i paid well the the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https t iii nairobi xiii up from the coast nairobi is situated at the far edge of the great athi plains and just below range of hills it might about well have been anywhere else and perhaps better few miles back in the higher country whether the funny little railroad exists nairobi or nairobi the railroad it would be difﬁcult to say between mombasa and this interior town certainly there is nothing absolutely nothing either in passengers or freight to justify building the line that distance is if i remember it correc tly about three hundred and twenty miles dozen or so names of stations appear on the map these are water tanks telegraph stations or small groups of tents in which dwell black the railroad the way climbs out from the tropical steaming coast belt to and across the high scrub desert and then through lower rounded hills to the plains on the desert is only dense thorn possibility that the newcomer if he looks very closely may to his excitement see his ﬁrst game in africa this is stray duiker or so tiny grass antelopes foot high also in this land is thirst so that alongside the locomotives they struggle up grade in bad seasons run natives to catch precious drops 5 an impalpable red dust sifts through and into everything when man descends at voi dinner he ﬁnds his travellers have changed complexion the pale clerk from indoor mombasa has put on ﬁne healthy sunburn and the company in general present rich bloom chance dab with white napkin comes away like fresh paint however you clamber back into the compartment with its latticed sun shades and its smoked glass windows you let down the narrow canvas bunk you unfold your rug and settle yourself repose it is difﬁcult matter everything you touch is gritty the air is close and stiﬂing like the ged air of tunnel if you try to open window you are suffocated with more of the red dust at last you fall into doze to awaken nearly frozen the train has climbed into what is after weeks of the tropics comparative cold and if you have not been warned to carry wraps you are in danger of pneumonia the gray dawn comes and shortly in the sudden tropical fashion the full light you look out on wide smiling grass country with dips and swales and brushy river bottoms and long slopes and hills thrusting up in masses from down below the horizon and singly here and there in the immensities nearer at hand the train winds and doubles on itself up the gentle slopes and across the imperceptibly rising plains but the interest is not in these wide prospects beautiful and smiling they may be but in the game it is everywhere far in the distance the herds twinkle half guessed in the shimmer of the bottom lands or dotting the sides of the hills nearer at hand it stares the train rumbles and sways laboriously past occasionally it even becomes necessary to whistle aside some impertinent kongoni that has placed himself between the metals the newcomer has but theoretical knowledge at best of all these animals and he is intensely interested in identifying the various species the hartebeeste and the wildebeeste he learns quickly enough and of course the zebra and the giraffe are unmistakable but the smaller gazelles are legitimate subjects discussion the wonder of the extraordinary abundance of these wild animals mounts the hours slip by at the stops water or orders the passengers gather from their different compartments to detail excitedly to each other what they have seen there is always an honest superenthusiast who believes he has the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https lions or leopards he is looked upon with envy by the credulous and with exasperation by all others so the little train puffs and tugs along suddenly it happens on barbed wire fence and immediately after enters the town of nairobi the game has persisted right up to that barbed wire fence the station platform is thronged with heterogeneous multitude of people the hands of dozen raggetty black boys are stretched out luggage the newcomer sees with delight savage with tin can in his stretched ear lobe another with set of wooden skewers set fanwise around the edge of the ear he catches glimpse of beautiful naked creature very proud very decorated with beads and heavy polished wire then he is ravished away by the friend or agent or hotel representative who has met him and hurried out through the gates between the impassive and digniﬁed sikh sentries to the cab i believe nobody but the newcomer ever rides in the cab and then but once from the station to the hotel after that he uses rickshaws in fact it is probable that the cab is maintained the sole purpose of giving the newcomer grand and impressive entrance this brief ﬂeeting quarter hour of glory is unique and passes it is like crossing the line or the ﬁrst kiss something that in its nature can not be repeated the cab was once noble vehicle compounded of opulent curves with very high driver box in front little bench and deep luxurious back seat reclining in which one received the adulation of the populace that was in its youth now in its age the varnish is gone the upholstery of the back seat frayed the upholstery of the small seat lacking utterly so that one sits on bare boards in place of two digniﬁedly spirited fat white horses it is drawn by two very small mules in detached position far ahead and how it rattles between the station and the hotel at nairobi is long straight wide street nearly mile long and bordered by double row of young eucalyptus these latter have changed the main street of nairobi from the sunbaked array of galvanized houses described by travellers of half dozen years back to thoroughfare of great charm the iron houses and stores are now in shaded background and the attention is freed to concentrate on the vivid colouring the incessant movement the great intere st of the people moving to and fro when i left nairobi the authorities were considering the removal of these trees because one row of them had been planted slightly within the legal limits of the street what they could interfere with in practically horsele ss town i can not imagine but i trust this stupidity gave way to second thought the cab rattles and careers up the length of the street scattering rickshaws and pedestrians from before its triumphant path to the left opens wide street of little booths under iron awnings hung with gay colour and glittering things the street is thronged from side to side with natives of all sorts it whirls past and shortly after the cab dashes inside fence and draws up before the low hotel footnotes 5 the government does much nowadays by means of tank cars xiv town of contrasts it has been i have said the fashion to speak of nairobi an ugly little town this was probably true when the ﬁrst corrugated iron houses huddled unrelieved near the the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https it is not true now the lower part of town is well planted and is always picturesque long its people are astir the white population have built in the wooded hills some charming bungalows surrounded by bright ﬂowers or lost amid the trunks of great trees from the heights on which is government house one can with glass watch the game herds feeding on the plains two clubs with the usual games of golf polo and cricket weekly hunt with jackals instead of foxes bungalow town club on the slope of hill an electric light system race track riﬂe range frilly parasols and the latest ﬂufﬁest summer toilettes from london and paris mention few of the reﬁnements of civilization that offer to the traveller some of the most piquant of contrasts it must not be forgotten that nairobi in spite of these to the direct but slender thread of communication by railroad and actually in the middle of an african black man town far numbers go 6 the game feeds to its very outskirts even wanders into the streets at night 7 lions may be heard roaring within mile or so of town and leopards occasionally at night come on the verandas of the outlying dwellings naked savages from the jungle untouched by civilization in even the minutest particular wander the streets unabashed it is this constantly recurring sharply drawn contrast that gives nairobi its piquant charm one sits on the broad hotel veranda constantly varied pageant passes before him daintily dressed englishwoman bobs by in smart rickshaw drawn by two uniformed runners kikuyu anointed curled naked brass adorned teeters along an expression of satisfaction on his face horseman well appointed trots briskly by followed by his loping syce string of women their heads fantastically shaved heavily ornamented lean forward under the burden of ﬁrewood the market beautiful baby in frilled perambulator is propelled by tall solemn black man in white robe and cap the driver of high cart tools his animal past creaking clumsy wagon drawn by pair of small humpbacked native oxen and so it goes all day long without end the public rickshaw boys just across the way chatter and game and quarrel and keep watchful eye out possible patron on whom to charge vociferously and full tilt two or three with white whiskers and red faces continue to slaughter thousands and thousands and thousands of lions from the depths of their easy chairs the stone veranda of that hotel is very interesting place here gather men from all parts of east africa from uganda and the jungles of the upper congo at one time or another all the famous hunters drop into its canvas allan black judd outram hoey and the others white traders with the natives of distant lands owners of farms experimenting bravely on greater or lesser scale in land whose difﬁc ulties are just beginning to be understood great naturalists and scientists from the governments of the earth eager to observe and collect this interesting and teeming fauna and sportsmen just out and full of interest or just returned and modestly important more absorbing conversation can be listened to on this veranda than in any other one place in the world the gathering is cosmopolitan it is representative of the most active of every social political and racial element it has done things it contemplates vital problems from the vantage ground of experience the talk veers from pole to returns always to lions every little while raw along and takes up stand just outside the railing he stands there mute and patient ﬁve half some one any one happens to notice him here commands this person the savage silently proffers bit of paper on which is written the name of the one with whom he has business nenda ofﬁcie indicates the charitable person waving his hand towards the hotel the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https and not until this permission has been given by some one dares the savage cross the threshold to his errand if the messenger happens to be traine d houseboy however dressed in his uniform of khaki or his more picturesque white robe and cap he is privileged to work out his own salvation and behind the hotel are rows and rows of other boys each waiting patiently the pleasure of his especial bwana lounging at ease after strenuous days at the drawling shout of boy one of them instantly departs to ﬁnd out which particular boy is wanted the moment any white man walks to the edge of the veranda of the rickshaws across the street career madly around the corners of the fence bumping colliding careening dangerously to drop beseechingly in serried confusion close around the step the rickshaw habit is very strong in nairobi if man wants to go hundred yards down the street he takes rickshaw that stupendous journey there is in justiﬁcation the legend that the white man should not exert himself in the tropics i fell into the custom of the country until i reﬂected that it would hardly be more fatal to to walk in the streets of nairob i than to march six or seven i often did on safari or in the hunting ﬁeld after that i got little exercise to the vast scandal of the rickshaw boys in fact so unusual was my performance that at ﬁrst i had fairly to clear myself way with my kiboko after few experiences they concluded particularly crazy person and let alone rickshaws however are very efﬁcient and very cheap the runners two in number are lithe little kavirondos generally their heads shaved to leave skull cap clad in scant ragged garments and wearing each an anklet of little bells their passion ornament they conﬁne to small bright things in their hair and ears they run easily with very long stride even steep hills they struggle up somehow zigzagging from one side of the road to the other edging along an inch or so at time in such places i should inﬁnitely have preferred to have walked but that would have lost caste everywhere there are limits even to crazy man idiosyncrasies that reason i never thoroughly enjoyed rickshaws save along the level ways with bells jingling and feet patpatting rapid time certainly i did not enjoy them going down the steep hills the boy between the shafts in front hits the landscape about every forty feet i not really object to sudden death but this form of it seemed unfair to some poor hungry lion however the winding smooth roads among the forested shaded bungalows of the upper part of town were very attractive especially towards evening at that time the universal or double terai could be laid aside straw hats cloth caps or bare heads people played the more violent games or strolled idly at the hotel there was now good deal of foolish drinking foolish becau in this climate it is very bad the human system and in these surroundings of much interest and excitement the relief of its exaltation from monotony or ennui or routine could hardly be required footnotes 6 fifteen hundred whites to twelve thousand natives approximately 7 this happened twice while i was in the country xv the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https class rather than individuals the population is easily the more interesting considered individuals the converse is true men like sir percy girouard hobley jackson lord delamere mcmillan cunninghame allan black leslie tarleton vanderweyer the hill cousins horne and dozen others are nowhere else to be met in so small community but the whites have developed nothing in their relations one to another essentially different the artisan and shopkeeping class dwell on the ﬂats the government people and those of military connections live on the heights on one side of the little stream the civil service and bigger business men among the hills on the other between them all is little jealousy and contempt and condescension just there is jealousy and contempt and condescension elsewhere they are pleasan t people and hospitable and some of them very distinguished in position or achieveme nt and i am glad to say i have good friends among them but the native is the joy and the never delight his beneﬁt is the wide glittering colourful insanitary bazaar with its dozens of little veranda shops its hotels where he can sit in real chair and drink real tea its cafes and the dark mysteries of its more doubtful amusements the bazaar is right in the middle of town just where it ought not to be and it is constantly being quarantined and threate ned with removal it houses large population mysteriously it is of slight extent then on the borders of town are the two great native belonging to the somalis and the other hospitably accommodating the swarms of caravan porters and their families just in old days mombasa and zanzibar used to be the points from which caravans into the interior would set forth now nairobi outﬁts the majority of expeditions probably ten thousand picked natives of various tribes are engaged in the profession of course but small proportion of this number is ever at home at any one time but the village is large one both these villages are built in the native style of plaster and thatch have their own headman are kept pretty well swept out and tidy besides these three main gathering places are many camps and shambas 8 scattered everywhere and the back country counts millions of raw jungle savages only too glad to drift in occasionally look at the metropolis at ﬁrst the newcomer is absolutely bewildered by the variety of these peoples but after little he learns to differentiate the somalis are perhaps the ﬁrst recognizable with their ﬁnely chiselled intelligent delicate brown features their slender forms and their strikingly picturesque costumes of turbans ﬂowing robes and embroidered sleeveless jackets then he learns to distinguish the savage from the sophisticated dweller of the town later comes the identiﬁcation of the numerous tribes the savage comes in just he has been ethnologists alone can guess how many thousands of years he is too old an institution to have been affected yet by this tiny spot of modernity in the middle of the wilderness consequence he startles the newcomer even more than the sight of giraf fes on the when the to town he gathers in two or three of his companions and presents himself follows his hair has been grown quite long then gathered in three tight pigtails wound with leather one of which hangs over his forehead and the other two over his ears the entire head he has then anointed with mixture of castor oil and bright red colouring earth this is wiped away evenly all around the face about two inches below the hair to leave broad bandlike glistening effect around the entire head the ears are most marvellous from early youth the lobes have been stretched until at last they have become like two long elastic loops hanging down upon the shoulder and capable of accommod ating anything up to and including tomato can when in fatigue uniform these loops are caught up over the tops of the ears but on dress parade they accommodate almost anything considered ornamental i have seen row of safety pins clasped in them or number of curtain rings or marmalade jar or the glittering cover of tobacco tin the edges of the ears all around to the top are then pierced then the insertion of row of long white wooden skewers gives one peculiarly porcupinish look or row of little brass danglers hints of wealth having thus ﬁnished off his head your savage clasps around his neck various strings of beads or collars the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https or copper wire polished to the point of glitter puts on armlets and leglets of the same ties on narrow bead belt in which is thrust short sword anoints himself all over with reddened castor oil until he glistens and shines in the sun rubs his legs with white clay and traces patterns therein seizes his spear and is ready the city oh i he probably came near doing strip of 9 this was originally white but constant wear over castor oil has turned it uniform and beautiful brown the purpose of this is ornament and it is so worn there has been an attempt i understand to force these innocent children to some sort of conventional decency while actually in the streets of nairobi it was too large an order some bring in clothes to be sure because the white man asks it but why sensible man could say they are hung from one shoulder ﬂap merrily in the breeze and are always quite frankly tucked up about the neck or under the arms when the wearer happens to be in haste matter of fact these savages are so beautifully and smoothly formed their or brown skin is so ﬁne in texture and their complete unconsciousness so genuine that in an hour the newcomer is quite accustomed to their nakedness these proud youths wander mincingly down the street with an expression of the most fatuous and satisfaction with themselves to their minds they have evidently done every last thing that human ingenuity or convention could encompass these young men are the dandies the proud young aristocracy of wealth and importance and of course they may differ individually or tribally from the sample i have offered also there are many other social grades those who care less dress or have less to get it with can rub along very cheaply the only real essentials are something the ear tomato can will b triﬂe that scrap of gunny sacking will be quite enough the women to be seen in the streets of nairobi are mostly of the kikuyu tribe they are pretty much of pattern their heads are shaven either completely or to leave only ornamental tufts and are generally bound with ﬁne wire ﬁllet so tightly that the strands seem to sink into the ﬂesh piece of cotton cloth dyed dark umber red is belted around the waist and sometimes but not always another is thrown about the shoulder they go in more hardware than the men the entire arms and the calves of the legs are encased in sort of armour made of quarter wire wound closely and collar of the same material stands out like ruff eight or ten inches around the neck this is wound on good and must be worn day and night and all the time cumbers ome and tremendously heavy burden dozen large loops of coloured beads strung through the ears and various strings and necklaces of beads cowrie shells and the like ﬁnish them out in all their gorgeousness they would sink like plummets their job in life besides lugging all this stuff about is to carry in ﬁrewood and forage at any time of the day long ﬁles of them can be seen bending forward under their burdens these they carry on their backs by means of strap across the tops of their heads after the fashion of the canadian tump line the next cut above the shenzi or wild man is the individual who has been on safari carrier or has otherwise been much employed around white men from this experience he has acquired articles of apparel and points of view he is given to ragged khaki or f garments of all sorts but never to shoes this hint of the conventi onal only serves to accent the little excursions he makes into barbarism the shirt is always worn outside the ear ornaments are varied ever the head is shaved in strange patterns tiny tight tuft on the crown is useful fastening feathers or little streamers or anything else that will wave or glitter one of these individuals wore red label he had with patience and difﬁculty removed from one of our trunks he had pasted it on his forehead and it read baggage room not wanted these people are after all but modiﬁed shenzis the modiﬁcation is nearly always in the direction of the comic now we step up to class that would resent being called shenzis it would resent an insult this is the personal servant class the members are of all tribes with possibly the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https preponderance of swahilis and somalis they are very clean ed respecting class with great deal of dignity and great deal of pride in their bwanas also they are exceedingly likely to degenerate unless ruled with ﬁrm hand and wise head very rarely are they dishonest respects the possessions of their own masters they understand their work perfectly and the best of them get the equivalent of from eight to ten dollars month every white individual has one or more of them even the tiny children with their ridiculous little sun helmets are followed everywhere by tall solemn black their powers of divination approach the uncanny about the time you begin to think of wanting something and are making ﬁrst helpless survey of boyless landscape your own servant suddenly mysteriously and unobtrusively appears from nowhere where he keeps himself where he feeds himself where he sleeps you not know these beautifully clean trim digniﬁed people are always pleasant feature in the varied picture the somalis are clan by themselves few of them condescend to domestic service but the most prefer the free life of traders horse dealers gunbearers camel drivers labour and similar guerrilla occupations they are handsome dashing proud treacherous courageous likeable untrustworthy they career around on their high stirruped saddles they saunter indolently in small groups they hang about the hotel hoping dicker of some kind there is nothing of the savage about them but much of the true barbarism with the barbarian pride treachery and love of colour footnotes 8 native farmlets generally temporary 9 white cotton cloth xvi recruiting to the traveller nairobi is most interesting the point from which expeditions start and to which they return doubtless an extended stay in the country would show him that problems of administration and possibilities of development could be even more absorbing but such things are very sketchy to him at ﬁrst usual thing when he wants porters he picks them out from the throng hanging around the big outﬁtters establishments each man is then given but of most satisfying tin water bottle short stout cord and navy blue jersey after that ceremony he is yours but on the occasion of one three month s journey into comparatively unknown country we ran up against difﬁculties some two weeks before our contemplated start two or three cases of bubonic plague had been discovered in the bazaar and consequence nairobi was quarantined this meant that rope had been stretched around the infected area that the shops had been closed and that native nairobi the latter provision af fected us under it we should be unable to get our bearers out matter of fact the whole farce natives conversed affably at arm length across the ropes hundreds sneaked in and out of town at will and from the rear of the infected area i personally saw beds chests household goods blankets and clothes passed to friends outside the ropes when this the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https was reported in my presence to the medical ofﬁcers they replied that this was matter police cognizance but the brave outward show of ropes disinfectants gorgeous ofﬁcial inspection went solemnly on great even in africa is the god of red tape our only possible plan in the circumstances was to recruit the men outside the town to camp them somewhere march them across country to way station and there embark them our goods and safari stores we could then ship out to them by train accordingly we rode on bicycles out to the swahili village this is i have said composed of large beehive houses thatched conically with straw the roofs extend to form verandas beneath which sit indolent damsels their hair divided in innumerable tiny parts running fore and aft like the stripes on water melon their ﬁgured garments draped gracefully beﬁtted the women of plutoc rats they wore much jewellery some of it set in their noses most of them did all of nothing but some sat half buried in narrow strips of tissue paper these they were pasting together like rolls of tape the coloured edges of the paper forming concentric patterns on the resultant inﬁnite labour the discs when completed were insertion in the lobes of the ears when we arrived the irregular streets of the village were nearly empty save few elegant youths in long kanzuas or robes of cinnamon colour and spotless white on their heads fezzes or turbans in their hands slender rattan canes they were very busy talking to each other and of course did not notice the idle beauties beneath the verandas hardly had we appeared however when mysteriously came forth the bearded solemn person with phenomenally ugly face but most pleasing smile we told him we wanted porters he clapped his hands to the four young men who answered this summons he gave command from sleepy indolence they sprang into life to the four cardinal points of the comp ass they darted away running up and down the side streets beating on the doors screaming at the tops of their lungs the word cazi 10 over and over again the village hummed like wasps nest men poured from the huts in swarms the streets were ﬁlled the idle sauntering youths were swamped and sunk from view clamour and shouting arose where before had been droning silence the mob beat up to where we stood surrounding us shouting at us from somewhere some one brought an old table and two decrepit chairs battered and rickety in themselves but symbols of great authority in community where nobody habitually used either two naked boys proudly took char ge of our bicycles we seated ourselves fall in we yelled about half the crowd fell into rough lines the rest drew slightly to one side nobody stopped talking single instant we arose and tackled our job the ﬁrst part of it was to segregate the applicants into their different tribes monumwezi hapa we yelled and the command was repeated and repeated again by the headman by his four personal assistants by lesser headmen slowly the monumwezi drew aside we impressed on them emphatically they must stay thus and went after in turn the baganda the wakamba the swahilis the kavirondo the kikuyu when we had them grouped we went over them individually we punched their chests we ran over all their joints we examin ed their feet we felt their muscles our victims stood rigidly at inspection but their numerous friends surrounded us closely urging the claims of the man to our notice it was rather confusing but we tried to go at it the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https were alone in wilderness if the man passed muster we motioned him to rapidly growing group when we had ﬁnished we had about sixty men segregated then we went over this picked lot again this time we tried not only to get good specimens but to mix our tribes at last our count of was made up and we took deep breath but to us came one of them complaining that he was monumwezi and that we had picked only three monumwezi cut him short his contention was quite correct porter tent holds ﬁve and it does not to mix tribes reor ganization cut out two extra kavirondos and include two more monumwezi bass ﬁnished now go get your effects we start immediately quickly it had ﬁlled the street cleared the rejected dived back into their huts the newly enlisted carriers went to collect their baggage only remained the headman and his assistants and the splendid youths idling up and of them had volunteered you may be the damsels of leisure beneath the porticos also one engaging and peculiar ﬁgure hovering near this individual had been particularly busy during our recruiting he had hustled the men into line he had advised us or against different candidates he had loudly sung my praises man to work although of course he knew nothing about now he approached saluted smiled he was tall person with phenomenally long thin legs slightly rounded shoulders forward thrust keen face and remarkably long slim hands with these he gesticulated much in fashion after the manner of egyptian hieroglyphical ﬁgures he was in manner shenzi he wore fez neat khaki coat and shorts blue puttees and boots also belt with leather pockets bunch of keys wrist watch and seal ring his air was of great elegance and social ease we took him with us gunbearer he proved staunch good tracker an excellent hunter and most engaging individual his name was kongoni and he was wakamba but now we were confronted with new problem that of getting our chosen ones together again they had totally disappeared in all directions we had emissaries beating up the laggards each man reappeared carrying his little bundle we lined him up with his companions then when we turned our backs we lost him again he had thought of another friend with whom to exchange farewells at the long last however we got them all collected the procession started the naked boys proudly wheeling our bikes alongside we saw them fairly clear of everything then turned them over to kongoni while we returned to nairobi to see after our ef fects footnotes 10 work par t iv lion hunt on kapiti xvii an ostrich f arm at machakos this has to with lion hunt on the kapiti plains on the veranda at nairobi i had some time previous met clifford hill who had invited to visit him at the ostrich farm he and his cousin were running in the mountains near machakos some time later visit the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https farm gave the opportunity juja is only day ride from the hills so an africander originally from the south captain and i sent across few carriers with our personal ef fects and ourselves rode over on horseback juja is on the athi plains between the athi and kapiti plains runs range of low mountains around the end of which one can make his way around promon tory the hills ostrich farm was on the highlands in the bay on the other side of the promontory it was towards the close of the rainy season and the rivers were up we had to swim our horses within of juja and got pretty wet shortly after crossing the athi however ﬁve miles on we emer ged on the dry drained slopes from the hills here the grass was long and the ticks plentiful our horses legs and chests were black with them and when we dismounted lunch we ourselves were almost immediately alive with the pests in this very high grass the game was rather scarce but after we had climbed by insensible grades to the shorter growth we began to see many hartebeeste zebra and gazelles and few of the wildebeeste or brindled gnus travel over these great plains and through these leisurely low hills is good deal like coastwise same apparently unattainable landmarks which nevertheless are at last passed and left astern by the same sure but insensible progress thus we drew up on apparently continuous hills found wide gaps between them crossed them and turned to the left along the other side of the promontory about ﬁve we came to the hills the ostrich farm is situated on the very top of conical rise that sticks up like an island close inshore to the semicircle of mountains in which end the vast plains of kapiti thus the hills have at their backs and sides these solid ramparts and face westward the immensities of space kapiti goes on over the edge of the world to unknown unguessed regions rolling and troubled like sea and from that unknown on very still days the snowy peak of kilimanjaro peers out sketched faintly against the sky soap bubble wafted upward and about to disappear here and there on the plains kopjes stand like islands their stone tops looking though thrust through the smooth prairie surface from beneath to them meandered long narrow ravines full of low brush like thin wavering streaks of gray on these of which had its in these ravines we were to hunt lions we began the ascent of the cone on which dwelt our hosts it was one of those hills that seem in part steep and yet which ﬁnally succeed in raising one to considerable height we passed two ostrich herds in charge of savages rode through scattered native village and so came to the farm itself situated on the very summit the house consisted of three large circular huts thatched neatly with papyrus stalks and with conical roofs these were arrange d triangle just touching each other and the space between had been roofed over to form veranda we were ushered into one of these circular rooms it was spacious and contained two beds two chairs dresser and table its earth ﬂoor was completely covered by the skins of animals in the corresponding room opposite slept our hosts while the third was the living and dining room long table bottomed chairs large sideboard bookcases long easy settee with pillows gun racks photographs in and out of frames table with writing materials and books and magazines to speak of again the skins of many animals completely covering the ﬂoor out behind in small separate buildings laboured the cook and dwelt the stores the and other such necessary af fairs soon we had consumed the usual grateful lime juice and sparklets we followed our hosts into the open air to look around on this high airy hill top the hills some day are going to build them real house in anticipation they have laid out grounds and have planted many things in examining these my california training stood by out there here one so often examines his own and his neighbours gardens not what they are but what they shall become his imagination can exalt this tiny seedling to the impressiveness of spreading noontime shade can magnify yonder apparent duplicate to the full symmetry of shrub the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https diminish the present importance of certain grand and lofty growths to its true status of ﬂower or animal so from dead uniformity of size he casts forward in the years to pleasing variation of shade of jungle of open glade of ﬂowered vista and he goes away full of expert admiration x bully garden with this solid training beneath i was able on this occasion to please immensely from the house site we descended the slope to where the ostriches and the cattle and the people were in the late sunlight swarming upward from the plains pastures below these people were to the chief extent wakamba quite savage but attracted here by the justness and fair dealing of the hills some of them farmed on shares with the hills the white men furnishing the land and seed and the black men the labour some of them laboured on wage some few herded cattle or ostriches some were hunters and took the ﬁeld only when now serious business was afoot they had their complete villages with priests witch doctors and all and they seemed both contented and fond of the two white men we walked about we learned much of the ostrich business and in the course of our ten days visit we came to better realization of how much there is to think of in what appears basically so simple proposition in the nesting time then the hills went out over the open country sometimes days at time armed with long telescopes with these fearsome and unwieldy instruments they surveyed the country inch by inch from the advantage of kopje when thus they discovered nest they descended and appropriated the eggs the latter hatched at home in an incubator formed the nucleus of ﬂock pass the raising of ostrich chicks to full size through the difﬁculties of disease wild beasts and sheer cussedness of the resultant thirty birds or so of the season catch but two or three will even promise good production these must be bred in captivity with other likely specimens thus after several years the industrious ostrich farmer may become possessed of few really prime birds to accumulate proper ﬂock of such in new country is matter of decade or so extra prime birds are well known and much in demand breeding any blood horse in racing country your true ostrich enthusiast like the hills possesses trunks full of feathers not good commerc ially but intensely interesting comparison and the purposes of prophecy while i stayed with them came rumour of very ﬁne plucking distant neighbour had just ﬁnished from likely the hills were manifestly uneasy until one of them had ridden the long distance to compare this newcomer product with that of their own and i shall never forget the reluctantly admiring shake of the head with which he acknowledged that it was indeed very ﬁne feather but getting the birds is by means all of ostrich farming many eager experimenters have discovered to their cost the birds must have certain sort of pasture land and their paddocks must be built on an earth that will not soil or break the edges of the new plumes and then there is the constant danger of wild beasts when man has spent years in gathering suitable ﬂocks he can not be blamed wild anger when happened while i was in the country lions kill sixty or seventy birds in night the ostrich seems to tempt lions greatly the beasts will make their way through and over the most complicated defences any ostrich farmer life is constant warfare against them thus the hills had slain lions in and near their tremendous record still the beasts continued to come in my hosts showed with considerable pride their arrangements ﬁnally evolved night protection the ostriches were conﬁned in series of heavy corrals segregating the birds of different ages around the outside of this group of enclosures ran wide ring corral in which were conﬁned the numerous cattle and an outer wall to this were built the huts of the wakamba village thus to penetrate to the ostriches the enterprising lion would have the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https both the people the cattle and the strong thorn and log structures that contained them this subject brings to another set of acquaintances we had already dogs these consisted of an airedale named ruby two setters called wayward and girlie heavy black mongrel nero ditto brindle ben and smaller black and white ditto ranger they were very nice friendly doggy dogs but they did not look like lion hunters nevertheless hill assured us that they were of great use in the sport and promised us that on the following day we should see just how xviii the first lioness at an early hour we loaded our bedding food tents and camp outﬁt on wagon drawn by four of the humpbacked native oxen and sent it away across the plains with instructions to make camp on certain kopje clifford hill and myself accompanied by our gunbearers and syces then rode leisurely down the length of shallow brushy cañon mile or so there we dismounted and sat down to await the arriv al of the others harold hill captain ﬁve or six wakamba spearmen our own carriers and the along more slowly beating the bottoms on the off chance of game the sun was just warming and the bees and insects were ﬁlling the air with their sleepy droning sounds the hillside opposite showed many little outcrops of rocks so like the hills of our own western states that it was somewhat difﬁcult to realize that we were in africa some reason the delay was long then suddenly all four of us simultaneously saw the same thing quarter away and on the hillside opposite magniﬁcent lioness came loping easily along through the grass she looked very small at that distance like toy and quite unhurried indeed every few moments she paused to look back in an annoyed fashion over her shoulder in the direction of the row behind her there was nothing to but sit tight and wait the lioness was headed exactly to cross our front nor except at one point was she at all likely to deviate shallow tributary ravine ran into our own about two hundred yards away she might possibly sneak down the bed of this it seemed unlikely the going was bad and in addition she had idea yet that she had been sighted indeed the chances were that she would come to deﬁnite stop before making the crossing in which case we would get shot and if she does go down the donga whispered hill the dogs will locate her sitting still while things approach is always exciting this is true of ducks but when you multiply ducks by lions it is still more true we all crouched very low in the grass she leapt without hesitation into the did not emer ge this was disappointment we conclud ed she must have entered the stream bottom and were just about to move when memba sasa snapped his ﬁngers his sharp eyes had discovered her sneaking along belly to the ground like the cat she was the explanation of this change in her gait was simple our companions had rounded the corner of the hill and were galloping in plain view away the lioness had caught sight of them she was gliding by dimly visible through thick brush seventy yards distant now i could make out tawny patch that faded while i looked now i could merely guess at melting shadow stir her up whispered hill never mind whether you hit she sneak away the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https the shot she leaped fully out into the open with snarl promptly i planted springﬁeld bullet in her ribs she answered slightly to the hit but did not shift position her head up her tail thrashing from side to side her ears laid back she stood there looking the landscape over carefully point by point she was searching us but yet could not locate us it was really magniﬁcent i attempted to throw in another cartridge but because of my desire to work the bolt quietly in order not to attract the lioness attention i did not pull it back far enough and the cartridge jammed in the magazine evidence of memba sasa coolness and efﬁciency it is to be written that he became aware of this soon i did he thrust across my right side at the same time withdrawing the springﬁeld on the left the motion was slight but the lioness caught it immediately she dropped her head and charged the next few moments naturally i was pretty intent on lions nevertheless corner of my mind was aware of memba sasa methodically picking away at the jammed riﬂe and paying attention whatever to the beast also i heard hill making picturesque remarks about his gunbearer who had bolted with his second gun the lioness charged very fast but very straight about in the tearing scrambling manner of terrier after thrown ball i got in the ﬁrst shot she came the bullet ranging back from the shoulder and hill followed it immediately with another from jeffrey she growled at the bullets and checked very slightly they hit but gave other sign then our second shots hit her both together the mere shock stopped her short but recovering instantly she sprang forward again hill third shot came next and perceptibly slowed and staggered but did not stop her by this time she was quite close and my own third shot reached her brain she rolled over dead decidedly she was game beast and stood more hammering than any other lion i killed or saw killed before the ﬁnal shot in the brain she had taken one light bulle t and ﬁve heavy ones with hardly wince memba sasa uttered loud grunt of satisfact ion when she went down good he had the springﬁeld reloaded and cocked right at my elbow hill gunboy hovered uncertainly some distance in the rear the sight of the charging lioness had been too much him and he had bolted he was not actually up tree but he stood very near one he lost the gun and acquired swift kick our friends and the men now came up the dogs made great row over the dead lioness she was measured and skinned to accompaniment of the usual chantings we had with us small boy of ten or twelve years whose job it was to take care of the dogs and to remove ticks in fact he was known the tick toto this was his ﬁrst expedition aﬁeld his father took especial pains to smear him with fat from the lioness this was to make him brave i am bound to confess the ef fect was not immediate xix the dogs i soon discovered that we were hunting lions with the assistance of the dogs not that the dogs were hunting lions they had not lost any lions not they my mental pictures of the snarling magniﬁcent king of beasts surrounded by an equally snarling magniﬁ cent pack vanished into thin air our system was to cover much likely country we could and to let the dogs have good time i have before indicated they were thoroughly doggy dogs and interested in lions none of the in their composition they ranged far and wide through all sorts of cover seeking what the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https ﬁnd in the way of porcupines mongoose hares birds cats and whatever else should interest any dog if there happened to be any lions in the path of these rangings the dogs retired rapidly discreetly and with every symptom of horriﬁed disgust if dog came sailing out of thicket agitatedly and took up his position tail between his legs behind his master we knew there was probably lion about thus we hunted lions with dogs but in order to be fair to these most excellent canines it should be recorded that they recovered certain proportion of their nerve after riﬂe had been ﬁred they then returned warily to this trait showed touching faith and was real compliment to the marksmanship of their masters some day it will be misplaced little cautious scouting on their part located the wounded beast whereupon at respectful distance they lifted their voices large element of danger in case of wounded lion is the uncertainty to his whereabouts it will be seen that the dogs were very valuable indeed they seemed to know exactly how badly hit any animal might happen to be and to gauge their distanc accordingly until at last when the quarry was hammered to harmlessness they closed in and began to worry the nearly lifeless carcass by this policy the dogs had lot of fun hunting on their own hook preserved their lives from otherwise inevitable extinction and were of great assistance in saving their masters skins one member of the pack perhaps two were however rather pathetic ﬁgures i refer to the setters wayward and girlie ranger ruby ben and nero scampered merrily over the landscape after anything that stirred from ﬁeld mice to serval cats all was game to their catholic tastes and you may be sure in country like africa they had few dull moments but wayward and girlie had been brought up in more exclusive manner their early instincts had been supplemented by rigorous early training gam to them meant birds and birds only furthermore they had been solemnly assured by human persons in whom they had the utmost conﬁdence that but one sequence of events was permissible or even thinkable in the presence of game the dog at ﬁrst intim ation by scent must convey the fact to the man must proceed cautiously to locate exactly must then stiffen to point which he must hold staunchly matter how distracting events might turn out or how long an interval might elapse the man must next walk up the birds shoot at them perhaps kill one then command the dog to retrieve the dog must on account move from his tracks until such command is given all the affair is perfectly simple but quite inﬂexible any variation in this procedure ﬁlls the honest bird dog mind with the same horror and dismay experienced by young man who discovers that he has on shoes of the wrong colour it is done you know consider then wayward and girlie in country full of game birds they quarter wide to right then cross to left their heads high their feather tails waving in the most approved good form when they ﬁnd birds they draw to their points in the best possible style stiffen wait it is now according to all good ethics up to the man and the man and his companions go right on by paying absolutely attention either to the situation or one own magniﬁcent piece of work what is one to conclude that our early training is all wrong that we are at one experience to turn apostate to the settled and only correct order of things or that our masters are gentlemen that is pretty difﬁcult thing an impossible thing to conclude of one own master but it leaves one in fearful state mentally and one has idea of what to wayward was perfect gentleman and he played the game according to the very best traditions he conscientiously pointed every bird he could get his nose on furthermore he was absolutely staunch and held his point even when the four dogs rushed in ahead of him the expression of puzzlement grief shock and sadness in his eyes deepened bird after bird soared away without shot girlie was more she pointed her birds and backed wayward at need but when the other dogs rushed her point she rushed too and when we swept on by her leaving her on point instead of holding it quixotically did wayward until the bird sneaked away she merely waited until we were out of sight and then tried to catch it finally captain remarked the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https or lions he was not going to stand it any longer he got out shotgun and all one afternoon killed grouse over wayward to the latter intense relief his ideals had been rehabilitated xx bondoni we followed many depressions in whic h might be lions until about three in the afternoon then we climbed the long slope that culminated far above the plains in the peak of hill called bondoni from distance it was steep and well deﬁned but like most of these larger kopjes its actual ascent up to the last few hundred feet was so gradual that we hardly knew we were climbing at the summit we found our men and the bullock cart there also stood an oblong blockhouse of stone the walls two feet thick and ten feet high it was entered only by blind angle passage and was strong enough apparently to resist small artillery this structure was simply an ostrich corral and bitter experience had shown the massive construction absolutely necessary adequate protection in this exposed and solitary spot against the lions we had some tea and bread and butter and then clifford hill and i set out afoot after meat only occasionally these settlers get chance hunting on the plains so near them and now they had promised their native retainers that they would send back treat of game to carry this promised luxury number of the villagers had accompanied the bullock wagon we were to move on next day it became very desirable to get the meat promptly while still near home we slipped over to the other side and by good fortune caught sight of dozen zebras feeding in scrub down the hill they were out of their proper environment up there but we were glad of it down on our tummies then we dropped and crawled slowly forward through the high sweet grasses we were in the late afternoon shadow of the hill and we enjoyed the mild skill of the stalk taking advantage of every cover slipping over into little ravines lying very ﬂat when one of the beasts raised his head we edged nearer and nearer we were already well within range but it amused us to play the game finally at one hundred yards we came to halt the zebra showed very handsome at that range even their smaller leg stripes were all plainly visible of course at that distance there could be small chance of missing and we owned one each the wakamba who had been watching eagerly swarmed down shouting we dined just at sunset under small tree at the very top of the peak long bars of light shot through the western clouds the plain turned from solid earth to mysterious sea of shifting twilights the buttes stood up wrapped in veils of soft desert colours kilimanjaro hung suspended like bubble above the abyss beyond the world xxi riding the plains from the mere point of view of lions lion hunting was very slow work indeed it meant riding the whole of long days from dawn until dark investigating miles of country that looked all alike and in which we seemed to get nowhere one by one the long billows of plain fell behind until our camp hill had turned blue behind us and we seemed to be out in illimitable space with possibility in an ordinary lifetime of ever the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https touch with anything again what from above had looked level ﬂoor now turned into tremendously wide and placid ground swell consequence we were always going imperceptibly up and up and up to or tipping gently down the other side of the wave from crest to crest of these long billows measured two or three miles the vertical distance in elevation from trough to top was perhaps not over ﬁfty to one hundred feet slowly we rode along the shallow grass and brush ravines in the troughs of the low billows while the dogs worked eagerly in and out of cover and our handful of savages cast stones and shouted occasionally we divided forces and beat the length of hill two of us lying in wait at one end the possible lion the rest sweeping the sides and summits many animals came bounding along but lions then harold hill unlimbering huge telescope would lie ﬂat on his back and sight the fearsome instrument over his crossed feet in general view of the plains miles around while he was at it we were privileged to look about us less under the burden of responsibility we could make out the game little dots and speckles thousands upon thousands of them thicker than cattle ever grazed on the open range and far the eye could make them out and then glance through our glasses picked them up again mile after mile even the could go farther the imagination was left the vision of more leagues of wild animals even to the azure beyond i had seen abundant game elsewhere in africa but nothing like the multitudes inhabiting the kapiti plains at that time of year in other seasons this locality is comparatively deserted the glass revealing nothing in our line we rode again to the lower levels and again took up our slow painstaking search but although three days went by in this manner without our getting glimpse of lions they were far from being days lost minor adventure ﬁlled our hours what elsewhere would be of major interest and strange and interesting experience met us at every turn the game while abundant was very shy this had nothing to with distrust of hunters but merely with the fact that it was the season of green grass we liked to come upon animals unexpectedly to see them and cavort otherwise we rode in moving space cleared of animals the beasts unobtrusively giving way before us and unobtrusively closing in behind the sun ﬂashed on the spears of savages travelling single ﬁle across the distance often we stopped short to gaze upon wild and tumbled horizon of storm that gustave doré might have drawn the dogs were always joyously routin g out some beast desirable from their point of view and chasing it hopelessly about to our great amusement once they ran into giant the size setter would be with shorter did not understand running away they came upon it in dense thicket and the ensuing row was unholy they managed to kill the porcupine among them after which we plucked barbed quills from some very grieved dogs the quills were large enough to make excellent penholders the dogs also swore by all canine gods that they would thing to hyena if only they could get hold of one they never got hold of one the hyena is coward his skull and teeth however are big and powerful those of lioness so i not know which was luckier in his avoidance of or the dogs nor from the shooting standpoint did we lack sport we had to shoot our men and we occasionally needed meat ourselves it was always interesting when such necessities arose to stalk the shy buck and riﬂe practice this shooting however was done only after the day hunt was over we had desire to spoil our lion chances the long circle towards our evening camp always proved very long indeed we arrived at dusk to ﬁnd supper ready us we were old campaigners we ate this off chop boxes tables and sat on the ground it was served by wakamba youth we had nicknamed herbert spencer on account of his gigantic intellect herbert meant well but about all he succeeded in accomplishing was pathetically wrinkled brow of care and scared eyes the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https never been harshly treated by any of us but he acted though always ready to bolt if there were twenty easy right methods of doing thing and one difﬁcult wrong method herbert would get the latter every time amount of experience could teach him the logic of our simplest ways one evening he brought tumbler of mixed water and condensed milk harold hill glanced into the receptacle stir it he commanded brieﬂy herbert spencer obeyed we talked about something else some ﬁve or ten minutes later one of us noticed that herbert was still stirring and called attention to the fact when the latter saw our eyes were on him he speeded up until the spoon fairly rattled in the tumbler then when he thought our attention had relaxed again he relaxed also his spoon travelled slower and slower in its dreamy circle we amused ourselves some time thus then we became so weak from laughter that we fell backward off our seats and some one gasped command that herbert cease i am afraid after little that we rather enjoyed mildly tormenting poor herbert spencer he tried so hard and looked so scared and was so unbelievably stupid almost always he had to pick his orders word by word from vast amount of unnecessary english herbert spencer the command would run if you would condescend to bend your mighty intellect to the lowly subject of maji and will snatch time from your profound cerebrations to assure its being moto sans i would esteem it inﬁnite condescension on your part to let pesi pesi and herbert listening to all this with painful strained intensity would catch the key words and would falter forth trembling bwana somewhere down deep within herbert spencer make up however was sense of moral duty when we ﬁnally broke camp good on the great hill of lucania herbert spencer relieved from his job bolted like shot far we could see him he was running at top speed if he had not possessed sense of duty he would have done this long ago we camped always well up on some of the numerous hills although anxiou s enough to ﬁnd lions in the daytime we had use them at all by night this usually meant that the boys had to carry water some distance we kept canvas full the beneﬁt of the dogs from which they could drink at any time this necessary privilege after hard day nearly drove captain crazy it happened like this we were riding along the slope of hillside when in the ravine half mile away and below us we saw something dark pop up in sight and then down again we shouted to some of the savage wakamba to go and investigate they closed in from all sides their long spears poised to strike at the last moment out darted not an animal but badly frightened old man armed with bow and arrow he dashed out under the upraised spears clasped one of the men around the knees and implored protection our savages their spears ready glanced over their shoulders instruction they would have liked nothing better than to have spitted the poor old fellow we galloped down fast possible to the rescue with reluctance our spearm en drew back releasing their prize we picked up his scattered bows and arrows restored them to him and uttered many reassurances he was so badly frightened that he could not stand the trembling of his knees undoubtedly he thought that war had broken out and that he was the ﬁrst of its unconscious victims after calming him down we told him what we were doing and offered to shoot him meat if he cared to accompany us he accepted the offer with joy so pleased and relieved was he that he skipped about like young and nimble goat his hunting companion who all this time had stood atop of hill at safe distance viewed these performances with concern our captive shouted loudly him to come join us and share in the good fortune not he he knew trap when he saw one the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https bit disturbed by the tales this man would probably carry back home our old fellow attached himself to us three days near sundown to make our promise good and also to give our own men feast i shot two hartebeeste near camp the evening was beautiful the macha kos range miles distant across the valley was mantled with thick soft clouds from our elevation we could see over them and catch the glow of moonlight on their upper surfaces we were very tired so we turned in early and settled ourselves good rest outside our tent the little injun ﬁre we had built our own comfort died down to coals short distance away however was huge bonﬁre around which all the savages were gathered they squatted comfortably on their heels roasting meat behind each man was planted his glittering spear the old man held the place of honour beﬁtted his ﬂirtation with death that morning everybody was absolutely happy good ﬁre plenty of meat and strangers with whom to have grand shauri the clatter of tongues was babel almost every one talked at once and excitedly those who did not talk crooned weird improvised chants in which they detailed the doings of the camp we fell very quickly into the half doze of too great exhaustion it never became more than half doze i suppose every one who reads this has had at some time the experience of dropping asleep to the accompaniment of some noise that ought soon to conversation in the next room singing the barking of dog the playing of music or the like the fact that it ought soon to cease permits the falling asleep when after an interval the subconsciousness ﬁnds the row still going on inexcusable and unabated it arouses the victim to staring exasperatio that was our case here those natives should have turned in sleep after reasonab le amount of they did nothing of the kind on the contrary i dragged reluctantly back to consciousness and the realization that they had quite happily settled down to make night of it i glanced across the little tent to where captain lay on his cot he was staring straight upward his eyes wide open after few seconds he slipped out softly and silently our little ﬁre had sunk to embers dozen sticks radiated from the centre of coals each made ﬁrebrand with one end cool to the grasp captain hurled one of these at the devoted and unconscious group it whirled through the air and fell plunk in the other ﬁre scattering sparks and coals in all directions the second was under way before the ﬁrst had landed it hit native with similar results plus astonished and grieved language the rest followed in every one hit its mark fair and square the air was full of sparks exploding in all directions the brush was full of wakamba their blankets ﬂapping in the breeze of their going the convention was adjourned there fell the sucking vacuum of great silence captain breathing righteous wrath ﬂopped heavily and determinedly down on his cot i caught faint snicker from the tent next door captain sighed deeply turned over and prepared to sleep then one of the dogs uprose think it was himself yawned approached deliberately and began to drink from the canvas just outside he lap lap very long time it seemed incredible that any mere canvas hold so much water the steady repetition of this sound long after it should logically have ceased was worse than the shenzi gathering around the ﬁre each lap should have been the last but it was not the shenzi convention had been abated with ﬁrebrands but the dog was strictly within his rights the poor pups had had long day with little water and they could hardly be blamed feeling bit feverish now at last ben ceased next morning captain claimed vehemently that he had drunk two hours minutes and ten seconds with contented sigh ben lay down then ruby got up shook herself and yawned bright idea struck her she too went over and had drink after that i personally went to sleep but in the morning i found captain and strung nearly to madness trying feverishly to calculate how seven dogs drinking on an average of three hours apiece could have ﬁnished by morning when harold hill the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https if he had slept well the captain threw the remaining but now extinct ﬁrebrand at him one of the safari boys big baganda had twisted his foot little and it had swelled up considerably in the morning he came to have it attended to the obvious treatment was very hot water and rest but it would never to tell him so the recommendation of so simple remedy would lose his faith so i gave him little dab of tick ointment wrapped in leaf this said i is most wonderful medicine but it is also most dangerous if you were to rub it on your foot or your hand or any part of you that part would drop off but if you wash the part in very hot water continuously half hour and then put on the medicine it is good and will cure you very soon i am sure i not know what they put in tick ointment nor the purpose did it greatly matter that night also herbert spencer reached the climax of his absurdities the chops he had cooked did not quite sufﬁce our hunger so we instructed him to give us some of the leg by this we meant steak of course herbert spencer was gone so long time that ﬁnally we went to see what possibly could be the matter we found him trying desperately to cook the whole leg in xxii the second lioness now our luck changed most abruptly we had been riding since early morning over the wide plains by and by we came to wide shallow course carpeted with lava boulders and scant scattered brush two of us took one side of it and two the other at this we were just within hailing distance the boys wandered down the middle game was here very abundant and in this broken country proved quite approachable i saw one grant gazelle head in especial that greatly tempted but we were hunting lions and other shooting was out of place also the prospects lions had brightened we were continually seeing hyenas in packs of from three to six they lay among the stones but galloped away at our approach the game paid not the slightest attention to these huge skulking brutes one passe d within twenty feet of hartebeeste the latter hardly glanced at him the hyena is lazy well cowardly and almost never does his killing we inferred good meat supply to gather so many of them in one place from tributary ravine we ﬂushed nineteen harold hill was riding with on the right bank his quick eye caught glimpse of something beyond our companions on the left side glance through the glasses showed that it was lion just disappearing over the hill at once we turned our horses to cross it was heavy job we were naturally in tremendous hurry and the footing among those boulders and rounded rocks was so vile that very slow trot was the best we could accomplish and that was only by standing in our stirrups and holding up our horses heads by main strength we reached the in time to see herd of game stampeding away from depression away we ﬁxed our eyes on that point and moment later saw the lion or lioness it turned out leap gully and come out the other side the footing down this slope too was appalling consisting mainly of chunks of lava interspersed with smooth rounded stones and sparse tufts of grass in spite of the stones we managed sort of stumbling gallop why we did not all go down in heap i not know at any rate we had chance to watch our quarry we were forced to keep our eyes strictly to our way when ﬁnally we emer ged from that tumble of rocks she had the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https she had galloped out over the plains or she had doubled back to take cover in the ravine in the latter case she would stand our ﬁrst job therefore was to determine whether she had escaped over the open country to this end we galloped our horses madly in four different directions pushing them to the utmost swooping here and there in wide circles that was an exhilarating ten minutes until we had surmounted every billow of the plain spied in all directio ns and assured ourselves beyond doubt that she had not run off the horses fairly ﬂew spurning the hard sod leaping the rock dikes skipping nimbly around the pig holes turning like under pressure of knee and rein finally we drew up conver ged and together jogged our sweating horses back to the ravine there we learned from the boys that nothing more had been seen of our quarry we dismounted handed our mounts to their syces and prepared to make afoot clean sweep of the wide shallow ravine here was where the dogs came in handy we left rearguard of two men and slowly began our beat the ravine could hardly be called ravine rather shallow depression with banks not over foot high and with varying width of from two to two hundred feet the grass grew very patchy and not very high in fact it seemed hardly tall enough to conceal anything large lioness we men walked along the edge of this depressi on while the dogs ranged back and forth in its bottom we had gone thus quarter when one of the rear guard came running up bwana said he we have seen the lioness she is lying in patch of grass after you had passed we saw her raise her head it seemed impossible that she should have escaped both our eyes and the dogs noses but we returned the man pointed out thin growth of dried yellow grass ten feet in diameter then it seemed even more incredible apparently we could look right through every foot of it the man persisted so we advanced in battle array at thirty yards captain saw the black tips of her ears we all looked hard and at last made her out lying very ﬂat her head between her paws even then she was shadowy and unreal and i have said the cover did not look thick enough to conceal dog though she realized she had been sighted she at this moment leapt to her feet instantly i put bullet into her shoulder any other lion i ever saw or heard of would in such circumstances and at such distance immediately have charged home she turned tail and ran away i missed her she ran then knocked her down with third shot she got up again but was immediately hit by captain magnum and brought to halt the dogs seeing her turn tail and heari ng our shots had scrambled madly after her we dared not shoot again fear of hitting one of them so we dashed rapidly into the grass and out the other side before we could get to her she had sent ruby ﬂying through the air and had then fallen over dead ruby got off lucky with only deep gash the length of her leg this was the only instance i experienced of wounded lion showing the white feather she was however only about grown and was suf fering from diarrhoea xxiii the big lion the boys skinned her while we ate lunch then we started several of them back towards camp with the trophy and ourselves cut across country to small river know n the stony athi there we dismounted from our horses and sent them and the boys atop the ridge above the stream while we ourselves explored afoot the hillside along the river the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https was totally different sort of country from that to which we had been accustomed imagine very bouldery hillside planted thickly with brambles and more sparsely with higher bushes they were not really brambles of course but their tripping tangling spiky qualities were the same we had to force our way through these or step from boulder to boulder only very rarely did we get little rubbly clear space to walk in and then only ten or twenty feet we tried in spaced intervals to cover the whole hillside it was very hard work the boys with the horses kept pace with us on the line atop and two or three hundred yards away we had proceeded in this fashion about mile when suddenly and most unexpectedly the biggest lion i ever saw leapt straight up from bush ve yards in front of and with tremendous roar vanished behind another bush i had just time to throw up and let drive snapshot clifford hill who was ten yards to my right saw the fur ﬂy and we all heard the snarl the bullet hit naturally we expected an instant charge but things turned out it was evident the lion had not seen us at all he had leapt at the sight of our men and horses on the and when the bullet hit he must have ascribed it to them at any rate he began to circle through the tangled vines in their direction from their elevation they could follow his movements at once they set up howls of terror and appeals help some began frantically to run back and forth none of them tried to run away there was nowhere to go the only thing that saved them was the thick and spiky character of the cover the lion instead of charging straight and fast was picking an easy way we tore directly up hill fast we were able leaping from rock to rock and thrusting recklessly through the tangle about up i jumped to the top of high conical rock and thence by good luck caught sight of the lion great yellow head advancing steadily about eighty yards away i took good sight i could and pulled trigger the recoil knocked clear off the boulder but i fell i saw his tail go up and knew that i had hit at once clifford hill and i jumped up on the rock again but the lion had moved out of sight by this time however the sound of the shots and the smell of blood had caused the dogs to close in they did not of course attempt to attack the lion nor even to get very near him but their snarling and barking showed us the beast whereabouts even this much is bad judgment on their part number of them have been killed at it the thicket burst into an unholy row we all manoeuvred rapidly position again luck was with again i saw his great head the mane standing out all around it and the second time i plante d heavy bullet square in his chest this stopped his advance he lay down his head was up and his eyes glared he uttered the most reverberating and magniﬁcent roars and growls the dogs leapt and barked around him we came quite close and i planted my fourth bullet in his shoulder even this was not enough it took ﬁfth in the same place to ﬁnish him and he died at last biting great chunks of earth the howls from the hill top ceased all gathered to marvel at the lion immense size he measured three feet nine inches at the shoulder and nine feet eleven inches between stakes or ten feet eleven inches along contour this is only ﬁve inches under record we weighed him piecemeal after fashion and put him between 550 and 600 pounds but these are only statistics and mean little unless real attempt is made to visualize them matter of fact his mere of little unless accented by the impression of his tremendous power and quickness we skinned him and then rode four long hours to camp we arrived at dark and at once set to work preparing the trophy dozen of us squatted around the skin working by lantern light memba sasa had had nothing to eat since before dawn but in his pride and delight he refused to touch mouthful until the job was ﬁnished several times we urged him to stop long enough even bite he steadily declined and whetted his knife his eyes gleaming with delight his lips crooning one of his weird monumwezi songs the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https the task was done then i presented memba sasa with tall mug of coffee and lots of sugar he considered this great honour xxiv the fifteen lions two days before captain and i were to return to juja we approached about eleven in the morning long low rugged range of hills called lucania they were not very high but bold with cliffs buttes and broken rocky stretches here we were to make our ﬁnal hunt we led our safari up to the level of boulder ﬂat between two deep cañons that ran down from the hills here should be water so we gathered under lone little tree and set about directing the simple disposition of our camp herbert spencer brought us cold lunch and we sat down to rest and refreshment before tackling the range hardly had we taken the ﬁrst mouthfuls however when memba sasa gasping breath came tearing up the slope from the cañon where he had descended drink lions he cried guardedly i went to drink and i saw four lions two were lying under the shade but two others were playing like puppies one on its back while he was speaking lioness wandered out from the cañon and up the oppos ite slope she was somewhere between six and nine hundred yards away and looked very tiny but the binoculars brought us up to her with jump through them she proved to be good one she was not at all hurried but paused from time to time to yawn and look about her after short interval another also lioness followed in her footsteps she too had climbed clear when third probably but still immature lion came out and after him the fourth you were right we told memba sasa there are your four but while we watched ﬁfth again at the spaced interval this time maned lion clambered leisurely up in the wake of his family and after him another and another and yet another we gasped and sat down the better to steady our glasses with our knees there seemed end to lions they came out of that apparently inexhaustible cañon bed one at time and at the same regular intervals perhaps twenty yards or so apart it was almost though they were being released singly finally we had ﬁfteen in sight it was most magniﬁcent spectacle and we could enjoy it unhurried by the feeling that we were losing opportunities at that range it would be silly to open ﬁre if we had descended to the cañon in order to follow them out the other side they would merely have trotted away our only chance was to wait until they had disappeared from sight and then to attempt wide circle in order to catch them from the ﬂank in the meantime we had merely to sit still therefore we stared through our glasses and enjoyed to the full this most unusual sight there were four cubs about big setter dogs four but immature youngsters four lionesses and three male lions they kept their spaced single ﬁle formation the ascent of the the nature of the ground forced them to then gradually drew together near the top but still below the summit they entered jumble of boulders and stopped we could make out several of them lying down one ﬁne old yellow fellow stretched himself comfortably atop ﬂat rock in the position of bronze lion on pedestal we waited twenty minutes to make sure they were not going to move then leaving all our men except the gunbearers under the tree we slipped back until out of sight and began to execute our ﬂank movement the chances seemed good the jumble of boulders was surrounded by open country and it the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https the lions could leave it without being seen we had arranged with our men system of signals two hours we walked very hard in order to circle out of sight down wind and to gain the other side of the ridge back of the lions we purposed slipping over the ridge and attacking from above even this was but slight advantage the job was stiff one we might expect certainly the majority to char ge therefore when we ﬁnally deployed in skirmish order and bore down on that patch of brush and boulders we were braced the shock of battle we found nothing our men however signalled that the lions had not left cover after little search however we discovered very shallow depression running slantwise up the hill and back of the cover so slight it was that even the glasses had failed to show it from below the lions had in all probability known about us from the start and were all the time engaged in withdrawing after their leisurely fashion of course we hunted them in fact we spent two days at it but we never found trace of them again the country was too hard tracking they had left lucania probably by the time we had completed our two hours of ﬂanking movement they were ﬁve miles away the presence of cubs would account this in ordinary circumstances we should have had wonderful and exciting ﬁght but the sight of those ﬁfteen great beasts was one i shall never get after we had hunted lucania thoroughly we parted company with the hills and returned to juja farm par t the tsavo river xxv voi part way up the railroad from the coast is station called voi on his way to the interior the traveller stops there an evening meal it is served in high wide stone room by swahilis under command of very efﬁcient and quiet east indian the voyager steps out into the darkness to look across the way upon the outlines of two great rounded hills against an amethyst sky that is all he ever sees of voi on the down trip he passes through it about two in the morning at that particularly trying hour and i descended and attempted by the light of lanterns to sort out twenty safari boys strange to us and miscellaneous camp stores we did not entirely succeed three men were carried on down the line and the ﬂy to our tent was never seen again the train disappeared our boys shiveri ng crept into corners we took possession of the maintained by the railroad just such travellers ourselves it was simply high stone room with three iron beds and corner so cemented that one could pour pails of water over one self without wetting the whole place the beds were supplied with mosquito canopies and strong wire springs over these we spread our own bedding and thankfully resumed our slumbers the morning discovered to us voi the station the district commissioner house on distant side hill and fairly extensive east indian bazaar the keepers of the latter the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https the natives immediately about the station grew some ﬂat shady trees all else was dense thorn scrub pressing close about the town opposite were the tall rounded mountains nevertheless in spite of its appearance voi has its importance in the scheme of things from it crossing the great serengetti desert runs the track to kilimanjaro and that part of german east africa the germans have yet railroad so they must perforce patronize the british line thus far and then trek across the kilimanjaro district is one rich in natives and trade the track is well used most of the transport is done by donkeys in carts or under the pack saddle the distance from water to water is very great the journey is hard one this fact and the incidental consideration that from ﬂy and hardship the mortality in donkeys is very heavy pushes the freight rates high and that fact accounts the motor car which has been my point of aim from the beginning of this paragraph the motor car plies between voi and the german line at exorbitant rates our plan was to have it take us and some galvanized water tanks out into the middle of the desert and dump us down there so after breakfast we hunted up the owner he proved to be very short blond german youth who justiﬁed weber and fields in fact he talked so exactly like those comedians that my task in visualizing him to you is somewhat lightened if all instead of merely majority of my readers had seen weber and fields that task would vanish we explained our plan and asked him his price sefen hundert and feefty rupees 11 said he uncompromisingly he was abrupt blunt and insulting we wanted transportation very not seven hundred and ﬁfty rupees persisted he offered an imperturbable stolidity the motor truck stood near i said something technical about the engine then something more he answered these remarks though grudgingly i suggested that it took mighty good driver to motor through this rough country he mentioned particular hill i proposed that we should try the station restaurant beer while he told about it he grunted but headed the station two hours we listened to the most blatant boasting he was great driver he had driven the american millionai re the chinese ambassador to france alexis the kaiser himself we learned how he had been the trusted familiar of these celebrities how on various detailed at length had been treated by them an equal and he told us sundry sly slanderous and disgusting anecdotes of these worthies his foreﬁn ger laid one side his nose when we ﬁnally got him worked up to the point of going to get some excessively bad photograp hs i haf daken myself we began to have hopes so we tentatively approached once more the subject of transportation then the basis of the trouble came out one davis from england had also dealt with our friend davis we reconstructed him was of the blunt type with probably very little feeling of democracy those in subordinate positions and with most certainly good deal of insular and racial prejudice evidently rather vague bargain had been struck and the motor had set forth then ensued ﬁnancial wranglings and disputes to terms it ended by useless hauteur on davis part and inexcu sable but effective action by the german davis found himself dumped down on the serengetti desert and left there we heard all this in excruciatingly funny weberandﬁeldese many times repeated the german literally beat his breast and cried aloud against davis we unblushingly sacriﬁced probably perfectly worthy davis to present need and cried out against him too am i like one dog demanded the german fervently the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https certainly not we cried with equal fervour we both like dogs then followed wearisomely reiterated assurances that we at least knew how gentleman should be treated and more boasting of proud connections in the past but the end of it was bargain of reasonable dimensions ourselves our personal boys and our loads under plea of starting our safari boys off we left him and crept with shattered nerves around the corner of the there we lurked busy at pretended affairs until our friend swaggered away to the hindu quarters where it seems he had his residence about ten small safari marched in afoot it had travelled all of two nights across the thirst and was glad to get there the single white man in charge had been three years alone among the natives near kilimanjar and he was now out six months vacation at home two natives in the uniform of sudanese troops hovered near him very sorrowful he splashed into the water of the and then introduced himself we sat in teakwood and talked all day he was most interesting likeable and cordial man at any stage of the game the game by means of french all drinks steadily we could hardly blame him celebrating by the afternoon he wanted to give things away so insistent was he that ﬁnally accepted an ebony and i an ebony knife inset with ivory if we had been the least bit unscrupulous i am afraid the relativ es at home would have missed their african souvenirs he went out viâ freight car all by himself seated regally in steamer chair between two side doors one native squatted on either side to see that he did not lurch out into the landscape footnotes 11 fifty pounds xxvi the or yx at ten the following morning we started on the high front seat under an awning sat the german and the body of the truck was ﬁlled with safari loads memba sasa simba mohammed and boy whose name i have forgotten the arrangement on the front seat was due to strike on the part of f look here said he to you got to sit next that rotter we want him to bring us back some water from the other side and i break his neck in ten minutes you sit next him and give him your motor car patter therefore i took the middle seat and played chorus the road was not bad one natural mountain roads go i have myself driven worse in california our man however liked to exaggerate all the difﬁculties and while doing it to point to himself with pride perfect wonder between times he talked elementary mechanics the inﬂammation of the sparkling plugs was one of his expressions that did much to compensate the country mounted steadily through the densest thorn scrub i have ever seen it was about ﬁfteen feet high and so thick that its penetration save by made tracks would have been an absolute impossibility our road ran like lane between two spiky jungles bold bright mountains cropped up singly and in short ranges far the eye could see the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https sort of thing twenty than hard day journey on safari we made it in little less than two hours and the breeze of our going kept us reasonably cool under our awning we began to appreciate the real value of our diplomacy at noon we came upon series of unexpectedly green and clear small hills just under the frown of sheer rock cliff this oasis in the thorn was occupied by few scattered native huts and the usual squalid indian dukka or trading store at this last our german friend stopped from under the seat he drew out collapsible table and basket of provisions these we were invited to share diplomacy highest triumph after lunch we surmounted our ﬁrst steep grade to the top of ridge this we found to be the beginning of long elevated plateau sweeping gently downward to distant heat mist which later experience proved concealment to snowcapped kilimanjaro this plateau also looked to be covered with scrub we penetrated it however we found the bushes were more or less scattered while in the wide shallow dips between the undulations were open grassy meadows there was water isolated mountains or peaked hills showed here and there in the illimitable spaces some of them fairly hull down all of them toilsomely distant this was the serengetti itself in this great extent of country somewhere were game herds they were exceedingly migratory and nobody knew very much about them one of the species would be the rare and localized oryx this beast was the principal zoological end of our expedition though of course always we hoped chance lion geographically we wished to ﬁnd the source of the swanee river and to follow that stream down to its joining with the tsavo about one we passed our safari boys we had intended to stop and replenish their canteens from our water but they told us they had encountered stray and astonishing shower and did not need more we left them trudging cheerfully across the desert they had travelled most of the night before would the same in the night to come and should reach our about noon of the next day we ourselves stopped about four in few hours we had come hard three days march over the side went our goods we bade the german very affectionate farewell he was still to ﬁll our drums from one of the streams out of kilimanjaro and deliver them to us on his return trip next day we then all turned to and made camp the scrub desert here was exactly like the scrub desert the last sixty miles the next morning we were up and off before sunrise in this job time was very large element of the contract we must ﬁnd our oryx before our water supply gave out therefore we had resolved not to lose moment the sunrise was most work ﬂat clouds with burnished copper coloured clouds behind glowing through the lace we admired it some few moments then one of us happened to look higher there above the sky of the horizon apparently suspended in to the zenith hung like delicate bubbles the double cloud peaks of kilimanjaro between them and the earth we could apparently see clear sky it was in reality of course the haze that rarely leaves these torrid plains i have seen many mountains in all parts of the world but none fantastically insubstantial wonderfully lofty gracefully able to yield before clouds and storms and sunrise glows all the space in inﬁnity they could possibly use and yet to tower above them serene in an upper space of its own nearly every morning of our journey to come we enjoyed this wonderful vision an hour or so then the mists closed in the rest of the day showed us grayish sky along the western horizon with apparently nothing behind it in the meantime we were tramping steadily ahead over the desert threading the thorn scrub crossing the wide shallow rown swales spying about us signs of game at the end of three or four miles we came across some ostrich and four hartebeeste this encouraged us to think we might ﬁnd other game soon the hartebeeste is gregarious animal suddenly we saw squat beast that none of us the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https along like badger sixty yards ahead any creature not easily identiﬁed is scientiﬁc possibility in africa therefore we ﬁred at once one of the bullets hit his foreleg paw immediately this astonishing small creature turned and charged us if his size had equalled his ferocity he would have been formidable opponent we had lively few minutes he rushed us again and again uttering ferocious growls we had to step high and lively to keep out of his way between charges he sat down and tore savagely at his wounded paw we wanted him nearly perfect specimen possible so tried to rap him over the head with club owing to remarkably long teeth and claws this was soon proved impracticable so we shot him he weighed about ﬁfty pounds and we subsequently learned that he was honey badger an animal very rarely captured we left the boys to take the whole skin and skull of this beast and strolled forward slowly the brush ended abruptly in wide valley it had been burnt over and the new grass was coming up green we gave one look and sank back into cover the sparse game of the immediate vicinity had gathered to this fresh feed herd of hartebeeste and gazelle were grazing and ﬁve giraffe adorned the but what interested us especially was group of about ﬁfty animals with the unmistakable rapier horns of the oryx we recognized them the rarity we desired the conditions were most unfavourable the cover nearest them gave range of three hundred yards and even this would bring them directly between us and the rising sun there was help it however we made our way to the bushes nearest the herd and i tried to align the blurs that represented my sights at the shot ineffective they raced to the right across our front we lay low they had seen nothing they wheeled and stopped after two hundred yards of ﬂight this shift had brought the light into better position once more i could deﬁne my sights from the sitting position i took careful aim at the largest buck he staggered twenty feet and fell dead the distance was just 381 paces this shot was indeed fortunate we saw more oryx xxvii across the serengetti we arrived in camp about noon almost exhausted with the ﬁerce heat and six hours tramp to ﬁnd our german friend awaiting us by an irony of fate the drums of water he had brought back with him were now unnecessary we had our oryx however we wearily gave him lunch and listened to his prattle and ﬁnally sped him on his way hoping never to see him again about three our men came in we doled out water rations and told them to rest in preparation the morrow late that night we were awakened by creaking and snorting and the ﬂash of torches passing we looked out to see donkey transport toiling slowly along travelling thus at night to avoid the terriﬁc day heats the carts with their wild and savage drivers looked very picturesque in the ﬂickering lights we envied them vaguely their deﬁned route that permitted night travel and sank to sleep in the morning however we found they had left with us new responsibilities in the shape of an elderly somali very sick and down with the fever this was indeed responsibility it was manifestly impossible us to remain there with him we should all die of thirst it was equally impossible to take him with us he was quite unﬁt to travel under the sun finally the best soluti on of bad business we left him ﬁve gallons of water some food and some quinine together with the advice to rest until night and then to follow his companions along the beaten track what between illness and wild beasts his chances did not look very good but it was the best we could him this the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https well the cruelty of this singular people they probably abandoned the old man because his groans annoyed them or because one of them wanted to ride in his place on the donkey cart 12 we struck off early possible through the thorn scrub on compass bearing that we hoped would bring us to reported swamp at the head of the swanee river the swanee river was one of the sources of the tsavo of course this was guesswork we did not know certainly the location of the swamp its distance from us nor what lay between us and it however we loaded all our transportable vessels with water and set forth the scrub was all alike sometimes thinner sometimes thicker we marched by compass until we had raised conical hill above the horizon and then we bore just to the left of that the surface of the ground was cut by thousands of game tracks they were all very old however made after rain and it was evident the game herds venture into this country only when it contains rainwa ter after two hours however we did see one solitary hartebeeste whom we greeted an old friend in desolation shortly afterwards we ran across one oribi which i shot our own table at the end of two hours we sat down the safari of twenty men was very miscellaneous lot consisting of the of the bazaars picked up in hurry they were soft and weak and they straggled badly the last along by one of our two in only at the end of half an hour then we took new start the sun was by now up and hot the work was difﬁcult enough at best but the weight of the tropics was now cast in the scale twice more within the next two hours we stopped to let every one catch up each time this required longer interval in the thorn it was absolutely essential to keep in touch with every member of the party man once lost would likely remain so we could not af ford to endanger all the sake of one time wore on until noon had it not been thin ﬁlm of haze that now overspread the sky i think the sun would have prove d too much some of the men four or ﬁve straggled so very badly that we ﬁnally left them in charge of one of our two askaris with instructions to follow on fast they could in order to make this possible we were at pains to leave trail after this fashion slowly and with growing anxiety some of the men we drew up on our landmark hill there our difﬁculties increased the thorn brush thickened only by series of short zigzags and by taking advantage of every rhino trail going in our direction could we make our way through it at all while to men carrying burdens on their heads the tangle aloft must have been fairly maddening so slow did our progress necessarily become and so difﬁcult was it to keep in touch with everybody that and i ﬁnally halted consultation it was decided that i should push on ahead with memba sasa to make certain that we were not on the wrong line while and the askaris struggled with the safari therefore i took my compass bearing afresh and plunged into the scrub the sensation was of hitting solid ground after long walk through sand we seemed fairly to shoot ahead and out of sight whenever we came upon earth we marked it deeply with our heels we broke twigs downwards and laid bunches of grass to help the trail we were leaving the others to follow this in spite of our compass was very devious track besides the thorn bush es were patches of spiky aloe coming into red ﬂower and the spears of sisal after an hour steady swift walking the general trend of the country began to slope downwards this argued watercourse between us and the hills around kilimanjaro there could be doubt that we would cut it the only question was whether it like so many desert watercourses might not prove empty we pushed on the more rapidly then we caught glimpse through chance opening of the tops of trees below us after another hour we suddenly burst from the scrub to strip of green grass beyo nd which were the great trees the palms and the festooned vines of watercourse two bush the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https into the thicket we approached and ﬁfteen or twenty mongooses sat up straight and stif f so many picket pins the better to see us moment my heart sank the low under growth beneath the trees apparently swept unbroken from where we stood to the low bank opposite it was exactly like the shallow damp but waterless ravines at home ﬁlled with black berry vines we pushed forward however and found ourselves looking down on smooth swift ﬂowing stream it was not over six feet wide grown close with vines and grasses but so very deep and swift and quiet that an extraordinary volume of water passed through an artiﬁcial aqueduct furthermore unlike most african streams it was crystal clear we plunged our faces and wrists in it and took long thankful draughts it was all most grateful after the scorching desert the fresh trees meetin g in canopy overhead were full of monkeys and bright birds festooned vines swung their great ropes here and there long heavy grass carpeted underfoot after we had rested few minutes we ﬁlled our empty canteens and prepare d to start back our companions but while i stood there memba faithfu l memba both canteens and darted away lie down he shouted back at i will go back without would have been futile sank down on the grass i was very tired little breeze followed the watercourse the grass was soft i would have given anything nap but in wild africa nap is not healthy so i drowsily watched the mongooses that had again come out of seclusion and the monkeys and the birds at the end of long time and close to sundown i heard voices moment later memba sasa and about of the men came in we all white and black set to work to make camp then we built smudges and ﬁred guns in the faint hope of guiding in the stragglers matter of fact we had not the slightest faith in these expedients unless the men were hopelessly lost they should be able to follow our trail they might be almost anywhere out in that awful scrub the only course open to them would be to climb thorn trees the night next day we would or ganize formal search them in the meantime almost dead from exhaustion we sprawled about everywhere the men too dispirited even to start their own sat around resting boxers between rounds then to us came memba sasa who had already that day made double journey and who should have been the most tired of all bwana said he if you will lend winchi 13 and lantern i will bring in the men we lent him his requirements and he departed hours later he returned carefully leaned winchi in the corner of the tent deposited the lantern and stood erect at attention well memba sasa i inquired the men are here they were far very far verna memba sasa assanti sana 14 that was his footnotes 12 i have just heard that this old man survived and has been singing our praises in nairobi the saviour of his the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https 13 his name winchester 14 very good memba sasa thanks very much xxviii down the river relieved now of all anxiety to water we had merely to make our way downstream first however there remained the interesting task of determining its source accordingly next day we and our gunbearers left the boys to rest and set out upstream at ﬁrst we followed the edge of the river jungle tramping over hard hot earth winding in and out of growths of thorn scrub and brilliant aloes we saw herd of impallas gliding like phantoms and we stood in need of meat i shot at one of them but missed the air was very hot and moist at ﬁve in the morning the thermometer had stood at 78 degrees and by noon it had mounted to 106 degrees in addition the atmosphere was ﬁlled with the humidity that later in the day was to break in extraordinary deluges we moved slowly but even then our garments were literally dripping wet at the end of three miles the stream bed widened we came upon beautiful spacious open lawns of from eighty to one hundred acres apiece separated from each other by narrow strips of tall forest trees the grass was high and waved in the breeze like planted grain the boundary trees resembled artiﬁcial of eucalyptus or normandy poplar one might expect white ranch house beyond some low clump of trees and chicken runs and corrals along these apparent boundaries of forest trees our stream divided and divided again so that we were actually looking upon what we had come to source of the swanee branch of the tsavo river in these peaceful protected meadows was it cradled from them it sprang full size out into the african wilderness ﬁne impalla buck grazed in one of these ﬁelds i crept near him i could behind one of the rows of trees it was not very near and the second time i missed thereupon we decided two things that we were not really meat hungry and that yesterday hard work was not conducive to good shooting having thus accomplished the second object of our expedition we returned to camp from that time begins regular sequence of events on which i look back with the keenest of pleasure the two constant factors were the river and the great dry country on either side day after day we followed down the one and we made brief excursions out into the other each night we camped near the sound of the swift running water where the winds rustled in the palms the acacias made lacework across the skies and the jungle crouched in velvet blackness close to earth like beast our life in its routine was regular in its details bizarre and full of the unexpected every morning we arose an hour before day and ate by lantern light and the gleam of ﬁres at the ﬁrst gray we were afoot and on the march and i with our gunbearers then pushed ahead down the river leaving the men to come along fast or slowly they pleased after about six hours or so of marching we picked out good camp site and lay down to await the safari by two in the afternoon camp was made also it was very hot after light lunch we stripped to the skin lay on our cots underneath the the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https and tried to doze or read the heat at this time of day was blighting about four if we happened to be inspired by energy one or the other of us strolled out at right angles to the stream to see what we could see the evening was tepid and beautiful bathed and we lolled in our canvas chairs smoking chatting or listening to the innumerable voices of the night such was the simple and almost invariable routine of our days but enriching it varying it disguising it sunshine cloud shadow and unexpect ed winds modify the landscape so well known from study the incredible incidents and petty adventures of african travel the topography of the river itself might be divided very roughly into three the headwater country down to its junction with the tsavo the stretch and the gorge and hill district just before it crosses the rail road the headwater country is most beautiful the stream is not over ten feet wide but very deep swift and clear it ﬂows between deﬁned banks and is set in narrow strip of jungle in places the bed widens out to carpet of the greenest green grass sown with ﬂowers at other places it offers either mysterious thickets spacious cathedrals or snug bowers immediately beyond the edge of this river jungle begins the thorn scrub more or less dense distant single mountains or buttes serve landmarks in gently rising strongly rolling country occasional alluvial ﬂats draw back to low cliffs not over twenty feet high after the junction of the tsavo palms of various sorts replace to large extent the forest trees naturally also the stream widens and ﬂows more slowly outside the palms grow tall and bush our marching had generally to be done in the narrow neutral space between these two growths it was pleasant enough with the river snatching at the trailing branches and the birds and animals rustling away beyond the ﬂats low ridges ran down to the river varying in width but carrying always with them the dense thorn between them ran recesses sometimes three or four hundred acres in extent high with or little trees like alders so much the immediate prospect on our right we marched across the river to our left were huge riven mountains with great cliffs and cañons we followed necessarily every twist and turn of the river sometimes these mountains were directly ahead of us then magically behind so that we thought we had passed them by but the next hour threw them again across our trail the ideal path would of course have cut across all the bends and ridges but the thorn of the ridges and the of the ﬂats forbade it so we marched ten miles to gain four after days of struggle and deception we passed those mountains then we entered new type of country where the tsavo ran in cañons between hills the high cliffs often towered far above us we had to pick our way along narrow river ledges again the river ran like trout stream over rifﬂes and rapids while we sauntered along cleared banks beneath the trees had we not been making forced march under terriﬁc heat at just that time this last phase of the river might have been the pleasantest of all throughout the whole course of our journey the rhinoceros was the most abundant of the larger animals the indications of old tracks proved that at some time of the year or under some different conditions great herds of the more gregarious plains antelope and zebra visited the river but at the time of our visit they were absent the rhinoceroses however in incredible numbers came regularly to water paradoxically we saw very few of them and enjoyed comparative immunity from their charges this was due to the fact that their habits and ours swung in different orbits the rhinoceros after drinking took to the hot dry thorn scrub in the low hills and he drank at night we rarely encountered him in the river bottoms where we were marching this was very lucky the cover was so dense that meeting must necessarily be at close quarters indeed these large and truculent beasts were rather help than hindrance we often made use of their wide clear paths to penetrate some particula rly distressing jungle however we had several small adventures with them just enough to keep us alert in rounding corners the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https of our travel was bushes and corners the big ﬂat footsteps absolutely fresh in the dust padded methodically ahead of us down the only way until it seemed that we could not fail to plump upon their maker around the next bend we crept forward foot by foot every sense alert ﬁnger on trigger then after time the spoor turned off to the right towards the hills we straightened our backs and breathed sigh of relief this happened over and over again at certain times of year also elephants frequent the banks of the tsavo in considerable numbers we saw many old signs and once came upon the fresh path of small herd the great beasts had passed by that very morning we gazed with considerable awe on limbs snatched bodily from trees on acacias foot in diameter pulled up by the roots and stood up side down on tree trunks twisted like ropes of the game by far the most abundant were the beautiful red impalla we caught glimpses of their graceful bodies gliding in and out of sight through the bushes or came upon them standing in small openings their delicate ears pointed to us they and the tiny dikdik furnished our table and an occasional water satisﬁed the men one day we came on one of the latter beasts sound asleep in tiny open space he was lying down and his nose rested against the earth just like very old family horse in paddock besides these common species were lesser kudu giraffe and leopard the we jumped occasionally quite near at hand they ducked their heads low and rushed tearingly to the next cover the leopard was heard sighing every night and saw their pad marks next day but only twice did we catch glimpses of them one morning we came upon the carcass of female lesser kudu from which evidently we had driven the slayer these few species practically completed the game list they were sufﬁcien t our needs and the lesser kudu was prize much desired our collection but by far the most interesting to were the smaller animals the birds and the strange innumerable insects we saw natives in the whole course of our journey the valley of the river harboured many monkeys they seemed to be of two species blue and brown but were equally noisy and amusing they retired ahead of our advance with many remarks or slipped past us to the rear without any comments whatever when we made camp they retired with indignant protests and when we had quite settled down they returned near they dared one very hot afternoon i lay on my canvas cot in the open staring straight upward into the overarching greenery of the trees this is very pleasant thing to the beautiful outstretching of the tree branches and twigs intrigue the eye the leaves make fascinating hypnotically waving patterns against very blue sky and in the chambers and galleries of the upper world the birds and insects carry on varied businesses of their own after time the corner of my eye caught quick movement far to the left and in shadow at once i turned my attention that way after minute scrutiny i at length made out monkey evident ly considering himself quite unobserved he was slowly and with great care stalking our camp inch by inch he moved takin g skilful advantage of every bit of cover ﬂattening himself along the limbs hunching himself up behind bunches of leaves until he had gained big limb directly overhead there he stretched ﬂat staring down at the scene that had so strongly aroused his curio sity i lay there over two hours reading and dozing my friend aloft never stirred when dusk fell he was still there some time after dark he must have regained his band in the morning the limb was vacant now comes the part of this story that really needs witness not to veracity perhaps but to accuracy of observations fortunately i have about noon next day the monkey returned to his point of observation he used the same precautions to concea lment he followed his route of the day before he proceeded directly to his old conning tower on the big limb it did not take him quite so long to get there he had already scouted the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https trail and close at his heels followed two other monkeys they crawled where he crawled they crouched where he crouched they hid where he hid they ﬂattened themselves out by him on the big limb and all three of them passed the afternoon gazing down on the strange and fascinating things below whether these newcomers were part of the ﬁrst one family out treat or whether they were cook tourists of the jungle in charge of my friend competence guide i not know farther down the river and i stopped some time to watch the crossing of of the little blue monkeys the whole band clambered to near the top of tall tree growing by the water edge there one by one they ran out on straight overhanging limb and cast themselves into space on the opposite bank of the river and leaning well out grew small springy bush each monkey landed smash in the middle of this clasped it with all four hands swayed alarmingly recovered and scampered ashore it was rather nice problem in ballistics this mistake in calculation of foot in distance or pound in push would land monkey in the water and the joke of it was that directly beneath that bush lay two crocodiles each tiny body hurtled through the air i swear look of hope came into the eyes of those crocs we watched until the last had made his leap there were mistakes the joke was against the crocodiles we encountered quite number of baboons these big apes always retreated very slowly and noisily scouts in the rearguard were continually ascending small trees or bushes better look at us then leaping down to make disparaging remarks one lot seemed to show such variation in colour from the usual that we shot one the distance was about two hundred and ﬁfty yards immediately the whole hundred or so on all fours and started in our direction this was rather terrifying however we stood ﬁrm they slowly came to halt at about seventy yards barked and chattered moment then hopped away to right and left xxix the lesser kudu about eight the evening of our ﬁrst day on the swanee the heat broke in tropical downpour we heard it coming from long distance like the roar of great wind the velvet blackness star hung was troubled by an invisible blurring mist evidenced only through subtle effect on the subconsciousness every leaf above us in the circle of our ﬁrelight depended absolutely motionless from its stem the insects had ceased their shrilling the night birds their chirping the animals great and small their callings or their stealthy rustling to and fro of the world of sound there remained only the crackling of our ﬁres the tiny singing of the blood in our ears and that portentous roar our simple dispositions were made trenches had been dug around the tents the pegs had been driven well home our stores had been put in shelter we waited silently pufﬁng away our pipes the roaring increased in volume benea th it we began to hear the long rolling crash of thunder overhead the stars already dimmed were suddenly blotted from existence then came the rain in literal deluge though the god of ﬂoods had turned over an entire reservoir with one twist of his mighty hand our ﬁre went out instantly the whole world went out with it we lay on our canvas cots unable to see foot beyond our tent opening unable to hear anything but the insistent terrible drumming over our heads unable to think of anything through the tumult of waters man body might struggle from behind waterfall through the torrents so our imaginations half drowned managed dimly to picture forth little men huddled close in their tiny tents their cowled blankets over their heads all the rest of the universe had the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https time the insistent beat and rush of waters began to wear through our patience we willed that this wracking tumult should cease we willed it with all the force that was in us then this proved vain we too humped our spiritual backs cowled our souls with patience and waited dumbly the force of the storm to spend itself our faculties were quite effectually drowned out by the unceasing roar and crash of the wate rs our bodily comfort would have been had we lacked the protection of our tent abruptly the storm passed it did not die away slowly in the diminuendo of ordinary storms it ceased though the reservoir had been tipped back again the rapid drip drip drip of waters now made the whole of sound all the rest of the world lay breathless then inside our tent cricket struck up bravely this homely cheerful little sound rouse d us we went forth to count damages and to put our house in order the men hunted out dry wood and made another ﬁre the creatures of the jungle and the stars above them ventured forth next morning we marched into world swept clean the ground was smooth though new broom had gone over it every track now was fresh and meant an animal near at hand the bushes and grasses were hung with jewels merry little show ers shook down from trees sharing joke with some tiny wind white steam rose from moist soil the smell of greenhouses was in the air looking back we were stricken motionless by the sight of kilimanjaro its twin peaks suspended clean blue sky fresh snow mantling its shoulders this day so cheeringly opened was destined to fulﬁl its promise in the dense scrub dwell shy and rare animal called the lesser kudu specimens of which we greatl y desired the beast keeps to the thickest and driest cove where it is impossible to see ﬁfty yards ahead but where the slightest movement breaks the numberless dry interlacements of which the place seems made to move really quietly one could not cover over in an hour the countryside extends thousand square miles or more and the lesser kudu is rare it can be seen that hunting them might have to be slow and painful process we had twice seen the peculiar tracks on this morning however we caught glimpse of the beast itself ﬂash of gray with an impression of the characteristic was all the trail in the ground was of course very plain i left the others and followed it into the brush usual the thorn scrub was so thick that i had to stoop and twist to get through it at all and so brittle that the least false move made crackling like ﬁre the rain of the night before had however softened the débris lying on the ground i moved forward quickly i could half suffocated in the steaming heat of the dense thicket after three or four hundred yards the beast fell into walk so i immediately halted i reasoned that after few steps at this gait he would look back to see whether or not he was followed if his scouting showed him nothing he migh t throw off suspicion after ten minutes i crept forward again the spoor showed my surmises to be correct i came to where the animal had turned behind small bush and had stood few minutes taking up the tracks from this point i was delighted to ﬁnd that the kudu had forgotten its fear and was browsing at the end of ﬁve minutes more of very careful work i was fortunate enough to see it feeding from the top of small bush yards away the raking shot from the springﬁeld dropped it in its tracks it proved to be doe great prize of course but not to be compared with the male we skinned her carefully and moved on delighted to have the species our luck was not over however at the end of six hours we picked our camp in pretty grove by the stream there we sat down to await the safari the were full of both the brown and blue monkeys baboons barked at us from distance the air was musical with many sweet birds big thunder were gathering around the the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https safari came in mohammed immediately sought us out to report in great excitement that he had seen ﬁve kudu across the stream he claimed to have watched them even after the safari had passed and that they had not been alarmed the chance was slight that the kudu could be found but still it was chance accordingly we rather reluctantly gave up our plans loaf and nap mohammed said the place was an hour back we had had six hours march already however abou t two we set out before we had arrived quite at the spot we caught glimpse of the ﬁve kudu they dashed across tiny opening ahead of us they had moved downstream and crossed the river it seemed rather hopeless to follow them into that thick country once they had been alarmed but the prize was great therefore memba sasa and i took up the trail we crept forward mile very quiet very sweaty then simultaneously through chance opening and long distance away we caught patch of gray with single transverse white stripe there was chance to ascertain the sex of the beast nor what part of its anatomy was thus exposed i took bull eye chance on that patch of gray had the luck to hit it in the middle the anim al went down memba sasa leapt forward like madman i could not begin to keep pace with him when i had struggled through the thorn i found him dancing with delight monuome bwana buck master he cried soon he saw and made spiral gesture in imitation of the male beautiful corkscrew horns while the men prepared the trophy and i followed on after the other four to see what they would and speedily came to the conclusion that we were lucky to land two of the wily beasts the four ran compactly together and in wide curve several hundred yards then two faced directly back while the other two one on either side made short detour out and back to guard the ﬂanks we did not get back to camp until after dark tremendous pair of electric storms were volleying and roaring at each other across the space of night leopards were crying pack of wild dogs were barking vociferously the camp we approached it was globe of light in bower of darkness the ﬁre shining and ﬂickering on the under sides of the leaves lent them strangely unreal appearance the porters their bodies and red blankets catching the blaze roasted huge chunks of meat over little ﬁres we ate belated supper in comfort peace and satisfaction then the storms joined forces and fell upon us xxx adventures by the way we journeyed slowly on down the stream interesting things happened to us the impressions of that journey are of two sorts the little isolated details and the general background of our day routine with the gray dawn the great heats of the day the blessed evening and its ﬁreﬂies the thundering of heaven artillery and the downpour of torrents the hot high crackling thorn scrub into which we made excursions the ﬂowing river with its palms and jungles outleaning palms trailing their fronds just within the snatch of the ﬂood waters wide ﬂats in the embrace of the river bends or extending into the low hills grown thick with lush green and threaded with rhinoceros paths the huge sheer cliff mountains over the way distant single hills far down the mild discomfort of the start before daylight clearly revealed the thorns and stumbling blocks the buoyant cheerfulness of the ﬁrst part of the day with the grouse rocketing straight up out of the elephant grass the birds singing everywhere and the beasts of the jungle still at the edges the growing weight of the sun though great pressing hand were laid upon the shoulders the suffocatin g gasping heat of afternoon and the the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https black and white clouds the cool evening in pyjamas with the ﬁreﬂies ﬂickering among the bushes the river singing and little breezes wandering like pattering raindrops in the dry palm these by repetition of main elements blend in my memory to form single image to be sure each day the rock pinnacles over the way changed slightly their compass bearings and little variations of contour lent variety to the procession of days but in essentials they were of one kin but here and there certain individual scenes and incidents stand out clearly and alone without reference to my notebook i could not tell you their chronological order nor the days of their happening they occurred without correlation thus one afternoon at the loaﬁng hour when was sound asleep under his mosquito bar and i in my canvas chair was trying to catch the breeze from an approaching deluge to came total stranger in large turban he was without arms or baggage of any sort an alien in strange and savage country jambo bwana greeting great master said he jambo said i though his existence were not in the least surprising and went on reading this showed him that i was indeed great master after suitable interval i looked up wataka neenee what you want i demanded nataka sema qua heri i want to say said this astonishing individual i had until that moment been quite unaware of his existence he had therefore not yet said how you i failed to fathom his reasons wanting to say however far be it from to deny any one innocent pleasure so i gravely bade him and he disappeared into the howling wilderness whence he had come one afternoon we came upon two lemurs seated gravely side by side on horizontal limb ten feet up thorn tree they contem plated us with the preternatural gravity of very young children and without the slightest sign of fear we coveted them pets billy but soon discovered that their apparent tameness was grounded on good solid common sense the thorns of that thorn tree we left them sitting upright side by side little farther on and up dry earthy hillside beast leapt from an eroded place fairly under my feet and made off with singularly familiar kiyi it was animal apparently brick red in colour when i had collected myself i saw it was wild dog it had been asleep in warm hollow of red clay and had not awakened until i was fairly upon it we had heard these beasts nearly every night but this was the ﬁrst we had seen some days later we came upon the entire pack drinking at the river they leapt suddenly across our front eighty yards away their heads all turned towards us truculently barking at us like so many watch dogs they made off but not though particularly alarmed one afternoon i had wounded good across the river and had gone downstream to ﬁnd dry way over more enthusiastic had plunged in and promptly attacked the he was armed with the english service revolver shooting ely cartridge it is very short stubby bit of ammunition i had often cast doubt on its driving power compared to colt example loyal englishman had of course defended his army weapon when i reached the centre of disturbance i found that had emptied his revolver three the head and forequarters of that without much effect incidentally the had given him good lively time charging again and again the weapon has not nearly the shock power of even our cartridge classiﬁed too light serious the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https afternoon i gave my shotgun to one of the porters to carry aﬁeld remarking facetiously to all and sundry that he looked like gunbearer after twenty minutes we ran across rhinoceros i spent some time trying to manoeuvre into position photograph of the beast however the attempt failed we managed to dodge his rush then after the excitement had died we discovered the porter and the shotgun up tree he descended rather shamefaced nobody said anything about it later we came upon another rhinoceros the beast was visib le at some distance and downhill nevertheless the porter moved little nearer tree this was too much memba sasa all the rest of the afternoon he ragged that porter in much the same terms we would have employed in the same circumstances that place ahead said he looks like good place rhinoceros perhaps you better climb tree there is dikdik bush is big enough to climb him are you afraid of jackals too the ﬁreﬂies were our regular evening companions we caught one or two of them the pleasure of watching them alternately igniting and extinguishing their little lamps even when we put them in bottle they still kept up their performance bravely but besides them we had an immense variety of evening visitors beetles of the most inconceivable shapes and colours all sorts of moths and numberless strange insects insects exactly like dry twigs and the ﬁerce tall praying mantis with their mock air of meekness and devotion let one of the other insects stray within reach and their piety was quickly enough abandoned one beetle about of an inch across was oblong in shape and of pure glittering gold his wing covers on the other hand were round and transparent the effect was of jewel under tiny glass case other beetles were of red dotted with black or of black dotted with red they sported stripes or circles of plain colours they wore long slender antennae or short knobby horns they carried rapiers or pinchers long legs or short in fact they ran the gamut of grace and horror so that an inebriate would ﬁnd here great rest the imagination after we had gone to bed we noticed more pleasantly our cricket he piped up you may remember the night of the ﬁrst great storm that evening he took up his abode in some fold or seam of our tent and there stayed throughout all the rest of the journey every evening he tuned up cheerfully and we dropped to sleep to the sound of his homelike piping we grew very fond of him one does of everything in this wild and changing country that can represent stable point of habitude nor must i forget one evening when all of sudden out of the darkness came tremendous hollow booming like the beating of war drums or the bellowing of some strange great beast at length we identiﬁed the performer an unfamiliar kind of frog xxxi the lost saf ari we were possessed of map of sorts consisting mostly of wide blank spaces with an occasional tentative mountain or the probable course of streams marked thereon the only landmark that interested us was single round peak situated south of our river and at point just before we should cross the railroad at tsavo station there came day when from the top of hill where we had climbed the sake of the outlook we thought we recognized that peak it was about ﬁve miles away the crow the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https we returned to camp and made the fatal mistake of starting to ﬁgure we ought to cover the distance even with the inevitable twists and turns in day the ekly train passed through tsavo the following night if we could catch that we would save two days wait the next train you follow the thought we arose very early the next morning to get good start on our forced march there is use in spinning out sad tale we passed what we thought must be our landmark hill just eleven times the map showed only one butte matter of fact there were dozens at each disappointment we had to reconstruct our theories it is the nature of man to this savo station must be just around the next bend we marched six hours without pause then began to save ourselves little by all the gods of logical reasoning we proved tsavo just beyond certain fringe of woods when we arrived we found that there the river broke through range of hills by way of deep gorge it was change from the everlasting scrub with its tumbling waters its awful cliffs its luxuriant tropical growths but it was so much the more difﬁcult to make our way through beyond the gorge we found any amount of hills kopjes buttes sugar loaves each isolated from its fellows each perfectly competent to serve the map single landmark we should have camped but we were very anxious to catch that train and we were convinced that now after all that work tsavo could not be far away it would be ridiculous and mortifying to ﬁnd we had camped almost within sight of our destination the heat was very bad and the force of the sun terriﬁc it seemed to possess actual physical weight and to press us down from above we ﬁlled our canteens many times at the stream and emptied them often by two was getting little wobbly from the sun we talked of stopping when an unexpected thunder shower rolled out from behind the mountains and speedily overcast the entire heavens this shadow relieved the stress much revived insisted that we proceed so we marched and passed many more hills in the meantime it began to rain after the tropical fashion in two minutes we were drenched to the skin i kept my matches and notebook dry by placing them in the crown of my cork helmet after the intense heat this tepid downpour seemed to us delicious and then quite unexpectedly of course we came around bend to make out through the sheets of rain the steel girders of the famous tsavo bridge 15 we clambered up steep slippery bank to the along which we proceeded half mile to the station this consisted of two or three native huts house the east indian in charge and the station building itself the latter was small frame structure with narrow ﬂoorless veranda there was platform drawing close on all sides was the interminable thorn scrub later when the veil of rain had been drawn aside we found that tsavo perched on hillside looked abroad over wide prospect the moment all we saw was dark dismal dripping station wherein was sign of life we were beginning to get chilly and we wanted very much some tea ﬁre chance to dry pending the arrival of our safari we jerked open the door and peered into the inky interior babu yelled f babu from an inner back room came the faint answer in most precise english i come i am there followed the sharp quick tinkle of little indian manner of calling upon the lord attention we both knew better than to hustle the institutions of the east so we waited with what patience we had listening to the intermittent tinkling of the little bell at the end of the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https minutes the devotee appeared he proved to be mild deprecating little man very eager to help but without resources he was hindu and lived mainly on tea and rice the rice was all out but he expected more on the night train there was trading store here he was the only inhabitant after few more answers he disappeared to return carrying two pieces of letter paper on which were tea and little coarse native sugar these with very small potatoes were all he had to of fer it did not look very encouraging we had absolutely nothing in which to boil water of course we could not borrow of our host caste stood in the way there if we were even to touch one of his utensils that utensil was him deﬁled ever nevertheless we had eaten nothing since four that morning and had put hard day work behind us we made an effort after short search we captured savage possessed of surfuria or native cooking pot memba sasa scrubbed this with sand first we made tea in it and drank turn about from its wide edge this warmed us up somewhat then we dumped in our few potatoes and single guinea fowl that had decapitated earlier in the day we ate and passed the pot over to memba sasa so far so good but we were still very wet and the uncomfortable thought would obtrude itself that the safari might not get in that day it behoved us at least to dry what we had on i hunted up memba sasa whom i found in native hut ﬁre blazed in the middle of the ﬂoor i stooped low to enter and squatted on my heels with the natives slowly i steamed off the surface moisture we had rather good time chatting and laughing after while i looked out it had stopped raining therefore i emer ged and set some of the men collecting ﬁrewood shortly i had ﬁne little blaze going under the veranda roof of the station and i hung out our breeches to dry and spread the tails of our shirts over the heat was actually the human chimney the smoke was pouring in clouds from the breast and collar of his shirt we were ﬁne ﬁgures the public platform of railway station we had just about dried off and had reassumed our thin and scanty garments when the babu emer ged we stared in ed astonishment he had mufﬂed his head and mouth in most brilliant scarf if zero weather although dressed otherw ise in the usual pongee under one arm he carried folded clumsy cotton umbrella around his waist he had belted huge knife in his other hand he carried his i mean just we had seen such things on tapestries or in museums but did not dream that they still existed out of capti vity this was an oriental looking with handle three feet long spike on top spike out behind and blade in front the babu had with little of his signal paint done the whole thing blade and all to brilliant green soon we had recovered our breath we asked him very politely the reason these stupendous preparations it seemed that it was his habit to take daily stroll just before sunset the sake of the health he told us in his accurate english the bush is full of bad men he explained who would like to kill but when they see this axe and this knife they say to each other walks very bad man we dare not kill him he marched very solemnly quarter up the track and back always in plain view promptly on his return he dived into his little back room where the periodic tinkling of his praying bell some time marked his gratitude having escaped the bad men the bell ceased several times he came to the door eyed us timidly and bolted back into the darkness finally he approached to within ten feet twisted his hands and giggled in most deprecating fashion what is the use of this killing game he gabbled rapidly he could man should not destroy what man can not ﬁrst create after which he giggled again and ﬂed his conscience evidently had driven him to this deﬁance of our high mightinesses against his sense of politeness and his the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https this time my boy mohammed and the cook drifted in they reported that they had left the safari not far back our hopes of supper and blankets rose they declined however with the gathering darkness and were replaced by wrath against the faithless ones memba sasa in spite of his long day took gun and disappeared in the darkness he did not get back until nine when he suddenly appeared in the doorway to lean the gun in the corner and to announce hapana safari we stretched ourselves on bench and ﬂoor was took what sleep we could in the small hours the train thundered through the train we had hoped to catch footnotes 15 this is the point at which construction was stopped by lions see patterson the of tsavo xxxii the babu we stretched ourselves stifﬂy in the ﬁrst gray of dawn wondering where we could get mouthful of breakfast on emer ging from the station strange and gladsome sight met our chop boxes and gun cases belonging to some sportsman not yet arrived necessity knows law so we promptly helped ourselves to food and cleaning implements much refreshed we lit our pipes and settled ourselves to wait our delinquents shortly after sunrise an indian track inspector trundled in on handcar propelled by two natives he was suave and corpulent person with very large umbrella and beautiful silken garments the natives upset the handcar off the track and the newcomer settled himself an enjoyable morning he and the babu discussed ethics and metaphysical philosophy three solid hours evidently they came from different parts of india and their only common language was english through the thin partition in the station building we could hear plainly every word it was very interesting especially did we chortle with delight when the inspector began one of his arguments somewhat follows now the two english who are here they possess great sums of wealth nudged and they have weapons to kill and much with which to things yet their savage it was plain rank eavesdropping but most illuminating thus to get at ﬁrst hand the eastern point of view to ourselves to hear the bloodless gentle shell of indian philosophy described by believers they discussed the most minute and impractical points and involved themselves in the most uncompromising dilemmas thus the gist of one argument was follows all sexual intercourse is sin but the race must go forward by means of sexual intercourse therefore the race is conceived in sin and is sinful but it is great sin an individual not to carry forward the race since the divine will decrees that in some way the race is necessary to it therefore it would seem that man is in sin whichever way you look at but interposes the inspector ﬁrmly but politely is it not possible that sexual sin and the sin of opposing divine will may be of balance in the spirit so that in resisting one sort man acquires virtue to commit the other without and so on the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https the safari drifted in consider that fact and what it meant the plain duty of the headman was of course to have seen that the men followed us in the day before but allowing the sake of argument that this was impossible and that the men had been forced by the exhaustion of some of their number to stop and camp if they had arisen betimes they should have completed the journey in two hours at most that should have brought them in by seven or eight but noon arrival condemned them without the necessity of argument they had camped early had risen very very late and had dawdled on the road we ourselves gave the two responsible headmen twenty lashes apiece then turned over to them the job of thrashing the rest ten per man was the allotment they expected the punishment took it gracefully some even thanked us when it was over the babu disappeared in his station about an hour later he approached us very deprecating and handed us telegra it was from the district commissioner at voi ordering us to report ﬂogging porters on the tsavo station platform i am truly sorry i am truly sorry the babu was murmuring at our elbows what does this mean we demanded of him he produced thick book it is in law he explained you must not ﬂog men on the station platform it was my duty to report how did we know that why did you tell us if you had gone there pointed ten feet away to spot exactly like all other spots it would have been of f the platform then i had nothing to say we tried to become angry but why in blazes could you have told us of that quietly and decently we have moved it is the law he tapped his thick book but we can not be supposed to know by heart every law in that book why did you warn us before reporting we insisted i am truly sorry he repeated i hope and trust it will not prove serious but it is in the book we continued in the same purposeless fashion moment or so longer then the babu ended the discussion thus it was my duty i am truly sorry suppose i had not reported and should die and should go to heaven and god should ask you done your duty what should i say to him we gave it up we were up against revealed religion so that night we took freight train southward to voi leaving the babu and his prayer bell and his green and his conscience alone in the wilderness we had quite respect that babu the district commissioner listened appreciatively to our tale of course i shall not carry the matter further he told us but having known the babu you must see that once he had reported to i was compelled to order you down here i am sorry the inconvenience the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https when we reﬂected on the cataclysmic upheaval that babu would have under gone had we not been summoned after breaking one of the laws in the book we had to admit the district commissioner was right par t vi in masailand xxxiii over the likipia escarpment owing to an outbreak of bubonic plague and consequent quarantine we had recruited our men outside nairobi and had sent them in char ge of to little station up the line billy and i saw to the loading of our equipment on the train and at two in solitary state set forth our only attendants were mohammed and memba sasa who had been fumigated and inoculated and generally the purpose the little train doubled and twisted in its climb up the range overlooking nairobi and the athi plains fields of corn grew so tall partially to conceal villages of round huts with conical roofs we looked down into deep ravines where grew the bananas the steep hillsides had all been carefully cultivated savages leaning on spears watched us puff heavily by women richly ornamented with copper wire or beads toiled along bent under loads carried by means of band across the top of the head 16 naked children rushed out to wave at us we were steaming quite comfortably through africa it had been thousands of years before the white man came at kikuyu station we came to halt kikuyu station ordinarily embarks about two passengers month i suppose now it was utterly swamped with business on it had descended all our safari of men and three mules thirty of the yelled and shrieked and got in the wrong place usual and the train men and the stationmaster and our responsible boys heaved and tugged and directed ordered commanded at length the human elem ent was loaded to its places and locked in then the mules had to be urged up very narrow into car quite sensibly they declined to take chances we persuaded them the process was quite simple two of the men holding the ends at safe distance stretched light strong cord across the beasts hind legs and sawed it back and forth we clanged the doors shut climbed aboard and the train at last steamed on now bits of forest came across our way deep shaded with trailing curtain vines and wide leaves big table tops and high lush impenetrable under growth full of ﬂashi ng birds fathomless shadows and inquisitive monkeys occasionally we emer ged to the edge of long oval meadow set in depressions among hills like our sierra meadows indeed so like were these openings to those in our own wooded mountains that we always experienced distinct shock of surprise the familiar woods parted to disclose dark solemn savage with ﬂashing spear we stopped at various stations and descended and walked about in the gathering shadows of the forest it was getting cool many little things attracted our attention to remain in our memories isolated pictures thus i remember one grave savage squatted by the track playing on sort of instrument it had two strings and he twanged these alternately without the slightest effort to change their pitch by the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https his ﬁngers he bent his head sidewise and listened with the meticulous attention of connoisseur we stopped at that place fully ten minutes but not second did he leave of f twanging his two strings nor did he even momentarily relax his attention it was now near sundown we had been climbing steadily the train shrieked twice and unexpectedly slid out to the edge of the likipia escarpment we looked down once more into the great rift valley the rift valley is though strip of half the length of the continent in time past sunk bodily some thousands of feet leaving more or less sheer escarpment on either side and preserving intact its own variegated landscape in the bottom we were on the likipia escarpment we looked across to the mau escarpment where the country over which our train had been travelling continued after its interruption by the valley and below us were mountains streams plains the westering sun threw strong slants of light down and across the engine shut off its power and we slid silently down the rather complicated grades and curves of the descent noble forest threw its shadows over us through the chance openings we caught glimpses of the pale country far below across high trestle bridges we rattled and craned over to see the rushing white water of the mountain torrents hundred feet down the shriek of our engine echoed and weirdly from the serried trunks of trees and from the great cliffs that seemed to lift themselves we descended we debarked at kijabe 17 well after dark it is situated on ledge in the escarpment is perhaps quarter wide and includ es nothing more elaborate than the station row of indian dukkas and two houses of south africans set back towards the rise in the cliffs mile or so away and on little higher level stand the extensive buildings of an american mission it is i believe educational well sectarian is situated in one of the most healthful climates of east africa and is prosperous at the moment we saw none of these things we were too busy getting men mules and equipment out of the train our lanterns ﬂared in the great wind that swept down the deﬁle and across the track little ﬁres ﬂared too shortly we made the acquaintance of the south africander who furnished us our ox teams and wagon and of lank drawling youth who was to be our rider the latter was very anxious to get started so we piled all our stores and equipment but those immediately necessary the night aboard the great wagon then we returned to the very belated supper while eating this we discussed our plans these were in essence very simple somewhere south of the great thirst of the sotik river called the narossara back of the river were high mountains and down the river were benches dropping off by thousands of feet to the barren country of lake magahdi over some of this country ranged the greater kudu easily the prize buck of east africa we intended to try greater kudu people laughed at us the beast is extremely rare it ranges over wide area it inhabits the thickest sort of cover in sheer mountainous country its senses are wonderfully acute and it is very wary man might once in blue moon get one by happening upon it accidentally but deliberately to go after it was sheer lunacy so we were told matter of fact we thought so ourselves but greater kudu was good an excuse another the most immediate of our physical difﬁculties was the thirst six miles from kijabe we would leave the kedong river after that was more water two days and nights during that time we should be forced to travel and rest in alternation day and night with great deal of travel and very little rest we should be able to carry the men limited amount of water on the ox wagon but the cattle could not drink it was hard anxious grind day journey beyond the ﬁrst water after the thirst we should cross the southern guaso nyero river 18 then two days should land us at the narossara there we the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https our ox wagon and push on with our tiny safari we planned to relay back porters from our dif ferent camps that was our whole plan our transport rider object in starting this night was to reach the kedong river and there to outspan until our arrival next day the cattle would thus get good feed and rest then at four in the afternoon we would set out to conquer the thirst after that it would be question of travelling to suit the oxen next morning when we arose we found one of the wagon kikuyus awaiting us his tale ran that after going four miles the oxen had been stampeded by lions in the the dusselboom had been broken he demanded new dusselboom i looked wise though i knew just what that meant and told him largely to help himself shortly he departed carrying what looked to be the greater part of forest tree we were in hurry so we did not try to get our safari under way before eight it consisted of porters the gunbearers three personal boys three syces and the cook of this lot some few stand out from the rest and deserve particular attention of course i had my veterans memba sasa and mohammed there was also kongoni gunbearer elsewhere described the third gunbearer was marrouki wakamba he was the personal gunbearer of twigg who very courteously loaned him this trip possessing some knowledge of the country he was small person with stripes about his eyes dressed in scotch highland cap khaki breeches and shooting coat miles too big him his soul was earnest his coura ge great his training good his intelligence none too brilliant timothy our cook was pure swahili he was thin elderly individual with wrinkled brow of care this represented conscientious soul he tried hard to please but he never could quite forget that he had cooked the governor safari his air was always one of silent disapproval of our modest outﬁt so well did he howe ver often under trying circumstances that at the close of the expedition billy presented him with very fancy knife to her vast astonishment he burst into violent sobs why what is it she asked oh memsahib he wailed i wanted watch personal boy billy had masai named geyeye 19 the members of this proud and aristocratic tribe rarely condescend to work the white man but when they they are very ﬁne servants they are highly intelligent geyeye was short and very very ugly perhaps this may partly explain his leaving tribal life the masai generally are over six feet man was an educated coast swahili named abba ali this individual was very smart he wore vandyke beard ﬂannel boating hat smart tailored khakis and carried rattan cane he was alert quick and intelligent his position was midway between that of personal boy and headman of the rank and ﬁle we began with two changed their minds before we were fairly started and departed in the night there was time to get regular porters but fortunately kikuyu chief detailed two wild savages from his tribe to act carriers these two children of nature drifted in with pleasant smiles and little else save knacks from our supplies we gave them two thin jerseys reaching nearly to the knees next day they appeared with broad tucks sewed around the middle they looked like my mama did use wool soap we then gave it up and left them free and untrammelled they differed radically one was past the ﬁrst enthusiasms and vanities of youth he was small unobtrusive unornamented he had possessions save the jersey the water bottle and the blanket we ourselves supplied the blanket he crossed bandolier fashion on one shoulder it hung down behind like tasselled sash his face was little and wizened and old he was quiet and uncomplaining and the easy mark all the rest we had constantly to be interfering to save him from imposition to too heavy the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https many jobs and the like nearing the close of the long expedition when our loads were lighter and fewer one day spoke up i going to give the old man good time said he i doubt if he ever had one before or if he ever will again he that sort of meek damnfool so it was decreed that kimau 20 should carry nothing the rest of the trip was to more work was to have all he wanted to eat it was treat to see him he accepted these things without surprise without spoken thanks just he would have accepted an increased supply of work and kicks before his little ﬁre he squatted all day gazing vacantly off into space or gnawing on piece of the meat he always kept roasting on sticks he spoke to one he never smiled or displayed any obvious signs of enjoyment but from him radiated feeling of deep content his companion savage was young blood and still affected by the vanities of life his hair he wore in short tight curls resem bling the rope hair of french poodle liberally anointed with castor and coloured with clay his body too was turned to bronze by the same method so that he looked like beautiful smooth metal statue come to life to set this quality off he wore glittering collars bracelets and ear ornaments of polished copper and brass when he joined us his sole costume was negligent strip of cotton cloth after he had recei ved his ofﬁcial jersey he carefully tied the cloth over his wonderful head nor far we knew did he again remove it until the end of the expedition all his movements were inexpressibly graceful they reminded one somehow of flaxman drawings of the greek gods his face too was and likeable certain half feminine wild grace combi ned with the queer effect of his headgear caused us to name him daphne at home he was called kingangui at ﬁrst he carried his burden after the fashion of the back and kept to the rear of the procession and at evening consorted only with old lightfoot soon opportunity offered he built himself marvellous iridescent ball of marabout feathers each of these he split along the quill so that they curled and writhed in the wind this picturesque charm he suspended from short pole in front of his tent also he belonged to the kikuyu tribe he ate game meat but conﬁned his diet to cornmeal porridge we were much interested in watching daphne gradual conversion from savage ways to those of the regular porter within two weeks he was carrying his load on his head or shoulder and trying to keep up near the head of the safari the charm of feathers disappeared shortly after i am sorry to say he took his share of the meat within two months daphne was imitating closely possible the manners and customs of his safari mates but he never really succeeded in looking anything but the wild and graceful savage he was footnotes 16 after the fashion of the canadian tump line 17

project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https to the kedong four hours we descended the valley through high thorn scrub or the occasional grassy openings we were now in the ﬂoor of the rift valley and both along the escarpments and in the ﬂoor of the great blue valley itself mountains were all about us most of the large ones were evidently craters and everywhere were smaller kopjes or buttes that in their day had also served blow holes subterranean ﬁres at the end of this time we arrived at the place where we were supposed to ﬁnd the wagon wagon was there the spot was in the middle of level plain on which grew very scattered bushe s great deal like the sparser mesquite growths of arizona towards the likipia escarpment and about to its base line of trees marked the course of the kedong river beyond that fairly against the mountain we made out settler house leaving billy and the safari and i set out this house the distance was long and we had not made half of it before thunder clouds began to gather they came up thick and black behind the escarpment and rapid ly spread over the entire heavens we found the wagon shortly still mending its dusselboom or whatever the thing was leaving instructions it to proceed to certain point on the kedong river we started back our safari it rained in ten minutes the dusty plains far the eye could reach were covered with water two or three inches deep from which the sparse bunches of grasses grew like reeds in great marshy lake we splashed along with the water over our ankles the channels made by the game trails offered natural conduits and wherever there was the least grade they had become rushing brooks we found the safari very bedraggled billy had made mound of valuables atop which she perched her waterproof cape spread wide possible good deal like brooding hen we set out the on the kedong in half an hour we had there found bit of higher ground and had made camp suddenly they had gathered the storm clouds broke away the expiring sun sent across the valley ﬂood of golden light that gilded the rugged old mountain of suswa over the way directly on the other side of suswa told there is of hard clay this rain will ﬁll it and we shall ﬁnd water there we can take night rest and set off comfortably in the morning so the rain that had soaked us so thoroughly was blessing after all while we were cooking supper the wagon passed us its wheels and frame creaking its great whip cracking like riﬂe its men shrieking at the imperturbable team of eighteen oxen it would travel until the oxen wanted to graze or sleep or scratch an ear or meditate on why is kikuyu thereupon they would be outspanned and allowed to it whatever it was until they were ready to go on again then they would go on these sequences might take place at any time of the day or night and greater or lesser intervals of time that was distinctly up to the oxen the human beings had mighty little to say in the matter but transport riding from the point of view of the rank outsider really deserves chapter of its own xxxv the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https transpor t rider the wagon is one evolved in south long affair with ingenious braces and timbers so arranged to furnish the maximum clearance with the greatest facility substitution in case the necessity repairs might arise the whole vehicle can be dismounted and reassembled in few hours so that unfordable streams or impossible bits of country can be crossed piecemeal its enormous wheels are set wide apart the brake is worked by crank at the rear like reversal of the starting mechanism of motor car bolted to the frame on either side between the front and rear wheels are capacious cupboards and two stout water kegs swing to and fro when the craft is under way the net carrying capacity of such wagon is from three to four thousand pounds this formidable vehicle in our own case was drawn by team of eighteen oxen the biggest brutes the wheelers were attached to tongue all the others pulled on long chain the only harness was the pronged yoke that ﬁtted just forward of the hump over rough country the wheelers were bange d and jerked about savagely by the tongue they did not seem to mind it but exhibited certain amount of intelligence in manipulation to drive these oxen we had one white man named brown and two small kikuyu savages one of these worked the brake crank in the rear while the other preceded the lead cattle brown exercised general supervision whip and boer expletives and admonitions in transport riding this game is called there is required great amount of especial skill though not necessarily high degree of intelligence along the ﬂats all goes well enough but once in the unbelievable rough country of hill trek the situation alters man must know cattle and their symptoms it is light feat to wake up eighteen sluggish bovine minds to the necessity effort and then to throw so much dynamic energy into the situation that the whole eighteen will begin to pull at once that is the secret unanimity an ox is the most easily disco uraged working animal on earth if the ﬁrst three couples begin to haul before the others have aroused to their effort they will not succeed in budging the wagon an inch but after moment struggle will give up comp letely by that time the leaders respond to the command and throw themselves forward in the yoke in vain they can not pull the wagon and their wheel comrades too therefore they give up by this time perhaps the lash has aroused the ﬁrst lot to another effort and so they go pulling and hauling against each other getting nowhere until the end is an exhausted team driver half insane and great necessity unloading good driver on the other hand shrie ks few premonitory dutch then i suppose inside those bovine heads the effect is somewhat that of violent electric explosion at any rate it hits them all at once and all together in response they surge against their yokes the heavily laden wagon creaks groans moves forw ard the hurricane of dutch and the volleys of whip crackings rise to crescendo we are of f to perform just this little simple trick of getting the thing started requires not only peculiar skill or gift but also lungs of brass and throat of iron transport rider without voice is tenor in the same ﬁx he so hoarse that it is pain to hear him but long he can croak in good volume he is all right mere shouting will not he must shriek until to the sympathetic bystander it seems that his throat must split wide open furthermore he must shriek the proper things it all sounds alike to every one but transport riders and oxen but matter of fact it is boer nicely assorted to suit different occasions it is incredible that oxen should distinguish but then it is also incredible that trout should distinguish the nice dif ferences in artiﬁcial ﬂies after the start has been made successfully the craft must be kept under way to an unbiassed bystander the whole affair looks insane the wagon creaks and sways and groans and cries aloud it bumps over great boulders in the way the leading the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https nimbly and shrills remarks at the nearest cattle the tail kikuy u winds energetically back and forth on his little handle and tries to keep his feet and brown he is magniﬁcent his long lash sends out volley of riﬂe reports down up ahead back his cracked voice roars out an unending stream of apparent gibberish back and forth along the line of the team he skips nimbly the sweat streaming from his face and the oxen plod along unhasting unexcited their eyes dreamy chewing the cud of yesterday philosophic reﬂections the situation conveys the general impression of peevish little stream breaking against great calm cliffs all this frantic excitement and expenditure of energy is so apparently purposeless and futile the calm cattle seem so aloof and superior to it all so absolutely unaffected by it they are going slowly to be sure their gait may be maddeningly deliberate but evidently they not intend to be hurried why not let them take their own speed but all this hullabaloo means something after all it does its business and the top of the boulder hill is gained without it the whole concern would have stopped and then the wagon would have to be unloaded before fresh start could have been made results with cattle are not shown by facial expression nor by increased speed but simply by continuance they will plod up steep hills or along the level at the same placid gait only in the former case they require especial treatment in case the wagon gets stuck on hill will occasionally happen so that all the oxen are discouraged at once we would see one of the kikuyus leading the team back and forth back and forth on the side hill just ahead of the wagon this is to confuse their minds cause them to get their failure and thus to make another attempt at one stretch we had three days of real mountains 21 brown shrieked like steam calliope all the way through he lasted the distance but had little conversation even with his beloved kikuyus when the team is outspanned which in the waterless country of forced marches is likely to be almost any time of the day or night brown sought little rest this purpose he had sort of bunk that let down underneath the wagon if it were daytime the cattle were allowed to graze under supervision of one of the kikuyus if it was night time they were tethered to the long chain where they lay in somnolent double row lantern at the head of the ﬁle and one at the wagon tail were supposed to discourage lions in bad lion country ﬁres were added to these defences brown thus worked hard throu gh varied and long hours in strict intimacy with stupid and exasperating beasts after working hours he liked to wander out to watch those same beasts grazing his mind was full of cattle that although we offered him reading matter he never seemed to care it nor conversation with white people not of his trade in fact the only gleam of interest i could get out of him was by commenting on the qualities or peculiarities of the oxen he had small organ on which he occasionally perfo rmed and would hold forth hours with his childlike kikuyus in the intelligence to follow ordinary directions he was an infant we had to iterate and reiterate in words of one syllable our directions to routes and and then he was quite apt to go wrong right yet i must repeat he knew thoroughly all the ins and outs of very difﬁcult trade and understood well how to keep his cattle always ﬁt and in good condition in fact he was little hipped on what the dear should or should not be called upon to one incident will illustrate all this better than i could explain it when we reached the narossara river we left the wagon and pushed on afoot we were to be gone an indeﬁnite time and we left brown and his outﬁt very well ﬁxed along the narossara ran pleasant shady strip of high jungle the country about was clear and open but most important of all white man of education and personal charm occupied trading boma or enclosure near at hand an accident changed our plans and brought us back unexpectedly at the end of few weeks we found that brown had trekked back long day journey and was encamped alone at the end of spur of mountains we sent native runners after him he explained his change of base by saying that the cattle the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https little better at his new camp mind you this at the narossara the feed was quite good enough the oxen were doing work there was companionship books papers and even phonograph to while away the long weeks until our return brown quite cheerfully deserted all this to live in solitude where he imagined the feed to be microscopically better footnotes 21 oxen xxxvi across the thirst we were off bright clear day after the rains suswa hung grayish pink against the bluest of skies our way slanted across the rift valley to her base turned the corner and continued on the other side of the great peak until we had reached the rainwater pan on her farther side it was long march the plains were very wide and roomy here and there on them rose many small cones and craters lava ﬂows and other varied evidences of recent volcanic activity geologically recent i mean the grasse s of the ﬂowing plains were very brown and the molehill craters very dark the larger craters blasted and austere the higher escarpment in the background blue with solemn distance the sizes of things were not originally ﬁtted out little tiny people like human beings we walked hours to reach landmarks apparently only few miles away in this manner we crept along industriously until noon by which time we had nearly reached the shoulder of suswa around which we had to double the sun was strong and the men not yet hardened to the work we had many stragglers after lunch memba sasa and i strolled along on route ﬂanking that of the safari looking the ﬁrst of our meat supply within short time i had killed thompson gazelle some solemn giraffes looked on at the performance and then moved of f like mechanical toys the day lengthened we were in the midst of wonderful scenery our objection grew to be that it took so long to put any of it behind us insensibly however we made progress suddenly it seemed we found ourselves looking at the other side of suswa and various little craters had moved up to take the places of our old friends at last about four we topped the swell of one of the numerous and interminable land billows that undulate across all plains countries here and saw few miles away the wagon outspanned we reached it about sunset to be greeted by the welcome news that there was indeed water in the pan we unsaddled just before dark and i immediately started towards the game herds many of which were grazing away the gazelle would supply our own larder but meat man was very desirable i shot hartebeeste made the prearranged signal men to carry meat and returned to camp even yet the men were not all in we took lanterns and returned along the road the long marches under desert sun are joke at last we had accounted all but two these we had to abandon next day we found their loads but never laid eyes on them again thus early our became about nine just we were turning number of lions began to roar usually lion roars once or twice by way of satisfaction after leaving kill these however were engaged in driving game and hence trying to make much noise possible the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https plainly seven individuals perhaps more the air trembled with the sound to the deepest tones of big organ only the organ is near and enclosed while these vibrations were in the open air and remote few moments the great salvos would boom across the veld roll after roll of thunder then would ensue momentary dead silence then single voice would open to be joined immediately by the others we awoke next day to an unexpected cold drizzle this was bit uncomforta ble from one point of view and most unusual but it robbed the thirst of its terrors we were enabled to proceed leisurely and to get good sleep near water every night the wagon had usual pulled out some time during the night our way led over succession of low rolling ridges each higher than its predecessor game herds fed in the shallow valleys between at about ten we came to the foot of the mau escarpment and also to the unexpected sight of the wagon outspanned brown explained to us that the oxen had refused to proceed farther in face of number of lions that came around to sniff at them then the rain had come on and he had been unwilling to attempt the mau while the footing was slippery this sounded reasonable in fact it was still reasonable the grass was here fairly neck high and we found water therefore we decided to make camp and i wandered out in search of game we tramped great deal of bold rugged country both in cañon bottoms and along the open ridges but found only rhinoceros one and dozen hartebeeste african game general rule avoids country where the grass grows very high we enjoyed however some bold and wonderful mountain scenery and obtained glimpses through the ﬂying murk of the vast plains and the base of suswa on precipitous cañon cliff we found hanging garden of cactus and of looped vines that was marvel to behold we ran across the hartebeeste on our way home our men were already out of meat the hartebeeste of yesterday had disappeared these porters are good deal like the ioned michigan take good deal of feeding the ﬁrst few days when we came upon the little herd in the grass i took shot at the report the animal went down ﬂat we wandered over slowly memba sasa whetted his knife and walked up thereupon hartebeeste jumped to his feet ﬂirted his tail gaily and departed we followed him mile or so but he got stronger and gayer every moment until at last he frisked out of the landscape quite strong and hearty in all my african experience i lost only six animals hit by bullets i took inﬁnite pains and any amount of time to hunt down wounded beasts this animal was i think creased by too high shot certainly he was not much injured but certainly he got big shock to start with the little herd had gone on i got down and crawled on hands and knees in the thick grass it was slow work and i had to travel by landmarks when i ﬁnally reckoned i had about reached the proper place i stood up suddenly my riﬂe at ready so dense was the cover and so still the air that i had actually crawled right into the middle of the band while we were cutting up the meat the sun broke through strongly therefore the wagon started on up the mau at six twelve hours later we followed the ﬁne drizzle had set in again we were very glad the wagon had taken advantage of the brief dry time from the top of the sheer rise we looked back the last time over the wonderful panorama of the rift valley before us were wide rounded hills covered with scattered small growth that in general appearance resembled scrub oak it sloped away gently until it was lost in mists later when these cleared we saw distant blue mountains across tremendous shallow basin we were nearly on level with the summit of suswa itself nor did we again drop much below that altitude after ﬁve or six miles we overtook the wagon outspanned the projected journey had again been frustrated by the lions these beasts had proved so bold and menacing that ﬁnally the team had been forced to stop in sheer however the day was cool and overcast so nothing was lost after topping the mau we saw few gazelle zebra and hartebeeste but soon plunged into bush country quite destitute of game we were paralleling the highest ridge of the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https and so alternated between the crossing of cañons and the travell ing along broad ridges between them in lack of other amusement long time i rode with the wagon the country was very rough and rocky everybody was excited to the point of frenzy except the wagon it had certain dutch stolidity in its manner of calmly and bumpily surmounting such portions of the landscape happened in its way after very long tiresome march we camped above little stream barring our lucky rain this would have been the ﬁrst water since leaving the kedong river here were hundreds of big blue pigeons swooping in to their evening drink two days more we repeated this sort of travel but always with good camps at sized streams gradually we slanted away from the main ridge though we still continued the swells and ravines thrown off its ﬂanks only the ravines hour by hour became shallower and the swells lower and broader on their tops the scrub sometimes gave way to openings of short grass on these fed few gazelle of both sorts and an occasional zebra or so we saw also four topi beast about the size of our wapiti built on the general speciﬁcations of hartebeeste but with the most beautiful iridescent coloured coat this quartette was very wild i made three separate stalks on them but the best i could was 360 paces at which range i missed finally we surmounted the last low swell to look down wide and sloping plain to the depression in which ﬂowed the principa l river of these parts the southern guaso nyero beyond it stretched the immense ocean like plains of the loieta from which here and there rose isolated hills very distant like lonesome ships at sea little to the left also very distant we could make out an unbroken blue range of mountains these were our ultimate destination xxxvii the southern guaso nyero the southern guaso nyero unlike its northern namesake is sluggish mudd y stream rather small ﬂowing between abrupt clay banks farther down it drops into great cañons and eroded abysses and acquires certain grandeur but here at the ford of agate drift it is decidedly unimpressive scant greenery ornaments its banks in fact at most places they run hard and baked to sheer f of ten or ﬁfteen feet scattered mimosa trees and aloes mark its course the earth mile or so is trampled by thousands of masai cattle that at certain seasons pass through the funnel of this the only ford miles apparently insigniﬁcant it is given to sudden tremendous rises these originate in the rainfalls of the upper mau escarpment many miles away it behooves the safari to cross promptly if it can and to camp always on the farther bank this we did pitching our tents in little opening between clumps of pretty ﬂowering aloes and the mimosas here everywhere in this country until we had passed the barrier of the narossara mountains the common horseﬂies were plague they follow the masai cattle i can give you better idea of their numbers than to tell you two isolated facts i killed at one blow and in the morning before sunrise the apex of our tent held solid black mass of the creatures running the length of the ridge pole and from half an inch to two inches deep every pack was black with them on the march and the wagon carried its millions when the shadow of branch would cross that slowly lumbering vehicle the swarm would rise and bumble around distractedly moment before settling down again they fairly made nimbus of darkness after we had made camp we saw number of masai warriors hovering about the opposite bank but they did not venture across some of their women did however and came cheerily into camp these most interesting people are worth more than the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https so i shall reserve my observations on them until later chapter one of our porters big baganda named sabakaki was suffering severely from pains in the chest that subsequently developed into pleurisy from the masai women we tried to buy some of the milk they carried in gourds at ﬁrst they seemed not averse but soon they realized the milk was not our own consumption they turned their backs on poor sabakaki and refused to have anything more to with us these masai are very difﬁcult to trade with their only willing barter is done in sheep these they seem to consider legitimate objects of commerce short distance from our camp stood three whitewashed round houses with thatched conical roofs the property of trader named agate he was away at the time of our visit after an early morning but vain attempt to get billy shot at lion 22 we set out our distant blue mountains the day was journey over plains of great varieg ation at times they were covered with thin scrub at others with small groves or again they were open and grassy always they undulated gently so from their tops one never saw far he thought he was going to see landmark we steered by butte named donga rasha memba sasa and i marched ahead on foot in this thin scrub we got glimpses of many beasts at one time we were within ﬁfty yards of band of magniﬁcent eland by ﬂeeting glimpses we saw also many wildebeeste and zebra with occasionally one of the smaller grass antelope finally in an open glade we caught sight of something tawny showing in the middle of bush it was too high off the ground to be buck we sneaked nearer at ﬁfty yards we came to halt still puzzled judging by its height and colour it should be lion but try we would we could not make out what part of his anatomy was thus visible at last i made up my mind to give him shot from the springﬁeld with the handy at the shot the tawny patch heav ed and lay still we manoeuvred cautiously and found we had killed stone dead not lion but bohur lying atop an ant hill concealed in the middle of the bush this accounted its height above the ground it happened i very much wanted one of these animals specimen so everybody was satisﬁed shortly after attracted by great concourse of carrion birds both on trees and in the air we penetrated thicket to come upon giraffe killed by lions the claw marks and other indications were indubitable the carcass had been partly eaten but was rapidly vanishing under the attacks of the birds just before noon we passed donga rasha and emer ged on the open plains here i caught sight of some roberts gazelle new species to and started alone in pursuit they usual trotted over the nearest rise so with due precautions i followed after at the top of that rise i lay still in astonishment befo re marched solemnly an unbroken single ﬁle of game reaching literally to my limit of vision in both directions they came over the land swell mile to my left and they were disappearing over another land swell mile and half to my right it was rigidly single ﬁle except the young the nose of one beast fairly touching the tail of the one ahead and it plodded along at businesslike walk there were but three species gnu the zebra and the hartebeeste i did not see the head of the procession it had gone from sight before i arrived nor did i ever see the tail of it either the safari appearing inopportunely broke its continuance but i saw two miles and half solid of big game it was great and formal trek probably to new pastures then i turned my attention to the roberts gazelle and my good luck downed specimen at 273 yards this with the bohur made the second new species the day our luck was not yet over however we had proceeded but few miles when kongoni discovered herd of topi the safari immediately lay down while i went ahead there was little cover and i had very hard time to get within range especially dozen zebras kept grazing across the line of my stalks the topi themselves were very uneasy crossing and recrossing and looking doubtfully in my direction i had number of chances at small bucks but refused them in my desire to get shot at the big leader of the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https finally he separated from the rest and faced in my direction at just 268 yards at the shot he fell dead the ﬁrst time we had an opportunity to admire the wonderful pelt it is beautiful in quality plum colour with iridescent lights and wavy water marks changing to pearl colour on the four quarters with black legs we were both struck with the gorgeousness of topi motor made of three skins with these pearl spots accents in the corners to our ambitions and hopes we added more topi our journey to the narossara river lasted three days in all we gained an outlying spur of the blue mountains and skirted their base the usual varied foothill country led us through deﬁles over ridges and by charming groves we began to see masai cattle in great herds the gentle humpbacked beasts were held in close formation by herders afoot tall lithe young savages with spears in the distance and through the heat haze the beasts shimmered strangely their glossy reds and whites and blacks blending together in this country of wide expanses and clear air we could thus often make out very herd simply speck of rich colour against the boundless rolling plains here we saw good variety of game zebras of course and hartebeeste the roberts gazelle few topi good many of the gnu or wildebeeste discovered and named by roosevelt few giraffes klipspringer on the rocky buttes cheetah and the usual jackals hyenas etc i killed one very old zebra so ancient was he that his teeth had worn down to the level of the gums which seemed fairly on the point of closing over nevertheless he was still fat and sleek he could not much longer have continued to crop the grass such extreme age in wild animals is in africa at least most remarkable generally they meet violent deaths while still in their prime about three of the third afternoon we came in sight of long line of forest trees running down parallel with the nearest mountain ranges these marked the course of the narossara and by four we were descending the last slope footnotes 22 see the land of footprints xxxviii the lower benches the narossara is really only about creek size but it ﬂows the whole year round it merits the title of river it rises in the junction of long spur with the main ranges cuts straight across wide inward bend of the mountains joins them again plunges down deep and tremendous cañon to the level of second bench below great cliffs meanders peacefully in ﬂowery meadows and delightful glades some miles and then once more and most unexpectedly drops eighteen hundred feet by waterfall and precipitous cascade to join the southern guaso nyero the country around this junction is some of the roughest i saw in africa we camped at the spot where the river ran at about its maximum distance from the mountains our tents were pitched beneath the shade of tall and refreshing trees number of masai women visited us laughing and joking with billy in their quizzically humorous fashion just we were sitting down at table an englishman wandered out of the greenery and approached he was small man with tremendous red beard wore loose garments and tennis shoes and strolled up his hands in his pockets and smoking cigarette this was man of whom we had heard member of historical family the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https in crack english regiment he had resigned everything to come into this wild country here he had built boma or enclosed compound and engaged himself in acquiring masai sheep in exchange beads wire and cloth obviously the proﬁts of such transactions could not be the temptation he liked the life and he liked his position of inﬂuence with these proud and savage people strangely enough he cared little the sporting possibilities of the country though of course he did little occasional shooting but was quite content with his trading his growing knowledge of and intimacy with the masai and his occasional tremendous journeys to the casual and infrequent stranger his attitude was reported most uncertain we invited him to tea which he accepted and we fell into conversation he and were already old acquaintances the man i found was shy about talking of the things that interested him but they most decidedly interested us also we managed to convey an impression of our sincerity thereafter he was most friendly his helpfulness kindness and courtesy could not have been bettered he lent us his own boy guide down through the cañons of the narossara to the lower benches where we hoped to ﬁnd kudu he offered to such of our supplies we intended holding in reserve he sent us sheep and eggs welcome variety to our game diet and in addition he gave us masai implements and ornaments we could not possibly have acquired in any other way it is impossible to buy the personal belongings of this proud and independent peop le at any price the price of spear ordinarily runs about two rupees worth when one trades with any other tribe i know of case where masai was offered ﬁfty rupees his weapon but refused scornfully acquired these things through friendship and after we had gained his he was most generous with them thus he presented us with thing almost impossible to get and seen rarely outside of masai war bonnet made of the mane of lion it is in shape and appearance though not in colour almost exactly like the grenadier shako of the last century in addition to this priceless trophy also gave us samples of the cattle bells both wooden and metal ivory ear ornaments bead bracelets steel collars circumcision knives sword belts and other affairs of like value but i think that the apogée of his kindliness was reached when much later he heard from the native tribes that we were engaged in penetrating the deﬁles of the higher mountains then he sent after us swift masai runner bearing to us bottle of whisky and message to the effect that was afraid we would ﬁnd it very cold up there think of what that meant turn it well over in your mind with all the circumstances of distance from supplies difﬁculty of transportation and all we none of us used whisky in the tropics so we later returned it with suitable explanation and thanks being too good to waste next morning under guidance of our friend boy we set out the lower benches leaving brown and his outﬁt to camp indeﬁnitely until we needed him the return journey the whole lie of the land hereabout is roughly speaking in series of shelves behind us were the high fourth bench we had been travelling on the plateau of the third bench now we were to penetrate some apparently low hills down an unexpected thousand feet to the second bench this was smaller perhaps only ﬁve miles at its widest its outer rim consisted also of low hills concealing drop of precipitous cliffs there were passes nor cañons streams dropped over in and precarious game trails offered the only chance descent the first bench was mere ledge mile or so wide from it one looked down into the deep gorge of the southern guaso nyero and across to tangle of eroded mountains and malpais that ﬁlled the eye only far off in an incredible distance were other blue mountains that marked the other side of the great rift valley our present task was to drop from the third bench to the second some distance we followed the narossara then when it began to drop into its tremendous gorge we continued along the hillsides above it until by means of various hogs backs and tributary cañons we were able to regain its level far below the going was rough and stony and hard on the porters but the scenery was very wild and ﬁne we met the river bottom again in the pleasantest oval meadow with ﬁne big trees the mountains the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https us towering imminent above our heads ahead of us the strea m broke through between portals that rose the full height of the ranges we followed it and found ourselves on the second bench here was grass high grass in which the boys were almost lost to sight behind us the ramparts rose sheer and high and over across the way were some low cliffs that marked plateau land between the plateau and the ranges from which we had descended was sort of slight ﬂat valley through which meandered the forest trees that marked the stream we turned to the right and marched an hour the river gradually approached the plateau thus leaving between it and the ramparts considerable plain and some low foothills these latter were reported to be one of the feeding grounds of the greater kudu we made most delightful camp at the edge of great trees by the stream the water ﬂowed at the bottom of little ravine precipitous in most places but with gentl y sloping banks at the spot we had chosen it ﬂowed rapidly over clean gravel with hurrying tinkling sound broad gravel beach was spread on the hither side of it like spacious secret room in the jungle here too was clear little slope on which to sit with the thicket all about the clean swift little stream below the high forest arches above and the inquisitive smaller creatures hovering near others had been here before us the wild things taking advantage of the easy descent to drinking buffalo leopard and small bucks the air was almost cloyingly sweet with perfume like honey our ﬁrst task was to set our boys to work clearing space the grass was so high and rank that mere trampling had little effect on it the baganda sabakaki we had been compelled to leave with the ox team so our had become next morning and i started out very early with one gunbearer the direction of the wind compelled us to two hours walk before we could begin to hunt the high grass was soaked with very heavy dew and shortly we were wet though we had fallen into the river number of hornbills and parrots followed us some distance but soon left us in peace we saw the roberts gazelle and some hartebeeste when we had gained point of vantage we turned back and began to work slowly along the base of the mountains we kept on general level hundred feet or so up their slope just high enough to give us point of overlook anything that might stir either in the ﬂat plateau foothills or the plains we also kept sharp lookout signs we had proceeded in this manner an hour when in an opening between two bushes below us and perhaps ﬁve hundred yards away we saw leopard standing like statue head up most beautiful spectacle while we watched her through the glasses she suddenly dropped ﬂat out of sight the cause we discovered to be three hartebeeste strolling sociably along stopping occasionally to snatch mouthful but headed always in the direction of the bushes behind which lay the great cat much interested we watched them they disappeared behind the screen sudden ﬂash marked the leopard spring two badly demoralized hartebeeste stamped out into the open and away two only the kill had been made we had only the one riﬂe with us we were supposed to be out after kudu only and were travelling light possible doubt the springﬁeld would kill leopa rd if the bullet landed in the right place we discussed the matter it ended of course in our sneaking down there i with the springﬁeld and with his knife unsheathed our precautions and trepidations were wasted the leopard had carried the hartebees bodily some distance had thrust it under bush and had departed surmised it would return towards evening therefore we continued after kudu we found old signs proving that the beasts visited this country but nothing fresh we saw however the ﬁrst some impalla some klipspringer and chanler the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https evening we made crafty stalk atop the foothills to point overlooking the leopard kill we lay here looking the place over inch by inch through our glasses when an ejaculation of disgust from kongoni called our attention there at another spot that confounded beast sat like house cat watching us cynically either we had come too soon or she had heard us and retired to what she considered safe distance there was of course chance of getting nearer so i sat down steadier hold and tried her anyway at the shot she leaped high in the air rolled over once then recovered her feet and streaked off at full speed just before disappearing over slight rise she stopped to look back i tried her again we conclud ed this shot miss the distance and light were such that only sheer luck could have landed the bullet however that luck was with us later developments showed that both shots had hit one cut foreleg but without breaking bone and the other had hit the paunch one was at 380 paces and the other at we found blood on the trail and followed it hundred yards and over small ridge to wide patch of high grass it was now dark the grass was very high and the animal probably desperate the situation did not look good to us badly armed we were so we returned to camp resolved to take up the trail again in the morning every man in camp turned out next day to help beat the grass with the stayed to direct and protect the men while i with the springﬁeld sat down at the head of the ravine soon i could hear the shrieks rattles shouts and whistles of the line of men they beat through the grass small grass bucks and hares bounded past birds came whirring by i sat on little ant hill spying hard i could in all directions suddenly the beaters fell to dead silence guessing this signal to that the beast had been seen i ran to climb higher ant hill to the left from there i discerned the animal plainly sneaking along belly to earth exactly in the manner of cat after sparrow it was not but the or cheetah supposed to be comparatively harmless beast at my shot she gave one spring forw ard and rolled over into the grass the nearest porters yelled and rushed in i ran too fast i could but was not able to make myself heard above the row an instant later the beast came to its feet with savage growl and charged the nearest of the men she was crippled and could not move quickly usual but could hobble along faster than her intended victim could run this was tall and very conceited kavirondo he ﬂed but ran around in circles in and out of his excited companions the cheetah followed him and him only with most minded purpose i dared not shoot while men were in the line of ﬁre even on the other side of the cheetah i knew the bullet would at that range go right on through and i fairly split my throat trying to clear the way it seemed ﬁve minutes though it was probably only many seconds before i got my chance it was high time the cheetah had reared to strike the man down 23 my shot bowled her over she jumped to her feet again made another dash at the thoroughly scared kavirondo and i killed her just at his the cheetahs ordinarily are supposed to be cowards although their size and power are equal to that of other leopards nobody is afraid of them yet this particular animal charged with all the ferocity and determination of the lion and would certainly have killed or badly mauled my man 24 to be sure it had been wounded and had had all night to think about it in the relief from the tension we all burst into shrieks of laughter all except the victim of the scrimmage who managed only sickly smile our mirth was short out from thicket over hundred yards away walked one of the men who had been in way involved in the ﬁght calmly announcing that he had been shot we were sceptical but he turned his back and showed us the bullet hole at the lower edge of the ribs one of my bullets after passing through the cheetah had ricocheted and picked this poor the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https from the whole of an empty landscape and this after i had delayed my rescue fairly to the point of danger in order to avoid all chance of hurting some one we had means of telling how deeply the bullet had penetrated so we reassured the man and detailed two men to assist him back to camp by easy stages he did not seem to be suf fering much pain and he had lost little strength at camp however we found that the wound was deep generously offered to make forced march in order to get the boy out to hospital by hitting directly across the rough country below the benches it was possible to shorten the journey somewhat provided could persuade the masai to furnish guide the country was desert and the water scarce we lined up our remaining men and selected the twelve best and strongest these we offered month and half extra wages the trip we then made hammock out of one of the ground cloths and the same afternoon started i sent with him four of my own men far the the purpose of bringing back more supplies they returned the next afternoon bringing also report from that all was well so far and that he had seen lion he made the desert trip without other casualty than the lost of his riding mule and landed the wounded man in the hospital all right in spite of expert care on the journey out and the best of treatment later the boy to my great distress died eleven days after reaching the hospital was gone just two weeks in the meantime i sent out my best trackers in all directions to look kudu signs conceiving this the best method of covering the country rapidly in this manner i shortly determined that chances were small here and made up my mind to move down to the edge of the bench where the narossara makes its plunge before doing so however i hunted and killed very large eland bull reported by mavrouki this beast was not only one of the largest i ever saw but was in especially ﬁne coat he stood ﬁve feet six inches high at the shoulder was nine feet eight inches long without the tail and would weigh hundred pounds the men were delighted with this acquisition i now had fourteen porters the three gunbearers the cook and the two boys they surrounded each tiny ﬁre with switches full of roasti ng meat they cut off great hunks stew they made quantities of biltong or jerky next day i left kongoni and one porter at the old camp loaded my men with what they could carry and started out we marched little over two hours then found ourselves beneath lone mimosa tree about quarter from the edge of the bench at this point the stream drops into little cañon preparatory to its plunge and the plateau rises ever so gently in tremendous cliffs i immediately dispatched the porters back anoth er load ﬁne lured across the river i did not get the but had good ﬁght with two lions narrated elsewhere in this spot we camped number of days did heap of hard climbing and spying killed another lion out of band of eight 25 thoroughly determined that we had come at the wrong time kudu and decided on another move this time our journey lasted ﬁve hours so that our relaying consumed three days we broke back through the ramparts by means of another pass we had discovered when looking kudu to the third bench again here we camped in the valley of lengeetoto this valley is one of the most beautiful and secluded in this part of africa it is shaped like an ellipse ﬁve or six miles long by about three miles wide and is completely surrounded by mountains the ramparts of the western forming the walls of the fourth in sheer rock cliffs forest crowned to the east from which direction we had just come were high rounded mountains at sunrise they cut clear in an outline of milky slate against the sky the ﬂoor of this ellipse was surfaced in gentle undulations like the low swells of summer sea between each swell singing clear brook leapt and dashed or loitered through its jungle into the mountains ran broad valleys of green grass and groves of great forest trees marched down cañons and out short distance the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https plains everything was fresh and green and cool we needed blankets at night and each morning the dew was cool and sparkling and the sky very blue under neath the forest trees of the stream beds and the cañon were leafy rooms small closet or great cathedral aisles and in the short brush dwelt rhinoceros and impalla in the jungles were buffalo and elephant on the plains we saw giraffe hartebees zebra duiker and in the bases of the hills we heard at evening and early morning the roaring of lions in this charming spot we lingered eight days memba sasa and i spent most of our time trying to get one of the buffalo without his getting us in this we were ﬁnally successful 26 then it was about time to return we moved back to boma on the narossara relaying usual the carrying of our effects at this time i had had to lay off three more men on account of various sorts of illness so was still more cramped transportation facilities we were breaking camp lioness leaped to her feet from where she had been lying under bush so near was it to camp that i had not my riﬂe ready she must have been lying there within two hundred yards of our tents watching all our activities we drew into boma little after two the man in charge of our tent did not put in an appearance until next day fortunately had an extra tent which he lent us we camped near the river just outside the edge of the river forest the big trees sent their branches out over us very far above while winding path led us to the banks of the river where was dingle like an inner room after dark we sat with at our little camp ﬁre it was all very skyful of tropical stars the silhouette of the forest shutting them out the velvet blackness of the jungle ﬂickering with ﬁreﬂies the purer outlines of the hilltops and distant mountains to the left the porters tiny ﬁres before the little white tents and in the distance from the direction of boma the irregular throb of the dance drum and the occasional snatch of barbaric singing borne down on the night wind from where his wakambas were holding an pair of ibis that had been ejected when we made camp contributed intermittent outraged and raucous squawks from the tiptop of some neighbouring tree footnotes 23 this is an interesting she reared to strike instead of springing 24 it must be remembered that this beast had the evening before killed pound hartebeeste with ease 25 the land of footprints 26 the land of footprints xxxix notes on the masai it is in way my intention to attempt comprehensive description of this uniqu people my personal observation is of course inadequate to that task and the numerous the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https on the subject are available to the interested reader the southern branch of the race among whom we were now travelling are very ﬁne physically men close to seven feet in height are not at all uncommon and the average is well above six they are strongly and lithely made their skins are or bronze generally brought to high state of polish by liberal anointing in feature they resemble more the egyptian or abyss inian than the negro cast of countenance the women are tall and well formed with proud quaintly quizzical faces their expressions and demeanour seem to indicate more independence and initiative than is usual with most savage women but whether this is actually so or not i can not say on this imposing and pleasing physical foundation your true masai is content to build very slight superstructure of ornament his are always stretched to hang down in long loops in which small medals ornaments decorated blocks of wood or the like are inserted long heavy ovals of ivory grooved to accommodate the ﬂesh loop very ﬁnely etched in decorative designs are occasionally worn stretchers around the neck is slender iron collar and on the arms are one or two glittering bracelets the sword belt is of leather heavily beaded with short dangling fringe of steel beads through this the short blade is thrust when in full dress the warrior further sports hollow iron knee bell connected with the belt by string of cowrie shells or beads often is added curious triangular strip of skin ﬁtting over the chest and reaching about to the waist robe or short cloak of sheepskin is sometimes carried warmth but not at all modesty the weapons are long heavy spear the buffalo hide shield the short sword and the war club or rungs the women are always wear voluminous robes of soft leather and carry great weight of heavy wire wound into anklets and stockings and brought to high state of polish so extensive are these decorations that they really form sort of armour with breaks only the elbow and the knee joints the married women wear also great outstanding collar the masai are pastoral and keep immense herds and ﬂocks therefore they inhabit the grazing countries and are nomadic their villages are invariably arranged in wide circle the low huts of mud and wattles facing inwards the spaces between the huts are ﬁlled in with thick dense thorn brush thus enclosing strong corral or boma these villages are called manyattas they are built by the women in an incredibly brief space of time indeed an overchief stopping two days at one place has been known to cause the construction of complete village to serve only that period he then moved on and the manyatta was never used again nevertheless these low rounded huts in shape like loaf of bread give ﬁctitious impression of great strength and permanency the smooth and hardened mud resembles masonry or concrete work matter of fact it is the thinnest sort of shell over plaited withies the single entrance to this compound may be closed by thorn bush so that at night when the lions are abroad the masai and all his herds dwell quite peaceably and safely inside the boma twelve to twenty huts constitute village when the grass is fed down the village moves to new location there is some regulation about this determined by the overchiefs so that one village does not interfere with another beside the few articles of value or of domestic use the only things carried away from an old village are the doors these are strapped along the ﬂanks of the donkeys while the other goods rest between donk ey pack masai fashion is marvellous af fair that would not stay on ten minutes white man the masai perform agriculture whatever nor will they eat game meat they have desire whatever any of the white man provisions except sugar in fact their sole habitual diet is mixed cow blood and fruits vegetables grains rarely ﬂesh striking commentary on extreme vegetarian claims the blood they obtain by shooting very arrow into the neck vein of the cow after the requisite amount has been drained the wound is closed and the animal turned into the herd to recuperate the blood and milk are then shaken together in long gourds certainly the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https seems to thrive on this strange diet only rarely on ceremonial occasions or when transportation is difﬁcult they eat mutton or goat ﬂesh but never beef of labour then about masai village it follows that there is practically none the women build the manyattas there is cooking tilling of the soil searching wild fruits the herd have to be watched by day and driven in at the fall of night that is the task of the boys and the youths who have not gone through with the quadriennial circumcision ceremonies and become or warriors therefore the grown men are absolutely and completely gentlemen of leisure in civilization the less men the more important they are inclined to think themselves it is so here socially the masai consider themselves several cuts above anybody else in the country social superiority lies mostly in thinking so hard that the inner belief expresses itself in the outward attitude and masai carry it off their haughtiness is magniﬁcent also they can look unsmiling and bored anybody anywhere consequently they are either greatly admired or greatly hated and feared the case happens to be by all the other tribes the kikuyu young men frankly ape the customs and ornaments of their powerful neighbours even the british government treats them very gingerly indeed and allows these economically useless savages latitude the more agricultural tribes not enjoy yet i submit that any people whose property is in immense herds can more easily be brought to terms than those who have nothing so valuable to lose matter of fact the white man and the masai have never had it out when the english few years since were engaged in opening the country they carried on quite stoutly contested little war with the wakamba these people put up so good ﬁght that the english anticipated most bitter struggle with the masai whose territory lay next beyond to their surprise the masai made peace we have watched the war with the wakamba they said in effect and we have seen the wakamba kill great many of your men but more of your men came in always and there were more wakamba to come in and take the places of those who were killed we are not afraid if we should war with you we would undoubtedly kill great many of you and you would undoubtedly kill great many of us but there can be use in that we want the ranges our cattle you want road let us then agree the result is that the masai look upon themselves an unconquered people and bear towar ds the other tribes the shrewd common sense and observation evidenced above must have convinced them that war now would be hopeless this acute intelligence is not at all incompatible with the rather bigoted and narrow outlook on life inevitable to people whose ideals are made up of fancied superiorities over the rest of mankind witness the feudal aristocracies of the middle ages with this type the underlying theory of masculine activity is the military some outlet energy was needed and in war it was found even the ordinary necessities of primitive agriculture and of the chase were lacking the masai ate neither vegetable grain nor wild game his whole young manhood then could be spent in better occupa tion than the pursuit of warlike cows on this rested the peculiar social structure of the people in perusing the following fragmentary account the reader must ﬁrst of all divest his mind of what he would according to white man standards consider moral or immoral such things must be viewed from the standpoint of the people believing in them the masai are moral in the sense that they very rigorously live up to their own customs and creeds their women are strictly chaste in the sense that they conduct affairs outside those permitted within the tribe doubt from the masai point of view we are ourselves immoral the small boy soon he is big enough to be that is very early in given in company with others charge of ﬂock of sheep thence he graduates to the precious herds of cows he wears little or nothing is armed with throwing club long stick or perhaps later spear of pattern peculiar the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https and young men his life is thus over the free open hills and veld until somewhere between the ages of eighteen and the year of the circumcision comes then he enters on the long ceremonies that initiate him into the warrior class my knowledge of the details of this subject is limited while i had the luck to be in masailand on the fourth year such things are not exhibited freely the curious reader can ﬁnd more on the subject in other books but this is conﬁned to personal experiences i will tell only what i have myself elicited the youth shaved head is allowed to grow its hair he hangs around his brow dangling string of bird skins stuffed out in the shape of little cylinders so that at short distance they look like curls something like month of probation he wears these then under goes the rite ten days thereafter he and his companions their heads daubed with clay and ashes clad in long black robes live out in the brush they have provision but are privileged to steal what they need at the end of the ten days they return to the manyattas or dance now completes their transformation to the class it ﬁnishes by an obscene night dance in the course of which the new warriors select their partners ten or twelve years these young men are they dwell in separate manyatta with them dwell promiscuously all the young unmarried women of the tribe there is permanent pairing off individual property marriage nor does this constitute ﬂagrant immorality difﬁcult it may be us to see that fact the institution like all national institutions must have had its origin in very real need and very practical expediency the ﬁghting strength of the tribe must be kept up and by the young and vigorous stock on the other hand every man of military age must be foot free to serve in the constant wars and forays this institution is the means and mind you unchastity in the form of illicit intercourse outside the manyatta of the whether with her own or another tribe subjects the women to instant death the in full ﬁghting rig are imposing they are i have explained tall and of ﬁne physique the cherished and prized weapon is the long spear this is ﬁve and six feet long with blade over three feet by many inches and with long iron shoe in fact only bare of wood is provided it is of formidable weight but so well balanced that ﬂip cast with the wrist will drive it clear through an enemy short sword and war club complete the offensive weapons the shield is of buffalo hide oval in shape and decorated with genuine heraldry based on genealogy circlet of black ostrich feathers in some branches surrounds the face and stands high above the head in the southern districts the warriors wear two single black ostrich plumes tied one either side the head and slanting little backwards they walk with mincing step so that the two feathers bob gently up and down like the waving of the circus equestrienne ﬁlmy skirts naturally the masai with the zulu were the most dreaded of all the tribes of africa they were constantly raiding in all directions far their sphere of operations could reach capturing cattle and women the prizes of war now that the white man has put stop to the ferocious intertribal wars the are out of job the military organization is still carried on before what will happen to the morals of the people it would be difﬁcult to say the twelve years of imposed peace have not been long enough seriously to deteriorate the people but inevitabl y complete idleness will tell either the people must change their ideals and become is extremely they will degenerate passing thought it is curious and formidable fact that the prohibition of intertribal wars and forays all through east central africa had already permitted the population to increase to point of discomfort many of the districts are becoming so crowded to overﬂow what will happen in the long run only time can are weakening things while war at least hardens nation ﬁbre this is not necessarily an argument war only everywhere in the world the white man seems with the best of intentions to the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https natural balances without substituting anything them we are better at preventing things than causing them at the age of thirty or thereabout the becomes an elder he may now drink and smoke vices that in the spartan days of his military service were rigorously denied him he may also take wife or wives according to his means and keep herds of cattle his wives he purchases from their parents the usual medium of payment being cows or sheep the young women who have been living in the village are considered quite desirable the young virgins if there are children these are taken over by the husband they are considered rather recommendation than detriment they prove the girl is fruitful relieved of all responsibility the rrior now has full leisure to be gentleman he drinks fermented liquor made from milk he takes snuff or smokes the rank native tobacco he conducts interminable diplomatic negotiations he oversees minutely the forms of ceremonials he helps to shape the policies of his manyatta and he gives his attention to the accumulation of cows the cow is the one thing that arouses the masai full energies he will undertake any journey any task any danger provided the reward therefor is horned cattle and cow is the one thing he will on account trade sell destroy very few of them he milks and very few of them he periodically bleeds but the majority to the numbers of thousands upon thousands live uselessly until they die of old age they are branded generally on the ﬂanks or ribs with strange large brands and are so constantly handled that they are tamer and more gentle than sheep i have seen upwards of thousand head in sole charge of two old women on foot these ancie nt dames drove the beasts in long ﬁle to water then turned them quite easily and drove them back again opposite our camp they halted their charges and came to make us long visit the cattle stood in their tracks until the call was over not one of fered even to stray of f the baked earth in search of grasses the masai cattle king knows his property individually each beast has its name some of the wealthier are worth in cattle at settler prices close to hundred thousand dollars they are men of importance in their own council huts but they lack many things dear to the savage heart simply because they are unwilling to part with single head of stock in order to procure them in the old days forays and raids tended more or less to keep the stock down since the white man peace the herds are increasing in the country between the mau escarpment and the narossara mountains we found the feed eaten down to the earth two months before the next rainy season in the meantime the few settlers are hard put to it to buy cattle at any price wherewith to stock their new farms the situation is an anomaly which probably can not continue some check will have eventually to be devised either limiting the cattle or compelling an equitable sale of the surplus certainly the present situation represents sad economic the energies of ﬁne race destined to rust away and of the lives of tens of thousands of valuable beasts brought into existence only to die of old age if these matchless herders and cattle breeders could be brought into relation with the world markets everybody would be the better besides his sacred cattle the masai raises also lesser herds of the hairy sheep of the country these he used himself only on the rare occasions of solitary forced marches away from his herds or at the times of ceremony their real use is trading more cattle certain white men and somalis conduct regular trading expeditions into masailand bringing in small herds of cows bought with trade goods from the other tribes these they barter with the masai sheep in masai estimation cow is the most valuable thing on earth while sheep is only medium of exchange with such notions it is easy to see that the white man can make an advantageous exchange in spite of the masai shrewdness at bargain each side is satisﬁed there remain s only to ﬁnd market the easy matter small herd of cows will in the long run bring quite decent the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https masai has very little use white man products he will trade squares of cloth beads of certain kinds and in limited quantity brass and iron wire of heavy gauge blankets and sugar that barring occasional personal idiosyncrasy is about all these things he will pay also in sheep masai curios are particularly difﬁcult to get hold of i rather like them their independence in that respect i certainly should refuse to sell my tennis shoes from my feet merely because some casual chinaman happened to admire them the women seem to occupy position quite satisfactory to themselves to be sure they the work but there is not much work they appear to be well treated at least they are always in good spirits laughing and joking with each other and always ready with quick repartee to remarks ﬂung at them by the safari boys they visited camp freely and would sit down good lively afternoon of joking their expressions were quizzical with shy intelligent humour in spite of the apparent unabashed freedom of their deportment they always behaved with the utmost circumspection nor did our boys ever attempt any familiarity the unobtrusive lounging presence in the background of two warriors with long spears may have had something to with this the masai government is centred in an overlord or king his orders seemed to be implicitly obeyed the present king i not know the old king lenani had just died at an advanced age in former days the traveller on entering masailand was met by chief this man planted his long spear upright in the ground and the intending traveller ﬂung over it coils of the heavy wire very generous traveller who completely covered the spear then had more trouble one less lavish was likely to be held up further impositions he penetrated the country this tax was called the honga the masai language is one of the most difﬁcult of all the native tongues in fact the white man is almost completely unable even to pronounce many of the words who is who knows them intim ately and who possesses their conﬁde nce does not pretend to talk with them in their own tongue but employs the universal swahili xl through the enchanted forest we delayed at boma three days waiting to turn up he maintained little force of wakamba the masai would not take service the wakamba are hunting tribe using both the spear and the poisoned arrow to kill their game their bows are short and powerful and the arrows exceedingly well fashioned the poison is made from the wood of certain fat tree with fruit like gigantic bologna sausages it is cut ﬁne boile d and the product evaporated away until only black sticky substance remains into this the point of the arrow is dipped and the head is then protected until required by narrow strip of buckskin wound around and around it i have never witnessed the effects of this poison but told he had seen an eland die in minutes from so slight wound in the shoulder that it ran barely hundred yards before stopping the poison more or less loses its efﬁciency however after the sticky tarlike substance has dried out i offered prize an archery competition i was curious to get view of their marksmanship the was piece of typewriter paper at thirty paces 27 this they managed to puncture only once out of ﬁfteen tries though they never missed it very widely seemed quite put out at this poor showing so i suppose they can ordinarily better but i imagine they are good deal like our hunting shots but very skilful at stalking close to beast our missing porter with the tent was brought in next afternoon by kongoni who had gone in search of him the man was big strong kavirondo he was sullen and the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https that he was tired this excuse ﬁve hours march after eight days rest i ﬁned him eight rupees which i gave kongoni and ordered him lashes six weeks later he did the same trick allotted him ﬁfty lashes and had him led thereafter by short rope around the neck he was probably addicted to opium this was the only man to be formally kibokoed on the whole good testimony at once to management the discrimination we had used in picking them out and the settled reputations we had by now acquired after return we prepared to penetrate straight back through the great rampart of mountains to the south and west we crossed the plains and entered gently rising long cañon ﬂanked on either side by towering ranges that grew higher and higher the farther we proceeded in the very centre of the mountains apparently this cañon ended in small round valley there appeared to be possible exit save by the way we had come or over the almost perpendicular ridges thousand feet or more above nevertheless we discovered narrow ravine that slanted up into the hills to the left following it we found ourselves very shortly in great forest on the side of mountain hanging creepers brushed our faces tangled vines hung across our view strange and unexpected openings offered themselves means through which we could see little closer into the heart of mystery the air was cool and damp and dark the occasional shafts of sunlight or glimpses of blue sky served merely to accentuate the soft gloom save that we climbed always we could not tell where we were going the ascent occupied little over an hour then through the tree trunks and under growth we caught the of the crest when we topped this we took breath and prepared ourselves corresponding descent but in hundred yards we popped out of the forest to ﬁnd ourselves on new level the fourth bench had been attained it was grass country of many low rounded hills and dipping valleys with ﬁne isolated oaklike trees here and there in the depressions and compact beautiful oaklike groves thrown over the hills like blankets green trim intimate it should have had church spires and gray roofs in appropriate spots it was refreshment to the eye after the great and austere spaces among which we had been dwelling repose to the spirit after the alert and dangerous lands the forest seemed fancifully an enchantment through which we had gained to this remote smiling land nearest of all to the blue sky we continued south two days and then the narrative will show were forced to return we found it always the same type pleasant sleepy little valleys winding around and between low hills crowned with soft groves and forests it was all the world like northern surrey or like some of the live oak country of california only this we soon discovered in spite of the enchantment of the forest the uppe r benches too were subject to the spell that lies over all africa these apparently little valleys were in reality the matter of an hour journey to cross these rounded hills to all seeming only two good golf strokes from bottom to top were matters of serious climbing these compact squared groves of oaklike trees were actually great forests of giants in which one could lose one self days in which roamed herds of elephant and buffalo it looked compact because we could see all its constituent elements matter of fact it was neat and tidy only we were usual too small it at the end of two hours fast marching we had made the distance say from the clubhouse to the second hole then we camped in genuinely little grove of really small trees overlooking green valley bordered with wooded hills the prospect was indescribably delightful sort of landscape of groves and green grass and feeling of church bells only down the valley diminished by distance all afternoon masai warriors in twos and threes trooped by mincing along so that their own ostrich feathers would bob up and down their spears held the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https began to realize that we were indeed in new country when our noon thermometer registered only 66 degrees and when at sunrise the following morning it stood at 44 degrees to us after eight months under the equator this was bitter weather footnotes 27 eight by ten and half inches xli naiokotuku next morning we marched on up the beautiful valley through shoulder grasses wet with dew at the end of two hours we came to the limit of leyeye knowledge of the country it would now be necessary to ﬁnd savage guides accordingly while we made camp with leyeye interpreter departed in search of masai village so tall and rank grew the grass that we had to clear it out one would clear brushwood in order to make room our tents several hours later returned he had found very large village but unfortun ately the savages were engaged in big which could not be interrupted by mere business however the chief was coming to make friendly call when the should be ﬁnished he would be delighted to furnish us with anything we might desire almost on the heels of this the chief arrived he was ﬁne old savage over six feet tall of well proportioned ﬁgure and with shrewd intelligent face the had him to limited extent he stumbled over tent ropes smiled bit uncertainly and slumped down rather suddenly when he had meant to sit however he stumbled smiled and slumped with unassailable dignity from beneath his goatskin robe he produced long ornamented gourd from which he offered us drink of fermented milk he took our refusal the gourd must have held gallon but he got away with all of its contents in the course of the interview also several pints of super coffee which we doled out to him little at time and which he seemed to appreciate extravagantly through leyeye we exchanged the compliments of the day and after the african custom told each other how important we were our visitor turned out to be none other than the brother of lenani the paramount chief of all the masai i forget what i was either the brother of king geor ge or the nephew of theodore only two white men every native has heard of it may be that both of us were mistaken but from his evident authority over very wide district we were inclined to believe our visitor we told him we wanted guides through the hills to the southward he promised them in most friendly fashion i not know the white man said he i live always in these mountains but my brother lenani told ten years ago that some day the white man would come into my country my brother told that when the white man came travelling in my country i must treat him well the white man is good friend but bad enemy i have remembered my brother lenani words though they were spoken long time ago the white man has been very long in coming but now he is here therefore i have brought you milk and i will send you sheep and later i will send young men who know the hills to take you where you wish to go the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https expressed gratiﬁcation and i presen ted him with marble ﬁsh knife the very thin blade and the ingenious manner in which the two halves of the handle folded forward over it pleased him immensely one but myself shall ever use this knife said he he had pockets but he tucked it away in his armpit clamped the muscles down over it and apparently forgot it at least he gave it further attention used his hands usual but retained it securely in pocket he promised at parting very early in the morning i will send my own son and another man to guide you and i will send sheep your meat we arose very early packed our few affairs picked out four sat down to wait our plan was to cruise ﬁve days with light and mobile an outﬁt possible and then to return fresh supplies billy would take charge of the main camp during our absence advisers we left her abba ali memba sasa and mohammed at noon we were still waiting the possibility of doing full day journey was gone but we thought we might at least make start at one just we had about given up hope the masai strolled in they were beautiful tall straight youths ﬁnely formed with proud features and most graceful carriage in colour they were though made of copper bronze with the same glitter of high lights from their skins even in this chilly climate they were nearly naked one carried spear the other bow and arrow joyously we sat down again we had provided an excellent supply of provisions our guides but on looking over the lot they discovered absolutely met their ideas what they want we asked leyeye in despair they say they will eat nothing but sheep he reported we remembered old naiokotuku promise of sending us sheep sneered cynica lly at the faith of savages and grimly set forth to see what we could buy in the surrounding country but we wronged the old man less than mile from camp we met men driving in presents not one but two sheep so we abandoned our shopping tour and returned to camp by the time one of the sheep had been made into mutton it was too late to start the masai showed symptoms of desiring to go back to the village the night this did not please us we called them up and began extravagantly to admire their weapons begging to examine them once we had them in our hands we craftily discoursed follows these are beautiful weapons the most beautiful we have ever seen since you are going so spend the night in our camp and since we greatly fear that some of our men might steal these beautiful weapons we will ourselves guard them you carefully from theft until morning so saying we deposited them inside the tent then we knew we had our masai safe they would never dream of leaving while the most cherished of their possessions were in hostage xlii scouting in the elephant forest the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https we were ﬁnally off at dawn it was very chilly wet dawn with the fog so thick that we could see not over ten feet ahead we had four porters carrying about pounds apiece of the bare necessiti es kongoni and leyeye the masai struck conﬁdently enough through the mist we crossed grass we were thoroughly hills through forest skirted apparently miles an immense reed swamp usual when travelling strange country in fog we experienced that queer feeling of remaining in the same spot while fragments of things are slowly paraded by when at length the sun power cleared the mists we found ourselves in the middle of forest country of high hills into this forest we now plunged threading our way here and there where the animal trails would take us looking always fresh elephant spoor it would have been quite impossible to have moved about in any other fashion the timber grew on hillsides and was very lofty and impressive and the tropical under growth grew tall rank and impenetrable we could proceed only by means of the kind assistance of the elephant the buffalo and the rhinoceros elephant spoor we found but none made later than three weeks before the trails were broad solid paths through the forest ancient and beaten though they had been in continuous use years unlike the rhino and buffalo trails they gave us head room and to spare the great creatures had by sheer might cut their way through the dense tough growth leaving twisted splintered wrecked jungle behind them but impediment by means of these beautiful trails we went quietly penetrating farther and farther into the jungle our little procession of ten made noise if we should strike fresh elephant tracks thus would we hunt them with all our worldly goods at our backs so that at night we could camp right on the trail the day passed almost without incident once wild crash and snort told of rhinoceros invisible but very close we huddled together our riﬂes ready uncertain whether or not the animal would burst from the leafy screen at our very faces the masai stood side by side the long spear poised the bow bent ﬁne tense ﬁgures in bronze near sundown we found ourselves by swift little stream in the bottom of deep ravine here we left the men to make camp and ourselves climbed big mountain on the other side it gave us look abroad over wilderness of hills forested heavily and glimpse of the landfall far away where white man had ever been this was far south we were destined to get though at the time we did not know it our plan was to push on two days more near the top of the ridge we found the unmistakable tracks of the bongo this is interesting to zoologists in that it extends the southward range of this rare and shy beast just at dark we regained our camp it was built california the ﬁrst and last time in africa blankets spread on canvas under the open sky and gipsy ﬁre at our feet over which i myself cooked our very simple meal we were smoking our pipes in sleepy content leyeye and the two masai appeared shauri said the masai we have taken you over the country we know there are elephants there sometimes but there are elephants there now we can take you farther and if you wish us to so we will so but we know more of the country than you but now if we return to the manyatta we can march two hours to where are some wanderobo and the wanderobo know this country and will take you through it if it pleases you one of us will go get the wanderobo and the other will stay with you to show good faith we rolled our eyes at each other in humorous despair here at the very beginning of the reconnaissance we had run against the stone wall of african indirect ness and procrastination and just we thought we had at last settled everything why we inquired were not the wanderobo sent at ﬁrst instead of yourselves the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https because they replied with truly engaging frankness our chief naiokotuku thought that perhaps we might ﬁnd elephant here in the country we know and then we should get ourselves all the presents you would give ﬁnding elephant but the elephant are not here now so the wanderobo will get part of the present that was certainly candid after some further talk we decided there was help it we must return to camp new start at this decision the masai brightened they volunteered to set off early with leyeye to push ahead of us rapidly and to have the wanderobo in camp by the time we reached there we concealed somewhat cynical smiles and agreed the early start was made but when we reached camp we found not the wanderobo but leyeye and the masai huddled over ﬁre this was exasperating but we could not say much after all the whole matter was right of ours but manifestation of friendship on the part of naiokotuku in the early afternoon the sky cleared and the ambassadors departed promising faithfully to be back before we slept we spent the day writing and in gazing at the vivid view of the hillsid the forest and the distant miniature prospect before us finally we discovered what made it in essence so strangely familiar in vividness and in the crudity of its was exactly like coloured photograph of course the savages did not return that evening nor did we really expect them just matter of form we packed up the next morning and sat down to wait shortly before noon leyeye and the masai returned bring ing with them two of the strange shy forest hunters but by this time we had talked things over thoroughly the lure of the greater kudu was regaining the strength it had lost by long series of disappointments we had not time left both thorough investigation of the forests and raid in the dry hills of the west after kudu mavrouki said he knew of place where that animal ranged so we had come to decision we called the masai and wanderobo before us they squatted in row their spears planted before them we sat in canvas chairs leyeye standing translated the affair was naturally of the greatest deliberation in the indirect african manner we began our shauri we asked one simple question at time dealing with one simple phase of the subject this phase we treated from several different points of view in order to be absolutely certain that it was understood to these questions we received replies in this manner yes the wanderobo told us they knew the forest they knew how to go about in the forest they understood how to ﬁnd their way in the forest they knew the elephant they had seen the elephant many times in the forest they knew where the elephant ranged in the so on through every piece of information we desired it is the usual and only sure way of questioning natives thus we learned that the elephant range extended south through the forests about seven days travel that at this time of year the beasts might be anywhere on that range this conﬁrmed our decision then said we to leyeye tell the masai that the bwana is most pleased with them and that he is pleased with the way they have worked him and that he is pleased with the presents they have brought him tell them that he has goods here with him but that he has sent men back to the boma of bwana kingozi 28 blankets and wire and cloth and when those men return he will make good present to these masai and to naiokotuku their chief tell the wanderobo that the bwana is pleased with them and that he thanks them coming so far to tell him of the elephant and that he believes they have told him the truth tell them the bwana will not ﬁght the elephant now because he has not the time but must go to attend to his affairs but later when two years have gone the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https make another safari and will come back to this country and will again ask these men to lead him out where he can ﬁght the elephant and in the meantime he will give them rupees with which to pay their hut tax to the government after various compliments the sitting rose then we packed up few hours march in short time we passed the chief village he came out to say copper bronze youth accompanied him lithe leopard my men have told your words said he i live always in these mountains and my young men will bring word when you return i am glad the white men have come to see i shall have the wanderobo ready to take you to ﬁght the elephant when you return he then instructed the young man to accompany us the purpose of bringing back the presents we had promised we shook hands in farewell and so parted from this friendly and powerful chief footnotes 28 native master with the red beard xliii the topi camp at the next camp we stayed nearly week the country was charming mountains surrounded the long ellipse near one edge of which we had pitched our tents the ellipse was some ten miles long by four or ﬁve wide and its surface rolled in easy billows to narrow neck at the lower end there we could just make out in the far distance conical hill partly closing the neck atop the hill was masai manyatta very tiny with indisti nct crawling red and brown blotches that meant cattle and sheep beyond the hill and through the opening in the ellipse we could see to another new country of hills and meadows and forest groves in this clear air they were microscopically distinct blue of atmosphere nor shimmer of heat blurred their outlines they were merely made small our camp was made in the open above tiny stream we saw wonderful sunrises and sunsets and always spread out before us was the sweep of our plains and the unbroken ramparts that hemmed us in from these mountains meandered small marked by narrow strips of trees and brush but the most of the valley was of high green grass occasional ant hills ten feet tall rose conical from the earth and the country was pleasingly broken and modelled so that one continually surmounted knolls low round ridges and the like of such conditions are surprises made the elevation here was some feet so that the nights were cold and the days not too warm our men did not fancy this change of weather good many of them came down with the fever always latent in their systems and others suf fered from bronchial colds at one time we had down sick eleven men out of our slender total however i believe in spite of these surface symptoms that the cold air did them good it certainly improved our own appetites and staying power in the thirty or forty square miles of our valley were many herds of varied game we here the ﬁrst time found neuman hartebeeste the type at narossara and even in lengetto was the common coke hartebeeste so that between these close ly the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https there interposes at this point only the barriers of climb and forest these animals and the zebra were the most plentiful of the game the zebra were brilliantly white and black with magniﬁcent coats thompson and roberts gazelles were here in considerable numbers eland roosevelt wildebeeste giraffe the smaller grass antelopes and fair number of topi in the hills we saw buffalo sign several cheetah and heard many lions it had been our ﬁrst plan that should return immediately to boma after supplies but in view of the abundance of game we decided to wait over day we much desired to get four topi and this seemed good chance to carry some of them out also we wished to decide certain whether or not the hartebeeste here was really of the neuman variety we had great luck over the very ﬁrst hill from camp we came upon herd of about dozen topi feeding on hill across the way i knocked down the ﬁrst one standi ng at just 250 paces the herd then split and broke to right and left by shooting very carefully and steadily i managed to kill three more before they were out of range the last shot was at 325 paces in all i ﬁred seven shots and hit six times this was the best shooting i did in anywhere is argument the springﬁeld and the high velocity bullet overjoyed at our luck in collecting these animals so promptly so near camp and at time so very propitious handling the trophies we set to the job of skinning and cutting up the men all came out from camp to carry in the meat they appeared grinning broadly they had had meat since leaving the narossara and i saw matters well under way and then went on to where i had seen cheetah the day before hardly were we out of sight when two lions sauntered over the hill and proceeded to appropriate the meat the two men in charge promptly withdrew moment later dozen porters on their way out from camp topped the hill and began to yell at the lions the latter then slowly and reluctantly retreated we were very sorry we had not stayed the valley seemed populated with lions but in general they were some reason strictly nocturnal by day they inhabited the fastnesses of the mountain ranges we never succeeded in tracing them in that large and labyrinthine country nor at any time could we induce them to come to kills either their natural prey was so abundant that they did not fancy food or what is more likely the cold nights prevented the odour of the carcasses from carrying far we heard lions every night and every morning we conscientiously turned out before daybreak to crawl up to our bait through the wet cold grass but with results that very night we were jerked from sound sleep by tremendous roar almost in camp so close was it that it seemed to each of us but just outside the tent we came up all standing the lion apparently was content with that practical joke he moved off quietly next morning we found where the tracks had led down to water not ten yards away we spent the rest of that day spying on the game herds it is fascinating work to lie belly down on tall ant hill glasses steadied by elbows picking out the individual animals and discussing them with good companion and i looked over several hundred hartebeeste trying to decide their identity we were neither of us familiar with the animal and had only recollections of the book distinctions finally i picked out one that seemed to present the most marked missed him clean at 280 yards then i took three shots at 180 yards to down second choice the poor shooting was gotten however in our determination that this was indeed neumanii vain hunt lions occupied all the next day the third morning started the boma leaving billy and to look abou t us we willed shortly after he had departed delegation of masai came in dressed in their best and bearing presents of milk leyeye was summoned interpreter the masai informed us that last night lion had leapt the thorn walls of their boma had pressed on through the ﬁres had seized steer and had dragged the the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https then the pursuit with spears and ﬁrebrands had become too hot him so that he had dropped his victim and retired they desired medicine the steer b magic to keep that lion away c that i should assist them in hunting the lion down i questioned them closely and soon discovered both that the lion must have been very bold and also that he had received pretty lively reception magic to keep him away seemed like safe enough proposition the chances were he would keep himself away therefore i ﬁlled quart measure with clear water passed my hand across its untroubled lo it turned clear bright pink exclamations of eigh eigh greeted this magic performed by means of permanganate crystals held between the ﬁngers with this bathe the wounds of your steer then sprinkle the remainder over your cattle the lion will not return said then reﬂecting that i was to be some time in the country and that the lion might get over his scare i added the power of this magic is three days they departed very much impressed little later memba sasa and i followed them the manyatta was most picturesquely placed atop the conical hill at the foot of the valley from its elevation we could see here and there in the distance the variegated blotches of red and white and black that represented the cattle herds innumerable ﬂocks of sheep and goats under charge of the small boys and youths fed nearer at hand the low huts with their abattis of thorn bush between crowned the peak like chaplet outside it sat number of elder s sunning themselves and several smiling natured young women probably the spoiled darlings of these plutocrats one of these damsels spake swahili so we managed to exchange compliments they told us exactly when and how the lion had gone three nimble old gentlemen accompanied us when we left they were armed with spears and they displayed the most extraordinary activity skipping here and there across the ravines and through the brush casting huge stones into likely cover and generally making themselves ubiquitous however we did not come up with the lion in our clinic that evening appeared one of the men claiming to suffer from rheumatism i suspected him and still suspect him of malingering in advance in order to get out of the hard work we must soon undertake but had means of proving my suspicion however i decided to administer asperin we possessed only the powdered form of the drug i dumped about ﬁve grains on his tongue and was about to proffer him the water with which to wash it he inhaled sharply i not know the precise effect of asperin in the windpipe but it is not pleasant the boy thought himself bewitched his eyes stuck out of his head he gasped painfully he sank to the ground he made desperate efforts to bolt out into the brush by main strength we restrained him and forced him to swallow the water little by little he recovered next night i missed him from the clinic and sent abba ali in search the man assured abba ali most vehemently that the medicine was wonderful that every trace of rheumatism had departed that he never felt better in his life and that important point he was perfectly able to carry load on the morrow xliv the unknown land returned the next day from boma bringing more potio and some trade goods we sent good present back to naiokotuku and prepared an early start into the new country the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https marched out of the lower end of our elliptical valley towards the miniature landscape we had seen through the opening but before we reached it we climbed sharp to the right around the end of the mountains made our way through low pass and so found ourselves in new country entirely the smooth undulating plains were now superseded by lava expanses grown with low bushes it was almost exactly like the brush deserts of arizona and new same coarse sand and lava footing the same deeply eroded barrancas the same scattered round bushes dotted evenly over the scene we saw here very little game across the way lay another range of low mountains clothed darkly with dull green like the coast ranges of california in one place was gunsight pass through which we could see other distant blue mountains we crossed the arid plain and toiled up through the notch pass the latter made very difﬁcult footing indeed the entire surface of the ground was covered with smooth slippery boulders and rocks of iron and quartz what had so smoothed them i not know they seemed to be water erosion the boys with their packs atop found this hard going and we ourselves slipped and slid and bumped in spite of our caution once through the pass we found ourselves overlooking wide prospect of undulating thorn scrub from which rose occasional bushy hills solitary buttes and bold cliffs it was country to make way through nevertheless somewhere here dwelt the kudu so in we plunged the rest of the and of days to spent in picking way through the thorn scrub and over loose rocks and shifting stones stream bed contained an occasional water hole tall aloes were ablaze with red ﬂowers the country looked arid the air felt dry the atmosphere was so clear that day journey seeme the matter of few hours only rarely did we enjoy few moments of open travel most of the time the thorns caught at us in the mountain passes were sometimes broad trails of game or of the masai cattle the country was harsh and dry and beautiful with the grays and dull greens of brush or with the soft atmospheric tints of distances game was fairly common but rather difﬁcult to ﬁnd there were many buffalo very few zebra leopards hyenas plenty of impalla some few eland abundant thompson gazelle and duiker we never lacked meat when we dared shoot it but we were after nobler game the sheep given us by naiokotuku followed along under char ge of the syces when we should run quite out of meat we intended to eat them we delayed too long however one evening the fool boy tied them to thorn bush one of them pulled back the thorns bit and both broke loose and departed into the darkness of course everybody pursued but we could not recapture them ten minutes later the hyenas broke into the most unholy laughter we could not blame them the joke was certainly on us in passing the cachinnations of the laughing hyena are rather series of iced conscious titters than laughter they sound like the stage idea of lot of silly and rather embarrassed old maids who have been accused by some rude man of taking notice this call is rarely used indeed i never heard it but the once the usual note is sort of moaning howl impossible to describe but easy to recognize thus we penetrated gradually deeper and deeper into this wild country through low mountains over plains into thorn jungles down wide valleys over divided plateaus late in the afternoon we would make camp sometimes we had good water more often not in the evening the throb of distant drums and snatches of intermittent wailing song rose and fell with the little night breezes xl the the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https last camp before turning back we pitched about two one afternoon up to this time we had marched steadily down wide valleys around the end of mountain ranges moving from one room to the other of this plateau at last we ended on slope that descended gently to water it was grown sparingly with thorn trees among which we raised our tents over against us and across several low swells of grass and hills was range of mountains here mavrouki claimed dwelt roan antelope we settled down quite happily the country round about was full of game the weather was cool the wide sweeps of country the upward ﬂing of mountains and buttes were much like some parts of our great west almost every evening the thunderstorms made gorgeous piled effects in the distance at night the lions and hyenas roared or howled and some of the tiny fever owls impudently answered them back various adventures came our way some of which have been elsewhere narrated here we killed the very big buffalo that nearly got billy 29 in addition we collected two more specimens of the neuman hartebeeste and two chanler reed buck but mavrouki glowing predictions to roan were hardly borne out by facts according to him the mountains simply swarmed with had seen in one day etc of course we had discounted this but some old tracks had to certain extent borne out his statement lunch time one day however found us on top of the highest ridge here we hunted up bit of shade and spent two hours out of the noon sun while we lay there the sky slowly overcast so that when we aroused ourselves to go on the dazzling light had softened time was getting short we decided to separate memba sasa and mavrouki were to go in one direction while kongoni and i took the other before we started i remarked that i was of fering two rupees the capture of roan we had not gone ten minutes when kongoni turned his head cautiously and grinned back at us my rupees said he ﬁne buck roan stood motionless beneath tree in the valley below us he was on the other side of the stream jungle and nearly mile away while we watched him he lay down our task now was to gain the shelter of the stream jungle below without being seen to slip along it until opposite the roan and then to penetrate the jungle near enoug h to get shot the ﬁrst part of this contract seemed to us the most difﬁcult we were forced to descend the face of the hill like ﬂies crawling down blackboard plain him to see we slid cautiously from bush to bush we moved by imperceptible inches across the numerous open spaces about down we were arrested by violent snort ahead fifteen or twenty zebras nooning in the brush where zebras were supposed to be clattered down the hill like an avalanche we froze where we were the beasts ran ﬁfty yards then wheeled and started back up the hill trying to make us out twenty minutes all parties to the transaction remained stock still the zebras staring we hoping fervently they would decide to go down the valley and not up it the roan dozing under his distant tree by luck our hopes were fulﬁlled the zebra turned downstream walking sedately away in single ﬁle when we were certain they had all quite gone we resumed our painful descent at length we dropped below the screen of trees and could stand upright and straighten the kinks out of our backs but now new complication arose the wind which had the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https very basis of our calculations commenced to chop and veer here it blew from one quarter up there on the side hill from another and through the bushes in quite another direction still then without warning they would all shift about we watched the tops of the grasses through our binoculars hoping to read some logic into the condition it was now four stalk had thus far consumed two the roan must soon begin to feed if we were going to anything we must it soon therefore we crept through very spiky noisy jungle to its other edge sneaked along the edge until we could make out the tree and raised ourselves look through the glass i could just make out the roan face stripe he was still there quite encouraged i instantly dropped down and crawled to within range when again i raised my head the roan had disappeared one of these aggravating little side puffs of breeze had destroyed our two hours work the outlook was not particularly encouraging we had means of telling how far the animal would go nor into what sort of country and the hour was well advanced toward sunset however we took up the track and proceeded to follow it well we could that was not easy the ground was hard and stony suddenly threw himself ﬂat of course we followed his example to us he whispered that he thought he had caught glimpse of the animal through an opening and across the stream bed we stalked carefully and found ourselves in the middle of small herd of topis one of which half concealed in the brush had deceived this consumed valuable time when again we had picked up the spoor it was agreed that i was to ahead rapidly i could while and kongoni would puzzle out the tracks far possible before dark therefore i climbed the little rocky ridge on our left and walked along near its crest keeping sharp lookout over the valley one would hunt august bucks in california after two or three hundred yards i chanced on short strip of soft earth in which the fresh tracks of the roan going uphill were clearly imprinted i could not without making too much noise inform the others that i had cut in ahead of them so i followed the tracks cautiously and quietly i could on the very top of the hill the roan leapt from cover ﬁfty yards away and with clatter of rocks dashed off down the ridge the grass was very high and i could see only his head and horns but i dropped the front sight six inches and let drive at guess the guess happened to be good one he turned somersault yards away and kongoni came up the sun had just set in ﬁfteen minutes it would be pitch dark we dispatched kongoni help and lanterns and turned to on the job of building signal ﬁre and skinning the trophy the reason our strangely chopping wind now became apparent from our elevation we could see piled thunder looming up from the west they were spreading upward and outward in the swift rushing manner of tropic storms and i saw i must hustle if i was to get my ﬁre going at all the ﬁrst little blaze was easy and after that i had to pile on quantities of any wood i could lay my hands to the deluge blotted out every vestige of daylight and nearly drowned out my ﬁre i had started to help with the roan but soon found that i had my own job cut out and so went back to nursing my blaze the water descended in sheets we were immediately soaked through and very cold the surface of the ground was steep and covered with loose round rocks and in my continuous trips ﬁrewood i stumbled and slipped and ran into thorns miserably 30 after long interval of this the lantern s came bobbing through the darkness and few moments later the dim light revealed the shining faces of our men we wasted time in the distribution of burdens with one of the lanterns brought up the rear while i with the other went on ahead now kongoni had but this minute completed the round trip to camp we concluded that he would be the best one to give us lead this was mistake he took us out of the hills well enough and good job that was we could not see the length of our the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https the thick rainy blackness and we had to go entirely by the slants of the country but once in the more open sloping country with its innumerable bushy or wooded ravines he began to stray i felt this from the ﬁrst but kongoni insisted strongly he was right and in the rain and darkness we had way of proving him wrong in fact i had reason thinking him wrong i only felt it this sense of direction is apparently ﬁfth wheel or extra adjustment some people happen to possess it has nothing to with acquired knowledge is very well proved by the fact that in my own case it acts only long i not think about it soon i begin consciously to consider the matter i am likely to go wrong thus many many times i have in the dark over ground i had traversed but once before and have caught myself turning out bushes or trees i could not see but which my subconscious memory recalled this would happen only when i would think of something besides the way home soon i took charge i groped badly the next man it is curious and sometimes valuable extra but by means to be depended upon now however i was following kongoni this faculty had full play and it assured vehemently that we were wrong i called up from the rear consultation kongoni was very positive he was right but we had now been walking over an hour and camp should not have been more than three miles from where we had killed the roan we were inclined towards my instinct so we took the compass direction in order to assure consistency at least and struck of f at full right angles to the left so we tramped long time every few moments kongoni would want another look at that compass it happened that we were now going due north and his notion was that the needle pointed the way to camp we profoundly hoped that his faith in white man magic would not be shattered at the end of an hour the rain let up and it cleared sufﬁciently to disclose some of the mountain outlines they convinced us that we were in the main right though just where to the north camp now lay was beyond our power to determine kongoni detour had been rather indeterminate in direction and distance the country now became very rough in small way the feeble light of our leading lantern revealed only ghosts and phantoms and looming warning suggestions of things which the shadows confused and shifted heavily laden men would have found it difﬁcult travelling by prosaic daylight but now with the added impossibility of picking route ahead we found ourselves in all sorts of trouble many times we had to back out and try again the ghostly ﬂickering tree shapes against the fathomless black offered us apparently endless aisles that nevertheless closed before us like the doors of trap when we attempted to enter them we kept doggedly to the same general northerly direction when you are lost nothing is more foolish than to make up your mind hastily and without due reﬂection and nothing is more foolish than to change your mind once you have made it up that way vacillation confusion and disaster lie should you decide after due consideration of all the elements of the problem that you should go east then east you go and nothing must turn you you may get to the atlantic ocean if nothing else and if you begin to modify your original plan then you begin to circle believe i know kongoni was plainly sceptical and said so until i shut him up with some rather peremptory sarcasm the bearers who had to stumble in the dark under heavy burdens were and joking this we appreciated one can never tell whether or not he is popular with native until he and the native are caught in dangerous or disagreeable ﬁx we walked two hours in treadmill then that invaluable though erratic sixth sense of mine awoke i stopped short i believe we come far enough i shouted back to and ﬁred my riﬂe we received an almost immediate answer from short distance to the left not over two hundred yards in that direction we met our camp men bearing torches and so the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https in triumph after day footnotes 29 the land of footprints 30 six months after i had reached home one of these thorns worked its way out of the calf of my leg xl vi the grea ter kudu next morning in joking manner i tried to impress kongoni with sense of delinquency in not knowing better his directions especially he had twice traversed the route he declined to be impressed it is not the business of man to walk at night he replied with dignity and when you stop to think of it it certainly is africa at this camp we lingered several days the great prize of our journeying was still lacking and to tell the truth we had about given up hope if not our efforts almost we had begun to believe our friends in nairobi who had scoffed at the uselessness of our quest always we conscientiously looked over good kudu country hundreds of miles of it and always with the same lack of result or even of encouragement other game we saw in plenty of dozen different varie ties large and small but our ﬁve week s search had thus far yielded us only the sight of the same old old sign made many months before if you had stood with us atop one of the mountains and with us had looked abroad on the countless leagues of rolling land undulating away in all directions over far horizon you must with us have estimated very slight the chances of happening on the exact pin point where the kudu at that moment happen ed to be feeding the beast is shy it inhabits the densest closest mountain cover it possesses the keen eyesight and sense of smell of the deer and antelope and more than the average sense of hearing there are very few of him but the chief discouragement is that arising from his roaming tendencies other rare animals are apt to use about one locality so that once the hunter ﬁnds tracks new or old his game is one of patient skilful search the greater kudu however seems in this country at least to be wanderer he is here and gone systematic search seems foolish in the case of the proverbial needle in the haystack the only method is to sift constantly and trust to luck one can not catch ﬁsh with the ﬂy in the book but one has at least chance if one keeps it on the water mavrouki was the only one among us who had the living faith that comes from having seen the animal in the ﬂesh that is curious bit of hunter psychology when man is out after species new to him it is only by the utmost stretch of the imagination that he is able to realize that such an animal can exist at all he can not preﬁgure it somehow he generally exaggerates to himself the difﬁculty of making it out of approaching it of getting his shot until at last if he happens to have hunted some time in vain the beast becomes almost mythical and unbelievable once he has seen the animal wheth er he gets shot or not all this vanishes the strain on faith relaxes he knows what to look and what to expect and even if he sees other specimen month he nevertheless goes about the business with certain the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https afternoon we had been hunting carefully certain low mountains and were headed camp walking rather carelessly along the bed of narrow open valley below the covered side hills the sun had disappeared behind the ranges and the dusk of evening was just beginning to rise like mist from the deeps of the cañons we had ceased was time to hurry happened not to be talking only because we were tired by sheerest idle luck i chanced to look up to the densely covered face of the mountain across single tiny opening in the tall brush ﬁve or six hundred yards away i caught movement still idly i lifted my glasses look at what i thought would prove the usual impalla or and was just in time to catch the spirals of magniﬁcent set of horns it was the greater kudu at last i gave little cluck of caution and instantly without question after the african fashion the three men ahead of sank to the ground looked at inquiringly i motioned with my eyes he raised his glasses one look that the fellow he said quietly the kudu though he had merely stepped into the opening to give us sight of him melted into the brush it was magniﬁcent and exciting to have seen this wonderful beast after so long quest but by the same token it was not very encouraging all that if we had had all the daylight we needed and unlimited time it would have been quite feat to stalk the wary beast in that thick noisy cover now it was almost dark and would be quite dark within the the kudu had moved out of sight whether he had gone on some distance or whether he still lingered near the edge of the tiny opening was another matter to be determined and to be determined quickly leaving kongoni and mavrouki and i wriggled pantingly up the hill fast and at the same time cautiously we could at the edge of the opening we came to halt belly down and began eagerly to scrutinize the brush across the way if the kudu still lingered we had to ﬁnd it out before we ventured out of cover to take up his trail inch by inch we scrutinized every possible concealment finally breathed sharp with satisfaction he had caught sight of the tip of one horn with some difﬁculty he indicated to where after staring long enough we could dimly make out the kudu himself browsing from the tender all we could was to lie low if the kudu fed on out of sight into the cover we could not possibly get shot if he should happen again to cross the opening we would get good shot one but hunter can understand the panting excitement of those minutes ﬁve weeks hard work hung in the balance the kudu did neither of these things he ceased browsing took three steps forward and stood the game seemed blocked the kudu had evidently settled down snooze it was impossible in the situation to shorten the distance without being discovered the daylight was almost gone we could make out trace of him except through our glasses look hard we could we could see nothing with the naked eye unless something happened within the next two minutes we would bring nothing into camp but the memory of magniﬁcent beast and next day he would probably be inextricably lost in the wilderness of mountains 31 it was time desperate measures and to evident doubtful anxiety i took them through the glasses the mane of the kudu showed dim gray streak carefully i picked out two twigs on bush ﬁfteen feet from and tuft of grass ten yards on all of which were in line with where the shoulder of the kudu ought to be then i lowered my glasses the gray streak of the kudu mane had disappeared in the blending twilight but i could still see the tips of the twigs and the tuft of grass very carefully i aligned the sights with these and with silent prayer to the red gods loosed the bullet into the darkness at the crack of the riﬂe the kudu leapt into plain the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https hit rasped in great excitement i did not wait to verify this but ﬁred four times more fast i could work the bolt

lens steadied the camera and gave it the result was fairly good so much high grade lens we sent kongoni into camp help and ourselves proceeded to build up the usual ﬁre signal and protection against wild beasts then we sat down to enjoy the evening while mavrouki skinned the kudu we looked abroad over wide stretch of country successive low ridges crossed our front each of different shade of slate gray from its neighbours and gray luminous mist ﬁlled the valley between them the edge of the world was thrown sharp against burnished copper after time the moon rose memba sasa arrived before the lanterns out of breath his face streaming with perspiration poor memba sasa this was almost the only day he had not followed close at my heels and on this day we had captured the great prize thought of that seemed to affect the heartiness of his joy he rushed up to shake both my hands he examined the kudu with an attention that was held only by great restraint he let go that restrain to shake again enthusiastically by the hands after him up the hill bobbed slowly the lanterns the smiling bearers shouldered the trophy and the meat and we stumbled home through the half shadows and the opalescences of the moonlight our task in this part of the country was now ﬁnished we set out on the return journey the weather changed beautiful sunset was followed by drizzle by morning this had turned into heavy rain we left the topi camp to which we had by now returned cold and miserable and i had contributed our waterproofs to protect the precious trophies and we were speedily wet through the grass was long this was warm and grateful tropical rain but driving chilling storm straight out from the high mountains we marched up the long plain we turned to the left around the base of the ranges we mounted the narrow grass valley we entered the dark dripp ing and unfriendly forest over the edge we dropped and clambered down through the hanging vines and the sombre trees we emer ged on the open plains below the plains on the hither side of the narossara the africa we had known so long the rain ceased it was almost though magic portal had clicked after us behind it lay the wonderful secret upper country of the unknown xl the project gutenberg ebook of african camp fires by stewart edward white https last trek some weeks later we camped high on the slopes of suswa the great mountain of the rift valley only one day march from the railroad after the capture of the kudu africa still held us various buffalo go of fever and the the culmination had been reached we had lingered until the latest moment reluctant to go now in the gray dawn we were ﬁling down the slopes of the mountains the last trek low ﬂowing mist marked the distant kedong the ﬂames of an african sunrise were revelling in the eastern skies all our old friends seemed to be bidding us around the shoulder of the mountains lion roared rumble upon rumble two hyenas leapt from the grass ran ﬁfty yards and turned to look at us simba ﬁce we cried to them sadly little farther we saw zebra and the hartebeeste and the gazelles one by one appeared and disappeared again the beasts with which we had grown so familiar during our long months in the jungle so remarkable was the number of species that we both began to comment upon the fact to greet the animals to bid them farewell though they were reporting in order from the jungle to bid us half in earnest we waved our hands to them and shouted our greetings to them in the milia kongoni ﬁce twiga simba and the rest before our eyes the misty ranges hardened and stiffened under the ﬁerce sun our men marched steadily cheerfully beating their loads in rhythm with their safari sticks crooning under their breaths and occasionally breaking into chant they were glad to be back from the long safari back from across the thirst from the high cold country from the dangers and discomforts of the unknown we rode little wistfully these great plains and mysterious jungles these populous dangerous nights these ﬂaming splendid dawnings and these ﬁerce shimmering noons we were to know more two days we had in nairobi before going to the coast there we paid off and
