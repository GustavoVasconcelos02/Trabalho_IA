introduction ever since civilized man has had literature he has apparently sought to make selections from it and thus put his favorite passages together in compact and convenient form certain it is at least that to the greeks masters in all great arts we owe this habit they made such collections and named them after their pleasant imaginative fashion gathering of ﬂowers or what we borrowing their word call an anthology so to those austere souls who regard anthologies labor contrivance the beneﬁt of persons who like smattering of knowledge and are never really learned we can at least plead in mitigation that we have high and ancient authority the practise in any event amount of scholarly deprecation has been able to turn mankind or that portion of mankind which reads books from the agreeable habit of making volumes of selections and ﬁnding in them much pleasure well improvement in taste and knowledge with the spread of education and with the great increase of literature among all civilized nations more especially since the invention of printing and its vast multipli cation of books the making of volumes of selections comprizing what is best in one own or in many literatures is longer mere matter of taste or convenience with the greeks but has become something little short of necessity in this world of many workers comparatively few scholars and still fewer intelligent men of leisure anthologies have been multiplied like all other books and in the main they have done much good and harm the man who thinks he is scholar or highly educated because he is familiar with what is collected in anthology of course errs grievously such familiarity more makes one master of literature than perusal of dictionary makes the reader master of style but the latter pursuit can hardly fail to enlar ge man vocabulary so the former adds to his knowledge increases his stock of ideas liberalizes his mind and opens to him new sources of enjoyment the greek habit was to bring together selec tions of verse passages of especial merit epigrams and short poems in the main their example has been followed from their days down to the elegant extracts in verse of our grandmothers and grandfathers and thence on to our own time with its admirable golden treasury and oxford handbook of verse there has been end to the making of poetical anthologies and apparently diminution in the public appetite them poetry indeed lends itself to selection much of the best poetry of the world is contained in short poems complete in themselves and capable of transference bodily to volume of selections there are very few poets of whose quality and genius fair idea can not be given by few judicious selections large body of noble and beautiful poetry of verse which is joy forever can also be given in very small compass and the mechanical attribute of size it must be remembered is very important in makin g successful anthology an essential quality of volume of selections is that it should be easily portable that it should be book which can be slipt into the pocket and readily carried about in any wanderings whether near or remote an anthology which is stored in one or more huge and heavy volumes is practically valueless except to those who have neither books nor access to public library or who think that stately tome printed on calendered paper and profusely v vi vii viii the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume i of 10 greece https is an ornament to center in parlor rarely used except on solemn or ofﬁcial occasions i have mentioned these advantages of verse the purposes of an anthology in order to show the difﬁculties which must be encountered in making prose selection very little prose is in small parcels which can be transferred entire and therefore with the very important attribute of completeness to volume of selections from most of the great prose writers it is necessary to take extracts and the chosen passage is broken off from what comes before and after the fame of great prose writer rule rests on book and really to know him the book must be read and not merely passages from it extracts give very satisfactory idea of paradise lost or the divine comedy and the same is true of extracts from history or novel it is possible by spreading prose selections through series of small volumes to overcome the mechanical difﬁculty and thus make the selections in form what they ought above all things to and not books of reference or table decorations but the spiritual or literary problem is not so easily overcome what prose to take and where to take it are by means easy questions to solve yet they are well worth solving so far patient effort can it in this period of easy printing it is desirable to put in convenient form before those who read examples of the masters which will draw us back from the perishing chatter of the moment to the literature which is the highest work of civilization and which is at once noble and lasting upon that theory this collection has been formed it is an attempt to give exam ples from all periods and languages of western civilization of what is best and most memorable in their prose literature that the result is not complete exhibition of the time and the literatures covered by the selections one is better aware than the editors inexorable conditions of space make certain degree of incompleteness inevitable when he who is gathering ﬂowers traverses so vast garden and is obliged to conﬁne the results of his labors within such narrow bounds the editors are also fully conscious that like all other similar collections this one too will give rise to the familiar criticism and questionings to why such passage was omitted and such another inserted why this writer was chosen and that other passed by in literature we all have our favorites and even the most catholic of us has also his dislikes if not his pet aversions i will frankly confess that there are authors represented in these volumes whose writings i should avoid just there are certain towns and cities of the world to which having once visited them i would never willingly return the simple reason that i would not voluntarily subject myself to seeing or reading what i dislike or which is worse what bores and fatigues but editor of an anthology must seek to impose upon others his own tastes and opinions he must at the outset remember and never afterward forget that so far possible his work must be free from the personal equation he must recognize that some authors who may be mute or dull to him have place in literature past or present sufﬁciently assured to entitle them to place among selections which are intended above all things else to be representative to those who wonder why some favorite bit of their own was omitted while something else which they not care at all has found place i can only say that the editors having supprest their own personal preferences have proceeded on certain general principles which seem to be essential in making any selection either of verse or prose which shall possess broader and more enduring qualities than that of being mere exhibition of the editor personal taste to illustrate my meaning emerson parnassus is extremely interesting an expositio n of the tastes and preferences of remarkable man of great and original genius an anthology it is failure it is of awkward size is ill arranged and contains selections made without system and which in many cases bafﬂe all attempts to explain their appearance on the other hand palgrave neither very remarkable man nor great and original genius gave us in the ﬁrst golden treasury collec tion which has interest whatever reﬂecting the tastes of the editor but which is quite perfect in its kind barring the disproportionate amount of wordsworth which includes some of his worst which be it said in passing was due to palgrave giving way at that point to his personal golden ix x xi xii the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume i of 10 greece https in form in scope and in arrangement well in almost unerring taste is the best model of what an anthology should be which is to be found in any language returning now to our questioner who misses some favorite and ﬁnds something else which he dislikes the only answer i have just said is that the collection is formed on certain general principles any similar collection of the sort must be this series is called the best of the world classics and classics is used not in the narrow and technical sense but rather in that of thoreau who deﬁned classics the noblest recorded thoughts of mankind therefore the ﬁrst principle of guidance in selection is to take examples of the great writings which have moved and inﬂuenced the thought of the world and which have preeminently the quality of high seriousness required by aristotle this test alone however would limit the selections too closely therefore the second principle of choice is to make selections from writers historically import ant either personally or by their writings the third rule is to endeavor to give selections which shall be representative of the various literatures and the various periods throug h which the collection ranges lastly and this applies of course only to passages taken from the writers of england and the united states the effort has been to give specimens of the masters of english prose of that prose in its development and at its best and to show so far may be what can be accomplished with that great instrument and what ﬁne style really is exhibited in the best models everything contained in these volumes is there in obedience to one at least of these principles many in obedience to more than one some in conformity to all four one will become scholar or master of any of the great literatures here represented by reading this collection literature and scholarship are not to be had so cheaply that yet is there much proﬁt to be had from these little volumes they contain many passages which merit johnson ﬁne saying about books that they help us to enjoy life or teach us to endure it to the man of letters to the man of wide reading they will at least serve to recall when far from libraries and books those authors who have been the delight and the instructors of lifetime they will bring at least the pleasures of memory and that keener pleasure which arises when we meet poem or passage of prose which we know an old and friend remote from home upon some alien page to that larger public whose lives are not spent among books and libraries and whose delectation such collection this is primarily intended these volumes rightly read at odd times in idle moments in places on the ship or the train offer much they will bring the reader in contact with many of the greatest intellects of all time they contain some of the noblest thoughts that have passed through the minds of our weak and erring race there is man who will not be the better the moment at least by reading what cicero says about old age seneca about death and socrates about love to go further examples than to the glory that was greece and the grandeur that was rome moreover the bowing acquaintance which can be formed here may easily offer attractions which will lead to close and intimate friendship with all that the word implies in the case of great author or great book it seems to example if one who read here the too brief extrac ts from erasmus or from cervantes to take at random two writers widely separated in thought could fail to pursue the acquaintance thus begun so potent are the sympathetic charm the wit the wisdom and the humor of both these great men there is at least variety in these little volumes and while many things in them may not appeal to us they may to our neighbors that which is dumb to us may speak to him again let it be noticed that there is much more than the high seriousness which is the test of the greatest prose of the ﬁnest poetry humor and pathos tragedy and comedy all ﬁnd their place and glimpses of the pageant of human history ﬂit through the pages it would seem if it were impossible to read extracts from thucydides and tacitus and xiii xiv xv xvi the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume i of 10 greece https and not long to go to their histories and learn all that could be said by such men about the life of man upon earth about athens and rome and the rise and fall of empires selections are unsatisfying and the better they are the more unsatisfying they become but this is in reality their great merit they have much beauty in themselves they awaken pleasant memories they revive old delights but above all if rightly read they open the gates to the illimitable gardens whence all the ﬂowers which have here been gathered may be found blooming in radiance unplucked and unbroken and rooted in their native soil the most important part of the collection is that which gives selections from those writers whose native tongue is english translation even of prose can ever quite reproduce its original and rule can not hope to equal it there are many translations notably the elizabethan which are extremely ﬁne in themselves and memorable examples of english prose still they are not the original writings something escapes in the translation into another tongue an impalpable something which can not be held or transmitted the bible stands alone great literary monument of the noblest and most beautiful english which has formed english speech and become part of the language it is of the thought and emotion of the people who read king james version in all parts of the globe yet we know that the version which the people so fortunate in its possession wisely and absolutely decline to give up in exchange any revision is neither an accur ate nor faithful reproduction of its original therefore putting aside the english bible wholly by itself it may be safely said that the soul of language and the beauties of style which it is capable of exhibiting can only be found and studied in the productions of writers who not only think in the language in which they write but to whom that speech is native the inalienable birthright and heritage of their race or country in such writers we get not only the thought the humor or the pathos all that can be transferred in translation but also the pleasure to the ear akin to music the sense of form the artistic gratiﬁcation which form brings all those attributes which are possible in the highest degree to those only to whom the language is native these reasons will be readily understood in making selections from those writers whose native tongue is english specimens have been given of all periods from the earliest time and occasionally of authors who would not otherwise ﬁnd place in such collection the purpose of tracing in outline the development of english prose and the formation of an english style which like all true and great styles is peculiar to the language and can not be reproduced in any other this is not the place nor would it be feasible within any reasonable limits to narrate the history of english prose but in these selections it is possible to follow its gradual advance from the ﬁrst rude and crude attempts through the splendid irregularities of the ﬁfteenth and sixteenth centuries to the establishment of standard of style in the eighteenth and thence onward to the modiﬁcations and changes in that standard which extend to our own time the purpose of this collection is not didactic if it were it would be k and not an anthology in the greek sense where the ﬁrst principle was to seek what was of literary value artistic in expression and noble in thought yet the mere bringing together of examples of prose from the writings of the great masters of style can not but teach lesson never more needed than now i not mean by this to suggest imitation of any writer nothing is more dangerous especially when the style of the writer imitated is peculiar and strongly marked that which is valuable and instructive is the opportunity given here study of ﬁne english styles and in this way to learn the capabilities of the language and the general principles which have governed the production of the best english prose we have in the english language an unequaled richness of voca bulary far surpassing in extent that of any other tongue it possesses great literature and body of poetry unrivaled in modern times it is not only one of the strongest bonds of union in the united states but it is the language in which our freedom was won and in which our history and our laws are written it is our greatest heritage to weaken corru pt or deprave it would be misfortune withou t parallel to our entire people yet we can not disguise from ourselves the fact that the xvii xviii xix xx the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume i of 10 greece https of the the multiplication of cheap magazines and the ﬂood of printed words poured out daily in the newspapers all tend strongly in this direc tion this is an of haste and hurry stimulate d by the great inventions which have changed human environment form and style in any art require time and time seems the one thing we can neither spare nor wisely economize yet in literature above all arts to abandon form and style is inevitably destructive and entails misfortunes which can hardly be estimated loose weak and vulgar writing is sure precursor of loose weak and vulgar thinking if form of expression is cast aside form in thought and in the presentation of thought is certain to follow against all this the ﬁne english prose amply represented in these selections offers silent and convincing protest to every one who will read it attentively we can begin with the splendid prose of the age of elizabeth and of the seventeenth century it is irregular and untamed but exuberant and brilliant rich both in texture and substance we ﬁnd it at its height in the strange beauties of sir thomas browne in the noble pages of milton stiff with golden embroidery macaulay says and in the touching and beautiful simplicity of bunyan childlike sentences thence we pass to the eighteenth century when english prose was freed from its involutions and irregularities and brought to uniformity and to standard the age of anne gave to engl ish prose balance precision and settled form there have been periods of greater origin ality but the eighteenth century at least lived up to pope doctrine set forth in the familiar line what oft was thought but so well exprest there is better period to turn to instruction than the age of anne so if we must choose single writer there is better master to be studied than swift there have been many great writers and many ﬁne and beautiful styles since the days of the terrible dean of patrick from the imposing and ﬁnely balanced sentences of gibbon to the subtle delicacy of hawthorne and the careful ﬁnish of robert louis stevenson but in swift better than in any one writer can we ﬁnd the lessons which are so sorely needed now he had in the highest degree force clearness and concentration all combine d with marvelous simplicity swift style may have lacked richness but it never failed in taste there is not line of false in all his books those are the qualities which are so needed now simplicity and clearness and scrupulous avoidance of that ﬁne writing which is not at all ﬁne but merely vulgar and insincere the writing in our newspapers is where reform is particularly needed there are great journals here and there which maintain throughout careful standard of good and sober english most of them unhappily are ﬁlled in the news columns at least with strange jargon found nowhere else spoken by one and never used in daily life by those who every night furnish it to the compositors it is happily compounded in about equal parts of turgid ﬁne writing vulgar jauntiness and indiscriminate slang i can best show my meaning by exampl writer in newspaper wished to state that man who had once caused excitement by book of temporary interest and who after the days of his notoriety were over lived long and checkered career had killed himself this is the way he said it his

intended i think to be ﬁne writing of an imposing and dramatic kind why could not the writer have written it little more carefully perhaps but still in just the language which he would have used naturally in describing the event to his wife or friend simply stated it would have been far more solemn and impressive than this turgid insincere account with its large words its forced note of tragedy and its split inﬁnitive let put beneath it another description of the blood and spirits of le fevre which were waxing cold and slow and were retreating to their last citadel the back ﬁlm

on again shall i go on this famous passage is neither unintent ional sentiment nor unaffected pathos the art is apparent even in the punctuation the writer meant to be touching and pathetic and to awaken emotions of tenderness and pity and he succeeded the description is all he meant it to be the extract from the newspaper arouses emotion unless it be resentment at its form and leaves us cold and unmoved the other is touching and pitiful observe the manner in which sterne obtains his effect the perfect simplicity and good taste of every word the reserve the gentleness the utter absence of any straining effect the one description died the day it appeared the other has held its place century and half are not the qualities which produced such result worth striving let take another haphazard selectio n from description of young girl entitled such to every one kindness courtesy and respect in it occurs this sentence the college girl is grammatical in speech but she has the jolliest chummiest jargon of slang that ever rolled from under pink tongu that articulate sounds come from beneath the tongue is at least novel and few persons are fortunate enough to be able to talk with that portion of their mouths but i have desire to dwell either upon the anatomical peculiarities of the sentence or upon its abysmal vulgarity it is supposed to be effective it is what is appropriately called breezy it is form of words which can be heard nowhere in the speech of men and women why should it be consigned to print it is possible to describe young girl attractively and effectively in much simpler fashion let give an example not famous passage at all from another writer she shocked canon of taste she was admirably in keeping with herself and never jarred against surrounding circumstances her ﬁgure to be so small to be almost childlike and so elastic that motion seemed easy or easier to it than hardly have suited one idea of countess neither did her brown ringlets on either side and slightly piquant nose and the wholesome bloom and the clear shade of tan and the half dozen freckles friendly remembrancers of the april sun and precisely give us the right to call her beautiful but there was both luster and depth in her eyes she was very pretty graceful bird and graceful much in the same way pleasant about the house gleam of sunshine falling on the ﬂoor through shadow of twinkling leaves or ray of ﬁrelight that dances on the wall while evening is drawing nigh contrast this with the newspaper sentence and the sensation is one of pain again i say observe the method by which hawthorne gets his effect the simplicity of the language the balance of the sentences the reserve the reﬁne ment and the ﬁnal imaginative touch in the charming comparison with which the passage ends xxiv xxv xxvi xxvii the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume i of 10 greece https blame the hard working men who write the day which is passing over them because they not write like sterne and hawthorne would be absurd it would be unjust but they ought to recognize the qualities of ﬁne english prose they ought to remember that they can improve their readers by giving them good simple english pure and undeﬁled and they ought not to debauch the public taste by vulgar ﬁne writing and even more vulgar light writing in short they ought to write the public they would talk to their wives and children and friends little more formally and carefully perhaps but in the same simple and direct fashion the proliﬁc authors of the ﬂood of stories which every month bears on its broad bosom many tons of advertisements such allowance need be made they are not compelled to furnish copy between daylight and dark they need course of study in english prose more than anyone else and they would proﬁt by the effort class they seem to be like the young man in du maurier picture who being asked if he had read thackeray replies i nevah read novels i write them in this age of quickening movement and restless haste it is above all things important to struggle against the universal inclination to abandon all efforts form and style they are the great preservers of what is best in literature the salt which ought never to lose its savor those who use english in public speech and public writing have serious responsibility too generally forgotten and disregarded i would fain call attention to it altho single man can hope to effect much by any plea he can make in behalf of the use of good english whether written or spoken yet one i think can read the great masterpieces of english prose and not have both lesson and responsibility brought home to him he would be insensible indeed if he did not feel after such reading that he was sharer in noble heritage which it behooved him to guard and cherish if this series serves other purpose it will exhibit to those who read it some of the splendors and the beauties of english prose it will at least open the gates of literature and perhaps lead its readers to authors they have not known before or recall the words of writers who have entered into their lives and thoughts and thus make them more mindful of the ineffable value to them and their children of the great language which is at once their birthright and their inheritance henr y cabot lodge washington july 15 contents v

was ﬁrst printed in greek by aldus manutius in 1502 but latin version had appeared in 1474 1 i solon words of wisdom to crœsus 2 when all these conquests had been added to the lydian empire and the prosperity of sardis 3 was now at its height there came thither one after another all the sages of greece living at the time and among them solon the athenian he was on his travels having left athens to be absent ten years under the pretense of wishing to see the world but really to avoid being forced to repeal any of the laws which at the request of the athenians he had made them without his sanction the athenians could not repeal them they had bound themselves under heavy curse to be governed ten years by the laws which should be imposed on them by solon on this account well to see the world solon set out upon his travels in the course of which he went to egypt to the court of amasis 4 and also paid visit to crœsus at sardis crœsus received him his guest and lodged him in the royal palace on the third or fourth day after he bade his servants conduct solon over his treasuries and show him all their greatness and magniﬁcence when he had seen them all and so far time allowed inspected them crœsus addrest this question to him stranger of athens we have heard much of thy wisdom and of thy travels through many lands from love of knowledge and wish to see the world i am curious therefore to inquire of thee whom of all the men that thou hast seen thou deemest the most happy this he asked because he thought himself the happiest of mortals but solon answered him without ﬂattery according to his true sentiments tellus of athens sire full of astonishment at what he had heard crœsus demanded sharply and wherefore dost thou deem tellus happiest to this the other replied first because his country was ﬂourishing in his days and he himself had sons both beautiful and good and he lived to see children born to each of them and these children all grew up and further because after life spent in what our people look upon comfort his end was surpassingly glorious in battle between the athenians and their neighbors near eleusis he came to the assistance of his countrymen routed the foe and died upon the ﬁeld most gallantly the athenians gave him public funeral on the spot where he fell and paid him the highest honors thus did solon admonish crœsus by the example of tellus enumerating the manifold particulars of his happiness when he had ended crœsus inquired second time who after tellus seemed to him the happiest expecting that at any rate he would be given the second place cleobis and bito solon answered they were of argive race their fortune was enough their wants and they were besides endowed with so much bodily strength that they had both gained prizes at the games also this tale is told of them there was great festival in honor of the goddess juno at argos to which their mother must needs be taken in car now the oxen did not come home from the ﬁeld in time so the youths fearful of being too late put the yoke on their own necks and themselves 3 4 5 6 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume i of 10 greece https the car in which their mother rode five and forty furlongs did they draw her and stopt before the temple this deed of theirs was witnessed by the whole assembly of worshipers and then their life closed in the best possible way herein too god showed forth most evidently how much better thing man death is than life the argive men stood thick around the car and extolled the vast strength of the youths and the argive women extolled the mother who was blest with such pair of sons and the mother herself overjoyed at the deed and at the praises it had won standing straight before the image besought the goddess to bestow on cleobis and bito the sons who had so mightily honored her the highest blessing to which mortals can attain her prayer ended they offered sacriﬁce and partook of the holy banquet after which the two youths fell asleep in the temple they never woke again but so passed from the earth the argives looking on them among the best of men caused statues of them to be made which they gave to the shrine at delphi when solon had thus assigned these youths the second place crœsus broke in angrily what stranger of athens is my happiness then so utterly set at naught by thee that thou dost not even put on level with private men crœsus replied the other thou askedst question concerning the condition of man of one who knows that the power above us is full of jealousy and fond of troubling our lot long life gives one to witness much and experience much oneself that one would not choose seventy years i regard the limit of the life of man in these seventy years are contained without reckoning intercalary months thousand and two hundred days add an intercalary month to every other year that the seasons may come round at the right time and there will be besides the seventy years ﬁve such months making an addition of one thousand and ﬁfty days the whole number of the days contained in the seventy years will thus be thousand two hundred and ﬁfty whereof not one but will produce events unlike the rest hence man is wholly accident thyself crœsus i see that thou art wonderfully rich and art the lord of many nations but with respect to that whereon thou questionest i have answer to give until i hear that thou hast closed thy life happily assuredly he who posses ses great store of riches is nearer happiness than he who has what sufﬁces his daily needs unless it so hap that luck attend upon him and so he continue in the enjoyment of all his good things to the end of life many of the wealthiest men have been unfavored of fortune and many whose means

but of these babylon to which after the destruction of nineveh the seat of government was removed is by far the most renowne d and the most strongly fortiﬁed babylon is situated in an extensive plain each side of the city which forms square measures one hundred and twenty stadia about fourteen miles making the entire circuit of the city four hundred and eighty is the magnitude of this city babylon and in magniﬁcence also it surpassed every city of which we have any knowledge it is surrounded by trench deep wide and full of water within this is wall the width of which is ﬁfty royal cubits and its height two hundred cubits 6 the royal cubit exceeds the common measure by three ﬁngers breadth it is proper i should say in what manner the earth removed from the trench was disposed of and how the wall was constructed the earth fast it was removed from the trench was converted into bricks and baked in furnaces when thus prepared melted bitumen was used instead of mortar and between every thirtieth course of bricks there was inserted layer of reeds the sides of the trench were ﬁrst lined with brickwork and then the wall raised in the manner described on the upper edges of the wall and opposite to one another were constructed turrets between these turrets space was left wide enough chariot and four horses to pass and turn in the walls were one hundred gates all of brass with posts and upper lintels of the same eight days journey from babylon is city named is near which runs small river of the same name dischar ging itself into the euphrates this river brings down with its waters clots of bitumen in large 1 2 3 4 9 10 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume i of 10 greece https from this source was derived the bitumen used in cementing the walls of babylon such are the fortiﬁcations of babylon the city is divided into two portions by the river euphrates which runs through the midst of it this river rises in armenia and throughout its course is wide deep and swift it empties itself into the red sea 7 each of the city walls is extended to the river where it makes an angle and with coating of burnt bricks lines the sides of the river the city is ﬁlled with houses of three or four stories forming streets in straight lines and running parallel with one another the cross streets opening upon the river through many smaller brazen gates placed in the breastwork of the river walls within the principal wall just mentioned is second not much inferior to the ﬁrst in strength tho less in width in the center of each portion of the city is an enclosed one occupied by the royal palace building of vast extent and great strength in the other stands the temple of jupiter belus with its brazen gates remaining in my time it is square structure each side measures two stadia within the enclosure is erected solid tower measuring stadium both in width and depth upon this tower is raised another and then another and another making eight in all the ascent is by path which is formed on the outside of the towers midway in the ascent is furnished with easy chairs in which those who ascend repose themselves on the summit of the topmost tower stands large temple and in this temple is great couch handsomely ﬁtted up and near it stands golden table statue whatever is erected in the temple nor does any man ever pass the night there but woman only chosen from the people by the god the chaldeans who are the priests of the temple afﬁrm the same persons i give credit to the the god himself comes to the temple and reposes on the bed in like manner at thebes in egypt where also in the temple of jupiter woman passes the night similar custom is observed at pataris in lycia where there is at times an oracle on which occasions the priestess is shut up by night in the temple within the precincts of the temple at babylon there is smaller sacred ediﬁce on the ground containing an immense golden statue of jupiter in sitting posture around the statue are large tables which with the steps and throne are all of gold and the chaldeans afﬁrm contain eight hundred talents of gold without this ediﬁce is golden altar there is also another altar of great size on which are offered animals upon the golden altar it is not lawful to offer sacriﬁces except sucklings once in every year when the festival of this god is celebrated the chaldeans burn upon the greater altar thousand talents of frankincense there was also not long since in this sacred enclosure statue of solid gold twelve cubits in height at least so the chaldeans

prevent its removal such was the magniﬁcence of this temple which contained also many private of ferings of this babylon there were several i shall mention in my history of the adorned the city and its temples among these two young women must be mentioned the former named semir amis 8 reigned ﬁve generations before the latter this queen raised an embankment worthy of admiration through the plain to conﬁne the river which heretofore often spread over the level like lake the latter of these two queens named nitocris 9 excelled the former in intelligence she left monuments some of which i must describe seeing the medes already possest of extensive empire and restlessly extending their power by taking city after city among which was nineveh she resolved in good time to secure herself against them in the best manner possib le in the ﬁrst place therefore the river euphrates ran in straight course through the city she formed excavations at distance above it by which means its course became so tortuous that it three times passed certain town of assyria called ardericca travelers from our sea 10 in descending the euphrates toward babylon three times arrive at that town in the course of three days she also raised both banks of the river to an amazing height and thickness at some distance above baby lon and near the river she dug reservoir in the 11 12 13 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume i of 10 greece https of such depth to drain it the width of this excavation was such to make its circuit four hundred and twenty stadia the earth removed from it was taken to raise the banks of the river this done she brought stones with which the sides of the lake were lined both these diverting of the river and the formed with the intention of rendering the current less rapid by its many windings which broke its force and at the same time made the navigation more circuitous so that those who descended toward babylon by water might have to make long circuit around the lake these works were effective on that side which was exposed to the inroads of the medes and where the distance between her dominions and theirs was the least she wished to cut of f all communication with them and to keep them in ignorance of her movements thus did this princess raise from the depths fortiﬁcation within which she was included the city being divided into two portions by the river in former times whoever wished to pass from one to the other was obliged to take boat which manifestly was great inconvenience this defect she supplied when she had dug the lake in the marsh she availed herself of the occasion to construct another monument also by which her fame will be perpetuated she caused stones of great magnitude to be hewn and when they were ready the lake being empty she turned the waters of the euphrate s into it which it ﬁlled left the old channel dry then she lined both sides of the river and the descent from the gates with burnt bricks in like manner the city walls and with the stones already mentioned she constructed near the middle of the city possible bridge binding the stones together with iron and lead during the day planks of wood were extended from pier to pier so to form pathway these were withdrawn at night to prevent the people from passing over to plunder one another this bridge was we have said formed by withdrawing the water of the euphrates into the artiﬁcial lake when completed the river was restored to its ancient chan nel the propriety of this mode of proceeding then become apparent by means of which the citizens obtained the accommodation of bridge the same queen also executed the following machination she constructed herself tomb aloft upon gate in one of the most frequented ways of the city upon the sepulcher she engraved this inscription if any one of my successors the kings of babylon shall lack money let him open the sepulcher and take what treasures he pleases but let him beware of opening it from any other cause than necessity in such case it shall not turn to his advantage this sepulcher remained undisturbed till darius ascended the throne to this king it seemed grievance both that this gate should remain useless and that the wealth deposited in it and which invited research should not be appropriated the gate was not used because one could pass through it without having dead body over his head he therefore opened the tomb in which he treasures indeed nothing but the corpse and an inscription to this effect if thou hadst not been insatiably eager riches and greedy of ﬁlthy lucre thou wouldst not have opened the depository of the dead so much this queen and the reports that have been handed down concerning her it was against the son of this woman that cyrus made war he was named like his father labynetus and reigned over the assyria ns when the great king 11 goes out to battle he is attended by ample provisions and cattle drawn from the home stock and even water from the choaspian spring at susa 12 of which alone the king drinks is carried about his use he can taste other stream this choaspian water after having been boiled is put into vases of silver which are transported in wagons drawn by mules following him wherever he goes cyrus advancing toward babylon arrived at the river gyndes which rising in the matienian hills and running through the country of the dardanians or darnians empties itself into the tigris and this river passing by the city opis dischar ges its waters into the red sea 13 when cyrus attempted to pass this river gyndes which could only be done by boats one of the white horses called sacred full of mettle plunged into the stream and endeavored to reach the opposite bank but being submer ged in the curren t it was carried away cyrus enraged at the river this injury threatened to reduce it so low that 14 15 16 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume i of 10 greece https future women should ford it with ease not wetting their knees having uttered this threat he delayed the progress of his army toward babylon and dividing his forces into two bodies measured out one hundred and eighty channels to be cut from both banks of the river thus diverting the gyndes on all sides he enjoined upon his army the work of digging these trenches and by their numbers they completed it but the whole summer was spent there in the labor cyrus having in this manner punished the river gyndes by distributing its waters into three hundred and sixty trenches soon the next spring appeared advanced toward babylon the babylonians coming out in waited his approach when he drew nigh to the city they engaged him but being defeated retired within the walls some time before well knowing the restless intentions of cyrus and seeing him attack one nation after another they had brought into the city an abundance of corn many years they therefore disregarded the siege but cyrus beset with difﬁculties saw long time pass away without his making any progress toward the accomplishment of his object at length either at the suggestion of some one else or from thought of his own he resorted to the following means he disposed the whole of his army by placing one part above the city where the river enters it and another part below where it makes its exit commanding them soon they should perceive the river to be sufﬁciently shallow to enter by that way this order being given he himself went off with the inferior troops of the army arriving at the lake he did what had been done before by the queen of babylon in the marsh by making trench from the river to the empty reservoir he diverted the water from the ancient channel till it so far subsided to become fordable soon this happened the persians who had been appointed this purpose entered babylon by the bed of the river the water of which was little more than if the babylonians had been before apprized of the intentions of cyrus or if they had learned at the moment what he was doing they would not have suffered the persians to enter the city nor would the babylonians have perished so shamefully if they had closed all the gates by the river side and ascended the walls which ran along it they might have taken the persians in net but the persians came upon their opponents quite unexpectedly and from the great extent of the it has been afﬁrmed by some of the who dwelt in the outskirts of the city were made prisoners before the people in the center of babylon knew that the place was taken but it happened they were

of short wooden planks the ﬁrst machine raised them from the ground to the top of the ﬁrst step on this there was another machine which received the stone upon its arrival and conveyed it to the second step whence third machine advanced it still higher either they had many machines there were steps in the pyramid or possibly they had but single machine which being easily moved was transferred

put to death his wife melissa it chanced that on his ﬁrst afﬂiction second followed of different kind his wife had borne him two sons and one of them had now reached the age of seventeen the other of eighteen years when their mother father procles tyrant of epidaurus 16 asked them to his court they went and procles treated them with much kindness was natural considering they were his own daughter children at length when the time parting came procles he was sending them on their way said know you now my children who it was that caused your mother death the elder son took account of this speech but the younger whose name was lycophron was sorely troub led at much so that when he got back to corinth looking upon his father his mother murderer he would neither speak to him nor answer when spoken to nor utter word in reply to all his father questionings so periander at last growing furious at such behavior banished his son from his house the younger son gone he turned to the elder and asked him what it was that their grandfather had said to them then the son related in how kind and friendly fashion the grandfather had received them but not having taken any notice of the speech which procles had uttered at parting he quite forgot to mention it periander insisted that it was not possible this should be grandfather must have given them some hint or he went on pressing his son till at last he remembered the parting speech and told it periander after he had turned the whole matter over in his thoughts and felt unwilling to give way at all sent messenger to the persons who had opened their houses to his outcast son and forbade them to harbor him then the boy when he had been driven from one friend sought refuge with another but was forced from shelter to shelter by the threats of his father who mena ced all those that took him in and commanded them to shut their doors against him still fast he was forced to leave one house he went to another and was received by the inmates his acquaintances altho in small alarm yet gave him shelter he was periander son at last periander made proclamation that whoever harbored his son or even spoke to him should forfeit certain sum of money to apollo on hearing this one any longer liked to take him in or even to hold converse with him and he himself did not think it right to seek to what was forbidden so abiding by his resolve he made his lodging in the public porticoes when four days had passed in this way periander seeing how wretched his son was that he neither washed nor took any food felt moved with compassion toward him wherefore foregoing his anger he approached the lad and said which is better oh my son to fare now thou farest or to receive my crown and all the good things that i possess on the one condition of submitting thyself to thy father see now tho my own child and lord of this wealthy corinth thou hast brought thyself to beggar life because thou must resist and treat with anger him whom it least behooves thee to oppose if there has been calamity and thou bearest ill will on that account bethink thee that i too feel it and am the greater sufferer inasmuch it was by that the deed was done thyself now that thou knowest how much better thing it is to be envied than pitied and how dangerous it is to indulge anger against parents and 14 20 21 22 23 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume i of 10 greece https come back with to thy home with such words these did periander chide his son but the latter made reply except to remind his father that he was indebted to the god in the penalty coming and holding converse with him then periander knew there was cure the youth malady nor means of overcom ing it so he prepared ship and sent him away out of his sight to corcyra 17 which island at that time belonged to him procles periander regarding him the true author of all his present troubles went to war with him soon his son was gone and not only made himself master of his kingdom epidaurus but also took procles himself and carried him into captivity time went on and periander came to be old he found himself longer equal to the oversight and management of affairs seeing therefore in his elder son manner of ability but knowing him to be dull and blockish he sent to corcyra and recalled lycophron to take the kingdom lycophron however did not even deign to ask the bearer of this message question but periander heart was set upon the youth so he sent again to him this time by his own daughter the sister of lycophron who would he thought have more power to persuade him than any other person then the daughter when she had reached corcyra spoke thus with her brother dost thou wish the kingdom brother to pass into strange hands and our father wealth to be made prey rather than thyself return to enjoy it come back home with and cease to punish thyself it is scant gain this obstinacy why seek to cure evil by evil mercy remember is by many set above justice many also while pushing their mother claims have forfeited their father fortune power is slippery has many suitors and he is old and stricken in not thy own inheritance go to another thus did the sister who had been tutored by periander what to say urge all the arguments most likely to have weight with her brother he however made answer that so long he knew his father to be still alive he would never go back to corinth when the sister brought periander this reply he sent to his son third time by herald and said he would come himself to corcyra and let his son take his place at corinth heir to his kingdom to these terms lycophron agreed and periander was making ready to pass into corcyra and his son to return to corinth when the corcyreans being informed of what was taking place to keep periander away put the young man to death this reason it was that periander took vengeance on the corcyreans footnotes from book iii of the history translated by george rawlinson

an ally and tributary of theirs and that they had now openly joined the potidæans and were ﬁghting on their side the peloponnesian war however had not yet broken out the peace still continued thus far the corinthians had acted alone but now seeing potidæa 21 besieged they bestirred themselves in earnest corinthian troops were shut up within the walls and they were afraid of losing the town so without delay they invited the allies to meet at sparta there they inveighed against the athenians whom they afﬁrmed to have broken the treaty and to have wronged the peloponnesians the megarians alleged among other grounds of complaint that they were excluded from all harbors within the athenian dominion and from the athenian market contrary to the treaty the corinthians waited until the other allies had stirred up the lacedæmonians at length they came forward and last of all spoke follows the spirit of trust lacedæmonians which animates your own political and social life makes you distrust others who like ourselves have something unpleasant to say and this temper of mind tho favorable to moderation too often leaves you in ignorance of what is going on outside your own country time after time we have warned you of the mischief which the athenians would to us but instead of taking our words to heart you chose to suspect that we spoke only from interested motives and this is the reason why you have brought the allies to sparta too late not before but after the injury has been inﬂicted and when they are smarting under the sense of it which of them all has better right to speak than ourselves who have the heaviest accusations to make outraged we are by the athenians and neglected by you if the crimes which they are committing against hellas were being done in corner then you might be ignorant and we should have to inform you of them but now what need of many words some of us you see have been already enslaved they are at this moment intriguing against others notably against allies of ours and long ago they had made all their preparations in expectation of war else why did they seduce from her allegiance corcyra which they still hold in deﬁance of us and why are they blockading potidæa the latter most advantageous post the command of the thracian peninsula the former great naval power which might have assisted the peloponnesians and the blame of all this rests on you you originally allowed them to fortify their city after the persian war and afterward to build their long walls 22 and to this hour you have gone on defrauding of liberty their unfortunate subjects and are now beginning to take it away from your own allies the true enslaver of people is he who can put an end to their slavery but has care about it and all the more if he be reputed the champion of liberty in hellas and so we have met at last but with what difﬁculty and even now we have deﬁnite object by this time we ought to have been considering not whether we are wronged but how we are to be revenged the aggressor is not now threatening but advancing he has made up his mind while we are resolved about nothing and we know too well how by slow degrees and with stealthy steps the athenians encroach upon their neighbors while they think that you are too dull to observe them they are more careful but when they know that you wilfully overlook their aggressions they will strike you and not spare of all hellenes lacedæmonians you are the only people who never anything on the approach of an enemy you are content to defend yourselves against him not by acts but

which has been deferred until his power is doubled and you know that the barbarian miscarried chieﬂy through his own errors and that we have oftener been delivered from these very athenians by blunders of their own than by any aid from you some have already been ruined by the hopes which you inspired in them so entirely did they trust you that they took precautions themselves these things we say in accusing or hostile spirit that be by way of expostulation men expostulate with erring friends they bring accusations against enemies who have done them wrong and surely we have right to ﬁnd fault with our neighbors if any one ever had there are important interests at stake to which far we can see you are insensible and you have never considered what manner of men are these athenians with whom you will have to ﬁght and how utterly unlike yourselves they are revolutionary equally quick in the conception and in the execution of every new plan while you are only to keep what you have originating nothing and not acting even when action is most necessary they are bold beyond their strength they run risks which prudence would condemn and in the midst of misfortune they are full of hope whereas it is your nature tho strong to act feebly when your plans are most prudent to distrust them and when calamities come upon you to think that you will never be delivered from them they are impetuous and you are dilatory they are always abroad and you are always at home they hope to gain something by leaving their homes but you are afraid that any new enterprise may imperil what you have already when conquerors they pursue their victory to the utmost when defeated they fall back the least their bodies they devote to their country tho they belonged to other men their true self is in their mind which is most truly their own when employed in her service when they not carry out an intention which they have formed they seem to have sustained personal bereavement when an enterprise succeeds they have gained mere instalment of what is to come but if they fail they at once conceive new hopes and so ﬁll up the void with them alone to hope is to have they lose not moment in the execution of an idea this is the lifelong task full of danger and toil which they are always imposing upon themselves none enjoy their good things less because they are always seeking more to their duty is their only holiday and they deem the quiet of inaction to be disagreeable the most tiresome business if man should say to them in word that they were born neither to have peace themselves nor to allow peace to other men he would simply speak the truth in the face of such an enemy lacedæmonians you persist in doing nothing you not see that peace is best secured by those who use their strength justly but whose attitude shows that they have intention of submitting to wrong justice with you seems to consist in giving annoyance to others and in defending yourselves only against positive injury but this policy would hardly be successful even if your neighbors were like yourselves and in the present case we pointed out just now your ways compared with theirs are and in the arts so also in politics the new must always prevail over the old in settled times the traditions of government should be observed but when circumstances are changing and men are compelled to meet them much originality is required the athenians have had wider experience and therefore the administration of their state has improved faster than yours but here let your procrastination end send an army at once into attica and assist your allies especially the potidæans to whom your word is pledged not allow friends and kindred to fall into the hands of their worst enemies or drive us in despair to seek the alliance of others in taking such course we should be doing wrong either before the gods who are witnesses of our oaths or before men whose eyes are upon us the true breakers of treaties

lacedæmon an athenian embassy which had come on other business and when the envoys heard what the corinthians had said they felt bound to go before the lacedæmonian assembly not with the views of answering the accusations brought against them by the cities but they wanted to put before the lacedæmonians the whole question and make them understand that they should take time to deliberate and not be rash they desired also to set forth the greatness of their city reminding the elder men of what they knew and infor ming the younger of what lay beyond their experience they thought that their words would sway the lacedæmonians in the direction of peace so they came and said that if they might be allowed they too would like to address the people the lacedæmonians invite d them to come forward and they spoke follows we were not sent here to argue with your allies but on special mission observing however that small outcry has arisen against us we have come forward not to answer the accusations which they bring you are not judges before whom either we or they have to plead but to prevent you from lending too ready an ear to their bad advice and so deciding wrongly about very

repetition of them is disagreeable to us when we faced those perils we did so the common beneﬁt in the solid good you shared and of the glory whatever good there may be in that we would not be wholly deprived our words are not designed to deprecate hostility but to set forth in evidence the character of the city with which unless you are very careful you will soon be involved in war we tell you that we ﬁrst and alone dared to engage with the barbarian at marathon 23 and that when he came again being too weak to defend ourselves by land we and our whole people embarked on shipboard and shared with the other hellenes in the victory of salamis 24 thereby he was prevented from sailing to the peloponnesus and ravaging city after city against so mighty ﬂeet how could you have helped one another he himself is the best witness of our words when he was once defeated at sea he felt that his power was gone and quickly retreated with the greater part of his army the event proved undeniably that the fate of hellas depended on her navy and the three chief elements of success were contributed by us namely the greatest number of ships the ablest general the most devoted patriotism the ships in all numbered four hundred and of these our own contingent amounted to nearly to the inﬂuence of themistocles our general it was chieﬂy due that we fought in the strait which was confessedly our salvation and this service you yourselves honored him above any stranger who ever visited you thirdly we displayed the most extraordinary courage and devotion there was one to help us by land up to our frontier those who lay in the enemy path were already slaves so we determined to leave our city and sacriﬁce our homes even in that extremity we did not choose to desert the cause of the allies who still resisted and by dispersing ourselves to become useless to them but we embarked and fought taking offense at your failure to assist us sooner we maintain then that we rendered you service at least great you rendered us the cities from which you came to help us were still inhabited and you might hope to return to them your concern was yourselves and not us at any rate you remained at distance while we had anything to lose but we went forth from city which was more and fought one of which there was small hope and yet we saved ourselves and bore our part in saving you if in order to preserve our land like other states we had gone over to the persians at 32 33 34 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume i of 10 greece https or afterward had not ventured to embark because our ruin was already complete it would have been useless you with your weak navy to ﬁght at sea but everything would have gone quietly just the persian desired considering lacedæmonians the energy and sagacity which we then displayed we deserve to be so bitterly hated by the other hellenes merely because we have an empire that empire was not acquired by force but you would not stay and make an end of the barbarian and the allies came of their own accord and asked us to be their leaders the subsequent development of our power was originally forced upon us by circumstances fear was our ﬁrst motive afterward ambition and then interest stept in and when we had incurred the hatred of most of our allies when some of them had already revolted and been subjugated and you were longer the friends to us which you once had been but suspicious and how could we without great risk relax our hold the cities fast they fell away from us would have gone over to you and man is to be reproached who seizes every possible advantage when the danger is so great at all events lacedæmonians we may retort that you in the exercise of your supremacy manage the cities of pelopo nnesus to suit your own views and that if you and not we had persevered in the command of the allies long enough to be hated you would have been quite intolerable to them we are and would have been compelled the sake of your own safety to rule with strong hand an empire was offered to us can you wonder that acting human nature always will we accepted it and refused to give it up again constrained by three all powerful motives ambition fear interest we are not the ﬁrst who have aspired to rule the world has ever held that the weaker must be kept down by the stronger and we think that we are worthy of power and there was time when you thought so too but now when you mean expediency you talk about justice did justice ever deter any one from taking by force whatever he could men who indulge the natural ambition of empire deserve credit if they are in any degree more careful of justice than they need be how moderate we are would speedily appear if others took our place indeed our very moderation which should be our glory has been unjustly converted into reproach because in our suits with our allies regulated by treaty we not even stand upon our rights but have instituted the practise of deciding them at athens and by athenian law we are supposed to be litigious none of our opponents observes why others who exercise dominion elsewhere and are less moderate than we are in their dealings with their subjects escape this reproach why is it because men who practise violence have longer any need of law but we are in the habit of meeting our allies on terms of equality and therefore if through some legal decision of ours or exercise of our imperial power contrary to their own ideas of right they suffer ever so little they are not grateful our moderation in leaving them so much but are far more offended at their triﬂing loss than if we had from the ﬁrst plundered them in the face of day laying aside all thought of law then they would themselves have admitted that the weaker must give way to the stronger mankind resents injustice more than violence because the one seems to be an unfair advantage taken by an equal the other is the irresistible force of superior they were patient under the yoke of the persian who inﬂicted on them far more grievous wrongs but now our dominion is odious in their eyes and wonder the ruler of the day is always detested by his subjects and should your empire supplant ours may not you lose the which you owe to the fear of us lose it you certainly will if you mean again to exhibit the temper of which you gave specimen when short time you led the confederacy against the persian the institutions under which you live are incompatible with those of foreign states and further when any of you goes abroad he respects neither these nor any other hellenic laws not then be hasty in deciding question which is serious and not by listening to the misrepresentations and complaints of others bring trouble upon yourselves realize while there is time the inscrutable nature of war and how when protracted it generally ends in becoming mere matter of chance over which neither of us can have any control the event being equally unknown and equally hazardous to both the misfortune is that in 35 36 37 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume i of 10 greece https hurry to go to war men begin with blows and when reverse comes upon them then have recourse to words but neither you nor we have yet committed this mistake and therefore while both of us can still choose the prudent part we tell you not to break the peace or violate your oaths let our differences be determined by arbitration according to the treaty if you refuse we call to witness the gods by whom you have sworn that you are the authors of the war and we will our best to strike in return when the lacedæmonians had heard the charges brought by the allies against the athenians and their rejoinder they ordered everybody

absolutely alone among historians not only of hellas but of the world in his impartiality and love of truth macaulay enthusiasm him is well known mahaffy says his work was intended to be military history compiled from original documents and from personal observations made by himself and other there can not be the smallest doubt adds mahaffy that in the hands of thucydides the art of writing history made an extraordinary stride and attained perfection which subsequent hellenic and few modern writers have attained he is praised the lofty dignity which he imparts to every subject his temper is so solemn and severe to be strangely among his great and enduring merits is the fact that he has taught us to know more of greek interpolitical life than all other greek writers put together

peloponnesian war translated by benjamin jowett the peloponnesians were the people of the peninsula which forms the southern part of greece and which is now known morea in ancient times this territory was called the peloponnesus its people comprized the inhabitants of several political domains called achaia sicyonia corinthia argolis arcadia laconia messenia and elis laconia was otherwise and quite anciently known lacedæmon its capital being the city of sparta potidæa the modern pinaka had revolted from athens in 432 but did not capitulate until the end of the second year of the peloponnesian war it was rich and ﬂourishing town originally dorian but colonized later from corinth during one of the eastern invasions of greece it fell into persian hands these walls connected athens with its port the piræus and were each about ﬁve miles long they ran parallel and were separated from each other by about 500 feet of space this intervening land was used carriage road on either side of which were houses thus was formed continuous walled street from athens to the sea so that communication in case of war was made secure the battle of marathon was fought in september it ended the attempts of darius to subdue greece the battle of salamis took place in september 480 and was fought in waters lying between the piræus and the island of salamis themistocles commanded the greeks the persian

many places particularly lemnos 27 but there is record of such pestilence occurring elsewhere or of so great destruction of human life while physicians in ignorance of the nature of the disease sought to apply remedies but it was in vain and they themselves were among the ﬁrst victims because they oftenest came into contact with it human art was of any avail and to supplications in temples inquiries of oracles and the like they were utterly useless and at last men were overpowered by the calamity and gave up all remedies the disease is said to have begun south of egypt in ethiopia thence it desce nded into egypt and libya and after spreading over the greater part of the persian empire suddenly fell upon athens it ﬁrst attacked the inhabitants of the piræus and it was supposed that the peloponnesians had poisoned the cisterns conduits having yet been made there it afterward reached the upper city and then the mortality became far greater to its probable origin or the causes which might or could have produced such disturbance of nature every man whether physician or not will give his own opinion but i shall describe its actual course and the symptoms by which any one who knows them beforehand may recognize the disorder should it ever reappear i was myself attacked and witnessed the suf ferings of others the season was admitted to have been remarkably free from ordinary sickness and if anybody was already ill of any other disease it was absorbed in this many who were in perfect health all in moment and without any apparent reason were seized with violent heats in the head and with redness and inﬂammation of the eyes internally the throat and the tongue were quickly suffused with blood and the breath became unnatural and fetid there followed sneezing and hoarseness in short time the disorder accompanied by violent cough reached the chest then fastening lower down it would move the stomach and bring on all the vomits of bile to which physicians have ever given names and they were very distressing an ineffectual retching producing violent convulsions attacked most of the sufferers some soon the previous symptoms had abated others not until long afterward the body externally was not so very hot to the touch nor yet pale it was of livid color inclining to red and breaking out in pustules and ulcers but the internal fever was intense the sufferers could not bear to have on them even the ﬁnest linen garment they insisted on being naked and there was nothing which they longed more eagerly than to throw themselves into cold water and many of those who had one to look after them actually plunged into the cisterns they were tormented by unceasing thirst which was not in the least assuaged whether they drank little or much they could not sleep restlessn ess which was intolerable never left them while the disease was at its height the body instead of wasting away held out amid these sufferings in marvelous manner and either they died on the seventh or ninth day not of weakness their strength was not exhausted but of internal fever which was the end of most or if they survived then the disease descended into the bowels and there produced violent ulcerations severe diarrhea at the same time set in and at later stage caused exhaustion which ﬁnally with few exceptions carried them off the disorder which had originally settled in the head passed gradually through the whole body and if person got over the worst would often seize the extremities and leave its mark attacking the privy parts and the ﬁngers and the toes and some escaped with the loss of these some with the loss of their eyes some again had sooner recovered than they 38 39 40 41 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume i of 10 greece https seized with forgetfulness of all things and knew neither themselves nor their friends the malady took form not to be described and the fury with which it fastened upon each sufferer was too much human nature to endure there was one circum stance in particular which distinguished it from ordinary diseases the birds and animals which feed on human ﬂesh altho so many bodies were lying unburied either never went near them or died if they touched them this was proved by remarkable disappearance of the birds of prey which were not to be seen either about the bodies or anywhere else while in the case of the dogs the fact was even more obvious because they live with man such was the general nature of the disease i omit many strange peculiarities which characterized individual cases none of the ordinary sicknesses attacked any one while it lasted or if they did they ended in the plague some of the sufferers died from want of care others equally who were receiving the greatest attention single remedy could be deemed speciﬁc that which did good to one did harm to another constitution was of itself strong enough to resist or weak enough to escape the attacks the disease carried off all alike and deﬁed every mode of treatment most appalling was the despondency which seized upon any one who felt himself sickening he instantly abandoned his mind to despair and instead of holding out absolutely threw away his chance of life appalling too was the rapidity with which men caught the infection dying like sheep if they attended on one anoth er and this was the principal cause of mortality when they were afraid to visit one another the sufferers died in their solitud so that many houses were empty because there had been one left to take care of the sick or if they ventured they perished especially those who aspired to heroism they went to see their friends without thought of themselves and were ashamed to leave them even at time when the very relatives of the dying were at last growing weary and ceased to make lamentations overwhelmed by the vastness of the calamity but whatever instances there may have been of such devotion more often the sick and the dying were tended by the pitying care of those who had recovered because they knew the course of the disease and were themselves free from apprehension one was ever attacked second time or not with fatal result all men congratulated them and they themselves in the excess of their joy at the moment had an innocent fancy that they could not die of any other sickness the crowding of the people out of the country into the city aggravated the misery and the newly arrived suffered most havin g houses of their own but inhabiting in the height of summer stiﬂing huts the mortality among them was dreadful and they perished in wild disorder the dead lay they had died one upon another while others hardly alive wallowed in the streets and crawled about every fountain craving water the temples in which they lodged were full of the corpses of those who had died in them the violence of the calamity was such that men not knowing where to turn grew reckless of all law human and divine the customs which had hitherto been observed at funerals were universally violated and they buried their dead each one best he could many having proper appliances because the deaths in their household had been so frequent made scruple of using the of others when one man had raised funeral pile others would come and throwing on their dead ﬁrst set ﬁre to it or when some other corpse was already burning before they could be stopt would throw their own dead upon it and depart there were other and worse forms of lawlessness which the plague introduced at athens men who had hitherto concealed their indulgence in pleasure now grew bolder seeing the sudden the rich died in moment and those who had nothing immediately inherited their reﬂected that life and riches were alike transitory and they resolved to enjoy themselves while they could and to think only of pleasure who would be willing to sacriﬁce himself to the law of honor when he knew not whether he would ever live to be held in honor the pleasure of the moment and any sort of thing which conduced to it took the place both of honor and of expediency fear of god or law of man deterred criminal those who saw all perishing alike thought

the elder men among them declared to have been current long ago dorian war will come and plague with it footnotes the peloponnesian war broke out in 431 and lasted until its result was the abasement of athens and the elevation of sparta to supreme power in greece when it began athens with her allies included all the coast cities of asia minor far south lycia the cities bordering on the thracian and chalcidian shores and nearly all the islands of the ægean sea sparta at the same time was leader in confederacy of independent states among which were nearly all the peloponnesian states besides some of those in northern greece those of magna græcia and sicily athens was strong in her navy which comprized 300 galleys while the spartan strength lay in her land forces the treasury of athens was full that of sparta weak after the war the walls of athens were demolished and she was deprived of her foreign possessions the government set over her was an oligarchy of thirty persons known in history the thirty tyrants these men soon made their harsh rule so intolerable that within sixteen months after athens surrendered to sparta they were deposed and democratic rule was restored to the

appointed their departure the athenians and such of their allies had already joined them went down to the piræus and began to man the ships the entire population of athens accompanied them citizens and strangers alike the citizens came to take farewell one of an acquaintance another of kinsman another of son the crowd they passed along were full of hope and full of tears hope of conquering sicily tears because they doubted whether they would ever see their friends again when they thought of the long voyage on which they were sending them at the moment of parting the danger was nearer

curiosity desiring to witness an enterprise of which the greatness exceeded belief armament so magniﬁcent or costly had ever been sent out by any single hellenic power tho in mere number of ships and hoplites that which sailed to epidaurus under pericles and afterward under hagnon to potidæa was not inferior that expedition consisted of hundred athenian and ﬁfty chian and lesbian triremes conveying four thousand hoplites all athenian citizens three hundred cavalry and multitude of allied troops still the voyage was short and the equipments were poor whereas this expedition was intended to be long absent and was thoroughly provided both sea and land service wherever its presence might be required on the ﬂeet the greatest pains and expe nse had been lavished by the trierarchs and the state the public treasury gave drachma day to each sailor and furnished empty hulls sixty swift sailing vessels and forty transports carrying hoplites all these were manned with the best crews which could be obtained the trierarchs beside s the pay given by the state added somewhat more out of their own means to the wages of the upper ranks of rowers and of the petty ofﬁcers the ﬁgureheads and other ﬁttings provided by the trierarchs were of the most costly description every one strove to the utmost that his own ship might excel both in beauty and swiftness the infantry had been well selected and the lists carefully made up there was the keenest rivalry among the soldiers in the matter of arms and personal equipment and while at home the athenians were thus competing with one another in the performance of their several duties to the rest of hellas the expedition seemed to be grand display of their power and greatness rather than preparation war if any one had reckoned up the whole expenditur 1 of the state 2 of individual soldiers and others including in the ﬁrst not only what the city had already laid out but what was entrusted to the generals and in the second what either at the time or afterwa rd private persons spent upon their outﬁt or the trierarchs upon their ships the provision the long voyage which every one may be supposed to have carried with him over and above his public pay and what soldiers or traders may have taken purposes of exchange he would have found that altogether an immense sum amounting to many talents was withdrawn from the city men were quite amazed at the boldness of the scheme and the magniﬁcence of the spectacle which were everywhere spoken of less than at the great disproportion of the force when compa red with that of the enemy against whom it was intended never had greater expeditio n been sent to foreign land never was there an enterprise in which the hope of future success seemed to be better justiﬁed by actual power when the ships were manned and everything required the voyage had been placed on board silence was proclaimed by the sound of the trumpet and all with one voice before setting sail offered up the customary prayers these were recited not in each ship but by single herald the whole ﬂeet accompanying him on every deck both ofﬁcers and men mingling wine in bowls made libations from vessels of gold and silver the multitude of citizens and other who were looking on from the land joined in the prayer the crews raised the pæan and when the libations were completed put to sea after sailing out some distance in single ﬁle the ships raced with one another far ægina 30 thence they hastened onward to corcyra where the allies who formed the rest of the army were assembling meanwhile reports of the expedition were coming in to syracuse from many quarters but long time nobody gave credit to them at length an assembly was held even then different opinions were exprest some afﬁrming and others denying that the expedition was coming at last hermocrates 31 the son of hermon believing that he had certain information came forward and warned the syracusans great was the contention which his words aroused among the syracusan peop le some asserting that the athenians would never come and that he was not speaking truth others 47 48 49 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume i of 10 greece https and if they should come what harm could they to us nearly so great we could to them while others were quite contemptuous and made jest of the whole matter few only believed hermocrates and realized the danger at last athenagoras the popular leader who had at that time the greatest inﬂuence with the multitude came forward and spoke the athenians and their allies were by this time collected at corcyra there the generals began by holding ﬁnal review of the ships and disposed them in the order in which they were to anchor at their stations the ﬂeet was divided into three squadrons and one of them assigned by lot to each of the three generals in order to avoid any difﬁculties which might occur if they sailed together in ﬁnding water anchorage and provisions where they touched they thought also that the presence of general in each division would promote good order and discipline throughout the ﬂeet they then sent before them to italy and sicily three ships which had orders to ﬁnd out what cities in those regions would receive them and to meet them again on their way that they might know before they put in at length the great armament proceeded to cross from corcyra to sicily it consisted of hundred and triremes in all besides two rhodian vessels of ﬁfty oars of these hundred were athenian sixty being swift vessels and the remaining forty transports the rest of the ﬂeet was furnished by the chians and other allies the hoplites numbered in all ﬁve thousand one hundred of whom ﬁfteen hundred were athenians taken from the roll and seven hundred who served marines were of the fourth and lowest class of athenian citizens the remainder of the hoplites were furnished by the allies mostly by the subject states but ﬁve hundred came from argos besides two hundred and ﬁfty mantinean and other mercenaries the archers were in all four hundred and eighty of whom eighty were cretans there were seven hundred rhodian slingers hundred and twenty megarians who were exiles and one horse transport which conveyed thirty horsemen and horses such were the forces with which the ﬁrst expedition crossed the sea the transport of provisions thirty which also conveyed bakers masons carpenters and tools such are required in sieges were included in the armament it was likewise attended by hundred small vessels these well the were prest into the service other and lesser craft in great numbers followed of their own accord purposes of trade the whole ﬂeet now struck across the ionian sea from corcyra they arrived at the promontory of iapygia and at tarentum 32 each ship taking its own course and passed along the coast of italy the italian cities did not admit them within their walls or open market to them but allowed them water and anchorage tarentum and locri 33 refused even these at length they reached rhegium 34 the extreme point of italy where the ﬂeet reunited they were not received within the walls they encamped outside the city at the temple of artemis there they were provided by the inhabitants with market and drawing up their ships on shore they took rest they held conference with the rhegians and prest them being chalcidians themselves to aid their chalcidian kinsmen the leontines but the rhegians replied that they would be neutral and would only act in accordance with the decision of all the italian greeks the athenian commanders now began to consider how they could best commence operations in sicily meanwhile they were expecting the ships which had gone on and were to meet them from egesta 35 they wished to know whether the egestæans really had the money of which the messengers had brought inform ation to athens footnotes from book vi of the history of the peloponnesian war

took captive the whole of their great armament and did not allow them to escape either by sea or land so they at once began to close the mouth of the great harbor which was about mile wide by means of triremes and small boats placed broadside which they moored there they made every prepa ration also naval engagement should the athenians be willing to hazard another and all their thoughts were on grand scale the athenians seeing the closing of the harbor and inferring the intentions of the enemy proceeded to hold council the generals and ofﬁcers met and considered the difﬁculties of their position the most pressing was the want of food they had already sent to catana 37 when they intended to depart and stopt the supplies and they could get more unless they recovered the command of the sea they resolved therefore to quit their lines on the higher ground and to cut off by space close to their ships greater than was absolutely required their baggage and their sick after leaving guard there they meant to put on board every other man and to launch all their ships whether ﬁt service or not they would then ﬁght decisive battle and if they conquered go to catana but if not they would burn their ships and retreat by land in good order taking the nearest way to some friendly country barbarian or hellenic this design they proceeded to execute and withdrawing quietly from the upper walls manned their whole ﬂeet compelling every man of any age at all suitable service to embark the entire number of the ships which they manned was about hundre d and ten they put on board numerous archers and acarnanians 38 and other foreigners and made such preparations action the nature of the plan imposed upon them by their necessities allowed when all was nearly ready nicias 39 perceiving

orders to man the ships gylippus 40 and the syracusans could see clearly enough from the preparations which the athenians were making that they were going to ﬁght but they had also previous notice and had been told of the iron grapnels and they took precautions against this against all the other devices of the athenians they covered the prows of their vessels with hides extending good way along the upper part of their sides so that the grapnels might slip and ﬁnd hold when all was ready gylippus and the other generals exhorted their men when gylippus and the other syracusan generals had like nicias encouraged their troops perceiving the athenians to be manning their ships they presently did the same nicias overwhelmed by the situation and seeing how great and how near the peril was the ships were on the very point of rowing out feeling too men on the eve of great struggle that all which he had done was nothing and that he had not said half enough again addrest the trierarchs and

already put out with nearly the same number of ships before detachment of them guarded the entrance of the harbor the remain der were disposed all round it in such manner that they might fall on the athenians from every side at once and that their might at the same time be able to cooperate whenever the ships retreated to the shore sicanus and agatharchus comma nded the syracusan ﬂeet each of

the harbor previous engagement had been so ﬁerce and obstinate great was the eagerness with which the rowers on both sides rushed upon their enemies whenever the word of command was given and keen was

many places owing to the want of room they who had struck another found that they were struck themselves often two or even more vessels were 55 56 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world

city the commanders too when they saw any ship backing water without necessity would call the captain by his name and ask of the athenians whether they were retreating because they expected to be more at home upon the land of their bitterest foes than upon that sea which had been their own so long on the syracusan side whether when they knew perfectly well that the athenians were only eager to ﬁnd some means of ﬂight they would themselves ﬂy from the fugitives while the naval engagement hung in the balance the two armies on shore had great trial and conﬂict of soul the sicilian soldier was animated by the hope of increasing the glory which he had already won while the invader was tormented by the fear that his fortunes might sink lower still the last chance of the athenians lay in their ships and their anxiety was dreadful the fortune of the battle varied and it was not possibl that the spectators on the shore should all receive the same impression of it being quite close and having different points of view they would some of them see their own ships victorious their courage would then revive and they would earnestly call upon the gods not to take from them their hope of deliverance but others who saw their ships worsted cried and shrieked aloud and were by the sight alone more utterly unnerved than the defeated combatants themselves others again who had ﬁxt their gaze on some part of the struggle which was undecided were in state of excitement still more terrible they kept swaying their bodies to and fro in an agony of hope and fear the stubborn conﬂict went on and on at every instant they were all but saved or all but lost and while the strife hung in the balance you might hear in the athenian army at once lamentation shouting cries of victory or defeat and all the various sounds which are wrung from great host in extremity of danger not less agonizing were the feelings of those on board at length the syracusans and their allies after protracted struggle put the athenians to ﬂight and triumphantly bearing down upon them and encouraging one another with loud cries and exhortations drove them to the land then that part of the navy which had not been taken in the deep water fell back in confusion to the shore and the crews rushed out of the ships into the camp and the longer now divided in feeling but uttering one universal groan of intolerable anguish ran some of them to save the ships others to defend what remained of the wall but the greater number began to look to themselves and to their own safety never had there been greater panic in an athenian army than at that moment they now suffered what they had done to others at pylos at pylos 42 the lacedæmonians when they saw their ships destroyed knew that their friends who had crossed over into the island of sphacteria 43 were lost with them and so now the athenians after the rout of their ﬂeet knew that they had hope of saving themselves by land unless events took some extraordinary turn thus after ﬁerce battle and great destruction of ships and men on both sides the syracusans and their allies gained the victory they gathered up the wrecks and bodies of the dead and sailing back to the city erected trophy the athenians overwhelmed by their misery never so much thought of recovering their wrecks or of asking leave to collect their dead their intention was to retreat that very night on the third day after the when nicias and demosthenes thought that their preparations were complete the army began to move they were in dreadful condition not only was there the great fact that they had lost their whole ﬂeet and instea d of their expected triumph had brought the utmost peril upon athens well upon themselves 57 58 59 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume i of 10 greece https also the sights which presented themselves they quitted the camp were painful to every eye and mind the dead were unburied and when any one saw the body of friend lying on the ground he was smitten with sorrow and dread while the sick or wounded who still survived but had to be left were even greater trial to the living and more to be pitied than those who were gone their prayers and lamentations drove their companions to distraction they would beg that they might be taken with them and call by name any friend or relative whom they saw passing they would hang upon their departing comrades and follow far they could and when their limbs and strength failed them and they dropt behind many were the imprecations and cries which they uttered so that the whole army was in tears and such was their despair that they could hardly make up their minds to stir altho they were leavin g an enemy country having suffered calamities too great tears already and dreading miseries yet greater in the unknown future there was also general feeling of shame and they seemed not like an army but like fugitive populat ion of city captured after siege and of great city too the whole multitude who were marching together numbered not less than forty thousand each of them took with him anything he could carry which was likely to be of use even the and cavalry contrary to their practise when under arms conveyed about their persons their own food some because they had attendants others because they could not trust them they had long been deserting and most of them had gone off all at once nor was the food which they carried sufﬁcient the supplies of the camp had failed their disgrace and the universality of the misery altho there might be some consolation in the very community of suffering was nevertheless at that moment hard to bear especially when they remembered from what pomp and splendor they had fallen into their present low estate never had hellenic army experienced such reverse they had come intending to enslave others and they were going away in fear that they would be themselves enslaved instead of the prayers and hymns with which they had put to sea they were now departing amid appeals to heaven of another sort they were longer sailors but landsmen depending not upon their ﬂeet but upon their infantry yet in face of the great danger which still threatened them all these things appeared endurable when daylight broke and the syracusa ns and their allies saw that the athenians had departed most of them thought that gylippus had let them go on purpose and were very angry with him they easily found the line of their retreat and quickly following came up with them about the time of the midday meal the troops of demosthenes were last they were marching slowly and in disorde r not having recovered from the panic of the previous night when they were overtaken by the syracusans who immediately fell upon them and fought separated they were from the others they were easily hemmed in by the syracusan cavalry and driven into narrow space the division of nicias was much six miles in advance he marched faster thinking that their safety depended at such time not in remaining and ﬁghting if they could avoid it but in retreating quickly they could and resisting only when they were positively compelled demosthenes on the other hand who had been more incessantly harassed throughout the retreat because marching last was ﬁrst attacked by the enemy now when he saw the syracusans pursuing him instead of pressing onward had ranged his army in order of battle thus lingering he was surrounded and he and the athenians under his command were in the greatest danger and confusion they were crusht into walled enclosure having road on both sides and planted thickly with and missiles were hurled at them from all points the syracusans naturally preferred this mode of attack to regular engagement to risk themselves against desperate men would have been only playing into the hands of the athenians moreover every one was sparing of his life their good fortune was already assured and they did not wish to fall in the hour of victory even by this irregular mode of ﬁghting they thought that they could overpower and capture the athenians and so when they had gone on all day assailing them with missiles from every quarter and saw that they were quite worn out with their wounds and all their other sufferings 60 61 62 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume i of 10

length an agreement was made the entire force under demosthenes their arms were to be surrendered but one was to suffer death either from violence or from imprisonment or from want of the bare means of life so they all surrendered being in number six thousand and gave up what money they had this they threw into the hollows of shields and ﬁlled four the captives were at once taken to the city on the same day nicias and his division reached the river erineus which he crossed and halted his army on rising ground on the following day he was overtaken by the syracusans who told him that demosthenes had surrendered and bade him the same he not believing them procured truce while he sent horsema n to go and see upon the return of the horseman bringing assurance of the fact he sent herald to gylippus and the syracusans saying that he would agree on behalf of the athenian state to pay the expenses which the syracusans had incurred in the war on condition that they should let his army go until the money was paid he would give athenian citizens hostages man talent gylippus and the syracusans would not accept these proposals but attacked and surrounded this division of the army well the other and hurled missiles at them from every side until the evening they too were grievously in want of food and necessaries nevertheless they meant to wait the dead of the night and then to proceed they were just resuming their arms when the syracusans discovered them and raised the pæan the athenians perceiv ing that they were detected laid down their arms again with the exception of about three hundred men who broke through the enemy guard and made their escape in the darkness best they could when the day dawned nicias led forward his army and the syracusans and the allies again assailed them on every side hurling javelins and other missiles at them the athenians hurried on to the river assinarus they hoped to gain little relief if they forded the river the mass of horsemen and other troops overwhelmed and crusht them and they were worn out by fatigue and thirst but sooner did they reach the water than they lost all order and rushed in every man was trying to cross ﬁrst and the enemy pressing upon them at the same time the passage of the river became hopeless being compelled to keep close togethe r they fell one upon another and trampled each other under foot some at once perished pierced by their own spears others got entangled in the baggage and were carried down the stream the syracusans stood upon the further bank of the river which was steep and hurled missiles from above on the athenians who were huddled together in the deep bed of the stream and the most part were drinking greedily the peloponnesians came down the bank and slaughte red them falling chieﬂy upon those who were in the river whereupon the water at once became foul but was drunk all the same altho muddy and dyed with blood and the crowd fought it at last when the dead bodies were lying in heaps upon one another in the water and the army was utterly undone some perishin g in the river and any one who escaped being cut off by the cavalry nicias surrendered to gylippus in whom he had more conﬁd ence than in the syracusans he entreated him and the lacedæmonians to what they pleased with himself but not to go on killing the men so gylippus gave the word to make prisoners thereupon the survivors not including however large number whom the soldiers concealed were brought in alive the three hundred who had broken through the guard in the night the syracusans sent in pursuit and seized them the total of the public prisoners when collected was not great many were appropriated by the soldiers and the whole of sicily was full of them they not having capitulate d like the troops under demosthenes large number also perished the slaughter at the river being very great quite great any which took place in the sicilian war and not few had fallen in the frequent attacks

the greatest foe and the other the greatest friend of the lacedæmonians both in the same matter of pylos and sphacteria those who were imprisoned in the quarries were at the beginning of their captivity harshly treated by the syracusans there were great numbers of them and they were crowded in deep and narrow place at ﬁrst the sun by day was scorching and suffocating they had roof over

thousand greeks in their march to the black sea the story being chronicled in his famous anabasis fought on the spartan side in the battle of coronea banished from athens he settled at scillus in eleia spent his last years in corinth among his writings besides the anabasis are the hellenica cycropædia memorabilia of socrates and essays on hunting and horsemanship i the character of cyrus the younger 45 thus then died cyrus man who of all the persians since cyrus the elder was the most princely and most worthy of empire is agreed by all who appear to have had personal knowledge of him in the ﬁrst place while he was yet with his brother and the other youths he was boy and when he was receiving his education thought to surpass them all in everything without exception the sons of the persian nobles are educated at the gates of the king 46 where they may learn many lesson of virtuous conduct but can see or hear nothing disgraceful in this place the boys see some honored by the king and others disgraced and hear of them so that in their very childhood they learn to govern and to obey here cyrus ﬁrst of all showed himself most remarkable modesty among those of his own age and paying more ready obedience to his elders than even those who were inferior to him in station and next he was noted his fondness horses and managing them in superior manner they found him too very desirous of learning and most assiduous in practising the warlike exercises of archery and hurling the javelin when it suited his age he grew extremely fond of the chase and of braving dangers in encounters with wild beasts on one occasion he did not shrink from she bear that attacked him however in grappling with her he was dragged from his horse and received some wounds the scars of which were visible on his body but at last killed her the person who ﬁrst came to his assistance he made happy man in the eyes of many when he was sent down by his father satrap of lydia and great phrygia and cappadocia and was also appointed commander of all the troops whose duty it is to muster in the plain of castolus he soon showed that if he made league or compact with any one or gave promise he deemed it of the utmost importance not to break his word accordingly the states that were comm itted to his charge well individuals had the greatest conﬁdence in him and if any one had been his enemy he felt secure that if cyrus entered into treaty with him he should suffer infraction of the stipulation when 43 44 68 69 70 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume i of

would not abandon the cause of the exiles he both showed by his deeds and declared in words that he would never desert them since he had once become friend to them not even tho they should grow still fewer in number and be in worse condition than they were whenever any one did cyrus kindness or an injury he showed himself anxious to go beyond him in those respects and some used to mention wish of his that he desired to live long enough to outdo both those who had done him good and those who had done him ill in the requital that he should make accordingly to him alone of the men of our days were so great number of peop le desirous of committing the disposal of their property their cities and their own person yet one could with truth say this of him that he suffered the criminal or unjust to deride his authority he of all men inﬂicted punishment most unsparingly and there were often to be seen along the most frequented roads men deprived of their feet or hands or eyes so that in cyrus dominions it was possible any one greek or barbarian who did wrong to travel without fear whithersoever he pleased and having with him whatever might suit his convenience to those who showed ability war it is acknowledged that he paid distinguished honor his ﬁrst war was with the pisidians and mysians and marching in person into these countries he made those whom he saw voluntarily hazarding their lives in his service governors over the territory that he subdued and distinguished them with rewards in other ways so that the brave appeared to be the most fortunate of men while the cowardly were deemed ﬁt only to be their slaves there were therefore great numbers of persons who voluntarily exposed themselves to danger wherever they thought that cyrus would become aware of their exertions with regard to justice if any appeared to him inclined to display that virtue he made point of making such men richer than those who sought to proﬁt by injustice accordingly while in many other respe cts his affairs were administered judic iously he likewise possest an army worthy of the name it was not money that generals and captains came from foreign lands to enter into his service but because they were persuaded that to serve cyrus well would be more proﬁtable than any amount of monthly pay besides if any one executed his orders in superior manner he never suffered his diligence to go unrewarded consequently in every undertaking the ofﬁcers were said to be ready to assist him if he noticed any one that was skilful manager with strict regard to justice stocking the land of which he had the direction and securing income from it he would never take anything from such person but was ever ready to give him something in addition so that men labored with cheerfulness acquired property with conﬁdence and made concealment from cyrus of what each possest he did not appear to envy those who amassed riches openly but to endeavor to bring into use the wealth of those who concealed it whatever friends he made and felt to be well disposed to him and considered to be capable of assisting him in anything that he might wish to accomplish he is acknowledged by all to have been most successful in attaching them to him on the very same account on which he thought that he himself had need of that he might have cooperators in his he endeavor to prove an efﬁcient assistant to his friends in whatever he perceived any of them desirous of ef fecting he received many reasons more presents than perhaps any other single individual and these he outdid every one else in distributing among his friends having view to the character of each and to what he perceived each most needed whatever presents any one sent him of articles of personal ornament whether warlike accouterment or merely dress concerning these they said he used to remark that he could not 71 72 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume i of 10 greece https his own person with them all but that he thought friends well equipped were the greatest ornament man could have that he should outdo his friends indeed in conferring great beneﬁts is not at all wonderful since he was so much more able but that he should surpass his friends in kind attentions and an anxious desire to oblige appears to far more worthy of admiration frequently when he had wine served him of peculiarly ﬁne ﬂavor he would send ﬂagons of it to some of his friends with message to this effect cyrus has not some time met with pleasanter wine than this and he has therefore sent some of it to you and begs you will drink it with those whom you love best he would often too send geese partly eaten and the halves of loaves and other such things desiring the bearer to say in presenting them cyrus has been delighted with these and therefore wishes you also to taste of them wherever provender was scarce but he himself from having many attendants and from the care which he took was able to procure some he would send it about and desire his friends to give that provender to the horses that carried them so that hungry steeds might not carry his friends whenever he rode out and many were likely to see him he would call to him his friends and hold earne st conversation with them that he might show whom he held in honor so that from what i have heard i should think that one was ever beloved by greater number of persons either greeks or barbarians of this fact the following is proof that one deserted to the king from cyrus tho only subject except that orontes 48 attempted to so but he soon found the person whom he believed faithful to him more friend to cyrus than to himself while many came over to cyrus from the king after they had become enemies to each other and these too men who were greatly beloved by the king they felt persuaded that if they proved themselves brave soldiers under cyrus they would obtain from him more adequate rewards their services than from the king what occurred also at the time of his death is great proof well that he himself was man of merit that he could accura tely distinguish such were trustworthy well disposed and constant to their attachment when he was killed all his friends and the partakers of his table who were with him fell ﬁghting in his defense except ariæus who had been posted in command of the cavalry on the left and when he learned that

than the middle the sources of the river were said not to be far of hence they advanced three days march through much snow and level plain distance of ﬁfteen parasangs the third day march was extremely troublesome the north wind blew full in their faces completely parching up everything and benumbing the men one of the augurs in consequence advised that they should sacriﬁce to the wind and

shoes of raw hides had been made by the men themselves from the newly skinned oxen from such unavoidable sufferings some of the soldiers were left behind who seeing piece of ground of black appearance

up their cavalry before their main body and the thebans drew up theirs over against them but the cavalry of the thebans had been exercised in wars with the orchomenians and thespians while that of the lacedæm onians was at that time in very inefﬁcient condition the richest men maintained the horses and when notice of an expedition was given the men appointed came to ride them and each taking his horse and whatever arms were given him proceeded at once to the ﬁeld and thus the weakest and least spirited of all the men were mounted on horseback such was the cavalry on either side of the foot it was said that the lacedæmonians advanced with each enomoty drawn up three deep this arrangement making them not more than twelve deep in all the theban infantry in close array were not less than ﬁfty deep considering that if they could defeat the body of the enemy posted around the king the rest of the army would be an easy conquest soon cleombrotus began to lead forward against the enemy and even

royal tent and cleonymus his son were killed and the those who are called supporters of the polemarch and the rest being overpowered by the mass of the enemy were forced to fall back the lacedæmonians

quite defeated they were able when they had repassed the trench which was in front of the camp to form themselves under arms in the place from which they had set out their camp was nevertheless not on level ground but rather somewhat on an acclivity some of the lacedæmonians at the time who thought their disaster an insupportable disgrace exclaimed that they ought to prevent the enemy from erecting trophy and endeavor to recover the dead not by making truce but by ﬁghting anoth er battle however the polemarchs seeing that of the lacedæmonians in all nearly thousand had lost their lives and that of the spartan s who were in the ﬁeld to the number of about seven hundred about four hundred had fallen and observing also that all the auxiliaries were too dispirited to renew the combat and some of them not even concerne d at what had happened called council of the chief ofﬁcers and deliberated what course they ought to pursue and all were of opinion that they ought to fetch off the dead by truce they accordingly despatched herald to treat respecting truce the thebans soon afterward erected trophy and gave up the dead under truce after these occurrences the messenger who was sent with the news of the calamity to lacedæmon arrived there on the last day of the gymnopædiæ and after the chorus of men had made their entry the ephors when they heard of the calamity were greatly concerned i think they naturally must have been yet they did not order that chorus to withdraw but allowed them to ﬁnish the entertainment they then sent the names of the dead to their several relatives and gave notice to the women to make lamentations but to bear their afﬂiction in silence the day after person might have seen those whose relatives had died appearing in public with looks of cheerfulness and joy however of those whose relatives were said to be alive he would have seen but few and those going about with gloomy and dejected countenances footnotes from book vi of the hellenica at leuctra

regulations which i have mentione d are beneﬁcial alike in peace and in war but if any one wishes to learn what the lawg iver contrived better than other legislators with reference to military proceedings he may attend to the following particulars in the ﬁrst place then the ephors give the cavalry and infantry public notice of the years during which they must join the army well the artizans the lacedæmonians provide themselves in the ﬁeld with an abundance of all those things which people use in city and of whatever instruments an army may require in common orders are given to bring some on wagons and others on beasts of burden by this arrangement anything left behind is least likely to escape notice engagements in the ﬁeld he made the following arrangements he ordered that each soldier should have purple robe and brazen shield he thought that such dress had least resemblance to that of women and was excellently adapted the ﬁeld of battle it is soonest made splendid and is

thought that they thus appeared taller more manly and more terrible in the eyes of the enemy when they were thus equipped he divided them into six moræ of cavalry and armed infantry each of these moræ of the citizens has one polemarch four centurions eight captains of ﬁfty and sixteen enomotarchs the men of these moræ are sometimes according to the command issued form ed in enomotiæ sometimes by threes sometimes by sixes to what most people imagine that the arrangement of the lacedæmonians under arms is extremely complex they conceive the exact contrary to what is the fact in the lacedæmonian order the ofﬁcers are placed in the front ranks and each rank is in condition to perform everything which it is necessary it to perform so easy is it to understand this arrangement that one who can distinguish one man from another would fail of learning it it is assigned to some to lead and enjoined on others to follow shiftings of place by which the companies are extended or deepened are ordered by the word of the enomotarch by herald and in these there is nothing in the least difﬁcult to learn but how it is possible men in this arrangement even if they are thrown into confusion to ﬁght with an enemy presenting themselves on any quarter alike it is not so easy to understand except those who have been brought up under the institution of lycurgus the lacedæmonians with the greatest ease what appears extremel y difﬁcult to other men that are even accustomed to arms when they march in column one enomotia follows in the rear of another and if when they are in this order body of the enemy shows itself in front orders are given to each enomotarch to bring up his enomotia to the front on the left and this movement is made throughout the whole army until it presents itself in full array against the enemy but if again while they are in this order the enemy should show themselves in the rear each rank performs the evolution that the strongest may always be presented to the enemy but when the commander is on the left they not in that case consider themselves in worse condition but sometimes even in better if an enemy should attempt to encompass them he would come round not on the defenseless but on the armed side if on any occasion again it should appear advantageous any particular objec t that the commander should occupy the right wing they wheel the troop toward the wing and maneuver the main body until the commander is on the right and the rear becomes the left but if again the body of the enemy appear on the right marching in column they nothing else but turn each century round like ship so to front the enemy and thus the century which was in the rear comes to the right but if the enemy approach on the left they not allow them to come near but repulse them or turn their centuries round to face the enemy and thus again the century that was in the rear takes its place on the left footnotes from the treatise on the government of

classics volume i of 10 greece https person would buy horse that has been already ridden we shall subjoin some admonitions which he ought to bear in mind if he would not be cheated in his purchase in the ﬁrst place then let it not escape his notice what the age is horse that has longer the marks in his teeth neither delights the buyer with hope nor is so easy to be exchanged it is also necessary to see how he takes the rider on his back 55 many horses reluctantly receive on them anything which it is plain to them that they can not receive without being compelled to work it must likewise be observed whether when he is mounted he wishes to separate himself from other horses or whether if he be ridden near horses standing by he carries off his rider toward them there are some horses too that from bad training run of f from the place of exercise to their stalls at home horses whose jaws are not alike that sort of riding which is called the pede exposes them and still more change in the direction in which they are ridden many horses will not attempt to run away with their riders unless hard jaw and their course directed homeward concur to stimulate them we ought to ascertain also whether the horse being put to his speed is readily pulled up and whether he submits to be turned about it is good purchaser not to be too ignorant moreover whether horse is equally willing to obey when he is roused with blow servant and an army if disobedient are useless but disobedient horse is not only useless but often plays the traitor however when we take upon ourselve s to purchase warhorse we must make trial of him in all things in which war will make trial of him and these are leaping across ditches springing over walls jumping on to mounds and jumping down from them and we must try him in riding up and down steep places and along them all such efforts show his spirit whether it is bold and whether his body is sound yet we must not at once reject horse that does not accomplish all these feats perfectly many fail not from being unable but from want of training and if they are taught and used and exercised in such performances they will execute them all well provided they are sound in other respects and not wanting in spirit we must however be cautious of having anything to with horses that are naturally shy horses that are excessively timorous will not only not allow the rider on their back to harm the enemy but will often take him by surprize and expose him to great danger we must also learn whether the horse has anything of vice either toward other horses or toward men and whether he is averse to being handled all such defects are troublesome to his owner to any reluctance to being bridled and mounted and other tricks person will much sooner discover them if when the horse has been thoroughly exercised he attempt to to him what he did before he began to ride him since horses that after having been exercised are ready to submit to exercise again give sufﬁcient proofs of mettlesome spirit to sum up all in few words whatever horse has good feet is sufﬁciently swift is willing and able to endure fatigue and is in the highest degree obedient will probably give least trouble to his rider and contribute most to his safety in military occupations but horses that from sluggishness require great deal of driving or from excess of mettle much coaxing and care afford plenty of employment to the rider well much apprehension in time of danger we shall now show how man may groom horse with least danger to himself and most beneﬁt to the animal if when he cleans him he look the same way the horse there is danger that he may be struck in the face with his knee or his hoof but if he look in the opposite direction to the horse when he cleans him keeping himself out of the reach of his leg and rubs gradually down by the shoulder he will thus receive injury and may 88 89 90 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume i of 10 greece https the frog of the horse foot by turning up the hoof in like manner let him clean the hind legs but whoever is employed about horse ought to know that to these things and everything else that he has to he must come little possible near the face and the tail if horse be inclined to be vicious he has in both these parts the advant age of the man but person who approaches him at the side may manage the horse with least danger to himself and with most power over the beast when we have to lead horse we not approve of the practise of leading from behind these reasons that the person leading the horse is thus least able to keep on his guard against him and the horse has most liberty to what he pleases to the mode again of conducting him with long rein to teach him to go forward and take the lead we object the following reasons that the horse can mischief on whichever side he pleases and that by turning himself round he can set himself opposite his leader when there are number of horses together too how if they are thus led can they be prevented from annoying one another but horse that is accustomed to be led at the side will be least in condition to molest either other horses or men and will be readiest at hand his rider whenever he may require to mount in haste that the groom may put on the bridle properly let him ﬁrst approach the horse on the left side and then throwing the reins over the horse head let him suffer them to rest on the point of the shoulder and next let him take the headpiece in his right hand and apply the bit with his left if the horse take the bit into his mouth the man has nothing to but to put on the headpiece but if the horse will not open his mouth the man must hold the bit to his teeth and insert the middle ﬁnger of his left hand between the horse bars most horses when this is done open their mouths should the horse however not even then receive the bit let him press the lip against the or tusk and there are very few horses that on feeling this will not admit it but never to approach horse in ﬁt of anger is the one great precept and maxim of conduct in regard to the treatment of horse anger is destitute of foretho ught and consequently often does that of which the agent must necessarily repent when horse is shy of any object and reluctant to approach it the rider must try to make him feel that there is nothing terrible in it especially to horse of spirit but if he can not succeed the rider must himself touch that which appears so alarming and lead the horse up gently to it to those who force horses forward with blows in such case they merely inspire the animals with greater terror they imagine when they suffer any pain at such time that what they look upon with alarm is in some way the cause of it when the groom brings the horse to the rider we have objection that he should know how to make the horse stoop so that it may be easy to mount him yet we think every rider ought to take care to be able to mount even if the horse does not bend to him sometimes different horse will presen t himself and the same horse will not always be equally obedient when he has taken his seat whether on the horse bare back or on the cloth we not like that he should sit if he were on but if he were standing upright with his legs somewhat apart thus he will cling more ﬁrmly to the horse with his thighs and keeping himself erect he will be able to throw javelin or to strike blow on horseback if it be necessary with greater force but it is necessary to allow the leg well the foot to hang loose from the knee if rider keep his leg stiff and strike it against anything it may be broken but if the leg hang easy and anything strikes against it it will yield and yet not move the thigh from its position rider should also accustom himself to keep the parts of his body above the hips ﬂexible possible he will by this means be better able to exert himself and if any person should drag or push him he will be less likely to be thrown of 91 92 93 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume i of 10 greece https it be observed that when he is seated on the horse back he must ﬁrst teach the horse to stand quiet until he has drawn up his mantle if necessary and adjusted the reins and taken hold of his lance in such way it may most conveniently be carried then let him keep his left arm close to his side in such an attitude rider appears most graceful and his hand has the greatest power to reins we approve of such are equally balanced and not weak or slippery or too thick so that the hand which holds them may be able also to hold the spear when it is necessary when the rider gives the signal to the horse to start let him begin to advance at walking pace this pace is least likely to disturb the horse let him hold the reins if the horse be inclined to hold down his head rather high but if he be more disposed to carry it erect let him keep them lower thus he will best set off the horse ﬁgure after little if he trot at his natural pace he will ﬁnd his limbs become pliant without inconveni ence and will come with the greatest readiness to obey the whip since too it is the most approved practise to set off toward the left side the horse will most readily start on that side if when he lifts he is trotting the right foot the rider then give him the signal to gallop being then about to raise the left foot he will thus start with that foot and just at the moment that the rider turns him to the left he will make the ﬁrst spring in his gallop horse when he is turned to the right naturally leads off with the right foot and when turned to the left with the left foot footnotes from the treatise on horsemanship translated by watson mahaffy says this treatise on the horse shows an insight into the character of horses which would credit to modern book most readers of the treatise who are familiar with horses have remarked how true it all is of the horse we know him one commentator has remarked that the book reads if it might have been written by some educated man professionally attached to racing stables the ancients did not use the stirrup nor did they have saddle in the modern sense of the word pla to born in ægina of aristocratic parents about 427 died in athens in 347 originally called aristocles and surnamed plato because of his broad shoulders disciple of socrates and teacher of aristotle was the founder of the academic school in his youth successful gymnast soldier and poet traveled in egypt sicily and magna græcia arrested in syracuse by dionysius the tyrant and sold slave in ægina where he was released and returned to athens revisited syracu in 367 and 361 lived afterward in athens until his death which occurred at marriage feast 56 i the image of the cave 57 94 54 55 95 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume i of 10 greece https this i said imagine the enlightenment or ignorance of our nature in ﬁgure behold human beings living in sort of under ground den which has mouth open toward the light and reaching all across the den they have been here from their childhood and have their legs and necks chained so that they can not move and can see only before them the chains are arranged in such manner to prevent them from turning round their heads at distance above and behind them the light of ﬁre is blazing and between the ﬁre and the prisoners there is raised way and you will see if you look low wall built along the way like the screen which have before them over which they show the puppets i see he 58 said and you see i said men passing along the wall carrying vessels which appear over the wall also ﬁgures of men and animal s made of wood and stone and various materials and some of the passengers you would expect are talking and some of them are silent that is strange image he said and they are strange prisoners like ourselves i replied and they see only their own shadows or the shadow s of one another which the ﬁre throws on the opposite wall of the cave true he said how could they see anything but the shadows if they were never allowed to move their heads and of the objects which are being carried in like manner they would see only the shadows yes he said and if they were able to talk to one another would they not suppose that they were naming what was actually before them very true and suppose further that the prison had an echo which came from the other side would they not be sure to fancy that the voice which they heard was that of passing shadow question he replied there can be question i said that the truth would be to them just nothing but the shadows of the images that is certain and now look again and see how they are released and cured of their folly at ﬁrst when any one of them is liberated and compelled suddenly to go up and turn his neck round and walk and look at the light he will suffer sharp pains the glare will distress him and he will be unable to see the realities of which in his former state he had seen the shadows and then imagine some one saying to him that what he saw before was an illusion but that now he is approaching real being and has truer sight and vision of more real things will be his reply and you may further imagine that his instructor is pointing to the objects they pass and requiring him to name he not be in difﬁculty will he not fancy that the shadows which he formerly saw are truer than the objects which are now shown to him far truer and if he is compelled to look at the light will he not have pain in his eyes which will make him turn away to take refuge in the objects of vision which he can see and which he will conceive to be clearer than the things which are now being shown to him true he said 96 97 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume i of 10 greece https suppose once more that he is reluctantly dragged up steep and rugged ascent and held fast and forced into the presence of the sun himself you not think that he will be pained and irritated and when he approaches the light he will have his eyes dazzled and will not be able to see any of the realities which are now afﬁrmed to be the truth not all in moment he said he will require to get accustomed to the sight of the upper world and ﬁrst he will see the shadows best next the reﬂections of men and other objects in the water and then the objects themselves next he will gaze upon the light of the moon and the stars and he will see the sky and the stars by night better than the sun or the light of the sun by day certainly and at last he will be able to see the sun and not mere reﬂections of him in the water but he will see him he is in his own proper place and not in another and he will contemplate his nature certainly and after this he will reason that the sun is he who gives the seasons and the years and is the guardian of all that is in the visible world and in certain way the cause of all things which he and his fellows have been accustomed to behold question he said this allegory i said you may now append to the previous argument the prison is the world of sight the light of the ﬁre is the sun the ascent and vision of the things above you may truly regard the upward progress of the soul into the intellectual world that is my poor belief to which at your desire i have given expression whether i am right or not god only knows but whether true or false my opinion is that in the world of knowledge the idea of good appears last of all and is seen only with an effort and when seen is inferred also to be the universal author of all things beautiful and right parent of light and the lord of light in his world and the source of truth and reason in the other this is the ﬁrst great cause which he who would act rationally either in public or private life must behold i agree he said far i am able to understand you i should like to have your agreement in another matter i said i would not have you marvel that those who attain to this beatiﬁc vision are unwilling to descend to human affairs but their souls are ever hastening into the upper world in which they desire to dwell and this is very natural if our allegory may be trusted certainly that is quite natural and is there anything surprizing in one who passes from divine contemplation to human things misbehaving himself in ridiculous manner if while his eyes are blinking and before he has become accustomed to the darkness visible he is compelled to ﬁght in courts of law or in other places about the images or shadows of images of justice and is endeavoring to meet the conceptions of those who have never yet seen the absolute justice there is nothing surprizing in that he replied any one who has common sense will remember that the bewilderments of the eyes are of two kinds and arise from two causes either from coming out of the light or from going into the light which is true of the mind eye quite much of the bodily eye and he who remembers this when he sees the soul of any one whose vision is perplexed and weak will not be too ready to laugh he will ﬁrst ask whether that soul has come out of the brighter life and is unable to see because unaccustomed to the dark or having turned from darkness to the day is dazzled by excess of light and then he will count the one 98 99 100 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume i of 10 greece https in his condition and state of being and he will pity the other or if he have mind to laugh at the soul which comes from below into the light there will be more reason in this than in the laugh which greets the other from the den that he said is very just remark but if this is true then certain professors of education must be mistaken in saying that they can put knowledge into the soul which was not there before like giving eyes to the blind yes that is what they say he replied whereas i said our argument shows that the power is already in the soul and that the eye can not turn from darkness to light without the whole body so too when the eye of the soul is turned round the whole soul must be turned from the world of generation into that of being and become able to endure the sight of being and of the brightes t and best of is to say of the good very true and this is conversion and the art will be how to accomplish this easily and completely possible not implanting eyes they exist already but giving them right direction which they have not yes he said that may be assumed and hence while the other qualities seem to be akin to the body being infused by habit and exercise and not originally innate the virtue of wisdom is part of divine essence and has power which is everlasting and by this conversion is rendered useful and proﬁtable and is also capable of becoming hurtful and useless did you never observe the narrow intelligence ﬂashing from the keen eye of clever eager he is how clearly his paltry soul sees the way to his end he is the reverse of blind but his keen sight is taken into the service of evil and he is dangerous in proportio n to his intelligence very true he said but what if there had been circumcisio n of such natures in the days of their youth and they had been severed from the leaden weights i may call them with which they are born into the world which lead on to sensual pleasures such those of eating and drinking and drag them down and turn the vision of their souls about the things that are i say these natures had been released from these tendencies and turned round to the truth the very same faculty in these very same persons would have seen the other keenly they now see that on which the eye is ﬁxt that is very likely yes i said and there is another thing which is likely or rather necessary inference from what has proceeded that neither the uneducated and uninformed of the truth nor yet those who never make an end of their education will be able ministers of state not the former because they have single aim of duty which is the rule of their actions private well public nor the latter because they will not act at all except upon compulsion fancying that they are already in the islands of the blest very true he replied then i said the business of us who are the founders of the state will be to compel the best minds to attain that knowledge which has been already declared by us to be the greatest of that eminence they must ascend and arrive at the good and when they have ascended and seen enough we must not allow them to they now what you mean 101 102 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume i of 10 greece https mean that they remain in the upper world but this must not be allowed they must be made to descend again among the prisoners in the den and partake of their labors and honors whether they are worth having or not but is not this unjust he said ought we to give them an inferior life when they might have superior one you have again forgotten my friend i said the intention of the legislator he did not aim at making any one class in the state happy above the rest the happiness was to be in the whole state and he held the citizens together by persuasion and necessity making them benefactors of one another to this end he created them not that they should please themselves but they were to be his instruments in binding up the state true he said i had gotten that footnotes plato is one of the very few greek authors none of whose work has been lost he shares this good fortune with xenophon of the dialog plato was practically if not actually the originator and the form has survived to our day from the republic translated by benjamin jowett in this famous work plato describes an ideal commonwealth the speaker here is glaucon plato brother ii good and evil 59 i suppose that you are satisﬁed at having life of pleasure which is without pain and if you are satisﬁed and if you are unable to show any good or evil which does not end in pleasure and pain hear the consequences if this is true then i say that the argument is absurd which afﬁrms that man often does evil knowingly when he might abstain because he is seduced and amazed by pleasure or again when you say that man knowingly refuses to what is good because he is overcome at the moment by pleasure now that this is ridiculous will be evident if we only give up the use of various names such pleasant and painful and good and evil there are two things let us call them by two good and evil and then pleasant and painful assuming this let us go on to say that man does evil knowin g that he does evil but some one will ask why because he is overcome is the ﬁrst answer and by what is he overcome the inquirer will proceed to ask and we shall not be able to reply by pleasure the name of pleasure has been exchanged that of good in our answer then we shall say only that he is overcome by what he will reiterate by the good we shall have to reply indee d we shall nay but our questioner will rejoin with laugh if he be one of the swagge ring sort that is too ridiculous that man should what he knows to be evil when he ought not because he is overcome by good is that he will ask because the good was worthy or not worthy of conquering the evil and in answer to that we shall clearly reply because it was not worthy if it had been worthy then he who we say was overcome by pleasure would not have been wrong but how he will reply can the good be unworthy of the evil or the evil of the good is not the real explanation that they are out of proportion to each other either greater and smaller or more and fewer this we can not deny and when you speak of being overcome what you mean he will say but that you choose the greater evil in exchange the lesser 56 57 58 103 104 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume i of 10 greece https this being the case let us now substitute the names of pleasure and pain and say not before that man does what is evil knowingly but that he does what is painful knowingly and because he is overcome by pleasure which is unworthy to overcome and what measure is there of the relations of pleasure to pain other than excess and defect which means that they become greater and smaller and more and fewer and differ in degree if any one says yes socrates but immediate pleasure differs widely from future pleasure and pain to which i should reply and they differ in any other way except by reason of pleasure and pain there can be other measure of them and you like skilful weigher put into the balance the pleasures and the pains near and distant and weigh them and then say which outweighs the other if you weigh pleasures against pleasures you of course take the more and greater or if you weigh pains against pains you take the fewer and the less or if pleasures against pains then you choose that course of action in which the painful is exceeded by the pleasant whether the distant by the near or the near by the distant and you avoid that course of action in which the pleasant is exceeded by the painful would you not admit my friends that this is true i am conﬁdent that they can not deny this he agreed with well then i shall say if you admit that be so good to answer question not the same magnitudes appear larger to your sight when near and smaller when at distance they will acknowledge that and the same holds of thickness and number also sounds which are in themselves equal are greater when near and lesser when at distance they will grant that also now supposing that happiness consisted in making and taking large things what would be the saving principle of human life would the art of measuring be the saving principle or would the power of appearance is not the latter that deceiving art which makes us wander up and down and take the things at one time of which we repent at another both in our actions and in our choice of things great and small but the art of measurement is that which would away with the effect of appearances and showing the truth would fain teach the soul at last to ﬁnd rest in the truth and would thus save our life would not mankind generally acknowledg that the art which accomplishes this is the art of measurement yes he said the art of measurement suppose again the salvation of human life to depend on the choice of odd and even and on the knowledge of when men ought to choose the greater or less either in reference to themselves or to each other whether near or at distance what would be the saving principles of our lives would not knowledge knowledge of measuring when the question is one of excess and defect and knowledge of number when the question is of odd and even the world will acknowledge that will they not protagoras admitted that they would well then i say to them my friends seeing that the salvation of human life has been found to consist in the right choice of pleasures and the choice of the more and the fewer and the greater and the less and the nearer and not this measuring be consideration of excess and defect and equality in relation to one another that is undeniably true and this possessing measure must undeniably also be an art and science they will agree to that then you agree i said that the pleasant is the good and the painful evil and here i would beg my friend prodicus not to introduce his distinction of names whether he is disposed to say pleasurable delightful joyful however and in whatever way he rejoices to name them i will ask you most excellent prodicus to answer this in my sense prodicus laughed and assented did the others 105 106 107 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume i of 10 greece https my friends i said what you say to this are not all actions the tendency of which is to make life painless and pleas ant honorable and useful the honorable work is also useful and good this was admitted then i said if the pleasant is the good nobody does anything under the idea or conviction that some other thing would be better and is also attainable when he might the better and this inferiority of man to himself is merely ignorance the superiority of man to himself is wisdom they all assented and does not ignorance consist in having false opinion and being deceived about important matters to that they unanimously assented also then i said man voluntarily pursues evil or that which he thinks to be evil to prefer evil to good is not in human nature and when man is compelled to choose one of two evils one will choose the greater when he might have the less we all agreed to every word of this well i said there is certain thing called fear or terror and here prodicus i should particularly like to know whether you would agree with in deﬁning this fear or terror expectation of evil protagoras and hippias agreed but prodicus said that this was fear and not terror never mind about that prodicus i said but let ask whether if our former assertions are true man will pursue that which he fears when he need not would not this be in contradiction to the admission which has been already made that he thinks the things which he fears to be evil and one will pursue or voluntarily accept that which he thinks to be evil footnotes from the protagoras translated by benjamin jowett protagoras from whom this dialog gets its name was one of the greek sophists born about 481 and exiled from athens on charge of atheism his work entitled on the gods being publicly burned in the dialog which took place in the house of calias wealthy athenian gentleman besides protagoras there were present other sophists including hippias prodicus hippocrates alcibiades and critias iii socrates in praise of love 60 and now i will take my leave of you and rehearse the tale of love which i heard once upon time from diotima 61 of mantinea who was wise woman in this and many other branches of knowledge she was the same who deferred the plague of athens ten years by sacriﬁce and was my instructress in the art of love in the attempt that i am about to make i shall pursue agathon method and begin with his admissions which are nearly if not quite the same i made to the wise woman when she questioned 59 108 109 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume i of 10 greece https will be the easiest way and i shall take both parts myself well i can like agathon she spoke ﬁrst of the being and nature of love and then of his works and i said to her in nearly the same words which he used to that love was mighty god and likewise fair and she proved to i proved to him that in my way of speaking about him love was neither fair nor good what you mean diotima i said is love then evil and foul hush she cried is that to be deemed foul which is not fair certainly i said and is that which is not wise ignorant you not see that there is mean between wisdom and ignorance and what is this i said right opinion she replied which you know being incapable of giving reason is not knowledge how could knowledge be devoid of reason nor again ignorance neither can ignorance attain the truth but is clearly something which is mean between ignorance and wisdom quite true i replied not then insist she said that what is not fair is of necessity foul or what is not good is evil or infer that because love is not fair and good he is therefore foul and evil he is in mean between them well i said love is surely admitted by all to be great god by those who know or by those who know by all and how socra tes she said with smile can love be acknowledged to be great god by those who say that he is not god at all and who are they i said you and i are two of them she replied how can that be i said that is very intelligible she replied you yourself would acknowledge that the gods are happy and course you you dare to say that any god was not certainly not i replied and you mean by the happy those who are the possessors of things good or fair yes and you admitted that love because he was in want desires those good and fair things of which he is in want yes i admitted that but how can he be god who has share in the good or the fair that is not to be supposed then you see that you also deny the deity of love what then is love i asked is he mortal what then in the former instance he is neither mortal nor immortal but in mean between them what is he then diotima he is great spirit and like all that is spiritual he is intermediate between the divine and the mortal and what is the nature of this spiritual power i said this is the power she said which interprets and conveys to the gods the prayers and sacriﬁces of men and to men the commands and rewards of the gods and this power spans the chasm which divides them and in this all is bound together and through this the arts of the prophet and the priest their sacriﬁces and mysteries and charms and all prophecy and incantation ﬁnd their way god mingles not with man and through this power all the intercourse and speech of god with man whether awake or asleep is carried on the wisdom which understands this is spiritual all other wisdom such that of arts or handicrafts is mean and vulgar now these spirits or intermediate powers are many and divine and one of them is love and who i said was his father and who his mother the tale she said will take time nevertheless i will tell you on the birthday of aphrodite there was feast of the gods at which the god poros or plenty who is the son of metis or discretion was one of the guests when the feast was over penia or poverty the manner was came about the doors to beg now plenty who was the worse nectar there was wine in those days came into the garden of zeus and fell into heavy sleep and poverty considering her own straitened circumstances plotted to have him husband and accordingly she lay down at his side and conceived love who partly because he is naturally lover of the beautiful and because aphrodite is herself beautiful and also because he was born on aphrodite birthday is her follower and attendant and his parentage is so also are his fortunes in the ﬁrst place he is always poor and anything but tender and fair the many imagine him and he is and squalid and has shoes nor house to dwell in on the bare earth exposed he lies under the open heaven in the streets or at the doors of houses taking his rest and like his mother he is always in distress like his father too whom he also partly resembles he is always plotting against the fair and the good he is bold enterprising strong hunter of men always at some intrigue or other keen in the pursuit of wisdom and never wanting resources philosopher at all times terrible an enchanter sorcerer sophist he is neither mortal nor immortal he is alive and 110 111 112 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume i of 10 greece https at one moment when he is in plenty and dead at another moment and again alive by reason of his father nature but that which is always ﬂowing in is always ﬂowing out and so he is never in want and never in wealth and he is also in mean between ignorance and knowledge the truth of the matter is just this god is philosopher or seeker after wisdom he is wise already nor does any one else who is wise seek after wisdom neither the ignorant seek after wisdom herein is the evil of ignorance that he who is neither good nor wise is nevertheless satisﬁed he feels want and has therefore desire but who then diotima i said are the lovers of wisdom if they are neither the wise nor the foolish child may answer that question she replied they are those who like love are in mean between the two wisdom is most beautiful thing and love is of the beautiful and therefore love is also philosopher or lover of wisdom and being lover of wisdom is in mean between the wise and the ignorant and this again is quality which love inherits from his parents his father is wealthy and wise and his mother poor and foolish such my dear socrates is the nature of the spirit love the error in your conception of him was very natural and i imagine from what you say has arisen out of confusion of love and the made you think that love was all beautiful the beloved is the truly beautiful delicate and perfect and blest but the principle of love is of another nature and is such i have described i said thou strange woman thou sayest well and now assuming love to be such you say what is the use of him that socrates she replied i will proceed to unfold of his nature and birth i have already spoken and you acknowledge that love is of the beautiful but some one will say the beautiful in what socrates and diotima rather let us put the question more clearly and ask when man loves the beautiful what does he love i answered her that the beautiful may be his still she said the answer suggests further question which is this what is given by the possession of beauty that i replied is question to which i have answer ready then she said let put the word in the place of the beautiful and repeat the question what does he who loves the good desire the possession of the good i said and what does he gain who possesses the good happiness i replied there is difﬁculty in answering that yes she said the happy are made happy by the acquisition of good things nor is there any need to ask why man desires happiness the answer is already ﬁnal that is true i said and is this wish and this desire common to all and all men always desire their own good or only some men think you all men i replied the desire is common to all but all men socrates she rejoined are not said to love but only some of them and you say that all men are always loving the same things i myself wonder i said why that is there is nothing to wonder at she replied the reason is that one part of love is separated off and receives the name of the whole but the other parts have other names give an example i said she answered follows there is poetry which you know is complex and manifold and all creation or passage of into being is poetry or making and the processes of all art are creative and the masters of arts are all poets very true still she said you know that they are not called poets but have other names the generic term is conﬁned to that speciﬁc art which is separated off from the rest of poetry and is concerned with music and meter and this is what is called poetry and they who possess this kind of poetry are called poets very true i said and the same holds of love you may say generally that all desire of good and happiness is due to the great and subtle power of love but those who having their affections set upon him are yet diverted into the paths of or gymnastic philosophy are not called name of the genus is reserved those whose devotion takes one form they alone are said to love or to be lovers in that i said i am of opinion that you are right yes she said and you hear people say that lovers are seeking the half of themselves but i say that they are seeking neither the half nor the whole unless the half or the whole be also good and they will cut off their own hands and feet and cast them away if they are evil they love them not because they are their own but because they are good and dislike them not 113 114 115 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume i of 10 greece https they are another but because they are evil there is nothing which men love but the good you think that there is indeed i answered i should say not then she said the conclusion of the whole matter is that men love the good yes i said to which may be added that they love the possession of the good yes that may be added and not only the possession but the everlasting possession of the good that may be added too then love she said may be described generally the love of the everlasting possession of the good that is most true i said then if this be the nature of love can you tell further she said what is the manner of the pursuit what are they doing who show all this eagerness and heat which is called love answer that nay diotim i said if i had known i should not have wondered at your wisdom or have come to you to learn well she said i will teach you love is only birth in beauty whether of body or soul the oracle requires an explanation i said i understand you i will make my meaning clearer she replied i mean to say that which all men are bringing to the birth of their bodies and their souls there is certain age at which human nature is desirous of procreation and this procreation must be in beauty and not in deformity and this is the mystery of man and woman which is divine thing conception and generation are principle of immortality in the mortal creature and in the inharmonical they can never be but the deformed is always inharmonical with the divine and the beautiful harmonious beauty then is the destiny or goddess of partu rition who presides birth and therefore when approaching beauty the conceiving power is propitious and diffuse and benign and begets and bears fruit on the appearance of foulness she frowns and contracts in pain and is averted and morose and shrinks up and not without pang refra ins from conception and this is the reason why when the hour of conception arrives and the teeming nature is full there is such ﬂutter and ecstasy about beauty whose approach is the alleviation of pain love socrates is not you imagine the love of the beautiful only what then the love of generation and birth in beauty yes i said yes indeed she replied but why of birth i said because to the mortal birth is sort of eternity and immortality she replied and has been already admitted all men will necessarily desire immortality together with good if love is of the everlasting possession of the good all this she taught at various times when she spoke of love and on another occasion she said to what is the reason socrates of this love and the attendant desire see you not how all animals birds well beasts in their desire of procreation are in agony when they take the infection of love this begins with the desire of union to which is added the care of offspring in behalf of whom the weakest are ready to battle against the strongest even to the uttermost and to die them and will let themselves be tormented with hunger or suffer anything in order to maintain their offspring marvel not then at the love which all men have of their offspring that universal love and interest are the sake of immortality when i heard this i was astonished and said is this really true thou wise diotima and she answered with all the authority of sophist of that socrates you may be assured think only of the ambition of men and you will marvel at their senselessness unless you consider how they are stirred by the love of an immortality of fame they are ready to run risks greater far than they would have run their children and to spend money and under go any amount of toil and even to die the sake of leaving behind them name which shall be eternal you imagine that alcestis 62 would have died on behalf of admetus or achilles after patroclus or your own codrus in order to preserve the kingdom his sons if they had not imagined that the memory of their virtues which is still retained among us would be immortal nay she said i am persuaded that all men all things the sake of the glorious fame of immortal virtue and the better they are the more they desire this they are ravished with the desire of the immortal men whose bodies only are creative betake themselves to women and beget this is the character of their love their offspring they hope will preserve their 116 117 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume i of 10 greece https and give them the blessedness and immortality which they desire in the future but creative there are men who are more creative in their souls than in their that which is proper the soul to conceive or retain and what are these conceptions and virtue in general and such creators are all poets and other artists who may be said to have invention but the greatest and fairest sort of wisdom by far is that which is concerned with the ordering of states and families and which is called temperance and justic and he who in youth has the seed of these implanted in him and is himself inspired when he comes to maturity desires to beget and generate offspring and he wanders about seeking beauty that he may beget in deformity he will beget embraces the beautiful rather than the deformed and when he ﬁnds fair and noble and soul and there is union of the two in one person he gladly embraces it and to such soul he is full of fair speech about virtue and the nature and pursuits of good man and he tries to educate it and at the touch and presence of the beautiful he brings forth the beautiful which he conceived long before and the beautiful is ever present with him and in his memory even when absent and in company they tend that which he brings forth and they are bound together by far nearer tie and have closer friendship than those who beget mortal children the children who are their common offspring are fairer and more immortal who when he thinks of homer and hesiod 63 and other great poets would not rather emulate them in the creation of children such theirs which have preserved their memory and given them everlasting glory or who would not have such children lycurgus 64 left behind to be the saviors not only of lacedæmon but of hellas one may say there is solon too who is the revered father of athen ian laws and many others there are in various places both among hellenes and barbar ians they all have done many noble works and have been the parents of virtue of every kind and in honor of their children many temples have been raised which were never raised in honor of the mortal children of any one these are the lesser mysteries of love into which even you socrates may enter to the greater and more hidden ones which are the crown of these and to which if you pursue them in right spirit they will lead i know not whether you will be able to attain but i will my utmost to inform you and you follow if you can he who would proceed rightly in this matter should begin in youth to turn to beautiful forms and ﬁrst if his instructor guide him rightly he should learn to love one such form of that he should create fair thoughts and soon he will ﬁnd himself perceive that the beauty of one form is truly related to the beauty of another and then if beauty in gene ral is his pursuit how foolish would he be not to recognize that the beauty in every form is one and the same and when he perceives this he will abate his violent love of the one which he will despise and deem small thing and will become lover of all beautiful forms this will lead him on to consider that the beauty of the mind is more honorable than the beauty of the outward form so that if virtuous soul have but little comeliness he will be content to love and tend it and will search out and bring to the birth thoughts which may improve the young until his beloved is compelled to contemplate and see the beauty of institutions and laws and understan d that all is of one kindred and that personal beauty is only triﬂe and after laws and institutions he will lead him on to the sciences that he may see their beauty being not like servant in love with the beauty of one youth or man or institution himself slave mean and calculating but looking at the abundance of beauty and drawing toward the sea of beauty and creating and beholding many fair and noble thoughts and notions in boundless love of wisdom until at length he grows and waxes strong and at last the vision is revealed to him of single science which is the science of beauty everywhere such phædrus 65 i speak not only to you but to all the words of diotima and i am persuaded of their truth and being persuaded of them i try to persuade others that in the attainment of this end human nature will not easily ﬁnd better helper than love and therefore also i say that every man ought to honor him i myself honor him and walk in his ways and exhort others to the same even i praise the power and spirit of love according to the measure of my ability now and ever 118 119 120 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume i of 10 greece

and more brilliant than the phædo being intensely greek it has however seemed alien if not offensive to many modern readers scholars have valued it highly vivid picture of the manners of the most reﬁned society of athens it has sometimes been called the banquet under that name the poet shelley made translation the banquet described took place in the house of the tragic poet agathon agathon was born about 477 of rich and eminent athenian family he was remarkable personal accomplishments rather than high literary genius he is believed to have died at the age of diotima priestess reputed to have been pythagorean but some writers have doubted her existence the wife of admetus thessalian king who sacriﬁced her life in order to save that of her husband hesiod whose home was in bœotia is thought to have lived about three centuries after homer that is about 800 he was shepherd in his youth and began to write verses while tending his ﬂocks lived probably in the ninth century and the traditional author of the laws by which sparta was governed several centuries an athenian son of pythocles and friend of plato but of whom nothing more is known iv the praise of socrates by alcibiades 66 when socrates had done speaking the company applauded and aristophanes 67 was beginning to say something in answer to the allusion which socrates had made to his own speech when suddenly there was great knocking at the door of the house of revelers and the sound of was heard agathon told the attendants to go and see who were the intruders if they are friends of ours he said invite them in but if not say that the drinking is over little while afterward they heard the voice of alcibiades resounding in the court he was in great state of intoxication and kept roaring and shouting where is agathon lead to agathon and at length supported by the and some of his compa nions he found his way to them hail friends he said appearing at the door crowned with massive garland of ivy and and having his head ﬂowing with ribbons will you have very drunken man companion of your revels or shall i crown agathon was my intention in coming and go my way i was unable to come yesterday and therefore i come carrying on my head three ribbons that taking them from my own head i may crown the head of this fairest and wisest of men i may be allowed to call him will you laugh at because i am drunk yet i know very well that i am speaking the truth altho you may laugh but ﬁrst tell whether i shall come in on the understanding that i am drunk will you drink with or not 60 61 62 63 64 65 121 122 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume i of 10 greece https company were vociferous in begging that he should take his place among them and agathon specially invited him thereupon he was led in by the people who were with him and he was being led he took the crown and ribbons from his head intending to crown agathon and had them before his eyes this prevented him from seeing socrates who made way him and alcibiades took the vacant place between agathon and socrates and in taking the place he embraced agathon and crowned him take off his sandals said agathon and let him make third on the same couch by all means but who makes the third partner in our revels said alcibiade s turning round and starting up he caught sight of socrates by heracles he said wha t is this here is socrates always lying in wait and always his way is coming out at all sorts of unexpected places and now what have you to say yourself and why are you lying here where i perceive that you have contrived to ﬁnd place not by professor or lover of jokes like aristophanes but by the fairest of the company socrates turned to agathon and said i must ask you to protect agathon this passion of his has grown quite serious matter since i became his admirer i have never been allowed to speak to any other fair one or so much to look at them if i he goes wild with envy and jealousy and not only abuses but can hardly keep his hands off and at this moment he may some harm please see to this and either reconcile to him or if he attempt violence protect i am in bodily fear of his mad and passionate attempts there can never be reconciliation between you and said alcibiades but the present i will defer your chastisement and i must beg you agathon to give back some of the ribbons that i may crown the marvelous head of this universal despot i would not have him complain of crowning you and neglecting him who in conversation is the conqueror of all mankind and this not once only you were the day before yesterday but always then taking some of the ribbons he crowned socrates and again reclined when he had lain down again he said you seem my friends to be sober which is thing not to be endured you must drink that was the agreement which i made with i elect myself master of the feast until you are quite drunk let have large goblet agathon or rather he said addressing the attendant bring that the which caught his eye was vessel holding more than two quarts this he ﬁlled and emptied and bade the attendant ﬁll it again socrates observe my friends said alcibiades that my ingenious device will have effect on socrates he can drink any quantity of wine and not be at all nearer being drunk socrates drank the cup which the attendant ﬁlled him i shall praise socrates in ﬁgure which will appear to him to be caricature and yet i not mean to laugh at him but only to speak the truth i say then that he is exactly like the masks of silenus which may be seen sitting in the statuaries shops having pipes and ﬂutes in their mouths and they are made to open in the middle and there are images of gods inside them i say also that he is like marsyas the satyr you will not deny this socrates that your face is like that of satyr aye and there is resemblance in other points too example you are i am in position to prove by the evidence of witnesses if you will not confess and are you not that you are and far more wonderful performer than mars yas he indeed with instruments charmed the souls of men by the power of his breath the performers of his music still the melodies of olympus are derived from the teaching of marsyas and these whether they are played by great master or by miserable girl have power which others have they alone possess the soul and reveal the wants of those who have need of gods and mysteries because they are inspired but you produce the same effect with the voice only and not require the ﬂute that is the difference between you and him when we hear any other speaker even very good one his words produce absolutely effect upon us in comparison whereas the very fragments of you and your words even at and however imperfectly repeated amaze and possess the souls of every man woman and child who comes within 123 124 125 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume i of 10 greece https of them and if i were not afraid that you think drunk i would have sworn to well spoken of the inﬂuence which they have always and still have over my heart leaps within more than that of any corybantian 68 reveler and my eyes rain tears when i hear him and i observe that many others are affected in the same way i have heard pericles and other great orators but tho i thought that they spoke well i never had any similar feeling my soul was not stirred by them nor was i angry at the thought of my own slavish state but this marsya s has often brought to such pass that i have felt if i could hardly endure the life which i am leading this socrates you admit and i am conscious that if i did not shut my ears against him and ﬂy from the voice of the siren he would detain until i grew old sitting at his feet he makes confess that i ought not to live i neglecting the wants of my own soul and busying myself with the concerns of the athenians therefore i hold my ears and tear myself away from him and he is the only person who ever made ashamed which you might think not to be in my nature and there is one else who does the same i know that i can not answer him or say that i ought not to he bids but when i leave his presence the love of popularity gets the better of and therefore i run away and ﬂy from him and when i see him i am ashamed of what i have confest to him and many time i wish that he were dead and yet i know that i should be much more sorry than glad if he were to die so that i am at my wit end and this is what i and many others have suffered from the of this satyr yet hear once more while i show you how exact the image is and how marvelous his power i am sure that none of you know him but i know him and will describe him i have begun see you how fond he is of the fair he is always with them and is always being smitten by them and then again he knows nothing and is ignorant of all is the appearance which he puts on is he not like silenus in this yes surely that is his outer mask which is the carved head of the silenus but when he is opened what temperance there is i may say to you my companions in drink residing within know you that beauty and wealth and honor at which the many wonder are of account with him and are utterly despised by him he regards not at all the persons who are gifted with them mankind are nothing to him all his life is spent in mocking and ﬂouting at them but when i opened him and looked within at his serious purpose i saw in him divine and golden images of such fascinating beauty that i was ready to in moment whatever socrates commanded they may have escaped the observation of others but i saw them now i thought that he was seriously enamored of my beauty and this appeared to be grand opportunity of hearing him tell what he knew i had wonderful opinion of the attractions of my youth in the prosecution of this design when i next went to him i sent away the attendant who usually accompanied i will confess the whole truth and beg you to listen and if i speak falsely you socrates expose the falsehood well he and i were alone together and i thought that when there was nobody with us i should hear him speak the language of love lovers and i was delighted not word he conversed usual and spent the day with and then went away afterward i challenged him to the palestra and he wrestled and closed with several times alone i fancied that i might succeed in this way not bit there was use in that lastly i had failed hitherto i thought that i must use stronger measures and attack him boldly i had begun and not give him up until i saw how the matter stood so i invited him to supper just if he were fair youth and i designing lover he was not easily persuaded to come he did however after while accept the invitation and when he came the ﬁrst time he wanted to go away at once soon supper was over and i had not the face to detain him and yet i could not help wondering at his natural temperance and and courage i never could have thought that i should have met with man like him in wisdom and endurance neither could i be angry with him or renounce his company any more than i could hope to win him i well knew that if ajax could not be wounded by steel much less he by money and i had failed in my only chance of captivating him so i wandered about and was at my wit end one was ever more hopelessly enslaved by another all this i should explain happened before he and i went on the expedition to 126 127 128 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume i of 10 greece https there we messed together and i had the opportunity of observing his extraordinary power of sustaining fatigue and going without food when our supplies were intercepted at any place will happen with an army in the faculty of endurance he was superior not only to but to everybody else there was one to be compared to him yet at festival he was the only person who had any real powers of enjoyment and tho not willing to drink he could if compelled beat us all at that and the most wonderful thing of all was that human being had ever seen socrates drunk and that if i am not mistaken will soon be tested his endurance of cold was also surprizing there was severe frost the winter in that region is really tremendous and everybody else either remained indoors or if they went out had on end of clothing and were well shod and had their feet swathed in felt and ﬂeeces in the midst of this socrates with his bare feet on the ice and in his ordinary dress marched better than any of the other soldiers who had their shoes on and they looked daggers at him because he seemed to despise them i have told you one tale and now i must tell you another which is worth hearing of the doings and sufferings of this enduring man while he was on the expedition one morning he was thinking about something which he could not resolve and he would not give up but continued thinking from early dawn until he stood ﬁxt in thought and at noon attention was drawn to him and the rumor ran through the wondering crowd that socrates had been standing and thinking about something ever since the break of day at last in the evening after supper some ionians out of curiosity i should explain that this was not in the winter but in summer brought out their mats and slept in the open air that they might watch him and see whether he would stand all night there he stood all night well all day and the following morning and with the return of light he offered up prayer to the sun and went his way i will also tell if you indeed i am bound to his courage in battle who but he saved my life now this was the engagement in which i received the prize valor i was wounded and he would not leave but he rescued and my arms and he ought to have received the prize of valor which the generals wanted to confer on partly on account of my rank and i told them so this socrates will not impeach or deny but he was more eager than the generals that i and not he should have the prize there was another occasion on which he was very noticeable this was in the ﬂight of the army after the battle of delium and i had better opportunity of seeing him than at potidæa i was myself on horseback and therefore comparatively out of danger he and laches were retreating the troops were in ﬂight and i met them and told them not to be discouraged and promised to remain with them and there you might see him aristophanes you describe just he is in the streets of athens stalking like pelican and rolling his eyes calmly contemplating enemies well friends and making very intelligible to anybody even from distance that whoever attacks him will be likely to meet with stout resistance and in this way he and his companion these are the sort of persons who are never touched in war they pursue only those who are running away headlong i particularly observed how superior he was to laches in presence of mind many are the wonders of socrates which i might narrate in his praise most of his ways might perhaps be paralleled in others but the most astonishing thing of all is his absolute unlikeness to any other human being that is or ever has been you may imagine brasidas and others to have been like achilles or you may imagine nestor and anteno r to have been like pericles and the same may be said of other famous men but of this strange being you will never be able to ﬁnd any likeness however remote either among men who now are or who ever have been except that which i have already suggested of silenus and the satyrs and this is an allegory not only of himself but also of his words altho i forgot to mention this before his words are ridiculous when you ﬁrst hear them he clothes himself in language that is the skin of the wanton his talk is of and smiths and cobblers and curriers and he is always repeating the same things in the same words so that an ignorant man who did not know him might feel disposed to laugh at him but he who pierces the mask and sees what is within will ﬁnd that they are the only words which have meaning in them and also the most divine 129 130 131 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume i of 10 greece https in fair examples of virtue and of the largest discourse or rather extending to the whole duty of good and honorable man this friends is my praise of socrates i have added my blame of him his ill treatment of and he has ill treate d not only but charmides 69 the son of glaucon and euthydemus 70 the son of diocles and many others in the same beginning their lover he has ended by making them pay their addresses to him wherefore i say to you agathon not deceived by him learn from and take warning and be fool and learn by experience the proverb says when alcibiades had done speaking there was laugh at his plainness of speech he seemed to be still in love with socrates you are sober alcibiades said socrates or you would never have gone about to hide the purpose of your satyr praises all this long story is only an ingenious circumlocution the point of which comes in by the way at the end you want to get up quarrel between and agathon and your notio n is that i ought to love you and nobody else and that you and you only ought to love agathon but the plot of this satyric or selinic drama has been detected and you must not allow him agathon to set us at variance i believe you are right said agathon and i am disposed to think that his intention in placing himself between you and was only to divide us but he shall gain nothing by that move i will go and lie in the couch next to you yes yes replied socrates by all means come here and lie on the couch below alas said alcibiades how am i fooled by this man he is determined to get the better of at every turn i beseech you allow agathon to lie between us impossible said socrates you praised and i ought to praise my neighbor on the right he will be out of order in praising again when he ought rather to be praised by and i must entreat you to consent to this and not be jealous i have great desire to praise the youth ha ha cried agathon i will rise instantly that i may be praised by socrates the usual way said alcibiades where socrates is one else has any chanc with the fair and now how readily has he invented specious reason attracting agathon to himself footnotes from the symposium translated by benjamin jowett this picture of socrates is declared by mahaffy to be the most wonderful of all pictures of him inasmuch it shows him in all his ugliness his fascination his deep sympathy his iron courage his unassailable chastity mahaffy enthusiasm has been shared by many writers and readers in all generations the famous comic poet and dramatist author of the frogs clouds birds and many other works of which only eleven are now extant born about 451 died not later than the corybantes were priests of the phrygian goddess rhea worship of whom was exprest in dances which

difﬁculty in knowing what to with yourself if you escape men will love you in other places to which you may go and not in athens only there are friends of mine in thessaly if you like to go to them who will value and protect you and thessalians will give you any trouble nor can i think that you are justiﬁed socrates in betraying your own life when you might be saved this is playing into the hands of your enemies and destroyers and moreover i should say that you were betraying your children you might bring them up and educate them instead of which you go away and leave them and they will have to take their chance and if they not meet with the usual fate of orphans there will be small thanks to you man should bring children into the world who is unwilling to persevere to the end in their nurture and education but you are choosing the easier part i think not the better and manlier which would rather have become one who professes virtue in all his actions like yourself and indeed i am ashamed not only of you but of us who are your friends when i reﬂect that this entire business of yours will be attributed to our want of courage the trial need never have come on or might have been brought to another issue and the end of all which is the crowning absurdity will seem to have been permitted by us through cowardice and baseness who might have saved you you might have saved yourself if we had been good anything there was difﬁculty in escaping and we did not see how disgraceful socrates and also miserable all this will be to us well you make your mind up then or rather have your mind already made up the time of deliberation is over and there is only one thing to be done which must be done if at all this very night and which any delay will render all but impossible i beseech you therefore socrates to be persuaded by and to i say socrates from these premises i proceed to argue the question whether i ought or ought not to try and escape without the conse nt of the athenians and if i am clearly right in escaping then i will make the attempt but if not i will abstain the other considerations which you mention of money and loss of character and the duty of educating children are i fear only the doctrines of the multitude who would be ready to call people to life if they were able they are to put them to with little reason but now since the argument has thus far prevailed the only question which remains to be considered is whether we shall rightly either in escaping or in suffering others to aid in our escape and paying them in money and thanks or whether we shall not rightly and if the latter then death or any other calamity which may ensue on my remai ning here must not be allowed to enter into the calculation crito i think that you are right socrates how then shall we proceed socrates let us consider the matter together and you either refute if you can and i will be convinced or else cease my dear friend from repeating to that i ought to escape against the wishes of the athenians i am extremely desirous to be persuaded by you but not against my own better judgment and now please to conside r my ﬁrst position and your best to answer crito i will my best 133 134 135 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume i of 10 greece https again crito may we evil crito surely not socrates socrates and what of doing evil in return evil which is the morality of the many is that just or not crito not just socrates doing evil to another is the same injuring him crito very true socrates then we ought not to retaliate or render evil evil to any one whatever evil we may have suffered from him but i would have you consider crito whether you really mean what you are saying this opinion has never been held and never will be held by any considerable number of persons and those who are agreed and those who are not agreed upon this point have common ground and can only despise one another when they see how widely they differ tell then whether you agree with and assent to my ﬁrst principle that neither injury nor retaliation nor warding off evil by evil is ever right and shall that be the premise of our argument or you decline and dissent from this this has been of old and is still my opinion but if you are of another opinion let hear what you have to say if however you remain of the same mind i will proceed crito you may proceed i have not changed my mind socrates then i will proceed to the next step which may be put in the form of question ought man to what he admits to be right or ought he to betray the right crito he ought to what he thinks right socrates but if this is true what is the application in leaving the prison against the will of the athenians i wrong any or rather i not wrong those whom i ought least to wrong i not desert the principles which were acknowledged by us to be just what you say crito i can not tell socrates i not know socrates then consider the matter in this way imagine that i am about to play truant you may call the proceeding by any name which you like and the laws and the government come and interrogate tell us socrates they say what are you about are you going by an act of yours to overturn laws and the whole state far in you lies you imagine that state can subsist and not be overthrown in which the decisions of law have power but are set aside and overthrown by individuals what will be our answer crito to these and the like words any one and especially clever rhetorician will have good deal to urge about the evil of setting aside the law which requires sentence to be carried out and we might reply yes but the state has injured us and given an unjust sentence suppose i say that crito very good socrates socrates and was that our agreement with you the law would say or were you to abide by the sentence of the state and if i were to express astonishment at their saying this the law would probably add answer socrates instead of opening your eyes you are in the habit of asking and answering questions tell us what complaint you have to make against us which justiﬁes you in attempting to destroy us and the state in the ﬁrst place did we not bring you into existence your father married your mother by our aid and begot you say whether you have any objection to urge against those of us who regulate marriage none i should reply or against those of us who regulate the system of nurture and education of children in which you were trained were not the laws which have the charge of this right in commanding your father to train you in music and 136 137 138 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume i of 10 greece https right i should say well then since you were brought into the world and nurtured and educated by us can you deny in the ﬁrst place that you are our child and slave your fathers were before you and if this is true you are not on equal terms with us nor can you think that you have right to to us what we are doing to you would you have any right to strike or revile or any other evil to father or to your master if you had one when you have been struck or reviled by him or received some other evil at his hands you would not say this and because we think right to destroy you you think that you have any right to destroy us in return and your country far in you lies and will you professor of true virtue say that you are justiﬁed in this has philosopher like you failed to discover that our country is more to be valued and higher and holier far than mother or father or any master and more to be regarded in the eyes of the gods and of men of understanding also to be soothed and gently and reverently entreated when angry even more than father and if not persuaded obeyed and when we are punished by her whet her with imprisonment or stripes the punishment is to be endured in silence and if she lead us to wounds or death in battle thither we follow is right neither may any one yield or retreat or leave his rank but whether in battle or in court of law or in any other place he must what his city and his country order him or he must change their view of what is just and if he may violence to his father or mother much less may he violence to his country what answer shall we make to this crito the laws speak truly or they not crito i think that they socrates then the laws will say consider socrates if this is true that in your present attempt you are going to us wrong after having brought you into the world and nurtured and educated you and given you and every other citizen share in every good that we had to give we further proclaim and give the right to every athenian that if he does not like us when he has come of age and has seen the ways of the city and made our acquaintance he may go where he pleases and take his goods with him and none of our laws will forbid him or interfere with him any of you who does not like us and the city and who wants to go to colony or to any other city may go where he likes and take his goods with him but he who has experience of the manner in which we order justice and administer the state and still remains has entered into an implied contract that he will we command him and he who disobeys us is we maintain thrice wrong ﬁrst because in disobeying us he is disobeying his parents secondly because we are the authors of his education thirdly because he had made an agreement with us that he will duly obey our commands and he neither obeys them nor convinces us that our commands are wrong and we not rudely impose them but give him the alternative of obeying or convincing us that is what we offer and he does neither these are the sort of accusations to which we were saying you socrates will be exposed if you accomplish your intentions you above all other athenians suppose i ask why is this they will justly retort upon that i above all other men have acknowledged the agreement there is clear proof they will say socrates that we and the city were not displeasing to you of all athenians you have been the most constant resident in the city which you never leave you may be supposed to love you never went out of the city either to see the games except once when you went to the isthmus or to any other place unless when you were on military service nor did you travel other men nor have you any curiosity to know other states or their laws your affections did not go beyond us and our state we were your special favorites and you acquiesced in our government of you and this is the state in which you begot your children which is proof of your satisfaction moreover you might if you had liked have ﬁxt the penalty at banishment in the course of the state which refuses to let you go now would have let you go then but you pretended that you preferred death to exile and that you were not grieved at death and now you have forgotten these ﬁne sentiments and pay respect to us the laws of which you are the destroyer and are doing what only miserable slave would running away and turning your back upon the compacts and agreements which you made citizen and ﬁrst of all answer this very question are 139 140 141 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume i of 10 greece https right in saying that you agreed to be governed according to us in deed and not in word only is that true or not how shall we answer that crito must we not agree crito there is help socrates socrates then will they not say you socrates are breaking the covenants and agreements which you made with us at your leisure not in any haste or under any compulsion or deception but having had seventy years to think of them during which time you were at liberty to leave the city if we were not to your mind or if our covenants appeared to you to be unfair you had your choice and might have gone either to lacedæmon or crete which you often praise their good government or to some other hellenic or foreign state whereas you above all other athenians seemed to be so fond of the state or in other words of us her laws who would like state that has laws that you never stirred out of her the halt the blind the maimed were not more stationary in her than you were and now you run away and forsake your agreements not so socrates if you will take our choice not make yourself ridiculous by escaping out of the city just consider if you transgress and err in this sort of way what good will you either to yourself or to your friends that your friends will be driven into exile and deprived of citizenship or will lose their property is tolerably certain and you yourself if you ﬂy to one of the neighboring cities example thebes or megara both of which are cities will come to them an enemy socrates and their government will be against you and all patriotic citizens will cast an evil eye upon you subverter of the laws and you will conﬁrm in the minds of the judges the justice of their own condemnation of you he who is corrupter of the laws is more than likely to be corrupter of the young and foolish portion of mankind will you then ﬂee from cities and virtuous men and is existence worth having on these terms listen then socrates to us who have brought you up think not of life and children ﬁrst and of justice afterward but of justice ﬁrst that you may be justiﬁed before the princes of the world below neither will you nor any that belong to you be happier or holier or juster in this life or happier in another if you crito bids now you depart in innocence sufferer and not doer of evil victim not of the laws but of men but if you go forth returning evil evil and injury injury breaking the cove nants and agreements which you have made with us and wronging those whom you ought least to is to say yourself your friends your country and shall be angry with you while you live and our brethren the laws in the world below will receive you an enemy they will know that you have done your best to destroy us listen then to us and not to crito this is the voice which i seem to hear murmuring in my ears like the sound of the ﬂute in the ears of the mystic that voice i say is humming in my ears and prevents from hearing any other and i know that anything more which you may say will be vain yet speak if you have anything to say crito i have nothing to say socrates socrates then let follow the intimations of the will of god footnotes from the crito translated by benjamin jowett crito was an inﬂuential and citizen of athens and friend of socrates but nothing more deﬁnite about him is known 142 71 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume i of 10 greece https the death of socrates 72 already the tragic poet would say the voice of fate calls soon i must drink the poison and i think that i had better repair to the bath ﬁrst in order that the women may not have the trouble of washing my body after i am dead when he had done speaking crito said and have you any commands us socrates to say about your children or any other matter in which we can serve you nothing particular he said only i have always told you i would have you to look to yourselves that is service which you may always be doing to and mine well to yourselves and you need not make professions if you take thought yourselves and walk not according to the precepts which i have given you not now the ﬁrst time the warmth of your professions will be of avail we will our best said crito but in what way would you have us bury you in any way that you like only you must get hold of and take care that i not walk away from you then he turned to us and added with smile i can not make crito believe that i am the same socrates who has been talking and conducting the argument he fancies that i am the other socrates whom he will soon see dead he asks how shall he bury and tho i have spoken many words in the endeavor to show that when i have drunk the poison i shall leave you and go to the joys of the words of mine with which i comforted you and myself have had i perceive effect upon crito and therefore i want you to be surety now he was surety at the trial but let the promise be of another sort he was my surety to the judges that i would remain but you must be my surety to him that i shall not remain but go away and depart and then he will suffer less at my death and not be grieved when he sees my body being burned or buried i would not have him sorrow at my hard lot or say at the burial we lay out socrates or we follow him to the grave or bury him false words are not only evil in themselves but they infect the soul with evil be of good cheer then my dear crito and say that you are burying my body only and with that is usual and you think best when he had spoken these words he arose and told us to wait until he went into the chamber with crito and we waited talking and thinking of the subject of discourse and also of the greatness of our sorrow he was like father of whom we were being bereaved and we were about to pass the rest of our lives orphans when he had taken the bath his children were brought to he had two young sons and an elder one and the women of his family also came and he talked to them and gave them few directions in the presence of crito and he then dismissed them and returned to us now the hour of sunset was near good deal of time had passed while he was within when he came out he sat down with us again after his bath but not much was said soon the jailer who was the servant of the eleven entered and stood by him saying to you socrates whom i know to be the noblest and gentlest and best of all who ever came to this place i will not impute the angry feelings of other men who rage and swear at when in obedience to the authorities i bid them drink the i am sure that you will not be angry with others you are aware and not i are the guilty cause and so fare you well and try to bear lightly what must needs be you know my errand then bursting into tears he went out socrates looked at him and said i return your good wishes and will you bid then turning to us he said how charming the man is since i have been in prison he has always been coming to see and at times he would talk to and was good could be and now see how generously he sorrows but we must he says 143 144 145 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume i of 10 greece https let the cup be brought if the poison is prepared if not let the attendant prepare some yet said crito the sun is still upon the hilltops and i know that many one has taken the draft late and after the announcement had been made to him he has eaten and drunk and enjoyed the society of his beloved not hasten then there is still time socrates said yes crito and they of whom you speak are right in doing thus they think that they will gain by the delay but i am right in not doing thus i not think that i should gain anything by drinking the poison little later i should be sparing and saving life which is already gone i could only laugh at myself this please then to i say and not to refuse crito made sign to the servant who was standing by and he went out and after being absent some time returned with the jailer carrying the cup of poison socrates said you my good friend who are experienced in these matters shall give the directions how i am to proceed the man answered you have only to walk about until your legs are heavy and then to lie down and the poison will act at the same time he handed the cup to socrates who in the easiest and gentlest manner without the least fear or change of color or feature looking at the man with all his eyes echecrates 73 his manner was took the cup and said what you say about making libation out of this cup to any god may i or not the man answered we only prepare socrates just so much we deem enough i understand he said yet i may and must ask the gods to prosper my journey from this to that other world so be it according to my prayer then holding the cup to his lips quite readily and cheerfully he drank off the poison and hitherto most of us had been able to control our sorrow but now when we saw him drinking and saw too that he had ﬁnished the draft we could longer forbear and in spite of myself my own tears were ﬂowing fast so that i covered my face and wept over myself certainly i was not weeping over him but at the thought of my own calamity in having lost such friend nor was i the ﬁrst crito when he found himself unable to restrain his tears had got up and moved away and i followed and at that moment apollodorus who had been weeping all the time broke out into loud and passi onate cry which made cowards of us all socrates alone retained his calmness what is this strange outcry he said i sent away the women mainly in order that they might not offend in this way i have heard that man should die in peace be quiet then and have patience when we heard that we were ashamed and refrained our tears and he walked about until he said his legs began to fail and then he lay on his back according to the directions and the man who gave him the poison now and then looked at his feet and legs and after while he prest his foot hard and asked him if he could feel and he said and then his leg and so upward and upward and showed us that he was cold and stiff and he felt them himself and said when the poison reaches the heart that will be the end he was beginning to grow cold about the groin when he uncovered his face he had covered himself up and said they were his last words crito i owe cock to asclepius will you remember to pay the debt the debt shall be paid said crito is there anything else there was answer to this question but in minute or two movement was heard and the attendants uncovered him his eyes were set and crito closed his eyes and mouth such was the end echecrates of our friend whom i may truly call the wisest and justest and best of all the men whom i have ever known footnotes from the phædo translated by benjamin jowett probably the phædo is of all plato writings the most famous its importance is ascribed by mahaffy not only to what is said of immortality in passages which have fascinated the thoughtful men of all ages but to the touching story of the last hours of socrates 146 147 148 72 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume i of 10 greece https seems to have been the locrian philosopher to whom plato is believed to have gone some of his early instruction arist otle born in stagira in 384 died at chalcis in eubœa in 322 the most famous of greek philosophers went to athens in his eighteenth year pupil of plato and remained there twenty years in 343 went to the court of macedon where he undertook the education of alexander the great then thirteen years old in 335 returned to athens and produced the greater part of his writings afterward forced to ﬂee from athens to chalcis during an uprising against the macedonians his numerous writings deal with all branches of science known to his times the ﬁrst edition of the greek text that of aldus manutius published in 74 i what things are pleasant 75 let it be laid down by us that pleasure is certain motion of the soul and settlement of it at once rapid and perceptible into its own proper nature and that pain is the contrary if then pleasure be thing of this nature it is plain that whatever is productive of the disposition i have described is pleasant while every thing of nature to destroy it or produce disposition the opposite to it is painful generally speaking therefore it is necessary both that the being in progress toward state conformable to nature should be pleasant and that in the highest degree when those feelings whose original is conformable to it shall have recovered that their nature and habits because that which is habitual becomes by that time natural it were in certain way custom is like nature because the idea of frequency is proximate to that of always now nature belongs to the idea of always custom to that of often what is not compulsory also is pleasant compulsion is contrary to nature wherefore acts of necessity are painful and it has been truly remarked every act of necessity is in its nature painful it must be also that state of sedulous attention anxiety the having the mind on the stretch are painful they all are acts of necessity and constraine d unless they have become habitual but it is custom which under such circumstances renders them pleasant the contraries of these must also be pleasant wherefore relaxation of mind leisure listlessness amusements and intervals of rest rank in the class of things pleasant none of these has anything to with necessity everything of whic h there is an innate appetite is pleasant appetite is desire of what is pleasant now of appetites some are irrational others attended by reason i call all those irrational which men desire not from any conception which they form of this kind are all which are said to exist naturally those of the body thirst or hunger instance in the case of sustenance and the appetite of sustenance in every kind and the appetites connected with objects of taste and of lust and in fact objects of touch generally the appetite of fragrant odors too connected with smelling and hearing and sight appetites attended by reason are all those whatsoever which men exercise from persuasion many things there are which they desire to behold and possess on hearsay and persuasion now the being pleased stands in the perception of certain affection and imagination is kind of faint percept ion there will attend on him who exerci ses either memory or hope kind of imagination of that which is the object of his memory or hope but if so it is plain that they who exercise memory or hope certainly feel pleasure since 73 149 150 151 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume i of 10 greece https have also perception so that everything pleasant consists either in the perception of present objects or in the remembrance of those which have already been or in the hope of such are yet to be men exercise perception on present memory on past and hope on future objects now the objects of memory are pleasant not only such at the moment while present were pleasant but some even which were not pleasant should their consequence subsequently be honorable and good and hence this saying but it is indeed pleasant man when preserved to remember his toils and this after his sufferings man who has suffered much and much achieved is gladdened at the recollection but the reason of this is that to be exempt from evil is pleasant and all objects are pleasant in hope which appear by their presence either to delight or beneﬁt in great degree or to beneﬁt without giving pain in word whatever objects by their presence delight us so generally speaking we hope or remember them on which account too the feeling of anger is pleasant just homer has remarked of anger in his poem that which with sweetness far greater than distilling honey it drops there is one who feels anger where the object seems impracticable to his revenge nor with those far their superiors in power men feel anger at all or if they it is in less degree there is also kind of pleasure consequent on most appetites either in the recollection that they have enjoyed them or in the hope that they shall enjoy them men are affected and delighted by certain pleasure thus men possest by fevers feel delight amid their thirst well at the remembrance how they used to drink at the hope of drinking yet again lovers too feel delight in conversing writing and composing something ever about the object beloved because in all those energies they have perception it were of the object they love and this is in all cases criterion of the commencement of love when persons feel pleasure not only in the presence of the object but are enamored also of it when absent on memory wherefore even when pain arises at absence nay in the midst of mourning and the very dirge of death there yet arises within us certain pleasure the pain is felt because the object is not present but the pleasure consists in rememberi ng and seeing it were both the person and what he used to and the kind of character of which he was whence has it been said and with probability enough thus spake he and excited within them all desire of lamentation also the avenging oneself is pleasant the getting of that is pleasant the failing to get which is painful now the angry feel pain in an excessive degree if they be not avenged but in the hope of revenge they take pleasure again to overcome is pleasant not to the ambitious only but even to all there arises an imagination of superiority which all either in faint or more violent degree have an appetite but since to overcome is pleasant it must follow of course that amusements where there is ﬁeld rivalry those of music and disputations are pleasant it frequently occurs in the course of these that we overcome also chess ball dice and drafts again it is the same with respect to amusements where lively interest is taken of these some become pleasant accustomed to them others are pleasant at ﬁrst instance hunting and every kind of sporting where there is rivalry there is also victory on which principle the disputations of the bar and of the schools are pleasant to those who have become accustomed to them and have abilities also honor and good character are most pleasant by reason that an idea arises that one is such is the good man and this in greater degree should those people pronounce one such who he thinks speak truth such are those immediately about one rather than those who are more removed familiar friends and acquaintances and one fellow citizens rather than those who are at distance the present rather than future generation man of practical wisdom rather than mere ignoramus many than few it is more likely that these i have mentioned will adhere to the truth than that the opposite characters will since one has anxiety about the honor or the opinion of such one greatly despises children and animals instance not at least the sake of such opinion itself but if one is anxious about it then it is on account of something else 152 153 154 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume i of 10 greece https friend too ranks among things pleasant the affection of love is pleas ant since there is lover of wine who does not delight in wine also the having affection felt toward one is pleasant there is in this case also an idea of one being an excellent person which all who have any sensibility to it are desirous of now the having affection felt you is the being beloved yourself on your own account also the being held in admiration is pleasant on the very account of being honored by it flattery and the ﬂatterer are pleasant since the ﬂatterer is seeming admirer and seeming friend to continue the same course of action is also pleasant what is habitual was laid down to be pleasant to vary is also pleasant change is an approach to what is natural sameness produces an excess of stated habit whence it has been said in everything change is pleasant on this principle whatever occurs at intervals of time is pleasant whether persons or things it is variation of present objects and at the same time that which occurs merely at intervals possesses the merit of rarity also learning and admiration generally speaking are pleasant under admiration exists desire to learn so that what is admired is desired and in the act of learning there is settlement into state conformable to nature to beneﬁt and to be beneﬁted are also of the number of pleasant things to be beneﬁted is to get what people desire but to beneﬁt is to possess and abound things the both of which men desire and because tendency to beneﬁcence is pleasant it is also pleasant to man to set his neighbor on his legs again and to put ﬁnish to that which was deﬁcient in some particular ii the life most desirable 76 he who proposes to make the ﬁtting inquiry to which form of government is the best ought ﬁrst to determine what manner of living is most eligible while this remains uncertain it will also be equally uncertain what government is best unless some unexpected accident interfere it is probable that those who enjoy the best government will live best according to existing circumstances he ought therefore ﬁrst to come to some agreement to the manner of life which so to speak is most desirable all and afterward whether this life is the same or different in the individual and the member of state deeming then that we have already sufﬁciently shown what sort of life is best in our popular discourses on that subject we must now make use of what we there said certainly one ever called in question the propriety of one of the divisions namely that there are three kinds of things good man which are what is external what belongs to the body and to the soul it is eviden t that all these must conspire to make men truly happy one would say that man was happy who had nothing of fortitude or temperance justice or prudence but was afraid of the ﬂies that ﬂew round him or who would abstain from nothing if he chanced to be desirous of meat or drink or who would murder his dearest friend farthing or in like manner one who was in every particular wanting and misguided in his understanding an infant or maniac these truths are so evident that all must agree to them tho some may dispute about the quantity and the degree they may think that very little amount of virtue is sufﬁcient happiness but to riches property power honor and all such things they endeavor to increase them without bounds but to such we say that it is easy to prove from what experience teaches us concerning these cases that it is not through these external goods that men acquire virtue but through virtue that they acquire them to happy life whether it is to be found in pleasure or in virtue or in both certain it is that it belongs more frequently to those whose morals are most pure and whose understandings are best cultivated and who preserve moderation in the acquisition of external goods than to those who possess sufﬁciency of external good things but are deﬁcient in the rest 155 156 157 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume i of 10 greece https that such is the case will be clearly seen by any one who views the matter with reﬂection whatsoever is external has its boundary machine and whatsoever is useful is such that its excess is either necessarily hurtful or at best usele ss to the possessor but every good quality of the soul the higher it is in degree becom es much the more useful if it is permitted on this subject to adopt the word useful well noble it is also evident that the best disposition of each thing will follow in the same proportion of excess the things themselves of which we allow they are accidents differ from each other in value so that if the soul is more noble than any outward possession or than the body both in itself and with respect to us it must be admitted of course that the best disposition of each must follow the same analogy besides it is the sake of the soul that these things are desirable and it is on this account that wise men should desire them and not the soul them let us therefore be well agreed that so much of happiness falls to the lot of every one he possesses of virtue and wisdom and in proportion he acts according to their dictates since this we have the example of the god himself who is completely happy not from any external good but in himself and because he is such by nature good fortune is something of necessity different from happiness every external good of the soul is produced by chance or by fortune but it is not from fortune that any one is just or wise hence it follows established by the same reasoning that the state which is best and acts best will be happy one can fare well who acts not well nor can the actions either of man or city be praiseworthy without virtue and wisdom valor justice and wisdom have in state the same force and form in individuals and it is only he shares in these virtues that each man is said to be just wise and prudent footnotes aristotle has been recognized great name in the classic literature of greece but this mahaffy points out is rather critic than man of letters in the narrow sense of the word physically he was unattractive in his day he was thought ugly his features were small and his legs thin sitting portrait of him now preserved in rome shows reﬁned and careworn tho somewhat hard face in which thought and perhaps bodily suffering have drawn deep furrows his writings are said to have numbered about four hundred from book i of the rhetoric translated by theodore buckley from book vii of the politics translated by edward walford iii ideal husbands and wives 77 but to man the ﬁrst object of his care should be respecting wife the society which exists between the male and female is above all others natural it is laid down by us elsewhere that nature aims at producing many such creatures the several kinds of animals but it is impossible the female to accomplish this without the male or the male without the female so that the society between them exists of necessity in all other animals indeed this association is irrational and exists only so far they possess natural instinct and the sake of procreation alone but in the milder and more intelligent animals this bond more nearly approaches perfection there seem to be in them more signs of mutual assistance and and of cooperation with each other but this is especially the case with man because the male and female here coop erate not 74 75 76 158 159 the project

also of solid beneﬁt the labor which they expend during their season of vigor upon their helpless young is given back to them in the decay of age from their children who are then in vigor and at the same time by this continual cycle nature provides the continuan ce of the race species since she can not so numerically thus divinely predispose d toward such society is the nature of both the male and the female the sexes are at once divided in that neither of them have powers adequate all purposes nay in some respects even opposite to each other tho they tend to the same end nature has made the one sex stronger and the other weaker that the one by reason of fear may be more adapted to preserve property while the other by reason of its fortitude may be disposed to repel assaults and that the one may provide things abroad while the other preserves them at home and with respect to labor the one is by nature capable of attending to domestic duties but weak to matters the other is to works where repose is necessary but able to perform those which demand exercise and with respect to children the bearing of them belongs to one sex but the advantage of them is common to both the one has to rear them and the other to educate them good and perfect wife ought to be mistress of everything within the house and to have the care of everything according to ﬁxt laws allowing one to come in unbidden by her husband and especially keeping on her guard against everything which can be noised abroad relating to woman dishonor so that if any mischance has happened within doors she alone ought to know about it but when those who have come in have done anything wrong the husband should bear the blame and she should manage the expenses laid out upon such festivals her husband has agreed with her in keeping and make an outlay of clothes and other ornaments on somewhat lesser scale than is encouraged by the laws of the state considering that neither splendor of vestments nor preeminence of beauty nor the amount of gold contributes so much to the commendation of woman good management in domestic affairs and noble and comely manner of life since all such array of the soul is far more lovely and has greater force than anything besides to provide herself and her children true orname nt till old age wife therefore ought to inspire herself with conﬁdence and perpetually to be at the head of domestic affairs it is unseemly man to know all that goes on in the house in all respects indeed she ought to be obedient to her husband and not to busy herself about public affairs nor to take part in matrimonial concerns and when it is time to give his daughters in marriage or to get wives his sons by all means in these respects she should obey her husband and she ought to show herself fellow counsellor to her husband so to assent to what pleases him remembering that it is less unseemly husband to take in hand domestic matters than wife to busy herself in affairs but the wife will justly consider the behavior of her husband model of her own life and law to herself invested with divine sanction by means of the marriage tie and the community of life if she can persuade herself to bear her husband ways patiently she will most easily manage matters in the house but if she can not she will have greater difﬁculty so that it will be seemly her to show herself of one mind with her husband and tractable not only when her husband is in good luck and prosperity but also when he is in misfo rtune and when good fortune has failed him or sickness has laid hold of his bodily frame or when he has been deprived of his senses she ought gently and sympathetically to yield in any matter which is not base and unworthy but if her husband has been ailing and made mistake she ought not to keep it on her mind but to lay the blame on disease or ignorance but the husband in his turn should ﬁnd out certain laws to regulate his treatment of his wife one who entered the house of her husband to share his children and his life and to leave him progeny destined to bear the names of her husband parents and her own and what in the world could there be more holy than these ties or

they will suffer the loss themselves unless parents afford their children ﬁt pattern of life they will leave them an obvious excuse to quote against themselves and this is to be feared that if they have not lived well their sons will disregard them and neglect them in their old age on this account nothing is to be omitted which tends to the ﬁt education of bride so that the children may be born of the best possible mother the husbandman neglects nothing so to cast his seed upon the richest and best wrought ground considering that it is from such soil that he will hereafter reap the fairest fruits and if any violence threatens he ﬁghts against his enemy and deliberately chooses to die rather than endure to see it ravaged and such disposition this is praised by most persons and such is the care which is spent by us on the support of our bodies what manner of men ought we to show ourselves on behalf of our child ren and of the mother that is to rear them ought we not most readily to strain every nerve in this way alone does the constitution of man nature which is mortal attain to prosperity and the prayers of parents all tend to this one end and hence whoever cares not this is sure to be regardless of the gods it was the sake of the gods then who were present to him when he offered the marriage sacriﬁce that he not only took to himself wife but also what is far more gave himself over to his bride to honor her next to his own parents but that which is most precious in the eyes of prudent wife is to see her husband preserving himself entirely her thinking of other woman in comparison with her and regarding herself above all other women peculiarly his own and faithful toward him in proportion wife perceives that she is faithfully and justly cared so much the more will she exert her energies to show herself such whoever therefore is prudent will not fail to remember with how much honor it becomes him to requite his parents his wife and his children in order that he may gain the name of one who is just and upright in distributing to each their due every one is indignant beyond measure at being deprived of that which belongs to himself in peculiar manner and there is one who is content at being deprived of his own property tho one were to give him plenty of his neighbor goods and in very truth nothing is so peculiarly the property of wife chaste and hallowed intercourse and hence it would not beﬁt prudent man to cast his seed wherever chance might take it lest children should be born to him from bad and base stock on an equality with his legitimate sons and by this the wife is robbed of her conjugal rights the children are injured and above all the husband himself is enveloped in disgrace he ought therefore to approach his wife with much and decency and to maintain modesty in his words and in his deeds regard to what is lawful and honest and in his intercourse he should be true and discreet and to little errors even tho they be voluntary he ought to vouchsafe pardon and if she has made any mistake through ignorance he ought to advise her and not to inspire her with fear except such is accompanied with reverence and respect such treatment would be more suited to mistresses at the hands of their gallants yet nevertheless justly to love her husband with reverence and respe ct and to be loved in turn is that which beﬁts wife of gentle birth to her intercourse with her own husband fear is of two kinds the one kind is reverent and full of respect such is that which good sons exhibit toward their parents and citizens toward those who rule them in kindly spirit but the other kind is attended by hatred and aversion such is that which slaves feel toward their masters and citizens toward unjust and lawless tyrants furthermore the husband ought to choose the best course out of all that we have said above and so to conciliate his wife to himself and to make her trustworthy and well disposed that whether her husband be present or absent she will be equa lly good while he can turn his attention to public matters so that even in his absence she may feel 162 163 164 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume i of

that such is the case even tho she may be very young and quite inexperienced in such matters if the husband should ever begin such course of conduct this and show himself to be perfect master of himself he would be the best guide of the entire course of his life and he would teach his wife to adopt similar mode of action footnotes from book i of the economics translated by edward walford iv happiness an end of human action 78 since we have spoken of the virtues of the different kinds of friendships and of pleasures it remains that we should discuss the subject of happiness in outline since we assumed this to be the end of human actions therefore if we recapitulate what has been said before the ar gument will be more concise we have said that it is not habit if it were it might exist in man who slept throughout his life living the life of plant and suffering the greatest misfortunes if then this does not please us but if we must rather bring it under kind of energy was said before and if of energies some are necessary and eligible the sake of something else others are eligible their own sakes it is plain that we must consider happiness one of those which are eligible their own sakes and not one of those which are eligible the sake of something else happiness is in want of nothing but is sufﬁcient now those energies are eligib le their own sakes from which nothing more is sought beyond the energy but of this kind actions done according to virtue seem to be the performance of honorable and good acts is among things eligible their own sakes and of amusements those are eligible their own sakes which are pleasant men not choose these the sake of anything else they are rather injured by them than beneﬁted since they neglect their persons and property but the majority of those who are called happy ﬂy to such pastimes these and therefore those who have happy turn such pastimes these are in favor with tyrants they make themselves agreeable in those things which tyrants desire and such are the men they want these things are thought to belong to happiness because those who are in power pass their leisure in them but such men are perhaps proof neither virtue nor intellect consists in having power and from these two good energies proceed nor if those who have never tasted pure and liberal pleasure ﬂy to bodily pleasures must we therefore think that these pleasures are more eligible children think those things which are esteemed by them the best it is reasonable therefore to suppose that the things which appear honorable to children and men differ so also those which appear so to the bad and the good will differ likewise and therefore we have very often said those things are honorable and pleasant which are so to the good man but to every man that energy is most eligible which is according to his proper habit and therefore to the good man that is most eligible which is according to virtue consequently happiness does not consist in amusement it is absurd that the end should be amusement and that men should toil and suffer inconvenience all their life long the sake of amusement we choose everything we might say the sake of something else except happiness that is an end but to be serious and to labor 77 165 166 167 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume i of 10 greece https sake of amusement appears foolish and very childish but to amuse ourselves in order that we may be serious anacharsis said seems to be right amusement resembles relaxation relaxation therefore is not the end we have recourse to it the sake of the energy but the happy life seems to be according to virtue and this is serious and does not consist in amusement we say also that serious things are better than those which are ridiculous and joined with amusement and that the energy of the better part and of the better man is more serious and the energy of the better man is at once superior and more tending to happiness besides any person whatever even slave may enjoy bodily pleasures less than the best man but one allows that slave partakes of happiness except so far that he partakes of life happiness does not consist in such modes of passing life but in ener gies according to virtue has been said already if happiness be an energy according to virtue it is reasonable to suppose that it is according to the best virtue and this must be the virtue of the best part of man whether then this best part be the intellect or something is thought naturally to bear rule and to govern and to possess ideas upon honorable and divine subjects or whether it is itself divine or the most divine of any property which we possess the energy of this part according to its proper virtue must be perfect happiness and that this energy is contemplative has been stated this also would seem to agree with what was said before and with the truth this energy is the noblest since the intellect is the noblest thing within us and of subjects of knowledge those are noblest with which the intellect is conversant it is also most continuous we are better able to contemplate continuously than to anything else continuously we think also that pleasure must be united to happiness but of all the energies according to virtue that according to wisdom is confessedly the most pleasant at any rate wisdom seems to contain pleasures worthy of admiration both in point of purity and stability and it is reasonable to suppose that his mode of life should be pleasanter to those who know it than to those who are only seeking it again that which is called must be most concerned with contemplative happiness both the wise man and the just and all others need the necessaries of life but supposing them to be sufﬁciently suppli ed with such goods the just man requires persons toward whom and with whom he may act justly and in like manner the tempe rate man and the brave man and so on with all the rest but the wise man if even by himself is able to contemplate and the more so the wiser he is perhaps he will energize better if he has cooperators but nevertheless he is most this would seem also to be the only energy which is loved its own sake it has result beyond the act of contemplation but from the active energies we gain more or less beyond the performance of the action happiness seems also to consist in leisure we are busy in order that we may have leisure and we go to war in order that we may be at peace now the energies of the active virtues are exerted in political or military affairs and the actions with respect to these are thought to allow of leisure certainly military actions altogether exclude it one chooses war nor makes preparations war the sake of war man would be thought perfectly deﬁled with blood if he made his friends enemies in order that there might be battles and massacres the energy of the statesman is also without leisure and besides the actual administration of the state the statesman seeks to gain power and honors or at least happiness himself and his fellow citizens different from the happiness of the state which we are in search of clearly being dif ferent if then of all courses of action which are according to the virtues those which have to with politics and war excel in beauty and greatness and these have leisure and aim at some end and are not chosen their own sakes but the energy of the intellect is thought to be superior in intensity because it is contemplative and to aim at end beyond itself and to have pleasure properly belonging to it and if this increases the energy and if and leisure and freedom from cares far anything human can be free and everything which is attributed to the happy man evide ntly exist 168 169 170 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume i of 10 greece https this energy then this must be the perfect happiness of man when it attains the end of life complete nothing is incomplete of those things which belong to happiness but such life would be better than man could attain to he would live thus not so far forth he is man but there is in him something divine but so far this divine part surpasses the whole compound nature so far does its energy surpass the energy which is according to all other virtue if then the intellect be divine when compared with man the life also which is in obedience to that will be divine when compared with human life but man ought not to entertain human thoughts some would advise because he is human nor mortal thoughts because he is mortal but far it is possible he should make himself immortal and everything with view to living in accordance with the best principle in him altho it be small in size yet in power and value it is far more excellent than all besides this would seem to be each man self if it really is the ruling and the better part it would be absurd therefore if man were to choose not his own life but the life of some other thing and what was said before will apply now that which peculiarly belongs to each by nature is best and most pleasant to every one and consequently to man the life according to intellect is most pleasant if intellect especially constitutes man this life therefore is the most happy footnotes from book x of the nicomachean ethics translated by browne pol ybius born in megalopolis in greece in 204 died

army in motion from both the camps those from the larger camp he drew up in order of battle soon he had got them across the river and bringing up those of the smaller camp he placed them all in the same line selecting the south the aspect of the whole the roman horse he stationed on the right wing along the river and their foot next them in the same line placing the maniples howev er closer together than usual and making the depth of each maniple several times greater than its front the cavalry of the allies he stationed on the left wing and the troops he placed slightly in advance of the whole army which amounted with its allies to eighty thousand infantry and little more than six thousand horse at the same time hannibal brought his balearic slingers and spearmen across the river and stationed them in advance of his main body which he led out of their camp and getting them across the river at two spots drew them up opposi the enemy on his left wing close to the river he stationed the iberian and celtic horse opposite the roman cavalry and next to them half the libyan foot and next to them the iberian and celtic foot next the other half of the libyans and on the right wing the numidian horse having now got them all into line he advanced with the central companies of the iberians and celts and so arranged the other companies next these in regular gradations that the whole line became diminishing in depth toward its extremities his objec t being to have his libyans reserve in the battle and to commence the action with his iberians and celts the armor of the libyans was roman hannibal had armed them with selection of the spoils taken in previous battles the shield of the iberians and celts was about the same size but their swords were quite different that of the roman can thrust with deadly effects it can cut while the gallic sword can only cut and that requires some room and the companies coming naked celts and the iberians with their short linen tunics bordered with purple stripes the whole appearance of the line was strange and terrifying the whole strength of the carthaginian cavalry was ten thousand but that of their foot was not more than forty thousand including the celts æmilius 82 commanded on the roman right gaius terentius on the left marcus atilius and gnæus servilius the consuls of the previous year on the center the left of the carthaginians was commanded by hasdrubal 83 the right by hanno 84 the center by hannibal in person attended by his brother mago and the roman line faced the south i said before and the carthaginian the north the rays of the rising sun did not inconvenience either of them the battle was begun by an engagement between the advanced guard of the two armies and at ﬁrst the affair between these troops was indecisive but soon the iberian and celtic cavalry got at the romans the battle began in earnest and in the true barbaric fashion there was none of the usual formal advance and retreat but when they once got to close quarters they grappled man to man and dismounting from their horses fought on foot but when the carthaginians had got the upper hand in this encounter and killed most of their opponents on the the romans all maintained the ﬁght with spirit and began chasing the remainder along the river slaying they went and giving quarter then the legionaries took the place of the and closed with the enemy short time the iberian and celtic lines stood their ground and fought gallantly but presently overpower ed by the weight of the lines they gave way and retired to the rear thus breaking up the crescent the roman maniples follo wed with spirit and easily cut their way through the enemy line since the celts had been drawn up in thin line while the romans had closed up from the wings toward the center and the point of danger the two wings did not come into action at the same time the center but the center was ﬁrst engaged because the gauls having been statio ned on the arc of the crescent had come into contact with the enemy long before the wings the convex of the crescent being toward the enemy the romans however going in pursuit of these troops and hastily closing in toward the center and the part of the enemy which was giving ground advanced so far that the libyan troops on either wing got on their ﬂanks those on the right 173 174 175 the project gutenberg ebook

charged their right ﬂank the exigency of the moment suggesting to them what they ought to thus it came about hannibal had planned that the romans were caught between two hostile lines of libyans to their impetuous pursuit of the celts still they fought tho longer in line yet singly or in maniples which faced about to meet those who charged them on the ﬂanks tho he had been from the ﬁrst on the right wing and had taken part in the cavalry engagement lucius æmilius still survived determined to act up to his own exhortatory speech and seeing that the decision of the battle rested mainly on the legionaries riding up to the center of the line he led the charge himself and personally grappled with the enemy at the same time cheering on and exhorting his soldiers to the charge hannibal on the other side did the same he too had taken his place on the center from the commencement the numidian horse on the carthaginian right were meanwhile charging the cavalry on the roman left and tho from the peculiar nature of their mode of ﬁghting they neither inﬂicted nor received much harm they yet rendered the enemy horse useless by keeping them occupied and charging them ﬁrst on one side and then on another but when hasdrubal after all but annihilating the cavalry by the river came from the left to the support of the numidians the roman allied cavalry seeing his charge approaching broke and ﬂed at that point hasdrubal appears to have acted with great skill and discretion seeing the numidians to be strong in numbers and more effective and formidable to troops that had once been forced from their ground he left the pursuit to them while he himself hastened to the part of the ﬁeld where the infantry were engaged and brought his men up to support the libyans then by charging the roman legions on the rear and harassing them by hurling squadron after squadron upon them at many points at once he raised the spirits of the libyans and dismayed and deprest those of the romans it was at this point that lucius æmilius fell in the thick of the ﬁght covered with wounds man who did his duty to his country at the last hour of his life he had throughout its previous years if any man ever did long the romans could keep an unbroken front to turn ﬁrst in one direction and then in another to meet the assaults of the enemy they held out but the outer ﬁles of the circle continually falling and the circle becoming more and more contracted they at last were all killed on the ﬁeld and among them marcus atilius and gnæus servilius the consuls of the previous year who had shown themselves brave men and worthy of rome in the battle while this struggle and carnage were going on the numidian horse were pursuing the fugit ives most of whom they cut down or hurled from their horses but some few escaped into venusia among whom was gaius terentius the consul who thus sought ﬂight disgraceful to himself his conduct in ofﬁce had been disastrous to his country such was the end of the battle of cannæ 85 in which both sides fought with the most conspicuous gallantry the conquered less than the conquerors this is proved by the fact that out of six thousand horse only seventy escaped with gaius terentius to venusia and about three hundred of the allied cavalry to various town s in the neighborhood of the infantry ten thousand were taken prisoners in fair ﬁght but were not actually engaged in the battle of those who were actually engaged only about three thousand perhaps escaped to the towns of the surrounding district all the rest died nobly to the number of seventy thousand the carthaginians being on this occasion on previous ones mainly indebted their victory to their superiority in cavalry lesson to posterity that in actual war it is better to have half the number of infantry and the superiority in cavalry than to engage your enemy with an equality in both on the side of hannibal there fell four thousand celts ﬁfteen hundred iberians and libyans and about two hundred horse the result of this battle such i have described it had the consequences which both sides expected the carthaginians by their victory were thenceforth masters of nearly the whole of the

site of cannæ in apulia southern italy near the adriatic shore lies on the bank of the river auﬁdus now called the ofanto ii hannibal advance on rome 86 211 when the news had arrived at rome that hannibal had encamped over against their lines and was actually besieging their forces there was universal excitement and terror from feeling that the result of the impending battle would decide the whole war consequently with one heart and soul the citizens had all devoted themselves to sending out reenforcements and making preparations this struggle on their part the capuans were encouraged by the receipt of hannibal letter and by thus learning the object of the carthaginian movement to stand by their determination and to await the issue of this new hope at the end of the ﬁfth day therefore after his arrival on the ground hannibal ordered his men to take their supper usual and leave their burning and started with such secrecy that none of the enemy knew what was happening he took the road through samnium and marched at great pace and without stopping his skirmishers always keeping before him to reconnoiter and occupy all the posts along the route and while those in rome had their thoughts still wholly occupied with capua 87 and the campaign there he crossed the anio without being observed and having arrived at distance of not more than forty stades from rome there pitched his camp on this being known at rome the utmost confusion and terror prevailed among the movement of hannibal being unexpected it was sudden he 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 178 179 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume i of 10 greece https never been so close to the city before at the same time their alarm was increased by the idea at once occurring to them that he would not have ventured so near if it were not that the armies at capua were destroyed accordingly the men at once went to line the walls and the points of vantage in the defenses of the town while the women went round to the temples of the gods and implored their protection sweeping the pavements of the temples with their hair this is their customary way of behaving when any serious danger comes upon their country but just hannibal had encamped and was intending to attempt the city itself next day an extraordinary coincidence occurred whic h proved fortunate the preservation of rome gnæus fulvius and publius sulpic ius having already enrolled one consu lar army had bound the men with the usual oath to appear at rome armed on that very day and were also engaged on that day in drawi ng out the lists and testing the men the other army whereby it so happened that large number of men had been collected in rome spontaneously in the very nick of time these troops the consuls boldly led outside the walls and entrenching themselves there checked hannibal intended movement the carthaginians were at ﬁrst eager to advance and were not altogether without hope that they would be able to take rome itself by assault but when they saw the enemy drawn up in order and learned before long from prisoner what had happened they abandoned the idea of attacking the city and began devastating the instead and setting ﬁre to the houses in these ﬁrst raids they collected an innumerable amount of booty the ﬁeld of plunder upon which they were entered was one into which one had ever expected an enemy to set foot but presently when the consuls ventured to encamp within ten stades of him hannibal broke up his quarters before daylight he did so three reasons ﬁrst because he had collected an enormous booty secondly because he had given up all hope of taking rome and lastly because he reckoned that the time had now come at which he expected according to his original idea that appius would have learned the danger threatening rome and would have raised the siege of capua and come with his whole force to the relief of the city or at any rate would hurry up with the greater part leaving detachment to carry on the siege publius had caused the bridges over the anio to be broken down and thus compelled hannibal to get his army across by ford and he now attacked the carthaginians they were engaged in making the passage of the stream and caused them great distress they were not able however to strike an important blow owing to the number of hannibal cavalry and the activity of the numidians in every part of the ﬁeld but before retiring to their camp they wrested the greater part of the booty from them and killed about three hundred men and then being convinced that the carthaginians were beating hasty retreat in panic they followed in their rear keeping along the line of hills at ﬁrst hannibal continued to march at rapid pace being anxious to meet the force which he expected but at the end of the ﬁfth day being informed that appius had not left the siege of capua he halted and waiting the enemy to come up made an attack upon his camp before daylight killed large number of them and drove the rest out of their camp but when day broke and he saw the romans in strong position upon steep hill to which they had retired he decided not to continue his attack upon them but marching through daunia and brutti he appeared at rhegium so unexpectedly that he was within an ace of capturing the city and did cut off all who were out in the country and during this excursion captured very lar ge number of the rhegini who could refrain from speaking in terms of admiration of this great man strategic skill courage and ability when one looks to the length of time during which he displa yed those qualities and realizes to oneself the pitched battles the skirmishes and sieges the revolutions and counter of states the vicissitudes of fortune and in fact the course of his design and its execution in its entirety sixteen continuous years hannibal maintained the war with rome in italy without once releasing his army from service in the ﬁeld but keeping those vast numbers under control like good pilot without any sign of disaf fection toward himself or toward each other tho he had troops in his service who so far from being of the same tribe were not even of the same race he had libyans iberians ligurians celts phœnicians italians greeks who had naturally 180 181 182 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume i of 10 greece https in common with each other neither laws nor customs nor language yet the skill of the commander was such that these differences so manifold and so wide did not disturb the obedience to one word of command and to single will and yet circumstances were not by any means unvarying tho the breeze of fortune often set strongly in his favor it often also blew in exactly the opposite direction there is therefore good ground admiring hannibal display of ability in campaign and there can be fear in saying that if he had reserved his attack upon the romans until he had ﬁrst subdued other parts of the world there is not one of his projects which would have eluded his grasp it was he began with those whom he should have attacked last and accordingly began and ended his career with them 88

occupied syracuse and had alienated the rest of the citizens with themselves from the friend ship of rome the romans who had already been informed of the murder of hieronymus tyrant of syracuse appointed appius claudius to command land force while marcus claudius marcellus 90 commanded the ﬂeet these ofﬁcers took up position not far from syracuse and determined to assault the town from the land at hexapylus and by sea at what was called stoa scytice in achradina where the wall has its foundation close down to the sea having prepared their wicker and darts and other siege material they felt conﬁdent that with so many hands employed they would in ﬁve days get their works in such an advanced state to give them the advantage over the enemy but in this they did not take into account the abilities of archimedes 91 nor calculate on the truth that in certain circumstances the genius of one man is more effective that any numbers whatever however they now learned it by experience the city was strong from the fact of its encircling wall lying along chain of hills with overhanging brows the ascent of which was easy task even with one to hinder it except at certain deﬁnite points taking advantage of this archimedes had constructed such defenses both in the town and at the places where an attack might be made by sea that the garrison would have everything at hand which they might require at any moment and be ready to meet without delay whatever the enemy might attempt against them the attack was begun by appius bringing his and scaling ladders and attempting to ﬁx the latter against that part of the wall which abuts on hexapylus toward the east at the same time marcus claudius marcellus with sixty quinqueremes was making descent upon achradina each of these vessels were full of men armed with bows and slings and javelins with which to dislodge those who fought on the battlements well these vessels he had eight quinqueremes in pairs each pair had had their oars removed one on the larboard and the other on the starboard side and then had been lasht together on the sides thus left bare on these double vessels rowed by the outer oars of each of the pair they brought up under the walls some engin es called sambucæ the construction of which was follows ladder was made four feet 86 87 183 184 185 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume i of 10 greece https and of height to reach the top of the wall from the place where its foot had to rest each side of the ladder was protected by railing and covering or was added overhead it was then placed so that its foot rested across the sides of the together vessels which touched each other with its other extremity protruding considerable way beyond the prows on the tops of the mast pulleys were ﬁxt with ropes and when the engines were about to be used men standing on the sterns of the vessels drew the ropes tied to the head of the ladder while others standing on the prows assisted the raising of the machine and kept it steady with long poles having then brought the ships close in shore by using the outer oars of both vessels they tried to let the machine down upon the wall at the head of the ladder was ﬁxt wooden stage secured on three sides by wicker upon which stood four men who fought and struggled with those who tried to prevent the sambuca from being made to rest on the battlements but when they have ﬁxt it and so got above the level of the top of the wall the four men unfasten the wicker from either side of the stage and walk out upon the battlements or towers the case may be they are followed by their comrades coming up by the sambuca since the ladder foot is safely secured with ropes and stands upon both the ships this construction has got the name of sambuca or harp the natural reason that when it is raised the combination of the ship and ladder has very much the appearance of such an instrument with such contrivances and preparations were the romans intending to assault the towers but archimedes had constructed catapults to suit every range and the ships sailing up were still at considerable distance he so wounded the enemy with stones and darts from the tighter wound and longer engines to harass and perplex them to the last degree and when these began to carry over their heads he used smaller engines graduated according to the range required from time to time and by this means caused so much confusion among them to altogether check their advance and attack and ﬁnally marcellus was reduced in despair to bringing up his ships under cover of night but when they had come close to land and so too near to be hit by the catapults they found that archimedes had prepared another contrivance against the soldiers who fought from the decks he had pierced the wall high man stature with numerous which on the outside were about big the palm of the hand inside the wall he stationed archers and or scorpions and by the volleys dischar ged through these he made the marines useless by these means he not only bafﬂed the enemy whether at distance or close at hand but also killed the greater number of them often too they tried to work their sambucæ he had engines ready all along the walls not visible at other times but which suddenly reared themselves above the wall from the inside when the moment their use had come and stretched their beams far over the battlements some of them carrying stones weighing much ten talents and others great masses of lead so whenever the sambucæ were approaching these beams swung round on their pivot the required distance and by means of rope running through pulley dropt the stone upon the sambucæ with the result that it not only smashed the machine itself to pieces but put the ship also and all on board into the most serious danger other machines which he invented were directed against storming parties who advancing under the protection of were secured by them from being hurt by missiles shot through the walls agains t these he either shot stones big enough to drive the marines from the prow or let down an iron hand swung on chain by which the man who guided the crane having fastened on some part of the prow where he could get hold prest down the lever of the machin inside the wall and when he had thus lifted the prow and made the vessel rest upright on its stern he fastened the lever of his machine so that it could not be moved and then suddenly slackened the hand and chain by means of rope and pulley the result was that many of the vessels heeled over and fell on their sides some completely capsized while the greater number by their prows coming down suddenly from height dipt low in the sea shipped great quantity of water and became scene of the utmost confusion tho reduced almost to despair by these bafﬂing inventions of archimedes and tho he saw that all his attempts were repulsed by the 186 187 188 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume i of 10 greece https with mockery on their part and loss to himself marcellus could not yet refrain from making joke at his own expense saying that archimedes was using his ships to ladle out the but that his not having been invited to the party were buffeted and turned out with such was the end of the attempt at storming syracuse by sea nor was appius claudius more successf ul he too was compelled by similar difﬁculties to desist from the attempt while his men were still at considerable distance from the wall they began falling by the stones and shots from the engines and catapults the volleys of missiles indeed were extrao rdinarily rapid and sharp their construction had been provided by all the liberality of hiero and had been planned and engineered by the skill of an archimedes moreover when they did at length get near the walls they were prevented from maki ng an assault by the unceasing ﬁre through the which i mentioned before or if they tried to carry the place under cover of they were killed by the stones and beams let down upon their heads the garrison also did them little damage with those hands at the end of their engines they used to lift the men armor and all into the air and then throw them down at last appius retired into the camp and summoning the tribunes to council of war decided to try every possible means of taking syracuse except storm and this decision they carried out during the eight months of siege which followed tho there was stratagem or measure of daring which they did not attempt they never again ventured to attempt storm so true it is that one man and one intellect properly qualiﬁed the particular undertaking is host in itself and of extraordinary efﬁcacy in this instance at any rate we ﬁnd the romans conﬁdent that their forces by land and sea would enable them to become masters of the town if only one old man could be got rid of while long he remained there they did not venture even to think of making the attempt at least by any method which made it possible archimedes to oppose them they believed however that their best chance of reducing the garrison was by failure of provisions sufﬁcient so large number were within the town they theref ore relied upon this hope and with their ships tried to cut off their supplies by sea and with their army by land footnotes this paragraph is taken from book xi from book

92 i demosthenes and cicero compared 93 furthermore leaving the comparison aside of the difference of their eloquenc in their orations methinks i may say thus much of them that demosthenes did wholly employ all his wit and learning natural or artiﬁc ial unto the art of rhetoric and that in force and vertue of eloquence he did excel all the orators in his time and gravity and magniﬁcent style all those also that only write shew or ostentation and sharpness and art all the sophisters and masters of rhetoric and that cicero was man generally learned in all sciences and that had studied divers books appeareth plainly by the sundry books of philosophy of his own making written after the manner of the academic philosophers furthermore they may see in his orations he wrote in certain causes to serve him when he pleaded that he sought occasions in his to shew men that he was excellently well learned furthermore by their phrases man may discern some spark of their manners and conditions demosthenes phrase hath manner of ﬁneness jests nor grace in it but is altogether grave and harsh and not only smelleth of the lamp pytheas said when he mocked him but sheweth great drinker of water extreme pains and therewith also sharp and sour nature but cicero oftentimes fell from pleasant taunts unto plain scurrility and turni ng all his pleadings of matters of importance to sport and laughter having grace in it many times he did forget the comeliness that became man of his calling in his oration cælius where he saith it is marvel if in so great abundance of wealth and ﬁneness he give himself little to take his pleasure and that it was folly not to use pleasures lawful and tolerable sith the famousest philoso phers that ever were did place the chief felicity of man to be in pleasure and it is reported also that marcus cato having accused murena cicero being consul defended his cause and in his oration pleasantly girded all the sect of the stoic philosophers cato sake the strange opinions they hold which they call paradoxes insomuch he made all the people and judges also fall laughing good and cato himself also smiling little said unto them that sat by him what laughing and mocking consul have we my lords but letting that pass it seemeth that cicero was of pleasant and merry nature his face shewed ever great life and mirth in it whereas in demosthenes countenance on the other side they might discern marvellous diligence and care and pensive man never weary with pain insomuch that his enemies he reporteth himself called him perverse and froward man furthermore in their writings is discerned that the one speaketh modestly in his own praise so man can justly be offended with him and yet not always but when necessity enforceth him some matter of great importance but otherwise very discreet and modest to speak of himself cicero in contrary manner using too often repetition of one self thing in all his orations shewed an extreme ambition of glory when incessantly he cried out let spear and shield give place to gown and give the tongue the laurel crown yea furthermore he did not only praise his own acts and deeds but the orations also which he had written or pleaded if he should have contended against isocrates or anaximenes master that taught rheto ric and not to go about to reform the people of rome which were both ﬁerce and stout in arms 191 192 193 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume i of 10 greece https ﬁt to work their enemies harms it is requisite governor of commonwealth to seek authority by his eloquence so to cover the praise of his own glorious tongue or it were to beg it that sheweth base mind and therefore in this point we must confess that demosthe nes is far graver and of nobler mind who decla red himself that all his eloquence came only but by practice the which also required the favour of his auditory and further he thought them fools and madmen indeed they be less that therefore would make any boast of themselves in this they were both alike that both of them had great credit and authority in their orations to the people and obtaining that they would propound insomuch captains and they that had armies in their hands stood in need of their eloquence chares diopithes and leosthenes they all were holpen of demosthenes and pompey and octavius cæsar the young man of cicero cæsar himself confesseth in his commentaries he wrote unto agrippa and mæcenas but nothing shewet h man nature and condition more it is reported and so is it true that when one is in authority that bewrayeth his humou r and the affections of his mind and layeth open all his secret vices in him demosthenes could never deliver any such proof of himself because he never bare any ofﬁce nor was called forward he was not general of the army which he himself had prepared against king philip cicero on the other side being sent treasurer into sicily and into cilicia and cappadocia 94 in such time covetousness reigned most insomuch that the captains and governors whom they sent to govern their provinces thinking it villainy and dastardliness to rob did violently take things by force at what time also to take bribes was reckoned shame but to handle it discreetly he was the better thought of and beloved it he shewed plainly that he regarded not money and gave forth many proofs of his courtesy and goodness furthermore cicero being created consul by name but dictator in deed having absolute power and authority over all things to suppress the rebellion and conspirators of catiline he proved plato prophecy true which was that the cities are safe from danger when the chief magistrates and governors by some good divine fortune govern with wisdom and justice demosthenes was reproved his corruption and selling of his eloquence because secretly he wrote one oration phormio and another in the self same manner apollodorus they being both advers aries further he was defamed also receiving money of the king of persia and there withal condemned the money which he had taken of harpalus and though some peradventure would object that the reports thereof which are many lie yet they can not possibly deny this that demosthenes had power to refrain from looking on the presents which divers kings did offer him praying him to accept them in good part their sakes neither was that the part of man that did take usury by trafﬁck on the sea the extremest yet of all other in contrary manner we have said before it is certain that cicero being treasurer refused the gifts which the sicilians offered him there and the presents also which the king of the cappadocians offered him whilst he was in cilicia and those especially which his friends pressed upon him to take of them being great sum of money when he went banished man out of rome furthermore the banishment of the one was infamous to him because by judgement he was banished thief the banishment of the other was honourable an act ever he did being banished ridding his country of wicked men and therefore of demosthenes there was speech after he was gone but cicero all the senate changed their apparel into black and determined that they would pass decree by their authority before cicero banishment was revoked by the people indeed cicero idly passed his time of banishment and did nothing all the while he was in macedon and one of the chiefest acts that demosthenes did in all the time that he dealt in the affairs of the commonwealth was in his banishment he went into every city and did assist the ambassadors of the grecians and refused the ambassadors of the macedonians in the which he showed himself better citizen than either themistocles or alcibiades in their like fortune and exile so when he was called home and returned he fell again to his old trade which he practiced before and was ever against antipater 95 and the macedonians where lælius in open 194 195 196 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume i of 10 greece https sharply took up cicero that he sat still and said nothing when that octavius cæsar the young man made petition against the law that he might sue the consulship and being so young that he had never hair on his face and brutus self also doth reprove cicero in his letters that he had maintained and nourished more grievous and greater tyranny than that which they had put down and last of all thinketh the death of cicero most pitiful to see an old man carried up and down with tender love of his servants seeking all the ways that might be to ﬂy death which did not long prevent his natural course and in the end old he was to see his head so pitifully cut off whereas demosthenes though he yielded little entreating him that came to take him yet that he had prepared the poison long before that he had kept it long and also used it he did he can not but be marvellously commended it sith the god neptune denied him the beneﬁt of his sanctuary he betook him to greater and that was death whereby he saved himself out of the soldiers hands of the tyrant and also scorned the bloody cruelty of antipater footnotes plutarch

he might have been one of cæsar chiefest friends and of greater authority and credit about him howbeit cassius friends did dissuade him from it 98 cassius and he were not yet reconciled together sithence their ﬁrst contention and strife the prætorship and prayed him to beware of cæsar sweet enticements and to ﬂy his tyrannical favors the which they said cæsar gave him not to honor his 92 93 94 95 197 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume i of 10 greece https but to weaken his constant mind framing it to the bent of his bow now cæsar on the other side did not trust him overmuch nor was not without tales brought unto him against him howbeit he feared his great mind authority and friends yet on the other side also he trusted his and fair conditions intelligence being brought him one day that mark antony and dolabella did conspire against him he answered that these fat men made him not afraid but the lean and fellows meaning that by brutus and cassius at another time also when one accused brutus unto him and bade him beware of him what said he again clapping his hand on his breast think ye that brutus will not tarry till this body die meaning that none but brutus after him was meet to have such power he had and surely in my opinion i am persuaded that brutus might indeed have come to have been the chiefest man of rome if he could have contented himself time to have been next unto cæsar and to have suffered his glory and authority which he had gotten by his great victories to consume with time but cassius being choleric man and hating cæsar privately more than he did the tyranny openly he incensed brutus against him but brutus his friends and countrymen both by divers procurements and sundry rumours of the city and by many bills also did openly call and procure him to that he did under the image of his ancestor junius brutus that drave the kings out of rome 99 they wrote oh that it pleased the gods thou wert now alive brutus and again that thou wert here among us now his tribunal or chair where he gave audience during the time he was prætor was full of such bills brutus thou art asleep and art not brutus indeed therefore cassius considering this matter with himself did ﬁrst of all speak to brutus since they grew strange together the suit they had the prætorship so when he was reconciled to him again and that they had embraced one another cassius asked him if he were determined to be in the the ﬁrst day of the month of march because he heard say that cæsar friends should move the council that day that cæsar should be called king by the senate brutus answered him he would not be there but if we be sent said cassius how then myself then said brutus i mean not to hold my peace but to withstand it and rather die than lose my liberty cassius being bold and taking hold of this word why quoth he what roman is he alive that will suffer thee to die the liberty what knowest thou not that thou art brutus thinkest thou that they be cobblers tapsters or suchlike base mechanical people that write these bills and scrolls which are found daily in thy prætor chair and not the noblest men and best citizens that it be thou well assured that of other prætors they look gifts common distributions amongst the people and common plays and to see fencers ﬁght at the sharp to show the people pastime but at thy hands they specially require due debt unto them the taking away of the tyranny being fully bent to suffer any extremity thy sake so that thou wilt show thyself to be the man thou art taken and that they hope thou art thereupon he kissed brutus and embraced him and so each taking leave of other they went both to speak with the friends about it now brutus who knew very well that his sake all the noblest valiantest and most courageous men of rome did venture their lives weighing with himself the greatness of the danger when he was out of his house he did so frame and fashion his countenance and looks that man could discern he had anything to trouble his mind but when night came that he was in his own house then he was cleaned changed either care did wake him against his will when he could have slept or else oftentimes of himself he fell into such deep thoughts of this enterprise casting in his mind all the dangers that might happen that his wife lying by him found that there was some marvellous great matter that troubled his mind not being wont to be in that taking and that he could not well determine with himself his wife porcia 100 we have told you before was the daughter of cato whom brutus married being his cousin not maiden but young widow after the death of her ﬁrst 198 199 200 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume i of 10 greece https bibulus by whom she had also young son called bibulus who afterwards wrote book of the acts and gests of brutus extant at this present day this young lady being excellently well seen in philosophy loving her husband well and being of noble courage she was also wise because she would not ask her husband what he ailed before she had made some proof by herself she took little razor such barbers occupy to pare men nails and causing her maids and women to go out of her chamber gave herself great gash withal in her thigh that she was straight all of and incontinently after vehement fever took her by reason of the pain of her wound then perceiving her husband was marv ellously out of quiet and that he could take rest even in her greatest pain of all she spake in this sort unto him i being brutus said she the daughter of cato was married unto thee not to be thy bedfellow and companion in bed and at board only like harlot but to be partaker also with thee of thy good and evil fortune now thyself i can ﬁnd cause of fault in thee touching our match but my part how may i show my duty towards thee and how much i would thy sake if i can not constantly bear secret mischance or grief with thee that requireth secrecy and ﬁdelity i confes s that woman wit commonly is too weak to keep secret safely but yet brutus good education and the company of virtuous men have some power to reform the defect of nature and myself i have this beneﬁt moreover that i am the daughter of cato and wife of brutus this notwithstand ing i did not trust to any of these things before until that now i have found by experience that pain nor grief whatsoever can overcom with those words she showed him her wound on her thigh and told him what she had done to prove herself brutus was amazed to hear what she said unto him and lifting up his hands to heaven he besought the gods to give him the grace he might bring his enterprise to so good pass that he might be found husband worthy of so noble wife porcia so he then did comfort her the best he could so when this day was come brutus went out of his house with dagger by his side under his long gown that nobody saw nor knew but his wife only the other conspirators were all assembled at cassius house to bring his son into the who on that day did put on the man gown called toga virilis and from thence they came all in troop together unto pompey porch looking that cæsar would straight come thither but here is to be noted the wonderful assured constancy of these conspirators in so dang erous and weighty an enterprise they had undertaken many of them being prætors by reason of their ofﬁce whose duty is to minist er justice to everybody they did not only with great quietness and courtesy hear them that spake unto them or that plead matters before them and gave them attentive ear if they had had other matter in their heads but moreover they gave just sentence and carefully despatched the causes before them so there was one among them who being condemned in certain sum of money refused to pay it and cried out that he did appeal unto cæsar then brutus casting his eyes upon the conspirators said cæsar shall not let to see the law executed notwithstanding this by chance there fell out many misfortunes unto them which was enough to have marred the enterprise the ﬁrst and chiefest was cæsar long tarrying who came very late to the senate because the signs of the sacriﬁces appeared unlucky his wife calpurnia 101 kept him at home and the soothsayers bade him beware he went not abroad the second cause was when one came unto casca being conspirator and taking him by the hand said unto him casca thou keepest it close from but brutus hath told all casca being amazed at it the other went on with his tale and said why how now how cometh it to pass thou art thus rich that thou dost sue to be ædile thus casca being deceived by the other doubtful words he told them it was thousand to one he blabbed not out all the conspiracy another senator called popilius lænas after he had saluted brutus and cassius more friendly than he was wont to he rounded softly in their ears and told them i pray the gods you may go through with that you have taken in hand but withal despatch i read you your enterprise is bewrayed when he had said he presently departed from them and left them both afraid that their conspiracy would out 201 202 203 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume i of 10 greece https in the meantime there came one of brutus men unto him and told him his wife was porcia being very careful and pensive that whic h was to come and being too weak to away with so great and inward grief of mind she could hardly keep within but was frightened with every little noise and cry she heard those that art taken and possessed with the fury of the bacchants asking every man that came from the what brutus did and still sent messenger after messenger to know what news at length cæsar coming being prolonged you have heard porcia weakness was not able to hold out any longer and thereupon she suddenly swooned that she had leisure to go to her chamber but was taken in the midst of her house where her speech and senses failed her howbeit she soon came to her self again and so was laid in her bed and tended by her women when brutus heard these news it grieved him it is to be presupposed yet he left not off the care of his country and commonwealth neither went home to his house any news he heard now it was reported that cæsar was coming in his litter he determined not to stay in the senate all that day because he was afraid of the unlucky signs of the sacriﬁces but to adjourn matters of importance unto the next session and council holden feigning himself not to be well at ease when cæsar came out of his litter popilius lænas that had talked before with brutus and cassius and had prayed the gods they might bring this enterprise to pass went unto cæsar and kept him long time with talk cæsar gave good ear unto him wherefore the conspirators if so they should be called not hearing what he said to cæsar but conjecturing by that he had told them little before that his talk was none other but the very discovery of their conspiracy they were afraid every man of them and one looking in another face it was easy to see that they all were of mind that it was tarrying them till they were apprehended but rather that they should kill themselves with their own hands and when cassius and certain others clapped their hands on their swords under their gowns to draw them brutus marking the countenance and gesture of lænas and considering that he did use himself rather like an humble and earnest suitor than like an accuser he said nothing to his companion because there were many amongst them that were not of the conspiracy but with pleasant countenance encouraged cassius and immediately after lænas went from cæsar and kissed his hand which shewed plainly that it was some matter concerning himself that he had held him so long in talk now all the senators being entered ﬁrst into this place or chapter where the council should be kept all the other conspirators straight stood about cæsar chair if they had had something to have said unto him and some say that cassius casting his eyes upon pompey image made his prayer unto it if it had been alive trebonius on the other side drew mark antony aside he came into the house where the senate sat and held him with long talk without when cæsar was come into the house all the senate rose to honour him at his coming in so when he was set the conspirators ﬂocked about him and amongst them they presented one metellus cimber who made humble suit the calling home again of his brother that was banished they all made though they were intercessors him and took him by the hands and kissed his head and breast cæsar at the ﬁrst simply refused their kindness and entreaties but afterwards perceiving they still pressed on him he violently thrust them from him then cimber with both his hands plucked cæsar gown over his shoulders and casca that stood behind him drew his dagger ﬁrst and struck cæsar upon the shoulder but gave him great wound cæsar feeling himself hurt took him straight by the hand he held his dagger in and cried out in latin traitor casca what doest thou casca on the other side cried in greek and called his brother to help him so divers running on heap together to ﬂy upon cæsar he looking about him to have ﬂed saw brutus with sword drawn in his hand ready to strike at him then he let casca hand go and casting his gown over his face suffered every man to strike at him that would then the conspirators thronging one upon another because every man was desirous to have cut at him so many swords and daggers lighting upon one body one of them hurt another and among them brutus caught blow on his hand because he would make one in murthering of him and all the rest also were every man of them bloodied cæsar being 204 205 206 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume i of 10 greece https in this manner brutus standing in the midst of the house would have spoken and stayed the other senators that were not of the conspiracy to have told them the reason why they had done this fact but they men both affrayed and amazed ﬂed one upon another neck in haste to get out at the door and man followed them it was set down and agreed between them that they should kill man but cæsar only and should entreat all the rest to defend their liberty all the conspirators but brutus determi ning upon this matter thought it good also to kill mark antony 102 because he was wicked man and that in nature favoured tyranny besides also that he was in great estimation with soldiers having been conversant of long time amongst them and specially having mind bent to great enterprises he was also of great authority at that time being consul with cæsar but brutus would not agree to it first that he said it was not honest secondly because he told them there was hope of change in him he did not mistrust but that mark antony being minded and courageous man when he should know that cæsar was dead would willingly help his country to recover her liberty having them an example unto him to follow their courage and virtue so brutus by this means saved mark antony life who at that present time disguised himself and stole away but brutus and his consorts having their swords bloody in their hands went straight to the capitol persuading the romans they went to take their liberty again footnotes from the life of julius cæsar translated by north marcus junius brutus had originally been an adherent of pompey but after the battle at pharsalia in 48 went over

with world of gifts store of gold and silver and of riches and other sumptuous ornaments is credible enough she might bring from so great house and from so wealthy and rich realm egypt was but yet she carried nothing with her wherein she trusted more than in her self and in the charms and enchantment of her passing beauty and grace therefore when she was sent unto by divers letters both from antony himself and also from his friends she made so light of it and mocked antony so much that she disdained to set forward otherwise but to take her barge in the river of cydnus the poop whereof was of

that his footmen were broken and overthrown he then ﬂed into the city crying out that cleopatra had betrayed him unto them with whom he had made war her sake then she being afraid of his fury ﬂed into the tomb which she had caused to be made and there locked the doors unto her and shut all the springs of the locks with great bolts and in the meantime sent unto antony to tell him that she was dead antony believing it said unto himself what dost thou look further antony sith spiteful fortune had taken from thee the only joy thou hadst whom thou yet reservedst thy life when he had said these words he went into cham ber and unarmed himself and being naked said thus cleopatra it grieveth not that i have lost thy company i will not be long from thee but i am sorry that having been so great captain and emperor i am indeed condemned to be judged of less courage and noble mind than woman now he had man of his called eros whom he loved and trusted much and whom he had long before caused to swear unto him that he should kill him when he did command him and then he willed him to keep his promise his man drawing his sword lift it up though he had meant to have stricken his master but turning his head at one side he thrust his sword into himself and fell down dead at his master foot then said antony noble eros i thank thee this and it is valiantly done of thee to shew what i should to my self which thou couldst not therewithal he took his sword and thrust it into his belly and so fell down upon little bed the wound he had killed him not presently the blood stinted little when he was laid and when he came somewhat to himself again he prayed them that were about him to despatch him but they all ﬂed out of the chamber and left him crying out and tormenting himself until at last there came secretary unto him called diomedes who was commanded to bring him unto the tomb or monument where cleopatra was 211 212 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume i of 10 greece https he heard that she was alive he very earnestly prayed his men to carry his body thither and so he was carried in his men arms into the entry of the monument notwithstanding cleopatra would not open the gates but came to the high windows and cast out certain chains and ropes in the which antony was trussed and cleopatra her own self with two women only which she had suffered to come with her into these monuments triced antony up they that were present to behold it said they never saw so pitiful sight they plucked up poor antony all bloody he was and drawing on with pangs of death who holding up his hands to cleopatra raised up himself well he could it was hard thing these women to to lift him up but cleopatra stooping down with her head putting to all her strength to her uttermost power did lift him up with much ado and never let go her hold with the help of the women beneath that bade her be of good courage and were sorry to see her labour so she her self so when she had gotten him in after that sort and laid him on bed she rent her garments upon him clapping her breast and scratching her face and stomach then she dried up his blood that had berayed his face and called him her lord her husband and emperor forgetting her own misery and calamity the pity and compassion she took of him antony made her cease her lamenting and called wine either because he was athirst or else that he thought thereby to hasten his death when he had drunk he earnestly prayed her and persuaded her that she would seek to save her life if she could possible without reproach and dishonour and that chieﬂy she should trust proculeius above any man else about cæsar and himself that she should not lament nor sorrow the miserable change of his fortune at the end of his days but rathe r that she should think him the more fortunate the former triumphs and honours he had received considering that while he lived he was the noblest and greatest prince of the world and that now he was overcome not cowardly but valiantly roman by another roman antony gave the last gasp proculeius came that was sent from cæsar after antony had thrust his sword in himself they carried him into the tombs and monuments of cleopatra one of his guard called dercetæus took his sword with the which he had stricken himself and hid it then he secretly stole away and brought octavius cæsar the ﬁrst news of his death and shewed him his sword that was bloodied cæsar hearing these news straight withdrew himself into secret place of his tent and there burst out with tears lamenting his hard and miserable fortune that had been his friend and brother 107 his equal in the empire and companion with him in sundry great exploits and battels then he called all his friends and shewed them the letters antony had written to him and his answ ers also sent him again during their quarrel and strife and how ﬁercely and proudly the other answered him to all just and reasonable matters he wrote unto him after this he sent proculeius and commanded him to what he could possible to get cleopatra alive fearing lest otherwise all the treasure would be lost and furthermore he thought that if he could take cleopatra and bring her alive to rome she would marvellously beautify and set out his triumph but cleopatra would never put her self into proculeius hands although they spake together proculeius came to the gates that were very thick and strong and surely barred but yet there were some crannies through the which her voice might be heard and so they without understood that cleopatra demanded the kingdom of egypt her sons and that proculeius answered her that she should be of good cheer and not be affrayed to refer all unto cæsar after he had viewed the place very well he came and reported her answer unto cæsar who immediately sent gallus to speak once again with her and bade him purposely hold her with talk whilst proculeius did set up ladder against that high window by the which antony was triced up and came down into the monument with two of his men hard by the gate where cleopatra stood to hear what gallus said unto her one of her women which was shut in her monuments with her saw proculeius by chance he came down and shrieked out poor cleopatra thou art taken then when she saw proculeius behind her she came from the gate she thought to have stabbed her self in 213 214 215 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume i of 10 greece https short dagger she wore of purpose by her side but proculeius came suddenly upon her and taking her by both the hands said unto her cleopatra ﬁrst thou shalt thy self great wrong and secondly unto cæsar to deprive him of the occasion and opportunity openly to shew his bounty and mercy and to give his enemies cause to accuse the most courteous and noble prince that ever was and to appeach him though he were cruel and merciless man that were not to be trusted so even he spake the word he took her dagger from her and shook her clothes fear of any poison hidden about her afterwards cæsar sent one of his enfranchised men called epaphroditus whom he straightly charged to look well unto her and to beware in any case that she made not her self away and the rest to use her with all the courtesy possible and himself he in the meantime entered the city of alexandria and he went talked with the philosopher arrius and held him by the hand to the end that his countrymen should reverence him the more because they saw cæsar so highly esteem and honour him then he went into the of exercises and so up to his chair of state which was prepared him of great height and there according to his commandment all the people of alexandria were assembled who quaking fear fell down on their knees before him and craved mercy cæsar bade them all stand up and told them openly that he forgave the people and pardoned the felonies and offences they had committed against him in this war first the founder sake of the same city which was alexander the great secondly the beauty of the city which he much esteemed and wondered at thirdly the love he bare unto his very friend arrius thus did cæsar honour arrius who craved pardon himself and many others and especially philostratus the eloquentest man of all the sophisters and orators of his time present and sudden speech howbeit he falsely named himself an academic philosopher therefore cæsar that hated his nature and conditions would not hear his suit thereupon he let his grey beard grow long and followed arrius step by step in long mourning gown still buzzing in his ears this greek verse wise man if that he be wise indeed may by wise man have the better speed cæsar understanding this not the desire he had to deliver philostratus of his fear to rid arrius of malice and envy that might have fallen out against him he pardoned him now touching antony sons antyllus his eldest son by fulvia was slain becaus his schoolmaster theodorus did betray him unto the soldiers who strake off his head and the villain took precious stone of great value from his neck the which he did sew in his girdle and afterwards denied that he had it but it was found about him and so cæsar trussed him up it cleopatra children they were very honourably kept with their governors and train that waited on them but cæsarion who was said to be julius cæsar son 108 his mother cleopatra had sent him unto the indians through ethiopia with great sum of money but one of his governors also called rhodon even such another theodorus persuaded him to return into his country and told him that cæsar sent him to give him his mother kingdom so cæsar was determining with himself what he should arrius said unto him too many cæsars is not good alluding unto certain verse of homer that saith too many lords doth not well therefore cæsar did put cæsarion to death after the death of his mother cleopatra many princes great kings and captains did crave antony body of octavius cæsar to give him honourable burial but cæsar would never take it from cleopatra who did sumptuously and royally bury him with her own hands whom cæsar suffered to take much she would to bestow upon his funerals 216 217 218 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume i of 10 greece https was she altogether overcome with sorrow and passion of mind

have good colour to abstain from meat and that so she might have died easily without any trouble she had physician called olympus whom she made privy of her intent to the end he should help her rid her out of her life olympus writeth himself who wrote book of all these thing but cæsar mistrusted the matter by many conjectures he had and therefore did put her in fear and threatened her to put her children to shameful death with these threats cleopatra fear yielded straight she would have yielded unto strokes and afterwards suffered her self to be cured and dieted they listed shortly after cæsar came himself in person to see her and to comfort her cleopatra being laid upon little low bed in poor state when she saw cæsar come into her chamber she suddenly rose up naked in her smock and fell down at his feet marvellously disﬁgured both that she had plucked her hair from her head also that she had martyred all her face with her nails and besides her voice was small and trembling her eyes sunk into her head with continual blubbering and moreover they might see the most part of her stomach torn in sunder to be short her body was not much better than her mind yet her good grace and comeliness and the force of her beauty was not altogether defaced but notwithstanding this ugly and pitiful state of hers yet she shewed her self within by her outward looks and countenance when cæsar had made her lie down again and sat by her bedside cleopatra began to clear and excuse her self that she had done laying all to the fear she had of antony cæsar in contrary manner reproved her in every point then she suddenly altered her speech and prayed him to pardon her though she were affrayed to die and desirous to live at length she gave him brief and memorial of all the ready money and treasure she had but by chance there stood seleucus by one of her treasurers who to seem good servant came straight to cæsar to disprove cleopatra that she had had not set in all but kept many things

desire to save her life so he made her answer that he did not only give her that to dispose of at her pleasure which she had kept back but further promised to use her more honourably and bountifully that she would think and so he took his leave of her supposing he had deceived her but indeed he was deceived himself there was young gentleman cornelius dolabella 109 that was of cæsar very great familiars and besides did bear evil will unto cleopatra he sent her word secretly she had requested him that cæsar determined to take his journey through syria and that within three days he would send her away before with her children when this was told cleopatra she requested cæsar that it would please him to suffer her to offer the last oblations of the dead unto the soul of antony this being granted her she was carried to the place where his tomb was and there falling down on her knees embracing the tomb with her women the tears running down her cheeks she began to speak in this sort my

of the wicked exempt from these evils not one consequently then they are not free if some person who has been twice consul should hear this he will forgive you provided you add but you are wise and this has reference to you but if you tell him the truth that in point of slavery he does not necessarily differ from those who have been thrice sold what but chastisement can you expect how he says am i slave my father was free my mother free besides i am senator too and the friend of cæsar and have been twice consul and have myself many slaves in the ﬁrst place most worthy sir perhaps your father too was slave of the same kind and your mother and your grandfather and all your series of ancestors but even were they ever so free what is that to you what if they were of gene rous you of mean spirit they brave and you coward they sober and you dissolute but what he says has this to with my being slave is it part of slavery to act against your will under compulsion and lamenting be it so but who can compel but the master of all cæsar by your own confession then you have one master and let not his being you say master of all give you any comfort then you are merely slave in large family thus the nicopolitans too frequently cry out by the genius of cæsar we are free the present however if you please we will let cæsar alone but tell this have you never been in love with any one either of servile or liberal condition why what has that to with being slave or free were you never commanded anything by your mistress that you did not choose have you never ﬂattered your fair slave have you never kissed her feet and yet if you were commanded to kiss cæsar feet you would think it an outrage and an excess of tyranny what else is this than slavery have you never gone out by night where you did not desire have you never spent more than you chose have you not sometimes uttere d your words with sighs and groans have you never borne to be reviled and shut but if you are ashamed to confess your own follies see what thrasonides says and does who after having fought more battles perhaps than you went out by night when his slave geta would not dare to go nay had he been compelled to it would have gone bewailing and lamenting the bitterness of servitude and what says he afterward contemptible girl has enslaved whom enemy ever enslaved wretch to be the slave of girl and

athenians and lacedæmonians quarreled with each other and the thebans with both the persian king with greece and the macedonians with both and now the romans with the getes 112 and in still remoter times the trojan war arose from the same cause alexander paris was the guest of menelaus and whoever had seen the mutual proofs of that passed between them would never have believed that they were not friends but tempting bait pretty woman was thrown in between them and thence came war at present therefore when you see that dear brothers have in appearance but one soul not immediately pronounce upon their love not tho they should swear it and afﬁrm it was impossible to live asunder the governing faculty of bad man is faithless unsettled undiscriminating successively vanquished by different semblances but inquire not others whether they were born of the same parents and brought up together and under the same preceptor but this thing only in what they place their externals or in their own wills if in externals you can more pronounce them friends than you can call them faithful or constant or brave or free nay nor even truly men if you are wise it is principle of humanity that makes them bite and vilify each other and take possession of public assemblies wild beasts of solitudes and mountains and convert courts of justice into dens of robbers that prompts them to be intemperate adulterers seducers or leads them into other offenses that men commit against each from that one single error by which they risk themselves and their own concerns on things uncontrollable by will but if you hear that these men in reality suppose good to be placed only in the will and in right use of things they appear longer take the trouble of inquiring if they are father and son or old companions and acquaintances but boldly pronounce that they are friends and also that they are faithful and just where else can friendship be met but joined with ﬁdelity and modesty and the intercommunication of virtue alone well but such one paid the utmost regard so long time and did he not love how can you tell foolish man if that regard be any other than he pays to his shoes or his horse when he cleans them and how you know but that when you cease to be necessary utensil he may throw you away like broken stool well but it is my wife and we have lived together many years and how many did eriphyle live with amphiaraus and was the mother of children not few but bauble came between them what was this bauble false conviction concerning certain things this turned her into savage animal this cut asunder all love and suf fered neither the wife nor the mother to continue such whoever therefore among you studies either to be or to gain friend let him cut up all false convictions

he will be without disguise to such are unlike he will be patient mild gentle and ready to forgive them failing in points of the greatest importance but severe to none being fully convinced of plato doctrine that the soul is never willingly deprived of truth without all this you may in many respects live friends and drink and lodge and travel together and even be born of the same parents and so

from having provided myself with any elaborate defense of them any of these that have been omitted by him and not previously emphasized by myself i propose now to quote this will be the best way to show you who were the persons that i sold by auction and inveighed against pretenders and impostors please to concentrate your vigilance on the truth or falsehood of my descriptions if what i say is injurious or severe your censure will be more fairly directed at the perpetrators than at the discoverer of such iniquities i had sooner realized the odious practises which his profession imposes on an deceit falsehood bluster clamor pushing and all the long hateful list than i ﬂed matter of course from these betook myself to your dear service philosophy and pleased myself with the thought of remainder of life spent far from the tossing waves in calm haven beneath your shadow at my ﬁrst peep into your realm how could i but admire yourself and all these your disciples there they were legislating the perfect life holding out hands of help to those that would reach it commending all that was fairest and best fairest and man must keep straight on it and never slip must set his eyes unwaveringly on the laws that you have laid down must tune and test his life thereby and that zeus be my witness there are few enough in these days of ours to so i saw how many were in love not with philosophy but with the credit it brings in the vulgar externals so easy any one to ape they showed striking resemblance to the real article perfect in beard and walk and attire but in life and conduct they belied their looks read your lessons backwards and degraded their profession then i was wroth methought it was tho some soft womanish actor on the tragic stage should give us achilles or theseus or heracles himself he can not stride nor speak out hero should but minces along under his enormous mask helen or polyxena would ﬁnd him too realistically feminine to pass them and what shall an invincible heracles say will he not swiftly pound man and mask together into nothingness with his club womanizing and disgracing him well these people were about ﬁt to represent you and the degradation of it all was too much apes daring to masquerade heroes emulators of the ass at cyme the cymeans you know had never seen ass or lion so the ass came the lion over them with the aid of borrowed skin and his most bray however stranger who had often seen both brought the truth to light with stick but what most distrest philosophy was this when one of these people was detected in rascality impropriety or immorality every one put it down to philosophy and to the particular philosopher whose name the delinquent took in vain without ever acting on his principles the living rascal disgraced you the long dead you were not there in the ﬂesh to point the contrast so it was clear enough that his life was vile and disgusting your case was given away by association with his and you had to share his disgrace this spectacle i say was too much i began exposing them and distinguishing between them and you and this good work you now arraign so then if i ﬁnd one of the initiated betraying and parodyin g the mysteries of the two goddesses and if i protest and denounce him the transgression will be mine there is something wrong there why at the games if an actor who has to present athene or poseidon or zeus plays his part badly derogating from the divine dignity the stewards have him whipt well the gods are not angry with them having the ofﬁcers whip the man who wears their mask and their attire i imagine they approve of the punishment to play slave or messenger 248 249 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics volume i of 10 greece https is triﬂing offense but to represent zeus or heracles to the spectators in an unworthy is crime and sacrilege i can indeed conceive nothing more extraor dinary than that so many of them should get themselves absolutely perfect in your words and then live precisely if the sole object of reading and studying them had been to reverse them in practise all their professions of despising wealth and appearances of admiring nothing but what is noble of superiority to passion of being proof against splendor and associating with its owners only on equal fair and wise and laudable they all are but they take pay imparting them they are abashed in presence of the rich their lips water at sight of coin they are dogs temper hares cowardice apes imitativeness asses lust cats thievery cocks jealousy they are perfect laughingstock with their strivings after vile ends their jostling of each other at rich men doors their attendance at crowded dinners and their vulgar obsequiousness at table they swill more than they should and would like to swill more than they they spoil the wine with unwelcome and untimely disquisitions and they can not carry their liquor the ordinary people who are present naturally ﬂout them and are revolted by the philosophy which breeds such brutes what is so monstrous is that every man of them says he has needs proclaims aloud that wisdom is the only wealth and directly afterward comes begging and makes fuss if he is refused it would hardly be stranger to see one in kingly attire with tall tiara crown and all the attributes of royalty asking his inferiors little something more when they want to get something we hear great deal to be sure about community of goods wealth is thing what is gold and silver more nor less worth than pebbles on the beach but when an old comrade and tried friend needs help and comes to them with his modest requirements ah then there is silence and searchings of heart unlearning of tenets and ﬂat renunciation of doctrines all their ﬁne talk of friendship with virtue and the good have vanished and ﬂown who knows whither they were winged words in sad truth empty fantoms only meant daily conversational use these men are excellent friends so long there is gold or silver them to dispute the possession of exhibit but copper or two and peace is broken truce void armistice ended their books are blank their virtue ﬂed and they so many dogs some one has ﬂung bone into the pack and up they spring to bite each other and snarl at the one which has pounced successfully there is story of an egyptian king who taught some apes

treatment but those pretenders deserve my detestation they have that of heaven why tell all of you what have such creatures to with you is there trace in their lives of kindred and afﬁnity does oil mix with water if they grow their beards and call themselves philosophers and look solemn these things make them like you i could have contained myself if there had been any touch of plausibility in their acting but the vulture is more like the nightingale than they like philosophers and now i have pleaded my cause to the best of my ability truth i rely upon you to conﬁrm my words philosophy

their delight in romancing themselves is only equaled by the earnest attention with which they receive other people ef forts in the same direction philocles why in some cases there is lack of motives of interest tychiades ah but that is neither here nor there i am not speaking of men who lie with an object there is some excuse that indeed it is sometimes to their credit when they deceive their country enemies instance or when mendacity is but the medicine to heal their sickness odysseus seeking to preserve his life and bring his companions safe home was liar of that kind the men i mean are innocent of any ulterior motive they prefer lie to truth simply on its own merits they like lying it is their favorite occupation there is necessity in the case now what good can they get out of it philocles why have you ever known any one with such strong natural turn lying tychiades any number of them philocles then i can only say they must be fools if they really prefer evil to good 121 122

respects who have somehow picked up this vice of romancing it makes quite angry what satisfaction can there be to men of their good qualities in deceiving themselves and their neighbors there are instances among the ancients with which you must be more familiar than look at herodotus or ctesias of cnidus 126 or to go further back take the himself here are men of celebrity perpetuating their mendacity in black and white not content with deceiving their hearers they must send their lies down to posterity under the protection of the most admirable verse many time i have blushed them i read of the mutilation of uranus the fetters of prometheus the revolt of the giants the torments of hell enamored zeus taking the shape of bull or swan women turning into birds and bears pegasuses chimæras gorgons cyclopes and the rest of it monstrous medley ﬁt only to charm the imaginations of children whom mormo and lamia have still their terrors however poets i suppose will be poets but when it comes to national lies when one ﬁnds whole cities bouncing collectively like one man how is one to keep one countenance cretan will look you in the face and tell you that yonder is zeus tomb in athens you are informed that erichthonius sprang out of the earth and that the ﬁrst athenians grew up from the soil like so many cabbages and this story assumes quite sober aspect when compared with that of the sparti whom the thebans claim descent from dragon teeth if you presume to doubt these stories if you choose to exert your common sense and leave triptolemus winged aerial car and pan marathonian exploits and orithyia mishap to the stronger digestions of corœbus and margites you are fool and blasphemer questioning such palpable truths such is the power of lies philocles i must say i think there is some excuse tychiades both your national liars and the poets the latter are quite right in throwing in little mythology it has very pleasing effect and is just the thing to secure the attention of their hearers on the other hand the athenians and the thebans and the rest are only trying to add to the luster of their respective cities take away the legendary treasures of greece and you condemn the whole race of ciceroni to starvation sightseers not want the truth they would not take it at gift however i surrender to your ridicule any one who has such motive and yet rejoices in lies tychiades very well now i have just been with the great eucrates who treated to whole string of old wives tales i came away in the middle of it he was too much altogether furies could not have driven out more effectually than his tongue philocles what eucrates of all credible witnesses that venerably bearded sexagenarian with his philosophic leanings i could never have believed that he would lend his countenance to other people lies much less that he was capable of such things himself tychiades my dear sir you should have heard the stuff he told the way in which he vouched the truth of it all too solemnly staking the lives of his children on his veracity i stared at him in amazement not knowing what to make of it one moment i thought he must be out of his mind the next i concluded he had been humbug all along an ape in lion skin oh it was monstrous when i was young man said he i passed some time in egypt my father having sent to that country my education i took it into my head to sail up the nile to coptus and thence pay visit to the statue of memnon 127 and hear the curious sound that proceeds from it at sunrise in this respect i was more fortunate than most
