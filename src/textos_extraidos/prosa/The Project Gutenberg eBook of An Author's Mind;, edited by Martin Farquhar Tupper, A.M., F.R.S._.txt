induced nothing loth to attempt the subtle abduction of the heroine headed always by manlius ready in the vestibule to escort him and exit nattalis alone minute betrays his own selﬁsh schemes

hope to claim originality or novelty to my own conscience however these things are reversed contemplation has produced that new to my own mind which may be old to others deeper read and has thought those ideas original which are only so to its own fancy very little then must such i reasonably hope to add on prophetical interpretation the universal wisdom of two millenaries can not be expected to gain any thing from the passing thought of hodiernal unit if any fancies in my brain are really new and hitherto unbroached upon the subject it can scarcely be doubted but that they are false so very little reliance principles of catholicity allow to be placed upon private interpretations with thus much of apology to those alike who will ﬁnd and those who will not ﬁnd any thing of novelty in my notions i still not withhold them by here little and there little is the general mind instructed it would be better the world if every mighty tome really contributed its grain the prophecies of holy writ appear to to have one great peculiarity distinguishing them from all other prophecies if any real or pretended and that peculiarity i deferentially conceive to be this that whereas all human prophecies profess to have but one fulﬁlment the divine have avowedly many true fulﬁlments the former may indeed light upon some one coincidence and may exult in the accident proof of truth the latter bounds it were like geor ge herbert sabbaths from one to another and another through some forty centuries equally fulﬁlled in each case but still looking forward with hope to some grander catastrophe it is not that they are loosely suited like the delphic oracles to whatever may turn up but that they by felicitous adaptation sit closely into each which the architect of ages has arranged pythonic divination may be likened to loose bag which woul d hold and involve with equal ease almost any circumstance biblical prophecy to an exact mould into which alone though not all similar in perfection its own true casts will ﬁt or again in another view of the matter accept this similitude let the g eye be the centre of many concentric circles beholding equally in perspective the circumference of each and accorda nce with human periods of time measuring off segments by conver ging radii separately marked on each segment of the wheel within wheel in the way of actual fulﬁlment well type and

and pious men may alike be right and hold together different minds travel on the different peripheries so our lord to take familiar instance speaks of his second advent in terms equally applicable to the destruction of one city of the accumulated hosts at armageddon and of this material earth antiochus and antichrist occur prospectively within the same pair of radii at differing distances and in

laodicea the riches of civilization choking the plant of christianity its decline and but the founder second coming its fall if indeed this were possible the elucidation of these several hints might show some striking conﬁrmations of the notion which every thing else in this book would humbly claim your indulgence reader my sketches must be rapid and their descriptions brief concurrently however with this which i know not whether any prophetic scholiasts have mentioned or not there may be deduced still further interpretation equally far i am concerned underived from the lucubrations of others this other interpretation involves typical view of the general characteristics of christendom seven true churches they are to be found standing at the coming of their lord the asiatic seven may be assimilated in their religious peculiarities with the national protestant churches of modern europe what order should be preserved in this assimilation unless indeed it be that of eldership it might be difﬁcult to decide but excluding those communities which has unchurched and leaving out of view such anomalies america presents having national religion we shall ﬁnd seven true churches now existing between which and the asiatics many curious parallels might be run the seven are those of england scotland holland prussia perhaps switzerland sweden and germany without professing to be quite conﬁdent to the list the idea remains the same it is but light hint on weighty subject demanding more investigation than my slender powers can at present compass it is merely thrown out

matter of portraits unless indeed some eminent fathers of the church or some authenticated enamels gems or coins if any displaying our lord likeness served the purpose and of course the character of the stories should not be much in dissonance with the sacredness of the text the ﬁrst might well enforce forgiveness of enemies especially if their hatred springs from misapprehension father forgive them they know not what they many true story of religious persecution of inquisitorial torture exacted by sincere bigotry and endured by equally sincere conviction would illustrate the prayer and the scene might be laid among waldensian saints and the friars of madrid the second tale might enlar ge upon promised paradise the assuranc of pardon and the efﬁcacy of repentance the certainty of hope and life being so that it might still be said of the seeming worst the brigand and the blasphemer shalt thou be with in paradise story to check presumption while it encourages the humility of pentitent hope the details of prodigal career and his return say falsely philosophizing german student or the excesses of some not ungenerous outburst of youthful wantonness haply fair and passionate neapolitan the third might well regard ﬁlial piety behold thy thy mother illustrated perhaps by slave scene in morocco or the last adieus between maccabæan mother and her noble child ren rushing on duteous death or the dangers of son during the reign of terror protecting his proscribed parents or allusive to the case of many razed and ﬁred homes in the irish rebellion the fourth necessarily tale of overwhelming calamity ultimately triumphant my god my god why hast thou forsaken conﬁdence of my god still even in his recognised judgments trusted in merciful the history of many an unrecorded job parent bereaved of his fair dear children an aged merchant beggared by the roguery of others and his very name blamelessly dishonoured the extremity of martyr sufferings or some hunted soul temptation

resigna tion even to the horrible death of drought among the torrid sands of africa or some noble act like that of sir philip sidney on the or david libation of that desire d draught from the well of

conscientious objections to hearing the bible set to music in and sure may we all be that unless the whole thing be regarded religious service in mixed gay company who think of sound more than sense not very easy the warbling of sacred phrases and variations on the summoning trumpet and imitated angelic praise and the unfelt expressions of musical repentance and unfearing despondency of guilt in recitative are any thing but congenial to mind properly attuned i hope i am neither prudish nor squeamish nor splenetic but speak only what many feel and few care to express now the cure in future all this would be very simple why not have some lay oratorios protestants have appropriated the madrigal and listen delighted with its melody without the needless offence of seeming to countenance

example set to all future ages by that early crichton if never yet accomplished my zeal is should the hint be ever acted on and if which is still possible an english version of the life of alfred should be positively rife and common among the reading public your humble ignoramus has nothing it but to pray pardon of its author not having known him and to walk softly with the world writing so much before he reads but this is an episode i plead statue to king alfred now another episode is there cure these desperate parentheses apropos of statues let in the simple untaught light of nature suggest word or two with regard to some recent under notwithstanding classical precedents whereof more presently it does seem ridiculous to common sense to set man like scavenger at calcutta or stork at athens or sonorous muezzin or simeon stylites on the top of column hundred feet high sculpture imitates life and who would not shudder at such an unguarded elevation sculpture imitates life and who can recognise countenance so much among the clouds again the precedents i presume that pompey pillar which indeed perhaps never had any thing on its summit except some egyptian emblem the cap and throne of higher and lower egypt or key of the nile likely any thing is the most notable if not the ﬁrst of solitary columns now pompey or some prefer diocletian and others alexander severus had that ﬁne pillar ferried over from the quarries of lycian xanthus at least this is good idea seeing that near that place still lie three or four other columns of like gigantic dimensions unﬁnished and believed to have been intended to support the triglyph of some new temple pompey idea was to ﬁx the pillar up either entering the harbour of alexandria or to denote shallows anchorage or the like but apart from this actual utility and apart also from its acknowledged ornament sentinel on that ﬂat strand i take it to be an architectural absurdity to erect regular column with little or nothing to support an obelisk now or naval trophy or tower decorated with shields or huge stele or cippus or globe or pyramid or sort of ediﬁce of course all these supporting nothing on their apices in fact any thing but corinthian or tuscan or other regular pillar seems to be permissable but base shaft and capital to have nothing to but lift telescopic man from earth maternal surface does look not little unreasonable and therefore much out of taste the marble arch at buckingham palace to spend its ener gies in supporting the magniﬁcent column of trajan is exempted from this hasty bit of criticism also

and right good feeling to our diurnal and hebdomadal amusers and instructors i can not but consider that gazette and newspaper reviewers are insufﬁcient and unsatisfactory judges of literature if not indeed sometimes erring guides to the public taste the main cause of this consisting in the essential rapidity of their composition there is the multiplicity of business to be got through there can not adequate time allowed any thing like justice to the claims of each author periodicals that appear at longer intervals are in all reason more or less excepted from this objection but by the daily

though i refuse not my gauntlet to any man my visor shall be raised by none but i enter the list others my kinsmen in composing authors to speak it generally are an race because judged hastily often superciliously evil or good it is impossible the poor public who besides having to earn daily bread have to wade through all the daily papers from mere lack of hours in the day to entertain any opinions of their own about book or books the money to buy them is one objection the time to read them another to say less of the capacity the patience and the will without question they are guided by their teachers and the grand fault of these is their everlasting hurry at another necessary failing of reviewers i would only delicately hint the royal we is very imposing example the king of

omniscient yet is their knowledge most various and brilliant having been from want of speciﬁc information incompetent to judge of the matters in question have striven to shroud their ignorance of the

might be difﬁcult and i can not show its workings in so slight an essay but surely it is strange thing in civilization and stranger when we consider what literature does us blessing our world or

perchance in his three full volumes he has admitted two false dates or haply mistakes the christened name of some spanish admiral once more how continually are not critical judgments falsiﬁed by the very extracts on which they rest how often the pet passage of one review is the stock butt of another here you will say is cure and malady together like viper fat and fang i trow not mainly because not one man in thousand takes the trouble to judge himself but it is needless to enumerate such instances every man conscience or his memory will supply examples wholesale therefore maltreated authors
