my settlement m y blockhouse was built at the foot of the mountain chain of the rio grande on the precipitous banks of the river leone on three sides it was surrounded by fourteen feet stockade of split trees standing perpendicularly at the two front corners of the palisade were small turrets of the same material whence the face of the wall could be held under ﬁre in the event of an attack from hostile indians on the south side of the river stretched out illimitable rolling prairies while the northern side was covered with the densest virgin forest many miles to the north and west i had civilized neighbours at all while to the south and east the nearest settlement was at least 250 miles distant my small garrison consisted of three men who whenever i was absent defended the fort and at other times looked after the small ﬁeld and garden well the cattle i had exclusively undertaken to provide my colony with meat i rarely stayed at home except when there was some pressing ﬁeld work to be done each dawn saw leave the fort with my faithful dog trusty and turn my horse either toward the boundless prairie or the mountains of the rio grande very often hunting kept away from home several days in which case i used to bivouac in the tall grass by the side of some prattling stream such oases though not frequent are found here and there on the prairies of the far west where the dark lofty magnolias offer the wearied traveller refreshment beneath their thick foliage and the stream at their base grants cooling draught one of these favourite spots of mine lay near the mountains about ten miles from my abode it was almost the only water far and wide and here formed two ponds whose depths i was never able to sound although i lowered large stones fastened to upwards of hundred yards of lasso the small space between the two ponds was overshadowed by the most splendid magnolias trees yuccas evergreen oaks and begirt by wall of cactuses aloes and other prickly plants i often selected this place hunting because it always offered large quantity of game of every description and i was certain at any time of ﬁnding near this water hundreds of wild turkeys which constitute great dainty in the bill of fare of the solitary hunter after very hot spring day i had sought the ponds it was too late to ride home the night was glorious the magnolias and cactuses diffused their vanilla perfume over myriads of ﬁreﬂies continually darted over the plain and gallant poured forth its dulcet melody into the silent night above my head the whole of nature seemed to be revelling in the beauty of this night and thousan ds of insects sported round my small camp ﬁre it was such night the elves select their gambols and long time i gazed intently at the dark blue expanse above but though the crystal springs incessantly bubbled up to the surface the lurleis would not visit they have not yet strayed to the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https dog and horse also played around long time until quite tired they lay down by the and all three of us slept till dawn when the gobbling of the turkeys aroused us the morning was lovely the night to the east the ﬂat prairie bordered the horizon like sea the dark sky still glistened with the splendour of all its jewels while the skirt of its garment was dipped in brilliant carmine the night ﬂed rapidly toward the mountains and morn pursued it clad in his festal robes the sun rose like mighty ball over the prairie and the heavy dew bowed the heads of the tender plants if they were offering their morning thanksgiving the refreshment which had been granted them i too was saturated with dew and was obliged to hang my deerskin suit to dry at the ﬁre fortunately the leather had been smok ed over wood ﬁre which prevents it growing hard in drying i freshened up the ﬁre boiled some coffee roasted the breast of turkey into which i had previously rubbed pepper and salt and ﬁnished breakfast with trusty while czar my famous white stallion was greedily browzing on the damp grass and turned his head away when i went up to him with the bridle i hung up the rest of the turkey well another i had shot on the previous evening and leg of deer meat in the shadow of magnolia i did not know whether i might not return to the spot that evening saddled and we were soon under weigh the mountains where i hoped to ﬁnd buf falo i was riding slowly along hollow in the prairie when rapidly approaching sound attracted my attention in few minutes very old buffalo covered with foam dashed past and almost at the same moment comanche indian pulled up his horse on the rising ground about ﬁfty yards from he had his bow ready to shoot the buffalo the savage made his declaration of war more quickly than i and his ﬁrst arrow passed through my game bag sling leather jacket and waistcoat to my right breast while two others whizzed past my ear to pluck out the arrow seize revolver and dig the spurs into my horse were but one operation and second later saw within twenty yards of the redskin who had turned his horse round and was seeking safety in ﬂight after chase of about two miles over awfully rough ground where the slightest mistake might have broken my neck the indian horse began to be winded while czar still held his head and tail erect i rapidly drew nearer in spite of the terrible blows the redskin dealt his horse and when about thirty paces behind the foe i turned slightly to the left in order if i could to avoid wounding his horse by my shot i raised my revolver and ﬁred but at the same instant the indian disappeared from sight with the exception of his left foot with which he held on to the saddle while the rest of his body was suspended on the side away from with the cessation of the blows however the speed of his horse relaxed and i was able to ride close up suddenly the indian regained his seat and urged on his horse with the whip i ﬁred and missed again i aimed too high in my anxiety to spare the mustang we went on thus at full gallop till we reached very broad ravine over which the indian could not leap he therefore dashed past my left hand trying at the same moment to draw an arrow from the quiver over his left shoulder i ﬁred the third time with the shot the comanche sank back on his horse croup hung on with his feet and went about hundred yards farther when he fell motionless in the tall grass he passed i had noticed that he was bleeding from the right chest and mouth and was probably already gone to the happy i galloped after the mustang which soon surrendered though with much trembling to the pale face i fastened its bridle to my saddle bow led both horses into neighbouring thicket and reloaded my revolver i remained about in my whence i could survey the landscape around but none of the indian comrades made their appearance and i therefore rode up to him to take his weapons he was dead the bullet had passed through his chest i took his bow quiver and buffalo hide and sought the arrows he had shot at i rode back i resolved to pass the night at the ponds not only to rest my animals but also to conceal myself from the indians who i felt sure were not far off i was not alarmed about myself but in the event of pursuit by superior numbers i should have trusty to protect and might easily lose the mustang again i reached the springs without any impediment turned my horses out to grass in the thicket and rested myself in the cool shade of the trees hanging over the ponds calm starry night set in and lighted on my ride home which i reached after midnight the mustang became one of my best horses it grew much stronger it was only four years old when i captured it and

gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https ii the comanches t he summer passed away in hunting building houses and other business and during this period i had frequently visited the ponds one evening i rode to them again in order to begin hunting from that point the next morning if i shot buffaloes not too far from my house i used to ride back and at evening drove out with cart drawn by mules to fetch the meat and salt it the probable event of siege i always had an ample supply of other articles my garrison and cattle and i had plenty of water i could resist an indian attack long time large herds of buffalo always appear in the neighbourhood so soon the vegetation on the rocky mountains begins to die out and the cold sets in they spread over the evergreen prairies in bands of from ﬁve to eight hundred head and i have often seen at one glance ten thousand of these relics of the primeval world week past these wanderers had been moving southwards but though their appearance may be so agreeable to the hunter in these parts it reminds him at the same time that his perils are greatly increased by their advent numerous tribes of horse indians always follow these herds to the better pasturage and traverse the prairie in every direction they depend on the buffalo exclusively food the warmer climate during the winter also suits them better they more easily ﬁnd forage their large troops of horses and mules at late hour i reached the ponds after supplying myself en route with some fat venison before i lit my ﬁre i also shot two turkeys on the neighbouring trees because at this season they are great dainty they feed on the ripe oily i sat till late over my small ﬁre cut every now and then slice from the meat roasting on spit and bade my dog be quiet who would not lie down but constantly sniffed about with his broad nose to the ground and growling sullenly czar on the contrary felt very jolly had abundant food in the prairie grass and snorted every now and then so lustily that the old turkeys round us were startled from their sleep it grew more and more quiet czar had lain down by my side and only the unpleasant jeering of the owl echoed through the night and interrupted the monotonous chorus of the hunting wolves which never ceases in these parts trusty my faithful watchman was still sitting up with raised nose when i sank back on my saddle and fell asleep the morning was breaking when i awoke saturated with dew but i sprang up shook myself made up the ﬁre put meat on the spit and coffee to boil and then leapt into the clear pond whose waters had so often refreshed after the bath i breakfasted and it was not till i proceeded to saddle my horse that i noticed trusty great anxiety to call my attention to something on following him i found great quantity of fresh indian sign and saw that large number of horses had been grazing round the pond on the previous day i examined my horse gear and weapons opened packet of cartridges my riﬂe and then rode in the direction of the leone i had scarce crossed the ﬁrst upland and reached the prairie when czar made an attempt to bolt and looked round with snort i at once noticed swarm of comanches about half mile behind and coming up at full speed there was not moment to lose in forming must either ﬂy or return to my natural fortress at the springs i decided on the latter course my enemies were already too near my dog to reach the thicket or the leone before them though the brave creature was remarkably powerful and he could not beat good horses in long the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https therefore turned czar round and ﬂew back to the ponds narrow path which i had cut on my ﬁrst visit through wall of prickly plants led to the shady spot between the two ponds which on the opposite side were joined by broad swamp so that i had only this narrow entrance to defend the thicket soon received us czar was fastened by the bridle to wild my long holster were thrust into the front of my the belt that held my revolvers was unbuckled and i was ready the attack of the savages trusty too had put up the stiff hair on his back and by his growling showed that he was equally ready to his part in the ﬁght the indians had come within few hundred yards and were now circling round with their frightful swinging their over their heads and trying by the strangest sounds and gestures either to startle my horse or terrify i not deny that although used to such scenes i felt an icy coldness down my back at the sight of these demons and involuntarily thought of the operation of scalping i remained quiet i could however and resolved not to expend bullet in vain the distance was gradually reduced and the savages came within about hundred and ﬁfty yards some even nearer the boldest came within hundred and twenty yards of while the others shot some dozen arrows at some of which wounded the sappy cactuses around the savages continually grew bolder and it was time to open the ball attacking is half the battle when engaged with indians i therefore aimed at the nearest powerful stout rather elderly savage mounted on very fast at once saw that the bullet struck him in his fall he pulled his horse round towards and dashed past within forty yards which enabled to see that the bullet had passed through his body and he did not need second about one hundred yards farther on he kissed the ground after the shot the band dashed off and their yell was augmented to roar more like that of wounded buffalo than human voices they assembled about half mile distant held short consultation and then returned like whirlwind towards with renewed yells the attack was now seriously meant although the sole peril i incurred was from arrows shot close to i led czar few paces in the rear behind yucca ordered trusty to lie down under the cactuses reloaded my gun and being bit of indian myself i disappeared among the huge aloes in front of pulling my stout beaver hat over my eyes i allowed the tornado to come within hundred and sixty paces when i raised my good riﬂe between the aloes pulled the trigger and saw through the smoke redskin bound in the air and fall among the horses hoofs dense dust concealed the band from sight but repetition of the yells reached my ear and i soon saw the savages going away from whereon i gave them the contents of the second barrel which had good effect in spite of the distance i recognised in the fresh yells raised and the dispersion of the band the indians ere long halted long way off but after awhile continued their retreat i understood these movements perfectly well they wanted to give time to leave my and then ride down on the plain hence i waited till the comanches were nearly two miles off and watched them through my glass they halted from time to time and looked round at i was certain that we now had sufﬁcient start to reach the forest on the leone without risk my riﬂe was reloaded and my pistols were placed in the holsters i stepped out of my and mounted my horse which bore at rapid pace towards my home the enemy scarce noticed my ﬂight ere they dashed down from the heights after like i did not hurry however fear of fatiguing trusty but selected the buffalo paths corresponding with my direction thousands of which intersect the prairies like net and at the end of the ﬁrst mile felt convinced that we should reach the forest all right which now rose more distinctly out of the sea of grass so it was we dashed into the ﬁrst bushes only pursued by ﬁve indians where i rode behind some dwarf chestnuts dismou nted and prepared to receive my enemies they remained out of range however and in short time retired again my readers will naturally ask why some thirty indians allowed single hunter to emer ge from his and why they did not compel him to surrender by short siege the comanches are horse indians who can only effect anything when mounted and hence never continue pursuit into thicket they never undertake any martial exploit by night and moreover the indian when he goes into action has very different ideas from white man while the latter always thinks he will be the last to fall every redskin believes that he will be the ﬁrst to be hit at the same time these tribes set far higher value on the life of one of their warriors than we white men and they often told that we grew out of the ground like mushrooms while it took them eighteen years to produce warrior the tribes are not large they consist of only one hundr ed and ﬁfty to three hundred men they have their chief and are quite independent of the other clans although belonging to the same nations the comanches instance reckon thirty thousand souls spread over the whole of the far west in consequence of the many sanguinary wars which the different tribes wage together it the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https of great consequence to clan whether it counts ten men more or less and hence the anxiety felt by the savages about the life of their warriors the northern indians have assumed many of the habits of the white men and are advancing gradually towards civilization they nearly all carry wear clothes till the ground and their squaws children and old men live in villages together our southern indians are all at the lowest stage of civilization are generally cannibals have home follow the buffalo on whose ﬂesh they live and have assumed none of our customs at times they may get hold of or bit which they have taken from hunter or stolen from border settlement but in other respects they are children of nature they go about almost naked and only carry weapons of their own manufacture their long lance is very dangerous weapon owing to the skill with which they use it and the same is the case with their bows from which they dischar ge arrows at distance of ﬁfty yards with such accuracy and force to pierce the largest buffalo the lasso plaited rope of leather is another weapon which they employ with extraordinary skill they throw the noose at one end over the head of an enemy then gallop off in the opposite direction and drag their captive to death there are but very few foot indians in the south they generally live in the mountains they are always at war with the horse savages and would be at disadvantage on the plains but they are by far the most dangerous denizens of these parts the most of them are supplied with and try to overpower their enemy treacherously at night the weicos form the chief tribe of these foot indians and are pursued both by the mounted redskins and the white borderers like the most dangerous of wild beasts on their account i have often spent the night without ﬁre and have been startled from my sleep by the whoot of the owl which they imitate admirably distant signal to one another in the conduct of the horse indians there is something open and chivalrous and i never hated them chasing we contended the possession of the land which they certainly held ﬁrst but which nature assuredly created better object than that few wild hordes should use it their hunting and war forages it always seemed to an honourable contest between civilization and savageness when i was attacked by these and i never felt that hatred which beset when i noticed the weicos and tonkaways creeping about like vipers i more than once all but fell victim to their cunning and it is always pleasan t memory that i frequently punished them severely the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https iii fight with the weicos s i mentioned my fort stood on the south side of the leone river and in front of it lay one of the richest and most fertile prairies which ran to the bank of mustang creek small stream running parallel to the leone beneath the shade of lofty trees magnolias cypresses and oaks to join the rio grande the prairie between the leone and this stream was about ﬁve miles broad and often when i had spent the day at home i rode off to pass the night there in order to shoot at daybreak much game my horse could comfortably carry and be back to breakfast i had found in coppice close to the stream small grassy clearing where czar was always comfortable around it stood colossal primæval oaks and magnolias in whose shade many varieties of evergreen bushes such myrtle laurel and rhododendron formed an impenetrable thicket they were intertwined with pendant llianas and vines the thickness of my body in this thicket i had built sort of hut of buffalo hides in which i hid away pan an old axe and at this spot i passed many hot summer night i found there cool quiet bed which the sun never reached myself and my faithful companions and ran risk of being betrayed by my and disturbed by the indians after one of these hot days i rode czar out of the fort and trusty released from the chain sprang joyfully at my horse head delighted at getting into the open country again and the prospect of fresh deer or buffalo kidneys we went slowly toward the bank of the creek which bordered the prairie ahead of us like purple strip through large gay ﬁelds of ﬂowers with which the prairie is adorned blue yellow red and white beds in the most varied hues succeeded each other and ﬁlled the air with the sweetest and most fragrant perfumes wherever the eye turned it fell on herds of deer that were sheltering themselves from the burning sun under isolated elms and mosquito trees and rose on our approach to be ready ﬂight further on grazed many herds of migratory buffaloes from which the prairies at this season are never quite free and here and there antelopes were ﬂying over the heaving sea of grass and ﬂowers i rode along my eye was certainly rejoiced by this abundance of game but i did not change my direction on that account because i was not any great distance from the thickets in advance of the forest on mustang creek where i could approach the game with much less trouble these wooded interv als which run about mile into the prairie consist of dwarf four feet in height partly separate partly in clumps which are closely interlaced with wild vines but always leave small openings between and here and there are overshadowed by elm you are obliged to wind between these clumps till you reach broad open grassy clearing which extends between these thickets and the high woods on mustang creek i had hardly reached these advance woods ere i saw very large stag standing in the shadow of an old driving away the ﬂies with its antlers and feeding on the ﬁne sweet mosquito grass which is much more tender in the shade than when it is exposed to the burning sunbeams the beautiful creature was hardly sixty paces from and i seized my riﬂe which was lying across the saddle in front of in moment czar who was well acquainted with this movement halted buried his small head in the grass and began seeking the green young shoots which are covered by the dry withered stalks i shot the deer and i saw that it could not go far i allowed trusty to catch it which always afforded him great delight i rode up threw the bridle before dismounting over the end of long pendant branch and then dragged the deer into the shade to break it up and cut off the meat i intended to take with i had knelt down by the deer and just thrust in my bowie knife when trusty who was sitting not far from began growling and on my inquiring what was the matter growled still more loudly the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https in the direction behind i knew the faithful creature so well that i only needed to look in his large eyes to read what he wished to tell they had turned red sure sign of his rising anger but i believed that wolves were at hand which were his most deadly enemies because he had fared badly from their claws now and then before i could get up to free him from his tormentors i ordered trusty to be quiet i heeded the dangers which had beset years much less than i had done at the beginning of my border and bent down again over the deer when trusty sprang with furious barks toward the quarter where he had been looking i quickly rose and on turning round saw two perfectly naked indians armed with guns leap out of the tall grass about sixty yards from and dash away like antelopes my ﬁrst step was to seize my riﬂe which was leaning against the tree but the savages took an enormous bound over one of the clumps of and disappeared from sight in few minutes i had unfastened czar and rushed after the indians through the many windings between the grown bushes they had gained great start and had increased it by leaping over clumps which i was compelled to ride round still i kept them pretty constantly in sight and reached the open prairie in front of the creek at the moment when the savages had crossed about half of it i gave czar slight touch of the spur and urged him on with the usual pat on his powerful hard neck he leaped through the grass if he hardly touched the ground and i was obliged to set my hat tightly on my head fear of losing it the pressure of the atmosphere was so great that i could hardly breathe the indians ran like deer but the distance between us was speedily lessened and i was only sixty yards behind them when they were still ﬁfty from the forest i stopped my horse leaped off aimed with my barrel at the savage furthest ahead and dropped him in the meanwhile the other indian reached the skirt of the wood and sprang into the shade of an old oak at the moment when the bead of my riﬂe covered him i ﬁred and saw him turn head over heels at this moment trusty came panting over the prairie who had remained behind i had leapt over some clumps which he was obliged to skirt he saw the ﬁrst indian leap out of the grass like hare which has been shot through the head and his legs seemed too slow his growing fury loud shout urged him on still more and in few seconds he and the savage disappeared in the tall grass frightfully shrill yell which echoed far and wide through the forest proved that the indian was feeling trusty teeth and the heaving grass over them showed that it was struggle life or death loading my riﬂe detained few minutes at the spot whence i had ﬁred then i ran up to czar who had strayed little distance and rode to the the contest was over the savage was dead and trusty handsome shaggy coat was spotted with blood he was standing with his fore paws on his enemy and tearing out his throa dog like trusty was invaluable to and my own preservation i dared not assuage the creature savageness besides the man was dead and it was matter of indifference whether the buzzards devoured his body or trusty tore it meal in the meanwhile i fastened the dead man short mexican escopeta and necklace to my saddle then i called trusty off mounted czar and rode back to my deer i did not dare venture into the forest where large number of these weicos were very probably lying in ambush the two had come down from the mountains to the banks of mustang creek whither the great quantity of game of all descriptions had attracted them on hearing my shot they crept up unnoticed had got within distance of and in few seconds would doubtless have settled had not my faithful watcher scented them or remarked their movements in the grass on coming within sight of my deer i saw that dozen buzzards had collected some on the trees others circling slowly in the air and watching with envious glances three wolves which had already begun greedily to share my deer although i hardly ever expended bullet on these tormentors i was annoyed at their impudence though they saw coming they did not interrupt their banquet i shot one of them very old red took the loins and legs of the deer hung them to my saddle and rode home to pass the night my dogs inside the fort announced to the garrison the arrival of stranger and they were little surprised to see return at so unusual an hour the gate was opened and after czar had been relieved of his rather heavy burden i led him once more into the grass to let him have good roll and after he had been put into the stable with feed of indian corn i described the events of the day at the supper my news aroused the apprehensions of my men they knew the vengeful spirit of these weicos and we therefore resolved to keep watch during the night we were still smoking and talking at midnight when the dogs of which i had fourteen began making tremendous row they all ran out through the small apertures left the purpose in the stockade and stood barking on the river bank at some foe on the other side at the spot where my maize ﬁeld in the forest joined the river it was pitch dark and calm night we listened attentively and could distinctly hear the trampling of dry brushwood in the ﬁeld the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https be occasioned by buffalo which had broken through the fence and were regaling on my maize but these animals rarely move at night and there was much greater probability of indians being there we gently opened the gate i took my large duck gun which held sixteen pistol bullets in each barrel and crawled down on my stomach to the river bank where i lay perfectly quiet when i arrived there one of my dogs was yelping and i distinctly heard the twang of i noticed the quarter very carefully the river was only forty yards across and the direction was shown still more plainly by the crackling of brushwood i shot one barrel there upon which human cries and hurried ﬂight were audible then i sent the second after it and fresh groans echoed through the quiet forest and mingled with the roar of my two shots i remained lying in the grass i might be easily seen against the starry sky from the other bank which was thirty feet lower the leaping and running through the maize retired farther and farther toward the wood and scarce reached my ear when suddenly wild war yell resounded in the forest which was answered by countless wolf howls on the prairie behind this was the last outbreak of fury on the part of the indians of whom i never saw anything more beyond the various bloody traces which they left in the ﬁeld we found several arrows sticking in the river bank whose form led to conclude that the assailants were cato indians the damage i received from this nocturnal visit only consisted in the trampled maize and harmless wound which one of my dogs had received from an arrow in the leg the morning was spent in following the trail of the savages to the prairie on the other side of the forest where number of horses had awaited these and borne them away in the afternoon i rode again to mustang creek with one of my the spot where the second indian had disappeared on the previous day the entrance into the wood and the roots of the old oak were covered with blood i sent trusty on ahead to see whether the road was clear and if we could penetrate into the gloom of the forest without danger we cautiously followed the dog who kept the trail and reached the river on whose bank the weico was sleeping the last sleep he was cold and stiff my bullet had passed through his brown sides the wounds were stopped with grass and his escopeta lay ready cocked close to him he was very young and handsome man and death had chosen him glorious under the dark arbour of leaves the rapid crystalline icy stream laved his small feet and on pillow of large ferns reposed his head round which his raven silky hair fell while the mossy bed beneath him was dyed by his blood till it resembled the purple velvet of we stood silently before this picture and even trusty seemed to feel that this was longer an object wild passion he lay down quietly in the grass death had reconciled us the dice had fallen in my favour and if they had been against i should not have found such an exquisite grave my bones would have been bleached years by the sun on the open prairie and greeted with shouts of joy by passing indians feelings which are rarely carried into these solitudes and still more rarely retained there gained the mastery over i could not leave this noble creation of nature to the wolves and buzzards we therefore fastened heavy stone round his feet and another round his neck and gently let him down into the clear water where he found his last solitary between two large rocks taking his few traps more reminiscence than booty we returned to our horses which we had left in the ﬁrst thicket they greeted us with their friendly neighing and impatient stamping while still long distance off and away we gallop ed over the open prairie up hill and down hill after ﬂying herd of buffalo at one moment leaping across broad watercourses at another over aged trees uprooted by storms until several of these primæval monsters had kissed the ground our melancholy thoughts had been dispersed by the light prairie breeze and merry and independent like the vultures in the blue sky overhead we returned heavily laden to our fort whose inhabitants down to the dogs gave us most hearty the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https iv hunting adventures it is scarce possible to form an idea of the abundance of game with which the country near was blessed in those days it really seemed to be augmented with every year of my residence which i may account by the fact that the several vagabond hordes of prefer the ﬂesh of deer antelopes and turkey to that of buffaloes whose enormous mass they can not devour at once while the smaller descriptions of game could be killed in the forests and coppices without revealing themselves to the enemy on the wide these indians i say more or less avoided my neighbourhood while my part i had greatly reduced the number of wild beasts especially of the larger sort i consumed great quantity of meat in my household owing to the number of dogs i kept but i really procured it if only amusing myself there were certainly days on which i shot nothing at times i did not get sight of buffalo week or the prairie grass was burnt down to the roots which rende red it extremely difﬁcult to stalk the game while just at this period when the ﬁrst green shoot s spring up the animals principally visit the open plains whence they can see their pursuers long distance all that though we had generally superabundance of meat and too often behaved with unpardonable extravagance i have frequently killed ﬁve or six buffaloes each weighing from thousand to ﬁfteen hundred pounds in one chase lasting perhaps and then merely carried off their tongues and often too i have shot one or two bears weighing from ﬁve to eight hundred pounds and only taken home their paws and few ribs because the distance was too great to burden my horse with large supply of meat i could always supply our stock in the vicinity of my fort although at times we were compelled to put up with turkeys or ﬁsh and turtle with which our river literally swarmed formed an important item in our more correctly speaking was of service in great many ways we employed it to fry our food which buffalo or deer fat was not so good we used it to burn in our lamps to rub all our leather with and keep it supple we drank it word it answered thous and demands in our small household this is the sole fatty substance an immoderate use of which does not turn the stomach or entail any serious consequences the transport of this article though was at times rather difﬁcult especially on warm day this fat easily becomes liquid and will even melt in the hunter hand while he is paunching bear this is chieﬂy the case with the stomach fat which is the ﬁnest and best that on the back and the rest of the body which at the fatting season is good six inches thick is harder and requires to be melted over slow ﬁre before it can be used in lamps these animals were very numerous in my neighbourhood in spring and summer they visited the woods

fruits kept them in our forests and in winter they sought rocky ravines and caves where they hybernated very many took up their quarters in old hollow trees so that at this season i had hardly any difﬁculty in ﬁnding bear in my neighbourhood trusty was hand at this he found track and kept to it long i pleased and at the same time possessed the great advantage that he never required leash never went farther than i ordered him and never followed game without my permission when bear rose before it rarely got ﬁfty paces away unless it was in thorny bushes where the dog could not escape its attack so soon the bear bolted trusty dug his teeth so furiously into its legs and slipped away with such agility that the bear soon gave up all attempts at the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https stood at bay it was laughable to see the trouble the bear was in when i came up how it danced round trusty and with the most ridiculous entrechats upbraided his impudence while trusty continually sprang away lay down before bruin and made the woods ring with his bass voice frequently however the honest dog incurred great peril during this sport and his life more than once depended on my opportune arrival in this way i followed one warm autumn day remarkably broad bear trail on the mountains of the rio grande trusty halting ﬁfty yards ahead of showed that it stopped at small torrent where the bear had watered on the previous night i dismounted examined the trail carefully and saw that it was made by very old fat bear it was in the fatting season when the bear frequently interrupts its sleep and pays nocturnal visit to the water at this season these animals are very clumsy and slow and can not run far they soon grow scant of breath they soon stop and can be easily killed by the supposing that he can trust to his dog and horse any mistake might expose the rider to great danger i ordered trusty to follow the trail it ran some distance up the ravine then went up the bare which was covered with loose boulders and large masses of rock into the valley on the opposite side in the middle of which was broad but very swampy pool girdled by thick thorny bushes trusty halted in front of this thicket looked round to and then again at the bushes while wagging his long tail i knew the meaning of this signal and that the bear was not far off i ordered the dog on and drew revolver from my belt feeling assured that the bear would soon leave the underwood and seek safety in ﬂight trusty disappeared in the bushes and his powerful bark soon resounded through the narrow valley it was an impossibility to ride through the thicket hence i galloped to the end of the coppice and saw there the bear going at rapid pace up the opposite steep hill with trusty close at its heels i tried to cross the swamp but czar retreated with snort if to show the danger of the enterprise by this time trusty had caught up to the bear at the top of the hill and furiously attacked it in the rear the bear darted round with extraordinary agility and was within an ace of seizing trusty but after making few springs at the dog it continued its hurried ﬂight and disappeared with trusty over the i had ridden farther up the water when i heard my dog baying i drove the spurs into my horse and with one immense leap we were both in the middle of the swamp up to the girths then with an indescribable effort czar gave three tremendous leaps which sent black mud ﬂying round us and reached the opposite ﬁrm ground with his fore feet while his hind quarters sunk in the quivering morass with one spring i was over his head when i sank in up to the knees and after several tremendous exertions the noble fellow sprang ashore trembling all over trusty barking if help continually reached i galloped up the steep i arrived on the summit at the moment when the bear sprang at trusty and buried him beneath its enormous weight my alarm the faithful best friend in these solitudes made urge czar on he bounded like cat over the remaining rocks and i saw trusty slip out from under the bear in some miraculous way and attack it again on the ﬂank i halted about ten paces from the scene of action held my riﬂe between the little red ﬁery eyes of the bright black monster and laid it lifeless on the bare rocks the greatest peril dogs is at the moment when the bear is shot they are apt to attack it it falls and get crushed in its last convulsive throes i leapt off czar who was greatly excited by the sharp ride went up to trusty who was venting his fury on bruin throat examined him and found that he had received three very serious wounds two on the back and one over the left shoulderblade which were bleeding profusely though in his fury he did not seem to notice them i took my case from the holster and sewed up his wounds during which operation he lay very patiently before and looked at with his large eyes if asking whether this were necessary then i took off my jacket and set to work on the bear stripped it and put the hide well hundred pounds weight of the ﬂesh on czar back if my readers will bear in mind that the sun was shining on my back furiously and that i was on bare blazing rock they will understand that i was worn out and longed cool the bear weighed at least 800 and it requires great effort to turn such an animal over i was good hour ride from the shade of the leone and only half that distance to the mountain springs i have already described i therefore selected the latter although they took rather farther from home i walked although i made czar carry my jacket weap ons and pouch and reached my destination in the afternoon with my two faithful companions at my heels czar had hearty meal after i had bathed him in the pond and poor trusty whose wounds had dried in the sun and pained him terribly felt comfortable in the cool grass and did not disturb the linen rag which i moistened every now and then nor did i forget myself i rested bathed and after awhile enjoyed the liver and tongue of the old vagabond until the evening breeze had cooled the air and i reached

ﬂasks in word the whole of the buf falo is turned to account in the settler housekeeping these animals are hunted in several ways with an enduring horse you ride up to them and shoot them with pistols or riﬂe horse accustomed to this chase always keeps short distance from the buffalo and requires guidance with the reins but this mode of hunting can only be employed on the plains in the mountainous regions the buffalo has great advantage in its sure footing over horse that has to carry rider in such regions and in wooded districts you stalk the animals which is not difﬁcult and if you keep yourself concealed you may kill several with ease they are not startled by the mere report of riﬂe on the prairies too where the grass is rather high you can creep up to them through it and if it be not sufﬁciently tall to hide you you make use of some large skin such wolf and covered with this crawl up within range this however is always dangerous plan if you are noticed by wounded buffalo you run great risk of being trampled to death by it on these crawling hunts i always had trusty short distance behind who moved through the grass quite cautiously myself and when it was necessary i set him on and had time to run to my horse while trusty attacked the buf falo and pinned it to the spot i always preferred riding after buffaloes this is one of the most exciting modes of hunting i am acquainted with it demands much skill from the rider and agility and training on the part of the horse horses that have been used to the sport any time are extremely fond of it and at the sight of the buffalo become so excited that there is difﬁculty in holding them in the revolver is the best weapon to use you have the great advantage with it of ﬁring several shots without reloading i always carried two in my belt which gave twelve shots and also two spare cylinders i also had my double riﬂe with which lay unfastened between and the saddle cloth the american revolvers are admirably made and carry their bullets very accurately hundred yards but at longer distances they can not be depended on it is difﬁcult to take aim with them it requires considerable practice to kill buffalo at gallop you may send dozen bullets into it and yet not prevent it from continuing its though very rapid progress the buffalo heart lies very deep in the chest behind the shoulder blades it can be easily missed through the eye being caught by the hump on the back and besides it requires very great practice to hit with pistol when going at full speed if you shoot the buffalo at the right spot it drops at once and frequently turns head over heels the animal is in the best condition in spring when it has changed its coat at this season its head is adorned with long dark brown locks and its are covered with shining black hair so long old tufts bleached by the sun are hanging about it it is not in prime condition and the experienced hunter never selects such quarry on spring need not add ﬁne

beauties which words are powerless to describe i reached the hilly ground near the mountain springs and ﬁrst learned from czar tugging at the bridle and his repeated bounds that i had come in sight of herd of about forty buffaloes that did not appear to notice yet probabl y they were engaged with that portion of the beauties of nature which most interested them at any rate they all had their huge shaggy heads buried in the fresh young grass i was never better inclined to have jolly chase than on this day and the same was the case with czar and trusty i let loose the reins drew revolver and dashed among the astounded herd looking plump bull surprised and disturbed these philosophers turned their heads towards the mountains raised their tails erect and started in their awkward gallop with the exception of one old fellow the very one i had selected the attack he looked after the fugitives awhile if reproaching them with their cowardice shook his wild shaggy mane several times and then

companions halted and seemed to be admiring the chivalric deed of their knight at length he stopped he had convinced himself that he could not catch up to and stamped with his front legs till the dust ﬂew up in cloud around him i turned my horse and raised my riﬂe to make more sure of hitting the bull his determined conduct had imbued with some degree of respect i ﬁred and wounded him in the side little too far back at the same instant he dashed ahead again but then thought better of it and tried to rejoin the ﬂying herd i now set trusty on him who soon brought him at bay and i gave him bullet from the revolver again he rushed at and again ﬂed in this way pursuing and pursued in turn i had given him ﬁve bullets when he left the herd in perfect state of mania and dashed after i made short turn with my horse the bull rushed past i turned czar again towards the buffalo and i passe d i put bullet through his heart at the distance of three yards the monster fell to the groun d in cloud of dust and raised up heap of loose sand which it stained with its dark blood an unexpected visitor to my surprise i noticed that trusty did not come up to the fallen buffalo but rushed past it loudly barking to the thicket at the springs whence i saw an immense panther leap through the prickly plants i galloped round the ponds and saw the royal brute making enormous leaps through the tall prairie

rather close to it it altered its course once more and climbed up an old evergreen live oak among whose leafy branches it disappeared i called trusty to heel stopped about ﬁfty yards from the oak to reload my barrel and then rode slowly round looking gap in the foliage through which to catch glimpse of this most dangerous animal the leaves were very close and i had ridden nearly round when i suddenly saw its eyes glaring at from one of the main branches in the midd le of the tree i must shoot it dead or else it would be very risky enterprise and czar breathing was too violent to ﬁre from his back with any certainty i cautiously dismounted keeping my eye on the panther held revolver in my left hand brought the bead of my riﬂe to bear right between the eyes of the king of these ﬁred

to see strange white face among us and though i visited the nearest town more frequently than at the outset it led to settled intercourse i rode there sever al times year taking to market on mules my stock of hides wax tallow and brought back provisions tools powder and lead on these occasions i received the letters which had arrived in the interval posted my own took my packets of books forwarded from new york and then my intercourse with the world was at an end six months the mules and horses certainly left traces during these rides in the clayey soil but they were soon destroyed by heavy rains or trampled by herds of passing buffaloes and thus hidden from the most acute eyes moreover on these journeys i never kept the same road i always guided myself by the compass and altered my course according to the seasons i had to pass spots which were inundated at certain periods and others where wate r at times was very scarce the ﬁrst of the country was wretched sandy region without grass on which stunted oaks grew here and there very mountainous and dry where one would dream of settling or under going the perils of pioneer the sake of the land nearer to one ventured to come many attempts had been made to settle on this fertile soil but had all turned out unhappily the last of them entailing the destruction of family of nineteen persons on my hunting expeditions i often saw their bones bleaching in the sun i said change had occurred in my position save that my mode of life was safer and more comfortable the country alone still remained solitude which isolated visitor could enter without staking his scalp hence i was greatly surprised one morning when the sentry came into my house and informed that white man was ridin g alone along the river mounted on mule which is the most unsuitable of animals in the indian country i ran with telescope to the turret at the east end of the fort and not only found the watchman statement conﬁrmed but also that the man had not even weapon unless it was hidden in two enormous packs which dangled on each side of his mule the rider drew nearer at one moment emer ging on the ridges and then disappearing again in the hollows at length our growing curiosity was satisﬁed and white man german saluted us with an innocently calm smile on my asking how he had come here alone and unarmed he said cheerfully w ell from the settlement

the flora about us which had not yet been collected this purpose he brought with him two enormous bundl es of which hung on his he called his gallant like woolbags in battery might have protec ted him against indian arrows if he had had any missiles to reply with but he only had pistol in his trowsers pocket which would not go off in spite of all the experiments we made with it everybody had warned him of the danger to which he exposed himself on his journey to and the last pioneer he passed jones had tried to keep him back by force but he had merely laughed and declared that an indian could not touch him on his lizzy there are men who wantonly rush into perils because danger has something attractive them and who seek them in order to have an opportunity of expending the energy they feel

their existence till they are surprised and destroyed by them such man was our new acquaintance kreger we all tried to make him understand how madly he had behaved and that it was only by miracle he had escaped the notice of the redskins which must have entailed his inevitable death during his long solitary journey to us and while sleeping at night by large ﬁre he merely smiled at it all and said that it could not be quite so bad while making repeated applications to his regarded his intentions of making his excursions from my house i told him it was impossible because when i went out hunting i did not waste my time over plants and he sportsman would be nuisance to on the other hand we could not think of letting him wander about alone the danger of which i conﬁrmed by telling him various adven tures of mine all this i received him hospitably gave him place to sleep in and seat at table showed him where to ﬁnd corn lizzy where he could wash his word made him comfortable lay in my power i had long intended to explore more distant countries than those i had visited during my sporting excursions especially the continuation of our plateaux to the north and had made my arrangements this tour when kreger surprised us by his advent on the day after his arrival we took walk round the fort and the garden during which he broke off the conversation every moment and plucked some rare plant to put in his herbal which he called his cannon and laughed at the revolver in my belt and the riﬂe i carried i told him that i intended to make journey in which if he liked to accomp any he would be able to make his researches my hunting on this trip would be restricted to my meat supply he was delighted and agreed to come with to which i consented on condition of his riding one of my horses and i recommended the mustang whose powers of endurance i knew and tried to prove by telling him how it came into my possession but it was of avail none of my cattle possessed the qualities of his lizzy and he offered bet that one could catch her the sake of the joke the mustang and the mule were soon saddled mosquito tree on the prairie about half mile from the fort was selected the goal and away we started through the tall grass it was really surprising how fast lizzy went cocking up her tail and long ears she accepted with pleasure the shower of blows that fell on her and reached the goal only twenty yards behind i laughed most heartily at the amusing appearance of our naturalist and expressed my admiration at his mule pace but remarked at the same time that consideration in the world would i ride her in the country i intended visiting because i was well acquainted with the obstinacy of mules and knew that when called on to show their speed they refuse to so and neither ﬁre nor sword could induce them all such remarks however produce d change in kreger invincible faith in his favourite and if he had assumed portion of lizzy obstinacy through his long friendly relations with her he irrevocably adhered to his resolution of only entrusting his carcass to her during the impending excursion our preparations which were very simple occupied us about week they consisted in removing czar shoes and rubbing his hoofs frequently with bear grease the indians follow the track of shoed horse wolves deer bleeding trail in grinding coffee and forcing it into bladders and in plaiting two new lassos which i fetched two new buffalo hides in which chase the botanist accompanied and felt pride in having given an indubitable proof of his lizzy powers she followed close at czar tail during the entire hunt kreger assisted in making the lassos the hide is fastened tight on the ground with wooden pegs very sharp knife is thrust into the centre and strip about the breadth of ﬁnger is cut until the whole hide is transferred into one very long line which though not so long the one with which dido measured the ground to build carthage on attained very great length this strip was then fastened between trees the hair shaved off with knife after which it was cut into ﬁve equal lengths and these were plaited into lasso about forty feet long which was once more fastened between trees with heavy weights attached to it and thus stretched to its fullest extent when such line has been dried in the open air it is rubbed with bear grease through which it always remains soft and supple and will resist tremendous pull the one made by kreger though not plaited so smoothly and regularly was useful and afforded him great pleasure perfection of his lizzy equipment one end of this lasso is fastened round the horse neck it is rolled up fastened by loop to the saddle undone when the animal is grazing and bound round tree or bush the day our start arrived and the morning was spent in

two enormous bushes of summer plant which we call spanish mulberry stuck behind her ears speciﬁc to keep the ﬂies off i had repeatedly told kreger of the absurdity of covering lizzy with this coat of mail in which she would melt away but he said that i too had skin over my saddle and he wanted his to protect him at night against rain and dew on the back of this monster our naturalist mounted dressed in long reddish homespun coat trowsers of the same material though rather more faded with mexican spurs on his heels with wheels the size of dollar and felt hat under which his long face with the large eyes and mouth peeped out over his right shoulder hung his huge botanizing case and over his left gun of mine loaded with slugs his hat kreger had also adorned with green bush and sitting erect in his wooden mexican stirrups he swung his whip and declared his readiness to start i rode czar and the only difference from my ordinary equipment was that i had bag full of provisions hung on the saddle behind this and little more powder and lead than usual was all the extra weight czar had to carry and too insigniﬁcant him to feel with truly heavy heart i bade to trusty and most earnestly commended him to the care of my men i could not take him with to an unknown country where i might feel certain of getting into situations where i must trust to the speed of my horse and trusty might easily get into trouble the ﬁrearms i left at the service of my garrison and consisting of nearly ﬁfty riﬂes and fowling pieces were carefully inspected we then rode of f and soon heard the gate of the fort bolted after us it was the afternoon when we rode down to the and waded through the stream the stranger this river is most beautiful and charming at its greatest depth it is so clear that were it not its motion and the leaves brushwood ﬂoating on it it would be doubtful to say whether it contained any water or not this is noticed more especially with horses which have to cross such stream the ﬁrst time generally they object and look down at the water whose depth they are unable to gauge you see the stones at the bottom clearly if there were water and can distinctly watch the slightest movements of the countless ﬁsh and turtle with which the streams in my neighbourhood swarm at the same time the banks are covered with the most luxurious vegetation and the gigantic vines cross it from the tops of the trees and are in their turn intertwined with other creepers so to form hanging wood over the darting waters most of these creepers adorn the woods with magniﬁcent show of ﬂowers and some trees are so overgrown with them that none of their own foliage is visible the stream in these rivers is so violent that it is very dangerous to ride through them especially at spots where the water is deep enough to reach the horse girths and the danger is heightened by the extremely slippery soap stones which cover the bottom i rode ﬁrst into the river and lizzy followed obediently after though it cost some persuasion to make my companion refrain from riding few yards lower down in order to pluck some specimens of the beautiful aquatic plants growing on the surface he fancied it was depth while he and his lizzy heavily laden they were would have sunk and never reached the bank again alive i remember while hunting swimming on horseback through places where the current was extremely violent and carried away my dog which reached the bank eventually bruised by the rocks and bleeding terribly we reached the opposite side without any difﬁculty and followed buffalo path into the forest which runs with breadth of several miles along the river after you have been riding ever so short time in the sun you feel the beneﬁt of the gloomy and impenetrable shade

still more so by the bushes waving over it i really felt sorry the poor wretch and bluntly told kreger that i would not ride step farther with him unless he left the buffalo hide here he was also convinced by his lizzy wretched appearance that she could not carry this weight long and we agreed that i should tan the hide of the ﬁrst deer i shot and let him use it lizzy was led into the grass

down again with my riﬂe on my arm the botanist on the contrary slept like top packed up in his buffalo hide with his head on an open bundle of blotting paper at the same time he snored nearly the whole night which did not help to improve my rest before daybreak czar got up shook himself and walked up to lizzy who still lay half dead in the grass if to wish her good morning i roused my companion we led the cattle to water and while i got breakfast i advised kreger to make some botanical researches which he did he came back with such an armful of plants that i told him i thought he had better not take more than one specimen of each otherwise by the end of our journey lizzy would be unable to carry the load he laid the plants in the bound his bundles and ere we started i rolled up the buffalo hide with the hair outwards and thrust it between two branches of tree where it would remain until our return the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian

in order to prevent skin prepared in this way from turning hard when exposed to the wet it is spread over hole in the ground in which rotten wood is kindled and it is smoked on both sides till it becomes quite yellow my botanist employed the halt in exposing the plants plucked in the morning to the sun while he collected fresh ones the greatest heat was past and it was about 3 when we set out again the country here became more broken the prairies were not so extensive and here and there were covered with clumps of trees and bushes the grass was not so tall on the ﬂat prairies which considerably accelerated the pace of our cattle lizzy especially seemed to feel the difference between yesterday and and trotted lightly and cheerfully by the side of czar who on such tours always ambled pace which is very pleasant the rider does not tire the horse and gets over the ground wonderfully quick this pace is natural to barbs i knew my czar sire who was one of six stallions presented by the emperor of morocco to taylor the president of the united states at nightfall we reached turkey creek i had christened it from the great number of those birds i found here it was still light enough to choose good spot our bivouac where we were near water we were tolerably hidden and had very good grass our cattle this evening however czar was hobbled that is to say short line round his neck was hooked to padded ring he always wore on his near forefoot so that he was obliged to keep his head to the ground or his foot in the air and hence could only walk this was an invention of my own suggested by the fear of losing my horse and when fastened in this way he could not be unexpectedly scared and driven off i prefer it to binding the two feet this often lames horse and to tying it up with lasso because the horse can easily entangle its feet in the latter and be seriously injured in this manner i could leap from my horse in the most dangerous neighbourhood and renders it in an instant incapable of bolting lizzy was again picketed and we kept watchful eye on the animals during the two hours they were grazing i had nearly reached the end of my terra cognita and the border of regions which had never yet been visited by ere we went to sleep the logs were covered with ashes the cattle fastened to trees close to us and we lay down to rest after supper but i could not sleep so soundly when i had trusty by my side the slightest sound disturbed and it was always long time ere i fell asleep again about midnight i started up and fancied i had been dreaming about storm i looked up and saw that all the stars had disappeared at the same moment the surrounding landscape was lit up by ﬂash of lightning and violent thunder rolled down the valley i sprang up blew the ﬁre into ﬂame the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https on it and woke the snoring naturalist who asked in great alarm about the cause of being disturbed i advised him to i did then broke off an armfull of bushes laid them in heap put my pistols and bags on it with the saddle over them covered them with the and laid the jaguar skin over all after which i helped kreger to put his traps in safety in which he greatly missed the buf falo hide while we were occupied with these preparations the thunder rolled almost uninterruptedly and the incessant ﬂashes kept the tall trees brilliantly illumined from the north we heard sound like distant waterfall and the turmoil soon rose to the mournful howling of the tempest which is only to be heard in these regions i was well acquainted with the appro aching spirit of the storm i had often met it hence i went up to czar put on his and threw the bridle over my shoulder giving kreger hint to the same with lizzy but he had quite lost his head and ran ﬁrst to his heap of traps and then to the mule when the storm burst over our heads in all its fury and made the primæval trees crack in their very roots it swept the earth and carried away with it an avalanche of dust leaves and branches our ﬁre stretched out long tongues of ﬂame over the ground and sent its sparks whirling through the black night into the gloomy wood the groans of the hurricane were blended with the deafening peals of thunder which at every second made the earth tremble under our feet and i had the greatest difﬁculty in making kreger understand that he should come to i had selected young white oak whose branches were interlaced with creepers to shelter myself and czar and had got out of the way of two lofty planes which were singing their death plaint the fury of the storm still increased blast followed blast crash followed crash the crowns of the two planes bent more and more and with shock resembling an earthquake they suddenly fell across our ﬁre which scattered in all directions like bursting shell and hurled logs and brands over our heads czar started back and in his terror would have broken lassos had i not been prepared this and followed him with the bridle while lizzy dragged my companion who would not loose the lasso long distance through the grass the ﬁrst drops of rain now fell and i knew that the greatest fury of the storm had passed i led czar back under the oak held my riﬂe with the hammer down under my armpit shouted to kreger to follow and stood erect under my hat i could the rain fell in torrents so that in few minutes we had not dry thread on us stream ﬂowed between our feet and the storm chilled us to the marrow we stood silent like herons and though it was so dark that we could not see each other we were contented at being still alive and having our horses with us it rained nearly till morning which was never more heartily greeted than by us two and ere long clear blue sky cheered us the greatest difﬁculty was to light the ﬁre again my traps had remained perfectly dry they were protected by the bushes underneath and the storm had been unable to touch them i had the means of making ﬁre but dry wood was not so easy to procure still i succeeded in getting some out of hollow old oak and the botanist helped to kindle the ﬂame it was scarce blazing ere we laid of dead wood from the fallen trees upon it and soon produced such heat that it dried us in very short time kreger traps had become rather wet but the damage could be easily repaired and we did not the less enjoy our breakfast on that account the sun came out with its warming cheering beams and lit up the ruin which the storm had created during the night while calm glad smile on the face of surrounding nature seemed to contradict the possibility of it being capable of any such wild passion we were ready to start at tolerably early hour but an obstacle offered itself which threatened to take us far out of our course the usually insigniﬁcant stream had swollen into such rapid torrent and spread so far over its banks that we could not hope to cross it i could not forgive myself the oversight of not crossing the stream over night which is an established rule with travellers and hunters in this country the waters often rise ﬁfteen to twenty feet in few hours and the hunter who incau tiously bivouacs on the bank runs the risk of being so begirt by the swelling tide to be unable to escape its fury not only men are exposed to this but also the quadruped denizens of these parts and i repeatedly saw drowned buffaloes and stags being carried away by such swollen rivers however rule the inundation only lasts few hours because the small streams have but short course and are only swollen by the mountain torrents i had intention to stop here and preferred riding up the stream in order to try and ﬁnd ford where we could cross without danger we rode good two hours along the bank the trees continually grew scantier and the road more difﬁcult through scattered boulders and rocks between these huge ferns sprang up and with the fallen trees frequently blocked the way the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https we had to make long circuit to fetch the river again at length we reached spot where the stream was more contracted and an old cypress lay across it which had been probably levelled by some storm i went across the trunk cut long bough and sounded the ground on the opposite bank it rose at steep pitch from the water and was ﬁrm so that i had doubt but that our animals could easily clamber up it i took the packages off czar carried them across then fastened the lasso to my horse bridle ring and crossed the stream with it shouting to him to follow the bank on his side was rather steep which fact he had discovered by feeling with his fore feet but he leaped with all four feet into the stream bounded up the other bank and set to work on the grass which had been freshened by the last night rain kreger followed my example but lizzy would not venture the leap i therefore went across suddenly seized her hind quarters and pushed her into the stream which she entered headforemost but soon reached the other side uninjured we loaded again and rode down the stream opposite the spot where we had spent the night it was by this time and though the heat was not oppressive our animals required rest we dined and mounted again at about two from this point the country was quite strange to and it was necessary to make sure of the direction in which we proceeded i compared the compass let into my with the one i had in my pocket and we rode at quick pace toward the all traces of the rain disappeared about four miles from our last bivouac and hence the hurricane had been limited to the course of turkey creek this is often found to be the case such storms at times are not more than mile in breadth but dash with equal fury thousands of miles over hill and valley so that nothing remains standing which does not bow to the ground before them the country again became ﬂat but very pleasant ourselves and our horses the prairies are frequently covered miles with post oaks that is to say oaks growing so close together that their foliage is interlaced and hardly allows the sun peep at the ground covered with ﬁne short grass large and small clumps of trees of this sort are scattered over these grassy plateaux and give the country an appearance if human hands had been active here years agone and these are the remaining and border lines of former grounds and gardens riding under this roof of foliage is extremely pleasant you are not checked by any obstacle or diverted from your course and the horses move lightly and quickly over the short grass it was at the same time ﬁne day the wind blew freshly and hence we resolved to ride late we were in the moon ﬁrst quarter which promised us light some time after sundown about six in the evening we crossed another small stream which probably also ﬂows into the rio grande where we could have spent the night very comfortably but we only ﬁlled our gourds let our steeds take hearty drink and rode on we could at all events pass the night now without water at about nine we reached with pleasant conve rsation the end of the through whose middle clear stream wound we greeted it gladly it is always disagreeable to camp without water near at hand our animals were soon unpacked small ﬁre was lit in the thickest bushes and at about eleven we lay down with czar and lizzy by our side hoping better night than the last we slept gloriously and awoke the next morning invigorated and in the best spirits the sun had just risen over the horizon when we mounted and rode over the plain after taking with the help of the compass the nearest direction to the forest rising in the blue distance above the wide prairie accord ing to my calculation it was about ten miles off the prairie was very ﬂat and only few mosquito trees grew on it here and there which sufﬁced to estimate distances that is difﬁcult job without such marks i told kreger it would be better us to push on now the road was good feeling of anxiety involuntarily oppressed on this broad plain where we could be so easily observed from the woods that formed semicircle round it i spoke to czar every now and then and we had nearly reached the middle of the prairie when my horse gave start and tried to break into gallop i attempted to pacify him but he soon began snorting and could not be held in i had examined the prairie on either side of us and when i looked behind to my horror i saw band of indians coming after us at full speed in front of cloud of dust my next glance was at the forest ahead of us to calculate how far it still was and then my eyes fell in terror on the mule at my side the band of indians consisted of at least hundred and hence must belong to powerful tribe possessing the best horses and weapons i turned deadly cold when i looked at kreger who yet had idea of our peril and was carelessly whistling i made the utmost efforts to remain quiet or at least to appear so in order not to terrify my companion the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https him to urge on his mule while i loosed the rein of my snorting steed and allowed it to make few forward bounds whether kreger noticed change in my countenance or voice i not know but he looked round and noticing the approaching savages with the ejaculation great heavens indians he drove his enormous spurs into his mule ﬂanks and pulled his bridle so tight that the excessively sharp bit lacerated the wretched lizzy mouth kreger had turned deadly pale he looked wildly around him and showered blows with his whip on lizzy at his ﬁrst movements i foresaw what would happen and tried to make him understand that if he let go the reins lizzy would be sure to follow czar and we should be able to reach the forest where the indians could not hurt us he did not did not see picture of horror he stared ﬁxedly before him and lizzy putting her head between her legs began kicking out behind the danger grew every minute the yell of the cannibal horde borne on the breeze was already echoing in our ears i rode up to kreger and tried to drag the reins out of his hand but it was of use prayers remonstrances reache d his ear it was almost impossible to hold czar in any longer at one moment he reared at another bounded onward the indians during this time had drawn so near that i could hear their several voices and distinguish the bright colours with whic h their faces were painted our life was in the greatest danger my horse was terribly excited and any slip on its part would infallibly entail my death once more i shouted to kreger to be reasonable and let go the reins but he did not hear minutes pressed i let czar go and ﬂew like the wind away from the hapless man who was left to his fate and my staying longer would be of avail i quieted my horse and looked back at my unfortunate companion the horde was now close behind him in second dense cloud of dust surrounded him and the savages while yell of triumph whose cause i could guess only too well reached my ears i pressed closer to czar patted his neck and away we ﬂew like light i looked round again dense mob of redskins was after and by their inhuman yells they gave to understand that i was to be their victim also the distance between us however had been increased i drew fresh breath and my passion soon dispelled my feelings of pity and its sister fear the forest rose rapidly before and my safety only depended on this question was there stream on this side the wood firmly resolved even in that event to force czar in i clung closer to him with my knees and gave him cheery chirrup like swan he ﬂew over the grass towards the woods whose single trees i already distinguished there was river on this side and i soon reached the dense foliage and led czar snorting and champing in while my pursuers now few in number stopped long way from on the prairie i took out my handkerchief and waved it at them to annoy them i would but too gladly have avenged my unhappy comrade but they turned round and i went along the buf falo path into the forest dragging czar after about an hour i walked through the gloomy shade cutting my way among the numerous creepers till i reached stream whose banks were quite forty feet above the water the forest on both sides of the path where it led down to the river was so overgrown with thorns that it was impossible to go up or down the river side especially with horse nor would it to stay here all night with czar there was nothing him to eat and in event of pursuit i could be easily tracked hence i soon made up my mind mounted czar hung my and over my shoulders took my riﬂe in my right hand and forced him to follow the path down to the stream it was so steep that walking was impossible but the faithful creature once on the steep half slipped half fell into the river the bank was very smooth and slippery the waves he fell in broke over the but the horse at once raised the whole of its back above the surface and snorting and pufﬁng passed the crystalline ﬂood in spite of the rapid current we reached the other side when the path again ran up the bluff but had it been few yards lower down the horse would never have been able to climb the steep the bank it was was very high and precipitous but my steed strength was equal to the emer gency and burying its delicate feet in the soft loose soil it sprang up the bank forcing to cling round its neck lest i should slip off behind i had noticed from the prairie that the forest grew lower down the stream and gradually ended which led to the conclusion that further on the banks would not be so steep though the river might be broade r hence i rode down the waterside the wood was not so close and impenetrable at the spot i had recently left about three miles in this direction and found spot where the bank was not so steep and i could easily lead czar to water while at the same time wild oats three feet in height grew close by hence i resolved to spend the night the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https led czar into the nearest thicket unsaddled and hobbled him and lit small ﬁre partly to dry my clothes partly to make cup of hot coffee i had turned chill and felt quite worn out i had chosen my bivouac so that i could see long distance along the road i had come and kept my weapons in readiness so that i might sell my life dearly possible were i pursued the scene of horror i had witnessed so lately the probably frightful death of the naturalist rose vividly before and though i had accustomed myself to society again very short time i now felt very lonely and reproached myself having ever consented to let kreger ride mule on this journey when i knew the great danger that he had fallen victim to this error there could be doubt still i resolved to make certain of his fate night set in the ﬁre had burnt low czar lay close to and i threw myself over his neck patting him his pluck and ﬁdelity he was very tired and frequently gave sigh nor did he stir the whole night through i remained awake till near morning and although i dozed now and then i was soon aroused by the hoot of an owl the yell of wolf or the mournful cry of panther and i then listened to the sound of every falling leaf and every leaping squirrel the night was cool too the ground under rather damp and the dew very heavy so that i really awaited daylight with longing czar however would not get up and i let him lie i knew that he needed rest and i might very possibly be obliged to trust to his powers during the day i had drunk cup of coffee and eaten slice of venison by the time my faithful comrade rose i led him down to the water and saw number of turkeys taking their morning draught at the river side but dared not ﬁre fear of betraying myself it was about ten k when i started down the stream again to ﬁnd convenient ford the forest grew thinner the shores ﬂatter and i soon found buffalo path which conveyed without difﬁculty across the river though it was very wide it was quite shallow within half an hour i was again on the same prairie where czar had saved yesterday and where the poor botanist had probably met his fate i cautiously examined the whole plain with my glass and could not see anything except few herds of buffalo and number of deer grazing carelessly among them i rode up the forest side to the path where i found my previous trail which was crossed by later hoofmarks and then proceeded cautiously in the direction of the spot where i had left my companion while still long way off i saw the fearful sight before the sun lit up his bloody corpse stretched out on the grass i rode up to him and found that he was lying on his back without his scalp and covered all over with lance and arrow wounds none of his clothing had been left him the only things i found were my destroyed pistols and gun from which i removed the locks even the aper had been taken though what purpose was mystery i would have gladly dragged the body to the wood and buried it but the distance was too great to so without help i therefore bade him silent farewell and turned my horse to the ford where i had crossed the river that the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https vii lonel y ride m y route led from here through very ﬁne country consisting of undulati ng plateaux covered with splendid mosquito grass and picturesquely broken up by post oaks here and there single conical mound whose top was covered with thicket rose some hundred feet from the plain it was still early in the evening when i neared one of these mounds and let my horse refresh itself in rippling stream at its base the stream came straight down from the thicket on the mound and the spot pleased so well that i resolved to pass the night there i rode up the hill to the wood whose tall trees chieﬂy consisted of holm oaks with thick under growth of rhododendra and azaleas creeping bignonia was remarkably beautiful it clambered to the tops of the trees and spread over them its scented blossoms like shower of ﬁre the shady green of this wood was relieved by ﬂowers of the most varied hues one of which i can still remember that is rightly called the traveller delight the ﬂowers of this plant hang in clusters two feet long rivalling the purest blue of the sky above them and greet the approaching traveller with perfume which the fabled east could not surpass the sources of the stream welled up in the centre of the copse and were girdled by beds of ﬂowers which regards colour and form could not have been better arranged by an artist here i encamped and hobbled czar who mercilessly plucked many beautiful ﬂower and champed it between his teeth with the tender grass i then took my riﬂe in order to see whether there was any dangerous animal in the wood which was about thousand yards in diameter i had crept through it and met nothing except few old does that had their fawns hidden here and when i stepped out on to the prairie i saw herd of large male antelopes grazing about thousand yards from this graceful animal though frequent in our parts is rarely killed by the sportsman it is the most shy of animals great curiosity alone brings it at times in the vicinity of the watching gun and hence i tried to attract the bucks grazing ahead of i chose spot covered with rather tall grass lay down on it with my cocked riﬂe by my side but drew my ramrod out and fastened my handkerchief to it i then whistled so loudly that the sound reached the antelopes all looked round towards at once and i raised one foot in the air and lowered it again minute after i saw that they had noticed it and were leaping about i then raised the and lowered it again upon which the herd got in motion led by one of the largest bucks they came near in large circle but i continued my telegraphic motions till the antelopes urged by their fatal curiosity came within shot and their leader fell bleeding among the ﬂowers giving the ﬂying herd sad parting glance with its large beauteous eyes i jumped up and ﬁred my second barrel after the fugitives clap i heard the bullet enter the mark and another buck fell on the grass after few more bounds hunting is the most cruel sport to which man can devote himself i repented of my second shot i could make use of the animal few pounds of the meat amply satisﬁed my wants the charm lay solely in the query can you hit or not if this doubt be removed it is all over with the passion and one would go out sporting the pleasure i must naturally see where the animals were hit that is the real enjoyment to know how near you have gone to the right spot and hence i walked up to the bucks to choose the best of the meat my consumption at the same time the one ﬁrst shot was the plumpest and carried pair of large beautiful horns which i regretted i could not take with the antelopes not shed their horns like stags they are formed more like goat horns and annually grow further out of the the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https are brown and bent back at the point like chamois horns the form of the antelope much resembles that of the deer but it is rather lighter on the legs and of brighter hue its weight does not exceed 120 lbs the eye of this graceful creature is certainly one of the loveliest that nature has given to any of her creatures and i have often turned away from the look of dying antelope because i could not endure the reproach that it expressed i cut off the best lumps of game and went back to the dark shade in which czar greeted with whinny of delight and rested on my refreshed by the delicio us perfumes of hyacinths jonquils daffodils and narcissuses that surrounded the night was warm and i required ﬁre after i had ﬁnished supper i slept splendidly with czar at my side and the sun was high when i awoke to ﬁnd my horse browzing on the grass within reach of his tether i washed czar clean which i never neglected when i had the chance and rode out of my arbour down the side of the hill whence i could survey the country before many miles glorious picture was spread out the sun was not very high yet so that the shadows over the landscape were rather long and the light mist gave the distance that tone which renders landscape with rich bold foreground so exquisite i remained some time at the spot examining the road to the hills whither i was going but which were still too far to reach them on this day up to these blue mountains the ground appeared to be much the same i had ridden over yesterday rich in arable land supplied with the most luxuriant pastures and abundance of wood and watered by magniﬁcent streams this earthly paradise awaited men to raise the unlimited treasures which it promised to bestow so bountifully it was saddening thought that these boundless plains were entirely uninha bited the nomadic hordes of savages can not be called such from where i stood to the north pole with the exception of few trading ports of the fur companies white man had yet erected his cabin westward the enormous regions were unpopulated almost to the paciﬁc and even eastward the distance to the ﬁrst settlement was so great that i felt very solitary and the ﬁrst time was overpowered by sort of yearning the social life which i had left in vexation still these feelin gs took deep root in my breast they were soon driven away by the joys of hunting which can only be found in their full extent far away from the civilized world two days i wandered through these gardens of nature without being checked by any material obstacle on the third day i reached the mountains and at evening found myself at the height where the limestone leaves off and the red granite begins to my surprise i saw splendid spring ﬂowing from narrow ﬁssure in the granite with sufﬁcient grass growing near it to give czar his supper and breakfast i stopped here the night and had glorious view from this stony height the misty blue outlines of the rocky mountains were only just visible between them and myself i looked down on the most fertile valleys which were begirt by lofty mountains the precipice behind was overgrown with splendid cactuses which were just opening their cups after sunset and diffusing their fragrance the moon had risen it illumined the large clustering ﬂowers of the yucca which grew in the rock ﬁssures and spread over the whole scene silvery light which though inferior to that of the day in brightness was far superior to it in pleasantness it was rather cool night so that from time to time i made up my ﬁre with the dry wood of old mimosas the only tree that ﬁnds nourishment on these stony heights many of these grew round my ﬁre which when it ﬂared up displayed the beautiful pink ﬂowers with which these trees are literally covered so that the delicate pendulous leaves can scarce be distinguished rarely did sound disturb the surrounding silence now and then the yelp of white wolf reached my ear through the cold damp fog from the valley below or the hoot of an owl was repeated by the echoes among the rocks day awoke from refreshing sleep the sun was gilding the summits of the mountains that emer ged from the sea of fog at my feet round which the large eagles were circling greatly invigorated i bade adieu to my pleasant and led czar over the rocks to the nearest valley which soon received us under its shady trees i traversed the valley about two hours in northern direction following the course of clear stream which ran through with thousand windings like mighty snake and was framed in on both sides by thick bushes and old over grown trees about i was following one of these windings i suddenly found myself few paces from camp of cato indians and general ugh reached my ear the men about thirty in number sprang up and we gazed at each other in surprise watching signal of peace or war my presence of mind did not desert and knowing that these savages when they the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https wives and children with them prefer peaceful understanding i waved good morning to them with pleasant smile and rode holding my riﬂe and watching every movement of the men to the next bend in the river while the savages looked after with open mouth if petriﬁed when i had got round curve and was protected by the bushes my ﬁrst idea was to give czar the spur and gallop away but this would only have been challenge to the indians to pursue hence i made him amble well he could manage it in the tall grass and hastened to get out of this unpleasant company it was highly probable that the savages would follow if only to get hold of my ﬁne horse hence i was obliged to calculate my next steps i had but the choice of two to throw out the savages by riding in the water and on stony ground where they could not follow my trail and then concealing myself at some easily defended else to ride quickly away from them so far that they could not follow on their wretched horses the former was difﬁcult and dubious the indian eye surpasses the nose of the best pointer and hence i chose the other trusting to my horse speed i cut off slice of the antelope leg which was hanging on my saddle abou t enough supper and left the rest behind not to give my horse any unnecessary weight then i set czar at sharp trot where the grass was dry and when i reached barren ground made him pace at which he could his mile in three minutes when put to it though he took eight minutes when not hurried and could go on hours without rest i followed the course of the water and at the end of some hours reached gorge where the river ran through perpendicular rocks and where my horse had scarce room to pass i could see the water nearly two miles ahead the current was wilder and swifter here and on looking down at its surface i noticed several spots where the water rippled and foamed it ran over rocks and stones on both sides of the pass the granite walls rose many hundred feet so that it was impossible to scale them and though farther to the right and left buffalo paths ran up them the indians must be well aware of this fact and were probably lying in ambush there they must have noticed from my course that i was quite stranger to the country there was only one choice and i quickly made up my mind i put my holsters over my shoulder placed in them those articles which must not be wetted and guided czar into the river in which he ﬂoated down with at tremendous pace past the rock walls i was not at all afraid about swimming him an hour the sole danger of the undertaking consisted in the large masses of rock over which the stream broke and against which we ran in less than ten minutes the river bed was here rather wider and hence fortunately the stream not so violent or else we should probably both have found watery grave czar raised himself by his forefeet on the rock which was not covered by more than foot of water but his sank he did so he found bottom and the waves dashed over my saddle the current had turned us against the rock when i pressed czar with my thighs and with frightful effort he worked his way along to the end of the rock where i felt that he had footing though it only consisted of few boulders i was compelled to cross this dam i could not go back and the uncertain ground threatened every moment to bury us between its rocks my horse ﬁrst slipping off the smooth stones and then leaping up again struggled in vain to ﬁnd footing in the rapid stream and i saw that any hesitation would be certain destruction i therefore dug both spurs into the ﬂanks of my brave steed he leaped desperately out of the foaming waves sprang on the rocks before us and scrambled over them into the river on the other side where he sank up to the nostrils and the waves met over my head my alarm lest czar had injured himself was alleviated by his speedy return to the surface and he blew the water from his nostrils we followed the stream to wall of rock where i noticed that the water was calm at the right hand end i steered this point and we swam unimpeded through this channel into the deep water till the valley opened again before us and my brave horse trod on the sand i led him into the grass examined him carefully and found that he was slightly grazed on the near foreleg and the knee but this caused apprehension i let him rest in the shade half an hour he was greatly excited gave him all the white sugar i had brought expressly him and which was now wet and then continued my journey along the river the grass which must have been burnt here late in winter and the fresh grown crop had not yet sprung up did not impede czar speed the valley constantly grew wider and trended to the west i left it at about 6 and followed stream which ran from the north going along it till nightfall i reached its source in the mountains and was at least forty miles from the indians when i unsaddled czar and hobbled him in the soft grass i felt quite secure here i was longer frightened about pursuit by the catos and it was not probable that accident would lead other indians here at so late an hour when they never march except some special reason my bivouac was in the only coppice far and wide in which the springs bubbled up at the foot of very tall cypress all around was glorious meadow and further north rose barren rocks on which only the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https yucca and varieties of brambles and cactus grew czar was tired and soon came to holding up his hobbled leg begging to set him at liberty and when i had thrown the lasso over his neck he stretched his delicate limbs on the grass i too fell back on my saddle and slept so soundly till morning that i did not once look after the ﬁre and on waking did not ﬁnd spark among the ashes it was soon lighted again and breakfast prepared before which i had bathe in the spring then i lit pipe washed czar all over and left the going toward the mountains in the north the road was so steep and fatiguing that i dismounted still i seemed to be on path at times trodden by buffaloes which was continued when i reached the top where wide tableland covered with rich vegetation was expanded before this plain only interr upted by few hillocks was about twenty miles in diameter it was covered with very high grass and small patches of mosquito trees elms dwarf oaks and yuccas the ground was quite black and very rich and this earth was in some places ﬁfteen feet deep i could see by the numerous channels cut by rain storms i did not see trace of spring water this country is entirely dependent on the rains which are frequent in these mountains well the peculiar nature of the soil which long resists evapora tion of the humidity on all sides i saw herds of grazing buffalo but though my mouth watered slice of hump and marrow bone i did not like to distress my horse or go too far away from him while stalking more antelopes were feeding here together than i had ever seen and the same was the case with deer i rode quietly on through the tall grass resolved only to shoot some animal i could ride up to and succeeded in doing so toward evening when i saw something dark moving in the grass which i recognised black wolf in second i was off czar back i should be very glad of such skin and was just about to ﬁre when i saw on the other side of ditch i had not observed in the tall grass very large bear running away owing to the high plants i could not ﬁre and forgetting my former resolution i leapt on czar back and ﬂew after the fat fellow his road led through number of low mosquito trees so that i was obliged to bend down over my horse neck to escape being caught in the branches i was close to the bear but it coursed so rapidly under the branches that i could not give it shot from my revolver at length we emer ged from the trees and i ﬂew few yards after the bear when suddenly czar made such leap to the right that i must have been thrown had it not been the heavy holsters that kept on i turned the horse round again and then noticed that the bear had disappeared in gap before and on drawing near i found cañon going down hundred feet sheer and about twenty feet wide at this part it was gully washed out by the rain which i had not observed owing to the tall grass i dismounted and walked to the spot where the bear had disappeared saw that the bushes had been uprooted about thirty feet lower down but could not discover trace of the bear what i had been told by old hunters now appea red to bear will in case of need put its head between its legs and roll like ball from some height without hurting itself which can be explained by the remarkable elasticity of its bones and the thickness of the fat over its body i owed it solely to the agility of my horse that i had not followed the bear down the precipice and i willingly resigned the delicate ribs which in imagination i had seen roasting at my camp ﬁre i continued my journey over the grassy plateau the sun poured its last vertical beams on the dry soil which was intersected by deep cracks foot in breadth this bursting of the ground during great heat is very common on plateaux where the earth is very rich and often endangers the rider the ﬁssures being covered by the long grass are difﬁcult to detect there was not breath of air my horse became very warm and looked in vain water in the deep dry ditches i also pined fresh draught the water in my pouch had become quite warm and czar could not swallow it when i poured some into his mouth my horse rug was so hot that i was hardly able to sit on it and the barrels of my riﬂe almost blistered my hand i stopped several times in the shade of an isolated tree to draw little breath but this did not advance my journey and i could not possibly spend the night here without water how far i still had to ride to the next stream i did not know but i was aware that i might travel days in these mountains without ﬁnding spring or stream the sun was on my left hand when i reached the end of this plateau but instead of perceiving the sign of water poplar tree i saw before almost impassable hills covered with loose stones that rose behind one another like sugar loaves i could only reckon on an hour daylight and it was highly probable that i should have to pass an unpleasant night so far i could see northward the hills were piled on each other without offering prospect of water hence i turned my horse westward on the chance of reaching the valley which ran along parallel with the plateau i was obliged to dismount in the hollows between the hills the torrents had torn deep ravines in which old trees washed down were piled up and became very dangerous to pass the rocks over which i wearily climbed the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https hot and burnt my feet and at the same time i suffered intolerable thirst i had shared the last water in my ﬂask with czar my mouth was very dry and my tongue clove to the palate in vain i looked from every height i reached the sign and wandered up hill and down till the sun sank behind the distant blue mountains and the ﬁrst shadows of night spread over the land i had passed over several hills in this manner when i saw valley before in the twilight which i greeted with renewed hopes but the darkness set in so rapidly that i was unable to continue my journey feeling quite knocked up i threw myself on the warm rocks holding czar by the rein to wait the rising moon the sky behind grew more and more red the anxiously awaited light rose slowly about the hills and looked down on the deadly silence that was spread over the whole landscape i had rested about an hour ere it grew light enough to continue my journey and i soon reached the plain where unfortunately the grass grew very high i was obliged to mount my horse again it was impossible to walk through the grass and though i was very sorry to it i urged the poor creature on while he continually strove by hanging his head and shaking his neck to make understand it was high time to go to rest i had continued my journey two hours without stopping when the grass grew shorter my horse every now and then stepped on stones and i saw tree or two again i had probably passed the lowest part of the valley and i had found water in it there was prospect of doing so at greater elevation i was awfully tired and sleepy and my horse was quite bad i therefore unsaddled under an elm fastened czar to the tree by his long lasso and in ten minutes i was dreaming of cool crystalline water but all that woke at daybreak exhausted and feverish and to my horror missed my horse i sprang up surveyed the wide plain and who can describe my delight when i saw czar white coat shining few hundred yards off over small mimosa bush behind which he was enjoying the fresh grass in hollow the knot of the lasso had come undone and thus czar had been able to look about more agreeable fodder i led him nearer my bivouac and was just going to light my ﬁre when i saw smoke rising in the west about three miles from i quickly pocketed my ﬂint and steel saddled and rode toward the highest part of the ridge which divided the valley in half when i had nearly reached the top i dismounted and crawled to the highest point whence i surveyed the valley and observed an indian camp round which some three hundred horses and mules were grazing i saw through the grass that the various families were sitting at the ﬁres in front of their leathern tents with the exception of few children that were playing about the camp was on the other side of stream which wound through the valley from the north though i longed so water i must avoid the neighbourhood of these savages who might prove very danger ous to in such an unknown and desolate country i rode back through the valley in which i had spent the night and into the mountains on its eastern side if i had followed the valley to reach the river i must have been noticed by the indians on my white horse the road was tiring i was frequently obliged to walk and the heat on these barren hills soon rendered my thirst intolerable it was midday when i with ﬁrm resolution to ride to the water cost what it might guided my horse down ravine and suddenly saw before the fresh verdure of plants which only grow at very damp spots under heap of dry trees among which number of turkeys were running i forgot the indians and the risk shot two old gobblers and threw myself between the tall ferns over the cold springs that welled up among them in order to quench my fearful thirst i lay nearly ate bit of biscuit and i could not fully quench my thirst continually applied to the spring this was one of the most glorious meals i ever enjoyed and i believe that i would sooner have defended myself against whole tribe of indians than leave this spot unsatisﬁed the shade here was not sufﬁcient however and hence i went little lower down the stream with czar and my two turkeys where i found cooler under group of elms and oaks after this hunger began to be felt with the exception of small slice of antelope and little biscuit i had eaten nothing since the preceding morning i set to work on one of the turkeys and spitted such quantity of the meat fat and lean that i was obliged to laugh at myself the exterior of the meat hardly began to get roasted ere i cut it away in the meanwhile the coffee was getting ready and i concluded my repast after which i found great difﬁculty in keeping my eyes open i fetched czar who had also enjoy ed himself and fastened him to tree took my riﬂe in my arms and in few minutes was fast asleep forgetting all the dangers that surrounded the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https viii the journey continued t about ﬁve i was awakened by the sun whose oblique beams were able to reach through the trees i felt refreshed and strong made czar get up saddled and followed the stream which led to the river i had seen in the morning i approached the valley cautiously when i rode out of the mountain gorge and carefully surveyed it with my glass without ﬁnding trace of the indians anywhere it was very important to know whether they had gone up or down the river the latter was the more probable because most of the buffalo herds i had seen lately were going southward and the savages rule follow these animals the banks of the river were not high i rode into it watered my horse and without any difﬁc ulty reached the other side when i was soon on the path of the indians who had gone south i expected i rode up this trail northwards in order if possible to reach before sunset some stream coming from the mountains i would not pass the night where i was it appeared to be pass greatly used by indians so that i ran greater danger here of meeting fresh hordes than i did among the hills i rode very quickly and at sunset turned into narrow valley bordered on either side by very lofty precipices about two miles i followed the torrent which wound through loose blocks of granite and frequently could scarce get through the tall ferns and reedy plants which grew between the wildly scattered boulders the gorge gradually became narrower and the granite walls steeper and in the twilight i saw the end of it great distance from i had dismounted and was going with czar round block of granite when large stag dashed past from the end of the gorge hardly ﬁfty yards off and i distinctly saw another darker animal bounding after it through the tall grass in an instant the ﬂying stag with its broad antlers thrown back was twenty yards from and bounded over rock close by while at the same moment panther of enormous size covered the track of the deer with its gigantic paws it had scarce touched the ground however ere the bullet from my riﬂe crashed through its shoulder and the crack echoing through the gorge thundered in its ears the panther ran its head into the grass while its hind quarters ﬂew up in the air but at the next instant it rose furiously in the grass showing its dazzlingly white teeth and stretching out its claws to leap on i held my riﬂe ﬁrmly to my shoulder and the animal rose ﬁred at the white stripe under the throat the bullet passed through its breast and rising on its hind legs it turned somersault and died with furious kick it was very old and had probably inhabited this tempting spot many years to surprise the game that came here to drink at the spring and enjoy the fresh green pasturage eight feet long from the snout to the tail the prince of the valley lay stretched out before and round it the bones of its victims were bleaching in the grass i found above dozen skulls of deer and antelopes all of which had hole an inch wide in the top in addition to them the skeletons of two buffaloes and an elk and countless bones of other animals glistened in the grass i went up to czar who probably recognising his foe had run some hundred yards down the valley and was looking after with his head up i led him up to the slain panther but it needed much persuasion ere he would draw quite close to this arch foe of his race after making czar stand by the panther awhile which i dragged about to remove his natural fear of the creature i led him to the end of the ravine where the ground was covered with young tender grass unsadd led him and laid my traps under the evergreen oaks in order to prepare my the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https face to face the darkness had greatly increased i ran back to the panther fastened the lasso round its neck and dragged it to my intending to skin it in the morning i lit the ﬁre prepared supper and lay down on my every now and then turning the spit or piling up the sticks round the coffee pot the ﬁre ﬂared brightly and produced peculiarly beautiful illumination on the thick foliage of the oaks and the projecting shadow of the high reddish rocks whose ﬁssures and crevices appeared all the blacker in consequence the russet moon was still low on the very dark sky it peered into the ravine from the east and did not spread sufﬁcient light to overpower my ﬁre while i was observing this pretty scene i noticed light spot under the rock which was lit up by the ﬁre i took it at ﬁrst buffalo skull but drew brand from the ﬁre and crept under the oaks to make certain what it was i held the brand over it and saw human skull grinning at out of the damp dark background and carried it to the ﬁre from its shape it was the skull of weico with low forehead and strong thick high back part judging from the ﬁne slightly worn teeth it must have belonged to quite young man who probably fancied he had found safe here and carelessly yielding to sleep had fallen victim to the panther the marks of teeth were quite distinct upon it i kept up the ﬁre during the whole night which did not disturb my rest i had grown into the habit of waking up every hour to see all was right and going to sleep again if it can be managed was the case here the hunter chooses large fallen tree and makes his ﬁre close against it with small wood so that the the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https catch this smoulders during the whole of the night and the ﬁre can easily be made to blaze at any time by throwing on brushw ood the night passed without the slightest disturbance and at dawn i skinned my panther which had great number of scars principally arrow and lance wounds it seemed after cleaning the skin from all ﬂeshy particles i spread it out to dry at the ﬁre while i bathed and swallowed my breakfast i sought all round the bivouac weapons or other articles belonging to the dead man but found none and the sun was already high i set out on my wanderings again just i reached the entrance of the gorge i saw herd of seven buffalo bulls grazing in second i leaped off czar and ran from stone to stone till i got within ten yards of the shaggy monsters from which i was only separated by large rock i crept under this on the ground till i had the buffaloes before the neare st one stood motionless with its broad hairy forehead turned toward and i aimed at the centre of it although i had often tried in vain to kill buffalo by shot through the head this time however the bullet did its work and the other bulls ﬂed round the rock toward the valley the fat buffalo would supply with food several days i fetched my horse took the axe hanging from the saddle and set to work cutting out the sirloin while czar grazed by my side and now and then licked up the blood it is very difﬁcult novice to cut up buffalo the hide is remarkably hard and elastic and sits very close to the ﬂesh while any attempt to turn the carcase about is hopeless we may fairly say that novice in these countries if what the practitioners call greenhorn would starve with dead buffalo if he had not some one to show him how to cut pieces off it i thrust my sharp bowie knife between the ribs close behind the shoulder blade ran it up along the spine and down again to the chest then in the same way separated the two last ribs from the spine and made cut under the belly to the end of the ﬁrst cut i then hacked the ribs with the axe lifted the entire side up which broke the hacked ribs and thus opened the interior of the animal like lifting trap door the entrails were removed without much difﬁculty and the two enormous loins under the spine cut out i removed piece of the hide from the hump in order to secure part of the streaky meat cut out the tongue between the jaws i could not think of opening the mouth took two marrow bones and left the remaining 1400 lbs of meat the wolves and buzzards all these dainties were hung about my saddle the hotter the sun shines on them the less does the meat putrefy with parting glance at the ravine i again struck the indian trail which i followed northwards up the river at 2 i crossed the river it trended to the west and followed beautiful valley some hours to the where i did not notice single trace of horses or indians while the path i had hitherto been following seemed to be exclusively made by nomad ic savages the valley i now traversed rose gradually with the stream and seemed to form plateau in the distance it was covered with splendid mosquito grass which is only the case with the richest soil this grass never grows very high but is very ﬁne and hangs in tresses like hair horses are excessively fond of it and grow fat on it in very short time so far i could see the valley was covered with game of every description among which i noticed several moose deer the ﬁrst i had seen on this tour these animals are only found separately so far south while they form herds farther north especially in the southern rocky mountains it is deer of enormous size reaching the weight of seven or eight hundred pounds the antlers spread very wide and often weigh much forty pounds the ﬂesh is not very toothsome being hard and ﬁbrous and is not eaten by the hunter when he can get any better the animal is not difﬁcult to kill it is not very fast and can be caught up by good horse the indians throw lasso over it and then kill it with lances the time i was amply supplied with meat and hence felt great longing these animals but let them graze at peace like the other game here they were very familiar and allowed to ride within shot which was further proof that this valley was rarely visited by indians the country was well covered with stately elms poplars mosquito trees and mimosas i call the last tree thus to distinguish it from the mosquito tree which is also mimosa of course such specimens grew on the leone were not to be found here this valley will certainly in time be visited by settlers though poor in wood better ground can be desired by cattle breeders at about six in the morning i reached spot where two streams joined and i could not make sure of water further up the valley hence i followed the eastern arm and reached at sunset the hills bordering the valley between which i bivouacked i had everything i required several days i continued to follow northern course the character of the soil varied before the mountains had the same shape were bare at top and covered with loose stones between which few low cactuses aloes and torch weeds grew i also rode over good deal the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https but got away from it soon i could through the entire want of water the ground here grows very hot and you are thoroughly roasted i found the grass on the prairie not very high which made it easier going my horse but more difﬁcult to approach the game which appeared remarkably shy and restless my stock of meat was exhausted and i ate my biscuit and salt tongue rarely possible so to have food by in case of need i dared not ride down the buffalo my white horse could be easily distinguished from the uplands and i must spare his strength nor did i care to go far from czar afoot single foot indian might easily be hidden in the grass and reach him more quickly than i could hence i deferred my chase till i reached the woods that rose ahead of i rode over the rolling prairie till on emer ging from hollow i saw three very plump old deer grazing not far from behind few low mosquito bushes i sprang off czar hobbled him and crawled on my stomach through the grass towards the deer dragging my riﬂe after although i had got within shot i wished to advance few more yards in order to reach hollow where i should be able to kneel and ﬁre on reaching it i pulled my riﬂe after and was just about to ﬁre when monstrous rattlesnake glided away from under my hand i sprang up in terror watched it darting through the grass with head erect and away ﬂed my deer over the prairie and i had had all my trouble nothing though rattlesnakes are so numerous in these regions the sudden announcement of their vicinity through the movement of the rattles is most unpleasant surprise which never failed to produce painful impression on my nerves the whole of america is troubled with these and other snakes but accidents through their poisonous bite are rare in spring and autumn when the heat is not great the bite of rattlesnake rarely kills and only in cases when large artery is injured if that be not the case it only produces soft swelli ng which soon disappears again only leaving want of sensitiveness few days in summer however when the heat attains its acmé such bite is more dangerous and curatives can not be employed too quickly cutting out to the seat of the wound without moment loss of time is the most certain remedy salammoniac which has so often been recommended is not of the slightest use but sometimes cure is effected by rubbing the wound with oil or lard or by poultice of the leaves of the large burr which is so often entangled in the hair of domestic animals the most infallible speciﬁc however is bulb known to all the borderers by the name of seneca root it has leaf foot long with few brown spots it is chewed into pulp which is laid on the wound and small portion of the juice is swallowed ere long the pain is reduced the fever disappears and the swelling ceases this bulb may be carried about years without losing its virtue moreover all these snakes shun man and it is only when they are startled by his sudden approach that they dart at the limb nearest to them the rattlesnake rarely exceeds eight to ten feet in length but the royal variety is somewhat larger much more poisonous and marked with the most brilliant colours other poisonous snakes found in our parts are the brown and black moccassin which lives both on land and in the water and the copperhead small but very venomous snake when i settled on the leone these snakes were so numerous that after sunset i did not dare let my horse walk along buffalo path because they used to come out and cool themselves there but my swine increased in number they gradually disappeared the former are exceedingly fond of eating them and are not hurt by their bite i was very much annoyed sent some strong language after the snake and returned to my horse who had been taking advantage of his rest in the long grass i took off his hobble and rode toward the forest which seemed inviting to enter its friendly shade it was midday when i reached the wood thirsting fresh drink i hung my hat on the saddle and greedily inhaled the cool breeze that blew through the majestic trees and then followed on foot buffalo path which wound between the bushes it led to clear stream which poured over loose masses of stone between rather high banks i let czar glide down the path was very steep watered him and made him leap up the other bank then i ﬁlled my gourd and quenched my thirst with the cold water i was just going to remount when i heard the sound of herd of peccaries or mexican swine coming toward probably in search of water the under growth was not very dense on the side of the stream i was able to see them coming some distance there were about twenty old pigs with lot of sucklings they ran very slowly and i had time to pick out fat boar i shot it sprang on my horse at once and i expected found the whole herd dash furiously after i had room before and dashed through them into the forest they did not follow and i granted them time to bid adieu to their fallen comrade while i led czar into the wild oats which grew luxuriantly here in quarter of an hour i rode back to my game the herd the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https and i at once cut away the musk gland which the boar had on its back of the size of an egg if i had allowed it to grow cold it would have been impossible to eat the meat owing to the powerful musky taste the boar weighed about ﬁfty pounds i cut off the best joints and took one of the tusks souvenir on account of its remarkable length the peccari is very frequently met in the western mountains of america and often in herds of hundred head it has handsome silver skin an enormous head its size with tremendous tusks and is remarkable its extraordinary courage if disturbed it will attack man soon horse or tiger and is very dangerous through its agility strength and tusks ﬁve inches long i have known hunter to be attacked by herd and forced to take shelter up tree where he remained the whole night till the herd retired i rode about two miles along the skirt of the next forest i came to without ﬁnding buffalo path and yet the forest was so densely overgrown with thorns and brambles that i could not enter it without path at length i found one which had been probably trodden centuries by millions of buffaloes i followed it into the wood and soon reached small river whose steep banks were about eight feet high here i refreshed my horse and myself and followed the path on the opposite side where the forest grew clearer and i soon caught glimpse of the prairie the bushes and few isolated trees ran some distance out into the prairie i dismounted and led my horse to the last bushes in order to survey the plain ere i entrusted myself to it and because i was undecided whether i would not bivouac here i had advanced to the furthermost bushes which were brightly illumined by the western sun and i found the prairie was populated by few deer and buffaloes whose evident watchfulness and restlessness i could not ascribe to my appearance i looked down the wood to the rocks and to my terror saw close under them on the prairie of about hundred and ﬁfty indians who were riding towards the forest one behind the other i sprang in front of my horse in order to cover its bright chest and hurriedly raised my telescope they were lepans i knew them by their plumed lances shields and ﬁne horses these indians are the best mounted and most warlike on the western steppes i stood if petriﬁed fear lest they might see movement on my part while i held czar by the rein they had not yet seen they rode past and drew close to the wood few yards farther and they would have been out of sight and the danger momentarily passed suddenly however the whole party halted and pointed toward i had been seen there could be doubt of the fact i noticed through my glass that they were holding their hands over their eyes to have better look at there was not mile between us my horse had been travelling all day the wood was very narrow and the path leading through it very broad i was aware of the courage of these lepans and saw salvation save in the endurance of my horse with one leap i was on his back threw away the ﬂesh and darted into the wood with the whole band of savages after like whirlwind the river made number of bends which i was compel led to follow the indians horses were extremely swift this was the ﬁrst time i had ever known any horses keep up with mine but i had not yet called on czar i now drove the spurs into him and let go the reins i ﬂew round the next corner and then round the next ere the indians reached the ﬁrst which was good mile behind at this moment i saw that the river bank was covered the next half mile with loose pebbles i turned czar round and leapt him down the bank into the river whose bottom composed of soft sand and shallow water he reached without injury i then galloped up the stream in the direction i had just come covered by the tall bank and the wood between it and the prairie calculating that the indians would not miss my track among the loose stones but would gallop through them to the next angle of the wood which would give grand start i remained at gallop about hundred yards so that the water met over my head until i reached deeper spot where czar was obliged to swim short distance at this moment i heard the savage horde dash past and the war yell of these unchained demons echoing through the forest probably the short extent of deep water saved at this spot only few thin bushes grew on the bank and though the savages were some distance off they would infallib ly have noticed the water being dashed up by czar i again reached ﬁrm bottom and followe d the stream quickly i could while the yells of the indians were audible long way behind i was beginning to feel more secure when my progress was impeded by large masses of rock between which the shallow water rippled i leapt on one of these blocks and gave czar gentle pull to follow he sprang up clambered across and reached without injury good sandy bottom on the other side i hurried down the swimming partly till i saw the lofty rocks on my right through the forest and hence knew that i was below the spot where the lepans had halted when they ﬁrst sighted i still followed the stream although the water came up to my horse girths but it suddenly made curve and ran close past the rocks at spot where they opened like narrow gateway leaving passage the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https that ﬂowed from the interior the entrance through the granite walls was not more than thirty feet wide and the gorge about hundred feet deep beyond which was beautiful little valley enclosed by the rocks about mile in length through which the stream rippled i rode up the rivulet on both sides of which the most exquisite ﬂowers grew among them i specially noticed sort of tiger lily not only through the brilliancy of its hues but the masses that covered the banks so that the ravine seemed to be strewn with live coals sitting down on rock at the entrance i listened but did not hear sound of my pursuers the rippling of the stream alone interrupted the silence and only at intervals did the shrill cry of the eagle rise above it that the lepans had overridden my trail was certain but it was equally certain that they would ride back when they noticed their error and ﬁnd my track my horse in leaping into the stream had left distinct marks on the bank and its track might also be followed in the sandy bed moreover the banks were splashed with water and that was sufﬁcient to show an indian the road i had followed hence it was certain that the savages could follow but doubtful whether they would it they might be sure that i should get under cover when my ﬁrearms would be very dangerous and they would be unable to surprise hence it was far more that they attached so much value to white man scalp or the possession of ﬁne horse to interrupt the some they would guard the prairies on both sides of the forest it was almost impossible horseman to ride through the latter while i was thus weighing my situation i inspected my ﬁrearms which had got slightly wet put on fresh caps and was taking look at my water powder when yell echoed through the wood from the east i knew its meaning perfectly well the lepans had found my trail and were assembling consultation at this sound all prospect of an amicable arrangement departed and i was determined in the event of an attack on defending myself here in case of need i could always escape down the stream all became silent again evening spread her veil over the earth the silver herons and ﬂamingoes uttered their hoarse cry they ﬂew homewards and the owl announced the setting in of night the outlines of the trees and rocks continually grew more indistinct and it was time to fetch up czar who was nibbling the tender grass along the stream i secur ed him with the lasso to very large stone behind the rock on which i was sitting and threw before him an armful of grass and weeds which i picked in the event of an attack from the river he was tolerably protected behind this rock and he was close at hand if i wanted to mount in hurry though i regretted having to leave him saddled through the night i only took the pistols out of the holsters and laid by them by my side suddenly loud long lasting yell was raised which however seemed much farther off and to come from the prairie on the south side of the forest probably the lepans had found my trail through the prairie but it was satisfact ory sign to that they had not attempted to follow along the river bed in all other directions my was unassailable unless there was second entrance into the valley in my rear was probable it had already grown so dark that i could not distinguish my white horse from the rocks although the stars shone brilliantly above before it was quite dark i sat down by the side of czar to prevent him lying down i grew very sleepy but the yell of the indians still sounded too loudly in my ears to indulge in repose i tried to keep awake by smoking which helped while but smoking in perfect darkness is enjoyment hence i soon grew tired of it and tried to keep awake by walking up and down czar too was tired of standi ng he stamped impatiently with his and tried the strength of the lasso by tugging at it at length nature claimed her dues and i could not possibly keep awake any longer i took off czar load laid it in the darkness against the stone to which he was secured spread out my rug and lay down on it with my riﬂe on my arm czar was not long in following my example and tried usual to have roll before going to sleep which might have injured or the saddle in the darkness hence i presse d his head to the ground and we were both ere long soundly asleep the rocks around us day was scarce breaking when i started up and looked around with disagreeable feeling of how easily could an indian have crept up and done to while asleep what all the whole tribe could not effect while i was awake czar lay motionless and i did not disturb him it might easily happen that his strength alone could bear away in safety i went out of the gorge and brought in some dry wood lit ﬁre and made coffee being obliged to breakfast on my biscuits and salt tongue the dainty lumps of pork i had cut yesterday had probably served wolf supper while i was breakfasting my faithful steed raised his head and rested it on my knee that i might remove the bridle which i had left on during the night the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https so hobbled him out in the grass and then sat down again at my small ﬁre where i could see along the river and up the valley behind whose steep granite walls were just beginning to be illumined by the rising sun in the valley itself the fog still lay like white veil and only few tall trees raised their crowns above it the stream by which i was sitting was all aglow with its tiger lilies with which the dazzling white of my horse grazing among them formed beautiful contrast the mist in the valley was dissipated and revealed the rich vegetation which grew there apart from the world i remembered the fairy tales of childhood enchanted princes and sleeping princesses the palace of glass and the magic valley had they not been narrated before this continent was known to europeans i should have believed that the fables had their origin in this valley i was very curious to learn whether there was another entrance besides the one i commanded if not it was very possible that my was unknown to the indians the steep hills around did not reveal that they concealed such fairylike kingdom in their interior after day sport it was about nine when after washing and saddling czar i rode off to examine the secrets of the wonderful valley i looked around at the lofty walls of granite but could not notice any other connexion with the external world but the one through which i had come the valley about mile in diameter was covered with most luxuriant crop of young grass and number of clumps of trees and bushes through which the rivulet wound it struck curious that i saw game on such rich pasturage excepting ﬂock of turkeys i had put the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https although i had reached the centre the turkeys were very shy and ran off when i dismounted to shoot one but just i was going to mount again an old cock came running up and my bullet put speedy end to his existence the report had hardly begun to echo through the rocks ere swarm of aquatic birds of all sizes rose right in front of like ﬂies in the sunshine but i remained quietly seated on the grass reloading my riﬂe they soon settled down again i walked through the bushes and noticed large pond with ﬂat banks covered with all sorts of gaily plumaged birds among which herons and ﬂamingoes occupied prominent place the banks were literally covered with these birds some of which were standing sentry on one leg while others were up to their knees in the water and engaged in catchin g frogs when i stepped out of the bushes all the birds rose again portion seated themselves with loud croaks on the nearest trees while the rest rose in the air and proceeded in various directions to less disturbed regions it now appeared if all the inhabitants of the valley had left it and i was not sorry at having secured good meal my stomach was beginning to complain about neglect i hung the turkey on my saddle and rode to the pond whose banks were so trampled by the birds that not single blade of grass grew on them but i noticed great number of jaguar tracks some old others quite recent the animals to which these tracks belonged must consequently live in the valley they would not climb over the rocks and had not passed my night quarters it was now clear to why this splendid pasture was so deserted and only visited by birds while hundreds of buffaloes and deer would have found abundant food i rode nearly round the valley with revolver in my hand i expected at any moment to meet the landlord but i did not see him and not living creature remained in the valley but the few turkeys which had probably strayed thither i rode back to my bivouac it was midday and both myself and czar felt hungry and prepared part of the turkey dinner while czar had hearty feed of grass when we had ﬁnished our meal i tied him up close to under the overhanging rocks where the sun did not fall on us i threw wood on the ﬁre and lay down to sleep to make up the last night lost rest the sun was

wood to my camp with which to keep up my ﬁre during the night i slept undisturbed till daybreak took refreshing bath in the cold stream while my breakfast was getting ready then rode czar into deep spot washed him thoroughly and was soon ready to leave this mysterious but so pleasant spot with the resolution to visit it again sooner or later my road led into the river again on whose rippled surface the night mist rolled along with the current but on further reﬂection i saw how many obstacles now stood in my way the current was very powerful and the waves broke against my horse strong chest the bottom covered with loose boulders rendered its footsteps unsteady and constantly put it in danger of falling at length i reached the bed of rocks which blocked the entire breadth of the river over which czar had clambered with such agility it now seemed to purely impossible that horse could achieve such feat although the marks of his shoes proved to the contrary i would not venture however to make my horse leap it again but took my axe out of its sheath entered the water which was shallow here and cut away the creepers and bush es hanging over the bank and thus formed much better path beneath them over very few large but ﬂat stones i led czar across and then slowly walked on constantly thrusting on one side the vines hanging with length of ﬁfty feet over the water in order to force myself through them after great exertions i at length reached the buffalo path by which i had crossed the river on the previous day but one and followed it again to the skirt of the wood but this time with greater caution i left czar behind in the thick bushes and crept out alone to the edge of the prairie and examined the latter carefully with my glass the grassy expanse before far i could see was covered with countless buffaloes and numerous deer which were grazing quietly and carelessly and i recognised at great distance large troop of wild horses which must consist of several hundred these were the surest signs that indian had shown himself on this day upon the plain so i returned to my horse and pursued my journey northward through this prairie in about an hour i drew near the horses which were giving vent to their playfulness by rearing kicking and galloping about i rode along hollow under the hill in order to get near them i could in which i perfectly succeeded the wind was favourable i rode to within short distance of them under the hill on which they were standing when czar scented them suddenly raised his head and expressed his delight at the friendly meeting by loud snort in an instant the troop dashed up to greet the stranger it was led by coal black very powerful stallion whose mane some ﬁve feet in length ﬂew wildly round his broad neck the thunder of their hoofs rolled along like tempest toward till we faced each other at distance of about twenty paces the black stallion fell if struck by lightning and the nearest horses fell upon him in the wildest confusion while czar gave them to understand by friendly whinny that there was really reason such fear it was wondrously beautiful sight when these noble powerful animals rose again and ﬂew over the grassy sea like smoke before the blast the black with wildly ﬂying mane ﬂashing eyes and scarlet nostrils at their head i looked after them the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https long time and regretted that i could not risk leading captured horse home i could have easily thrown my lasso over the stallion it is undoubtedly one of the most exquisite sights to watch closely troop of perfectly wild horses in state of excitement especially on the western steppes where every breed is represented these horses are originally descended from those of the old spaniards who established great number of military colonies in these parts each consisting of several hundred men these settlements whose remains may still be found here and there were established in the richest districts and when necessary strongly fortiﬁed maize was planted there and silver copper and lead mines opened i found in this country numerous relics of the old spanish times more especially preserved dams in the rivers and water led through large plantations which are now overgrown with grass these were employed to irrigate the country during protracted drought and thus always secure an abundant harvest which was matter of great importance to the settlers they were many hundred miles from civilized mexico and thus it was impossible to obtain provisions thence the people were entirely left to themselves produced their own food had great quantity of cattle and bred many horses and mules even at that day when these colonies were ﬂourishing it might now and then occur that some of their horses bolted and lived and propagated in the glorious climate and on the rich prairies without the aid of man at later date however more warlike indian hordes poured from the north over the south which was inhabited by tribes held in subjection by the invaders and destroyed these remote spanish outposts whose garrisons they cut down and scalped from this date in all proba bility came the numerous troops of wild horses now spread over the whole of western america the numerous horses of the military colonists were set at liberty and even at the present day the old spanish horse with its long ﬁne mane small head long neck and hanging long tail can be recognised since however eastern civilization has been advancing toward the west these troops have become crossed with all possible breeds and not of the worst sort the men who risked their lives on the border always spend their last farthing in taking good horse with them in whose speed and bottom they could trust when they came in contact with the savage indian hordes from these border settlements where the horses are necessarily turned out to graze on the prairie some frequently escaped they are constantly surrounded by the wild horses and every horse that has once got among such troop bids an eternal farewell to captivity hence we ﬁnd among these animals the pure arab blood we recognise the clumsy english cart horse the pony the and the racer in short there is such display of every breed in the world is able to show i especially noticed an enormous number of greys piebalds and black horses among the troops and that the differences of colour are far more frequent among them than with trained horses they possess great speed short distance on lengthened race owing to their grass feeding they can not keep up with horse fed on corn and hence they are often hunted down and captured by men mounted on the latter this purpose the lasso is employed whose noose is thrown over the horse neck so soon the wild horse neck is squeezed it falls quivering on the ground and the captor ﬁnds time to place halter or leathern thong round its neck the noose is then slightly loosened and trial is made whether it will follow the rider by the halter if it resists the operation is repeated often is necessary to make the animal understand that it must yield to captivity rule it follows soon and can be easily tamed especially when it is not too old if these horses are fed on maize awhile they grow very strong and enduring the ﬁllies are the easiest to capture and tame you need only chase manada some miles and the ﬁllies fall exhausted and not rise again and if they are raised on their legs after recovery they will immediately follow the ridden horse their mares have disappeared with the troop these animals become tame dogs and are of great value to the bordere r it costs nothing to rear them and they can be put to any work all that the wild horse is greatly detested in the vicinity of settlement and many noble brute has died there with bullet in its heart the borderer can not shut up his horses and mules in stables they must seek the food which nature offers them in such profusion and hence they have the gate of liberty always open but they not ﬂy because they not know what liberty is but scarc they see troop of their wild comrades dash past ere they dart off too never again to bow their neck to the plough or the bit they in such cases become the wildest of the troop and can always be recognised at its head my black stallion whose wildly ﬂowing mane i followed long distance over the prairie had however never yet bent his neck beneath the yoke of man it displayed too fully the pride and strength which nature imparts to liberty alone on its black the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https these animals had never seen the low roof the simple palisade of frontier house and fugitive thence had ever complained to them about the fate he had endured czar was beside himself that he was not allowed to join in the race and tried long time to check the speed of the fugitives by his snorts he danced threw his croupe from one side to the other and furiously tore at the bit but it was all of use and serfdom still lay on his broad neck even though with rosy bonds the sun was rather low on the horizon when i found myself about ﬁve miles from what seemed to be very large forest behin d which rose the mountains which i had noticed few days previously in the azure distance when i took my ﬁrst glance at this valley i leapt from my horse hobbled it and crawled through the grass after two very old stags one of which was quietly grazing behind fallen mosquito tree while the other if it had noticed something thrust its thick neck over the stump in my direction i had left my hat with czar in order to attract less attention and the sun shone hotly on my head but what will not hunter readily endure if it enables him to draw nearer the game at length there were about one hundred yards between us and i had reached small patch of ﬂowering jalap trees which cove red i raised myself on one arm and ﬁred aiming at the head i saw that the deer was hit close to the heart it ran about ﬁfty paces with its comrade and then fell dead after reloading i rode up to the deer and laid in some days supply of meat hung it on the saddle and continued my journey to the forest which i entered about sunset by very broad open buffalo path i was sure that the forest was traversed by stream and resolved to seek the latter ere i selected my night quarters i followed the path with my riﬂe on the when suddenly my horse gave start and very old bear entered the path hardly twenty yards ahead of stopped and with its head turned from began nibbling at the roots of few small bushes it took scarce moment to raise my riﬂe and pull the trigger and in the next i pulled czar round and rode the prairie on looking round however i perceived that the bear had only sprung few yards after and was now half sitting half lying on the path and showing its savage teeth when i slowly approached it i noticed that its fury was heightened with every step i took and only its inability to rise prevented it from attacking i there fore rode close up and sent second bullet through its head it was very heavy fat bear and i was really sorry that i could turn it to so little account not very far from this spot i found the stream and resolved to pass the night on its bank the forest on the other side seemed very extensive and it was doubtful whether i should ﬁnd there good provender my horse i watered czar ﬁlled my bottle and rode back to the bear from which i cut paw the tongue and some ribs i then camped in the forest at spot where the most splendid wild oats awaited my horse the paw was put to cook in the ashes the next morning but the ribs were to make their appearance on the supper table roasted bear rib is indubitably one of the greatest dainties which the desert can offer the hunter and i enjoyed it the more because i had been riding all day and had eaten nothing since my very early breakfast man soon grows used to this mode of life which is necessary in the case of violent exertion in the hot sun it is very easy to bring on fever by riding with full stomach the night was dark and rendered the light which my ﬁre cast upon the dark green roof above my head all the more attractive while the giant brightly illumined trunks looked like pillars supporting it i lay on my tiger skin and amused myself with counting the shaped ﬂowers of the bignonia which swung in long drooping festoons from one tree to the other and lit up by my ﬁre resembled so many red glass lamps around number of strove to outvie each other in uninterruptedly uttering their name and frequently circled round my ﬁre at the same time and huge glistened and ﬂashed in all the bushes and the rustling of the adjoining stream supplied the music this italian night my eyes gradually closed the pictures of dreams became more and more blended with those of reality until calm sleep fell on to strengthen and refresh day was breaking when i opened my eyes and the scene which had so sweetly lulled to sleep had faded away the ﬁre was out and instead of the grey mist lay over the bushes the grass around was very damp and the bear black hide was silvered over with dew from all sides the loud chuckling of the turkeys reached and i felt tickling in my foreﬁnger to bend it upon one of these birds but then i looked at the mountain of ﬂesh which lay before and rested my riﬂe again against the tree and went to the ﬁre to pull the paw out of the ashes the ﬁre soon burnt brigh tly and dispersed the cold damp air around i put coffee on and bear rib before the ﬁre led czar to the stream and refreshed myself and the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https i returned to the ﬁre led my horse into the oats and paid my respects to the bear paw and rib the sun was also darting his rays through the trees when i was ready to start and rode through the stream towards the dense forest i rode about three hours in this labyrinth passing from one buffalo path to another until the ground began to grow more uneven and here and there large masses of rock rose between the trees i dismounted and was leading my horse up narrow path by the side of great boulder when i suddenly saw on raising my head the entire forest literally covered with wild cattle i returned to the rock meeting with these most dangerous animals on an impracticable path like this was not desirable and hanging the bridle over branch i again ascended the height in order to convince myself in what direction the cattle were going the herd passed bound westward and i am certain i saw over 300 head pass these denizens of the desert are the most savage and dangerous animals in western america like the horses of the ﬁrst spanish settlements they are runaways and have now entirely returned to state of nature you never see spotted or black head among them they are all chestnut with black extremities and yellow stripe down the back and are more lightly and gracefully built than our cattle and rapid deer they shun man but when startled or excited they attack with the most frightful courage and obstina cy and i would sooner defend myself on foot with bowie knife against black bear than with riﬂe against furious bull of this description i remained about an hour behind the rock before the last of the herd had disappeared between the trees after which i rode across their deeply trampled path and soon found myself on the edge of the forest from this point gradually rose bald desolate mountain range that ran from east to west and whose base was covered with bad grass and few scattered granitic rocks these mountains the san saba are spurs of the rocky mountains which i had already noticed from the elevation where the granite follows on the limestone i might calculate on wandering about there weeks before again reaching watered valleys hence i resolved to alter my course and go farther east until i reached the mountains which were the source of all the streams i had lately crossed and return home along their base on this side of the forest the soil was too bad to produce good grass hence i looked about buffalo path by which i could cross it again in southern direction these eternally wandering buffaloes however appeared to avoid the sterile mountains and though here and there lightly trodden path entered the forest it was not open enough to be followed by horseman it was already noon and i was still on the outside of the forest when i noticed tolerably beaten path in an angle where the forest jutted out farther into the mountains i was very glad of it indescribable was the feeling of comfort when i reached the dense shade of the ﬁrst trees i threw my leathern jacket over the saddle hung my hat by its side and followed the path which ran between the rocks that rose among the trees and led deeper into the forest suddenly sound reached my ear resembling the fall of distant water and the nearer i drew the more distinct it became it was possible that the river here took wide curve to the foot of the mountains and i greeted it with delight i soon saw that i was not mistaken on turning large rock i stood close in front of waterfall which aroused my admiration both through the peculiarity of its shape and the refreshing coolness that it spread far and wide beneath the shady trees powerful mountain torrent about thirty yards wide fell over an immense rock twenty feet high down upon another rock which had been hollowed to depth of about three feet by the water which had fallen on it centuries and formed basin over whose front the agitated foaming stream dashed at height of about forty feet over widely scattered masses of rocks and aged trees suspended between them while on either side enormously lofty trees laid their thick crowns together over the roaring cataract and repulsed the inquisitive sunbeams i soon stripped czar and hobbled him lit small ﬁre put the on it and lay down on my blanket close to the fall in order to make sketch of it when i was sufﬁciently rested i went up to the basin undressed and leapt into the foaming water never in my life have i found so glorious this which nature appeared to have made the express purpose the very cold waves dashed up to an immense height and it was hardly possible to stand under the cataract while behind it i was entirely shut off from the outer world if i were in palace of crystal i remained till about ﬁve at this diana bath i christened it and it is known by that name to all the hunters who have since visited it it was too early however to camp hence i mounted my horse and rode up once more to bid adieu to the the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https through the forest i was followed by the roaring of the fall till the rustling of the river i was approaching overpowered it at about one hour before sunset i reached the prairie at the southern end of the forest and until nightfall followed its skirt in an easterly direction till i reached spot where the stream emer ged from it i camped here quite concealed and on the next day rode eastward towards the mountains from this point i altered my course to the south and rode there several days one afternoon when greatly troubled by thirst i reached pleasant grass valley on which several mosquito trees grew fresh stream wound through the verdant bottom and few deer were grazing on either bank i dismounted to refresh myself with the eagerly desired draught and grant my horse little rest very large deer was standing over two hundred yards off and staring intently at i was well stocked with meat but the query whether i could hit it led away it had so often done and while sitting on the bank i ﬁred at it the deer bled ran short distance in circle and then fell lifeless on the ground after reloading i went up to it to fetch the ﬁllet and while engaged in fastening it to my saddle i noticed two foot indians one armed with riﬂe the other with bow and arrows come out from behind some bushes and advance some twenty yards before they caught sight of i saw their terror and amazement and that one of them crossed his arms on his breast and laid his arms on his shoulders which among them is sign of friendship i made them signa l to be off and assured them of my friendly sentiments in the same way upon which they described large circle round and escaped from sight long way down the stream i felt convinced that several of their tribe were hunting in the vicinity they must have heard my shot and would assuredly not have emer ged so carelessly from behind the bushes had they not believed it was ﬁred by one of their comrades i put czar at sharp amble the grass was not high and hurried down into the valley while carefully looking round in order to escape this menacing place about sunset i reached another small stream where i halted lit ﬁre and prepared my supper while czar was enjoying his here i rested till night had set in then saddled again ﬁlled my gourd and rode on about ﬁve miles here i led my horse into thicket which ran between two steep hillocks and remained in it during the night it was very probable that the indians had informed their comrades of the presence of paleface and that they had followed to my but had been unable to strike my trail in the darkness from this point my journey was several days most fatiguing and far from pleasant one i constantly went up and down barren stony hills and found scarce grass enough to feed my horse we also both suffered from the want of water which was the more perceptible on the bare heated rocks i could only proceed short distances through the constant marching on very hard stones czar feet were beginning to swell and though he was not lame he put them down very gingerly there was certainly lack of game i always met turkeys and deer in the neighbourhood of water and on such uneven ground it is very easy to stalk the game although it may offend the feelings of the true sportsman i will confess that on this ride i shot several fawns the sake of their tender ﬂesh i also killed very large jaguar which i attracted by imitating the cry of complaining fawn it leaped within twenty yards of ere it noticed but then stopped and looked round its victim swinging its long tail high up in the air the bullet went through its head and laid it dead the indians make sort of wooden pipe which so admirably imitates the moan of fawn that every old animal within distance of mile round comes dashing up and is startled neither by horse nor its rider i have seen instances where old animals continued to advance after being missed two three or four times till they lamentably fall victims to their maternal love i always carried such an instrument about all the larger beasts of prey can be easily attracted by it such bears tigers panthers wolves lynxes and the leopard cats which are very numerous about us and are easily deceived by it i at length again reached the limestone region but i must have been great deal too far east the mountain chain was much lower than at the spot where i had crossed it this view was soon conﬁrmed when i went down into the valley and found all the streams i crossed small and insigniﬁcant the country continually became more pleasant and rich the valleys grew broader and the vegetation was more luxuriant than in the desolate melancholy ravines i had been lately riding along i daily expected to see mountains and looked about more especially very high point on mountain chain which runs southward from turkey creek to the rio grande on which the indians have built pyramid of large stones either put up ﬁnger the wandering tribes or border mark between the dif ferent the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https morning i had just left camp and was riding through an extensive prairie when i fancied i could recognise this landmark and convinced myself by the aid of my glass that i was not mistaken i felt myself at home again although this point was good day journey from my house still i knew in which direction my road lay and eagerly went along it about noon i reached one of those most troublesome cactus woods which frequently run across the prairies the present one ran like wall miles across my path there is chance of riding through these thickets the prickly plants grow closely together though they are most disagreeable to the hunter their appearance is most attractive to the naturalist through the brilliant colour of the cactus ﬂowers and the peculiar shape of the plants this obstacle led long way from my route i was obliged to ride round it several miles while i was riding close along this wall still hoping to ﬁnd free passage i suddenly noticed deer about twenty yards off poking its head out of the prickles and staring at in surprise i raised my stopped ﬁred at the head i could not see any more of the deer i could distinctly see through the smoke that the bullet smashed the right side of the deer head and heard it dash away few yards and then fall but it was impossible to penetrate the prickly wall this short distance and reach the deer the cactuses were here from sixteen to seventeen feet high and so close together that i could not go foot into them hence i was obliged to give up the deer and was very glad on at length reaching narrow glade which ran through the wood late at night i rode along the bank of river which i took one of the western arms of turkey creek and was forced to halt and pass the night here by the numerous rocks that rose from the tall grass and ferns the next morning i passed the spot where i crossed the river with the unfortunate kreger by means of the trunk of the tree and at noon reached the camp where the storm had treated us so the revived memory of the unhappy man was very painful to and i hurried from the spot in order to get rid of the picture of the scalped naturalist i now came again into my own where nearly every tree and shrub reminded of ﬁne chase and my desire home and my faithful trusty urged on i rode late into the night till i reached at ten where i and czar had often stopped before it was evident that the sensible creature recognised his home and again sought the same spot to rest where he had before stretched his beautiful limbs when day broke i rose from my blanke t with feeling resembling that i felt on my birthday when child but soon wretched doubts forced themselves on whether i should ﬁnd my little colony all right czar on this day was washed extra clean all the beards of the turkeys i had shot on the tour were fastened on the bridle the beautiful skin of the tiger shot on the mountains was laid over the panther skin to display it in the best way and i then continued my ride toward the fort which i hoped to reach at noon with joyously beating heart the grass however was so high and rendered going so fatiguing my horse that i advanced but slowly and did not reach our ﬁrst at the commencement of the tour till noon czar was very hot and tired so i did not ride on i had intended but unsaddled and boiled coffee while the horse was reposing in the shady grass when the greatest heat was passed and i had washed czar down in the stream i started again homewards and saw the sun was setting my beloved virgin forest appear above the prairie and the two immense poplars indicating the spot where the buffalo path that led to my settlement entered the forest it was about ten miles off so that i could calculate on reaching home by nightfall without any great ef fort i had ridden through small wood and had advanced into the prairie some hundred yards when i noticed on my left at about mile distance ﬁve horse indians emer ge from clump of oaks their horses were going at what is called dog trot although it seemed to be increased or diminished according to czar pace i looked at them through my glass and saw that only two of them had bows and the other three were unarmed their appearance did not cause any apprehension i quietly followed my road at gentle walk we constantly came nearer and i soon saw that the indians designed to meet on the path i therefore held my horse in so that they reached the path when i was about one hundred yards distant from them they stopped and when they saw that i did the same one of the armed men turned his horse toward and rode few paces nearer i made signs to them to go their way and when i saw they had result i leapt from my horse and raised my riﬂe again intimating to them to ride on they now shouted to kitchi kitchi delawa re delaware the names of friendly tribes and at the same time made the signals of amity i however signalled to them again and raised my riﬂe to my shoulder upon which they spoke together and went up the hill very slowly one behind the other till i lost sight of the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https suspicions which i entertained of all indians induced also to ride up the hill to see what had become of them to my great surprise i saw them long distance ahead galloping across the prairie this sudden haste could not be explained through fear of it must have another cause which i could only ﬁnd in the fact that their camp was great distance off and that they wished to inform their tribe of my presence so to cut off on the prairie and lay wait in the woods on the leone from the direction they followed if the tribe were encamped great distance from the path that led into the wood they could get there before whence i soon made up my mind and galloped off to another ford of the leone about twenty miles higher up czar galloped nearly the whole distance and i reached the forest before sunset i was now safe one could pass through the wood on horseback and the narrow buffalo path could be easily defended i reached the leone welcomed it with heartfelt joy and hurried down the opposite bank toward my home about three miles from it i had to cross hill whence i could see my fort i approach ed its crest with loudly beating heart because i must here obtain certainty to the fate of my settlement i looked across the valley and on the other side i saw the fort glistening through the gloom heavy load fell from my heart i took my glass everything was quiet the smoke rose straight from the kitchen and suddenly two of my dogs ran up from the river and disappeared through the palisades into the interior of the fort czar too knew perfectly well that he was going home though i had ridden him unusually hard he kept up his amble while usually when he was tired he had habit of stopping and biting the grass it had grown very dark when i rode up the last hill to my fort and was received by the loud barking of my dogs which dashed through the holes in the palisades but all their voices were overpowered by trusty bass from the interior of the building the dogs soon recognised and springing up to czar expressed their delight at my return by loud whining i now raised my hunting cry which was responded to by trusty tugging furiously at his chain and hearty welcome from my garrison the chain of the gate fell and trusty ﬂew out and up at so that i was hardly able to keep my feet under his demonstrations of delight my three comrades received most heartily and strove to show how much they were attached to my horses and mules raised their voices from the interior of the fort and czar answered them by his friendly whinnies when the ﬁrst greeting was over my three men asked almost simultaneously but where is mr kreger i pointed to heaven and intimated by short that i would tell them all about it presently czar was soon liberated from his burden rolled himself heartily at his old place in the grass and consoled himself with his long absent while i doffed my travelling accoutrements indoors and made myself comfortable by wash and change of dress we were soon seated round the old table at supper at which i refreshed myself with draught of fresh milk and then i described the unhappy fate of my companion kreger an almost unanimous did i not foretell it burst at the end of my narrative from the lips of my comrades who all felt great sympathy in the unhappy man fate in spite of my weariness it had grown rather late hence i rose went out once more to czar who had heartily enjoyed his husked corn and then proceeded indoors with my faithful trusty who resumed his old post on thick bearskin with delight but i felt so conﬁned in my room that i was obliged to open all the doors and windows and lie down on buffalo hide on the ﬂoor instead of resting in my bed

not yet awake and merely raised his head little from the ground gazing at with his glorious eyes if he wished to say that it was too soon to rise and then laid his head down on the ground again and accepted my patting without stirring the whinnied and turned about till it came up to when it took from my hand piece of biscui t the dogs leapt about but kept at respectful distance because trusty was by my side and none dared venture near him i aroused my garrison and then proceeded to the river whence i could survey my maize ﬁeld which glistened like dark pine forest and in which horseman would have been completely hidden then i went into the garden which i found in admirable order and in which the most magniﬁcent melons were ripening when i returned to the fort the milch cows were leaving the enclosure and shone in the morning sun if they had been my favourite cock whip called his numero us harem out to breakfast on the prairie and two pigs hurried with their farrows towards the river the purpose of going to the wood after breakfast i saddled the which the saddle girths had grown much too tight and rode with one of my men and trusty to the other side of the river towards the old buffalo path that led to the prairie we reached the skirt of the wood and had not ridden far through it when trusty who was ahead stopped and looked up at i dismounted and perceived number of footsteps made by mocassins little farther on the grass was trampled down by great number of horses hoofs my foreboding was then conﬁrmed the entire indian tribe had laid wait in the woods and i should certainly have fallen victim to their treachery if my good star had not warned of their design i silently thanked my guardian angel who had already led through so many dangers and rode back to the fort which i reached shortly before noon with very fat deer i had shot on passing through the wood and which hung across my comrade saddle few days rest at home did wonderful deal of good and i felt remarkably comfortable in the afternoon i swung in hammock in the verandah before my house smoking cigar and in the evening i sat till late hour in rocking chair in my neatly furnished room and sang to the guitar songs from the past days of youth and passion my house consisted of but one large room whose walls and ceiling were covered with the ﬁnest buffalo hides while carpet of smooth summer deer hides enlivened the ﬂoor over my bed was the skin of splendid spotted jaguar and in front of it was spread bear skin on which trusty slept the walls were adorned with excellent among them being very ﬁne specimen of murillo and from the ceiling hung lamp which throwing its faint light on the dark walls produced weak but pleasant illumination on the table in front of the glass stood two large gourds ﬁlled with water in which stood splendid bouquets of magnolias which spread their vanilla perfume through the whole room close by was glass case containing my ﬁrearms and on all the walls were displayed the most splendid antlers of our common deer the giant deer elks moose and antelopes collection of good engravings small library and my drawing apparatu s completed the furniture of this asylum to which i frequently retired when i returned home from long tour covered with dust and blood and was beginning to grow tired of this rough savage mode of life at such times i looked out the clothes of tail coat and polished boots and trusty in his amazement would not take his eyes off if he were afraid that i should at last become quite another man although this metamorphosis may appear so ridiculous it had something about it most the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https pleasant i then occupied myself some days with reading answering my letters drawing and music after which i again donned my suit and threw myself into the arms of nature with my faithful companions i had been at home about week had only hunted close to the fort and in addition to domestic arrangements occupied mysel f principally with ﬁshing which purpose i fastened strong cord across the stream on which were number of lines and hooks hanging baited in the water small bell in the middle of the cord informed us when ﬁsh or turtle was tugging at it and we fetched them ashore with the canoe we only cared large ﬁsh and it was rarity us to pull up and weighing thirty pounds trout of twelve and turtles of forty pounds early one morning i was engaged in shoeing czar forefeet i always kept stock of shoes and nails by after which i returned to my room to write letters i intended to send one of my men in few days with commissions to the nearest settlement i had been writing about half an hour with trusty lying under the table in the middle of the room when the door opened and i of course expected it was one of my own people trusty however sprang up barking from under the table and pulled down i tried to hold him back by the tail in an instant the furious animal leaped at the throat of stranger dressed in leather who came into the room with long kentucky riﬂe pulled him down and would certainly have killed him in few minutes if i had not thrust my hands between the dog jaws and forced them open though his teeth were buried deep in my ﬁngers with all my strength i lay on the desperate dog and my men dragged the stranger out of the door while i was scarce able to hold back the animal which leaped up madly at the closed door i hurried out to the stranger in whom i recognised who had paid visit about year previously he was seriously hurt though not mortally it seemed i at once took him into the house continually applied cold bandages and nursed him well i could during the four days he remained with

and friendship and i was very glad to get rid of this unbidden guest one evening the sun was setting i felt necessity of hearing the crack of my riﬂe czar had fattened up again and trusty was anxiously awaiting the day when i shou ld recover from my indolence i rode down the river to small pond on the prairie which was ﬁlled with rain water in the winter and retained it till far into the summer strangely enough all animals prefer this water to any other and will go long distance to drink it i led czar into the bushes threw his bridle over branch and sat down on the edge of the forest upon the roots of an old oak waiting the game that might come to water it was growing dark when herd of deer came across the prairie and posted themselves on hill behind the pond they were all rather large but one of them had antlers far larger than the rest after short halt they advanced up to the water hole with the big deer at their head it had drunk and was raising its head with the mighty antlers when i pulled the trigge r and the bullet struck behind the shoulder blade he ran away from the other deer to broad rather deep ravine formed by the torrents and which gradually grew narrower i mounted czar after reloading and rode after the deer which suddenly rose before and leaped up the steep wall of the ravine it was already very dark and i was afraid of losing the deer hence i called trusty to follow it nothing could please him better he ran after it up the wall and pursued it into the prairie with loud barking the spot was too steep i ran back and when i reached the prairie lower down i saw the deer proceeding towards the woods and two dogs instead of one following it i gave czar the reins in order to cut the deer off but trusty caught it at the moment and the supposed second dog an enormous white wolf attacked my dog all three lay atop of each other when i leaped from my horse within shot and hurried to the scene of action the wolf noticed and tried to bolt but trusty held it tightly and i ran within ten paces of them the two animals were leaping up savagely at each other when my bullet passed through the wolf side and trusty settled it the deer which had thirty tines had got up again but soon fell on leap from trusty and i killed it i then rode home fetched cart drawn the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https mule drove out with one of my men and brought back the deer and the wolf whose skin though not so ﬁne in winter still made an excellent carpet under our there was nothing to now in the ﬁelds whence we seldom went there and our visits were limited to one of us crossing the river at daybreak in canoe hollowed out of monstrous poplar and walking round the ﬁeld with fowling piece in order to put check to the countless squirrels which sprang over the fence to reach the forest at daybreak partly because they did great damage to the young maize partly because they supplied an excellent dish breakfast another animal which we killed in these walks was the racoon which also injured the maize and inhabited our forests in incredible numbers we merely shot it because it injured the maize its ﬂesh is uneatable its skin though highly valued in europe fetches price among us it visits the ﬁelds at night clambers up the maize stalks nibbles few seeds out of cob and then runs to another plant the result is that the gnawed cobs rot and die i was taking this walk one morning round the ﬁeld when i saw on the railings at the hinder end several whole stalks hanging and found one on the ground in the forest i went into the ﬁeld and found large spaces where all the stalks had been pulled up and carried off but could not recognise trail on the soil which was thickly overgrown with weeds and grass i followed the trail into the forest and found at great distance from the ﬁrst maize stalk footprint on the ground which seemed made only with the heel and which i took mocassin the maize however was not ripe yet and not even large enough boiling and hence it seemed to improbable that indians had carried off the plants i sought farther and soon found quite distinct enormous bear footprint which indicated the thief more clearly when evening came i and one of my men seated ourselves in the maize with trusty on couple of chairs we carried there i had my large loaded with pistol bullets and my comrade double riﬂe we sat long time the moon shon now and then but at length we grew tired of waiting and i got up to go home but at the same moment fancied i could hear the crackling of drift wood i fell back on my chair at the same moment the railing in front of grew dark and almost immediately bruin appeared with his broad chest and peered about in all directions piff paff i let ﬂy both barrels at him he disappeared behind the railing and we could hear him dashing through the wood we went home and on the next morning at daybreak we followed the trail along which trusty led us to the dead bear which had only run mile its fat and meat fully compensated the damage it had ef fected in the ﬁeld it was the summer season and the heat was growing very oppressive hence i carefully avoided hunting buffalo fear of tiring my horse too much and restricted myself to supplying our wants with deer turkeys and antelopes in the vicinity but our supply of salted and smoked meat was at an end and i resolved to go after buffalo on day which was not quite so hot trusty had run himself lame in following deer recently his feet had grown soft through doing nothing so i left him at home and rode down the river on czar early one morning about ten miles from home i saw from the wood whose skirt i was following small herd of about twenty buffalo bulls grazing on an elevation on the prairie i hid my riﬂe in bush that i might ride more easily took revolver from my belt and went cautiously under the hill near i could to the animals suddenly they saw broke into gallop and tried to escape i went after them and though i had to ride over many stony broken places in the bottom on the other side i soon caught them up and ﬁred bullet behind the shoulder blade of fat old bull it at once went slower remained behind the herd and bled profusely from the mouth and nostrils but still galloped on i did by its side short distance of at spot where valley entered the prairie i shot ahead and i expected it turned aside into the bottom it was in very bad state and i awaited it to turn at bay any moment when i would kill it with another shot still it kept up its speed and i tired of the chase rode up behind to kill it with shot from short distance i had hardly risen in the right stirrup however and leant over to ﬁre when the bull turned with lightning speed drove his horn under the stirrup and hurled such height in the air that on looking down from above i could see czar dash off frantically and fall in the tall grass in an instant i sprang on my legs again and three paces from stood the monster with its head on the ground braying furiously and stamping its fore feet it was nearly all over but still i held my revolver pointed between the bull little eyes and waited like statue the moment when it charged to send bullet through its shaggy forehead but it was in too bad state and hence turned away few minutes after and went round the mortal spot was the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https i ﬁred and the bull fell dead i then ran up the nearest hillock through the tall grass where i arrived greatly fatigued and looked about czar whom i saw in the distance ﬂying over the prairie with his tail ﬂuttering in the breeze i felt terribly frightened at this sight this region was rarely free from wild horses and i was well aware that if czar once got among them he would be eternally lost to i was looking after him in desperation when i noticed in front of him long black line apparently coming towards i looked through my telescope and recognised herd of buffalo which aroused by some cause were galloping towards my horse in long line czar stopped raising his head high in the air then turned and came straight towards with ﬂying mane i collected all my strength to reach one of the highest spots around that lay in the course of my terriﬁed horse he dashed through the last bottom over the trailing grass dragging the tiger skin after him which hung down on one side of the saddle on hearing my cry he stopped and recog nised ran to and stood tremblin g all over by my side while timidly looking round at the pursuing column with one bound i was on his back and felt myself once more lord of the desert the buffaloes halted on the nearest elevation looked at some minutes and then dashed into the bottom on the right i then rode back to my buffalo broke it up hung its tongue and ﬁllet on the saddle and started home fetching my riﬂe i passed i reached the fort at noon saddled the after we had drunk coffee and then went out with the cart to fetch the very fat meat of my vanquished foe it was then cut into long thin strips and packed into cask with alternate layers of salt after it had lain thus few days it was put up on long sticks and hung over very smoky ﬁre in the burning sun when in few hours it became dry enough to be carried into the where it kept good very long time one morning my men were busily engaged in hanging up the dried meat in the when one of them came running up to and informed that herd of buffaloes was coming up close to the garden on the river i seized my riﬂe and darted out shouting to my men to keep back the dogs but to let them all loose when i waved my handkerchief i ran out of the fort and in stooping posture along prairie hollow in order to get before the buffaloes which were marching two and two in long row up from the river to the prairie and lay down in the long grass under an elevation which they were steering i had been lying there but few minutes when the ﬁrst bulls appeared on the heights and i shot one of them though without showing myself the buffalo stopped sank on its knees and fell over while the others gathered round it looked at it long time and then tried to make it get up by pushing it with their horns if you not show yourself you can in this way kill great number of these animals they are not frightened by the sound of riﬂe after reloading i rose on one knee and shot second which i hit in the knee however instead of behind the shoulder i saw that it had noticed it turned round and with its head down dashed upon from the heights i sprung up and waved my handkerchief and then threw myself full length in narro w gully while the hunting cry of my people in the fort reached my ear and i recognised trusty voice among my dogs i heard the thunder of the savage bull approaching it made the ground shake under and i looked up expecting every minute to see the monster leap over but when it was within about twenty yards of it stopped with terrible roar it had lost and now saw my dogs dashing up the valley like unchained furies prince albert one of my young bloodhounds was the foremost and behind him came lady elsler his bitch both equally fast and courageous they dashed past i rose and now came trusty with his mouth wide open furious that another dog should dare to assault the enemy before him my echoed far over the prairie where the two bloodhounds hung by the thick hide of the infuriated buffalo on its wounded side while trusty pinned its monstrous muzzle in which he buried his fangs which never loosed their hold the buffalo fell back few paces and then rose with trusty still hanging to its snout on its colossal hind legs snorting furiously i could not shoot on account of the dog and the raging brute dashed over the prairie holding trusty in the air who only every now and then was able to touch the ground with his feet ere long however the whole pack had caught up the fugitives and the brave dogs hung like leeches from the buffalo shaggy coat still it dashed on with them toward the river at spot where the bank was forty feet the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https looked after them with terror there was doubt but that the buffalo would dash over and in that case most of my dogs and trusty more especially would be buried beneath it few more leaps and they would have reached the precipice but at this moment the monster rose in the air and turned over covered by my dogs it roared and raged till the sound echoed through the forest but was unable to get on its forelegs again because trusty kept its head pinned down to the ground i could hardly breathe when i reached the buffalo i held my riﬂe to its broad forehead and sent bullet through its hard skull the ﬁght was at an end and trusty came up to panting and wagging his tail while he looked up to much to say that it had been tough job he limped little and leo very brave dog had considerable wound between the ribs but none of the others were hurt we returned to the fort and were preparing to fetch the meat in the cart when we saw horseman coming down the river who soon dismounted at the gate and walked up to with pleasant good morning and shook my hand he was indubitably the handsomest man i had ever seen and the beauty of his form was heightened by his and leathern dress he was scarce twenty years of age above six feet high with small head long neck broad retreating shoulders full chest very small waist and muscular though shaped legs which were supported by very delicate ankles and feet almost too small his height his lofty forehead was surrounded by black shining silky locks and beneath his cut black eyebrows his blue eyes shone with calmness and decision but also with kindliness that it was impossible to offer him an unfavourable reception his black silky beard passed under his straight nose round his smiling mouth between whose cherry lips two rows of transparent white teeth were visible and heightened the white complexion of his oval face and the fresh ruddiness of his cheeks thus this god of the desert stood before with grace and propriety such are rarely met with in the gouty circles of high society and i thought to myself that his appearance would attract attention and respect in spite of the leathern garb among the nobility of the old world without asking him who he was i gave him the hearty welcome which his amiability claimed led him to the had his luggage brought into the fort and his horse put in stall and supplied with maize leaves then breakfast was set before my guest and after begging him in the old spanish fashion to make my house his home i apologized being obliged to leave him little while i had shot some buffaloes close by which i wanted to get home will you allow to assist you i am good hand at it was his reply he had soon ﬁnished his breakfast and went with out of the fort to the river bank where the buffalo lay although i had introduced trusty to the stranger the dog still pressed between him and which he noticed and remarked you have ﬁne hound there who has grown up in the desert i have heard of him before he is friend of and yet he does not seem savage with i begged him not to touch trusty he might misunderstand it and we soon reached my quarry the stranger whose name was warden he told laid aside his leathern jacket which was tastily ornamented with fringe turned up his displaying thus his ﬁnely formed muscular and white arms and drew splendid from its sheath we set to work together in skinning the buffalo in which operation warden displayed remarkable skill then broke it up and while my people carried the meat to the fort we procee ded to the other buffalo higher up the prairie and prepared it in the same way removal while we were engaged in skinning this animal warden remarked he was surprised at my using riﬂes of so large bore it was settled fact that the long kentucky riﬂes one of which he carried produced much greater effect with small bullets i contradicted this assertion and an argument ensued neither would give up his opinion warden offered wager and staked his riﬂe against one of mine which i accepted we cut off the buffalo head with the skin attached to it and had it carried to the fort with the meat in order to try our riﬂes on it it was noon when we got back we cleaned ourselves and enjoyed our dinner buffalo ﬁllet roasted on the spit and some of the after drinking coffee and smoking cigar we carried the buffalo head outside the fort put it in front of an oak pressed piece of white paper on the forehead and then walked eighty paces back i shot ﬁrst and my bullet passed through the paper into the head and an inch deep into the oak warden ﬁred next and also sent his bullet into the piece of paper but there was trace the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https bullet on the tree behind the head we removed the skin from the skull and found warden bullet lodged under it close to the hole which mine had made warden at once allowed the bet lost but at the same time requested to sell him gun he could not exist without one i naturally laughed my only object in the matter was conviction and the bet had only been joke warden however shot with surpri sing accuracy at one hundred yards with his riﬂe which was four feet and half long the whole weight resting on the left hand in front but his ball rarely passed through deer except when he was close to it after supper while we were lying on the grass on the river bank my guest told that he was native of missouri the son of farmer but had been compelled by unfortunate circumstances to quit home and had been living ﬁve years desert hunter at ﬁrst he remained on the frontiers of his own state but the cold winters had continually driven him to the south until he at last got so far down to country whose climate agreed better with him he remained whole week with and made himself useful during the day through his skill in making all sorts of triﬂes instance carvings in poplar and cypress wood plaiting strong tight lines of different coloured horseh air tanning skins making neatly ornamental powder ﬂasks out of buffalo horns and charge measures of the fangs of bears and jaguars while in the evening he described in most lively manner the numerous dangers he had fortunately escaped and the many ﬁghts he had had with the redskins during the ﬁve years the unchanging calmness which usually covered his noble face often deserted him when describing these scenes his eyes ﬂashed like daggers in the moonlight his brow contracted and we could read on his forehead that he must be terrible foe when aroused but these outbursts of passion soon passed away and the ordinary gentleness spread once more over his features among the feelings reﬂected on various occasions in his face there was an unmistakeable melancholy which must be produced by events of his life before the period when he bade farewell to human society and this was proved by the fact that he spoke reluctantly about that time and always became silent when the conversation was accidentally turne d to it hence i carefully avoided alluding to the period if heavy crime lay hid in his bosom i was ready to excuse it while if he was suffering undeservedly i pitied him and would not augment his sorrow by unnecessarily evoking his reminiscences i would have gladly kept him with he was pleasant attractive companion in my solitude but he would go and it seemed to if the tranquillity he enjoyed at my house did not permanently satisfy him and if he wished to deaden memory by the wild perilous life he led on his hunting expeditions i equipped him far lay in my power with everything that could soothe his fatiguing life and took hearty leave of him in front of the fort he parted regretfully and was greatly excited when he shook my hand in farewell and mounted his powerful horse which he had trained like dog he promised to pay anothe r visit soon and galloped at such pace over the prairie if he wished thus to dispel the thoughts which had mastered him i watched him long distance till he disappeared in cloud of dust on the edge of the prairie some time after i learned from the whom trusty received so savagely the history of this amiable but unfortunate man whom the former had known lad in missouri warden father was the son of one of the ﬁrst families in virginia was educat ed at school and studied medicine he got into bad company turned gambler and then highwayman and was some years the terror of post travellers in north carolina and virginia about this time he fell in love with very beautiful fashionably educated young lady in virginia and ran away with her to missouri which was just beginning to be colonized he altered his mode of life was greatly respected by his and in few years sent to congress deputy missouri thus he lived most creditably till his son was twelve years of age and his daughter was married at the age of seventeen to farmer one day however he rode to the nearest town where court was being held and the ﬁrst time during many years tasted spirits he had scarce done so ere his old wicked foe seized on him again with all its might and he rode daily in spite of all the prayers and representations of his family to the town and returned at night in most frightful state of intoxication on the next court day he was about to ride again to town when his wife begged her law to accompany him warden had been drinking already and said he had feeling he should be killed during the day he made his young son take solemn oath to follow his murderer to the end of the world and take his life then he rode off to the town soon became intoxicated began quarrelling at length began wrangling with his who tried to hold him back and drew his knife on him the latter defended himself and warden ran on his knife and the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https home in dying state warden once again reminded his son of the oath he had taken and expired the law was put in work again st his who ﬂed to indiana and lived there in concealment warden son grew up and in his sixteenth year was the favourite of the whole countryside but then he took his riﬂe and his horse bade to

project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https xi the wild horse t he departure of the unfortunate warden who had fallen victim to passions which had not been held in restraint at an early age was very painful to and the evenings which i generally spent alone grew very long i had before gossiped half the night away with him hence i went to bed early and followed my old habit of rising before daybreak i generally took my riﬂe went with trusty across the river to the forest and watched game at that hour the wood was most beautiful the coming day drove the darkness before it through the mighty masses of foliage the birds aroused one another from their sleep owls blinded by the morning light darted like the last shadows of night into the densest thickets and deer returned home from their nocturnal excursions through the dewy grass the bear startled by the increasing light trotted with hoarse growls towards its secret while the herons bearing the ﬁrst golden sunbeams on their silver plumage rose from the tall trees and passed with ﬂapping wing through the refreshing morning breeze i was cautiously walking one mornin g along this my favourite spot and inhaling the thousand perfumes which had ﬁlled the recesses of the forest during the tranquil night avoiding every dry branch fear of startling its denizens while trusty followed at short distance all my windings round the bushes and fallen trees it had become tolerably light when i fancied i heard rustling at an open spot in the centre of which stood several very large trees i stood still moment and listened holding my breath repetition of the noise i heard it again like the breaking of twigs ahead of but in spite of my utmost efforts could not perceive that even leaf was moving once again the same breaking and rustling reached and on looking up accidentally i saw thick black lump shining among the foliage of the i soon disting uished young bear busily engaged in drawing to it with its long paws the thin branches of the and putting the unripe nuts in its mouth i quickly sprang under the tree so to make sure of the bear which was about the size of sheep but i remembered its mamma who might be in the neighbourhood and easily come up to fetch her pet home i stationed myself under the tree on which the cub was and made trusty lie down by my side he was beginning to growl and pressing his nose against the tree the bear saw and became greatly alarmed sprang from one branch to the other and looked timidly down to i did not move but listened carefully to every soun d in the vicinity while my neighbour came down to the ﬁrst ﬂoor above my head and sitting among the lowest branches produced cry like that of little children it soon repeated its wail and i heard far away in the forest hob hob hob hob coming towards i sprang up and placed myself behind the trees after again forcing trusty head into the grass i distinctly distinguished by the leaps that it was an old bear hastening to the help of her cub i pointed my riﬂe in the direction whence it was coming and suddenly it parted the foliage in front of with its broad shoulders whereupon i gave loud pst in second the bear sat up on its and the ﬁre ﬂashed from my barrel it made couple of leaps towards but was rolled over by second bullet through the head while i shouted down sir to trusty who was on the point of springing up i drew revolver ran up to the old bear and sent bullet through her brain she was still furiously hitting out with her terrible paws i next reloaded my riﬂe and looked up at my neighbour who had ﬂed to the top of the tree and was swinging with the branches i called trusty away from under the tree bade him the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https in the grass behind and gave the cub something which brought it down like ball crashing through the foliage to the ground when i put the other barrel to its forehead and stopped its young bearish existence after reloading i broke it up to give trusty his share of the kidneys the only he ever touched unless he was very hungry i then hastened home and after breakfast i went back to the forest with one of my men and three mules when we broke up the old bear and carried the meat home on two of the animals and the cub entire on the third thus several weeks passed during which i went little beyond the immediate vicinity of my house in order to lay in our stock of meat either in the morning or evening when the heat was less oppressive during the day we were cutting steps in the perpendicular out of which very strong spring gushed about ten feet from the top and in buildin g small dairy over it we led the spring through wood en troughs in which we kept the milk and butter sweet while we hung up on the walls meat which remained fresh several days the dairy was on the north side so that it was very slightly exposed to the sun whose effects we also neutralized by thick layer of overhanging reeds this spot was most agreeable in the midday heat at which time the atmosphere in the houses was most oppressive while here it always remained cool and refreshing through the water the spring however was not so pleasant drinking the one i had on the side of the prairie near the garden from which we fetched our drinking water after ﬁnishing my job most of my stores were nearly expended and i required number of new tools hence i went myself to the nearest settlement sold there my stock of hides honey wax and tallow and took home the articles i needed on my pack animals while at the settlement i met at the with whom i was bargaining mexican lad sixteen years of age who had accompanied brace of mules brought here from mexico sale and had remained waiter at the hotel his name was antonio and he offered to go with and stop he was recommended to by an acquaintance horseman and lassoer and he pleased in other respects i accepted his of fer and he rode with home antonio skill in riding was extraordina ry it was all the same to him whether he had bridle or he sat in saddle or once on the animal back rearing or kicking could throw him i have often seen him go up to mules grazing on the prairie and approach them quietly lounging round them if seeking something in the grass till he was near enough to them when with sprin g he was on the back of one of them and the terriﬁed creature made all sorts of bounds and leaps to get rid of him but it was all in vain antonio responded to the mule efforts with his monstrous spurs which he dug into its ﬂanks at every volley till he grew tired of riding and sprang of f again with the same lightness he also threw the lasso with master hand i have frequently seen him at full gallop catch mule by the foot which i indicated one day he lassoed by the fore leg wild cow which had joined my milch kine on the prairie hurled it to the ground and so bound its four feet together that we dragged it along to the enclosure where my cows passed the night then we fastened it up to an old tree and on the next morni ng antonio leaped on its back cut away the rope round its head and galloped off into the prair ie where the cow leapt about if mad at last after lengthened contest she threw herself on the ground but antonio stood by her side gave her laughingly cut with his whip and the awfully terriﬁed creature galloped away to the forest between the fort and the mountain spring there were always great number of wild horses especially in the vicinity of considerable elevation on the prairie whose highest point was covered with small very thick wood where white stallion resided with his harem owing to his beauty and noble blood the indians revered this animal with superstitious fear the hunters had tried years in vain to capture him and the bards of america had raised him to immortality in their ballads and narrations very numerous are the wondrous tales which spread at that day about the noble animal over the continent of america and even distant europe he was described in them the star of the prairie the light of the steppe or the white spirit of the desert while his titles varied so the statements to the position of his kingdom varied equally but all these were merely traditions of the hunters of the far west the existence of the horse was still half fabulous and i belie ve that i am the only man capable of saying anything on the subject from personal observation i have seen and admired this horse countless number of times my hunts so frequently passed in his region and quite often i have yearned to possess and revolved the means to get him into my power this was one of the reasons why i took antonio into my service the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https him alone i had prospect of attaining my wish i have frequently crawled up to the animal miles through the tall grass with the utmost exertions and lain down on small mound near him with the resolution of creasing him the hunters call is to say sending ball through the skin of horse neck upon which it falls if struck dead and you have time to hobble it before it recovers but when i raised the riﬂe on the noble creature and had my ﬁnger on the trigger it seemed to to be murder and i could never make up my mind to ﬁre i have often ridden up to him and so soon he noticed he came toward proudly raising his graceful head in the air with his white silky tail erect and with coat white and tender the ﬁnest alabaster or the plumage of the silver heron with whose ﬂight i have often seen him compete he frequently came within ﬁfty yards of looking round pretty often at his ﬂying harem then stopped and snorted through his dilated purple nostrils then he trotted round and would ﬂy like an arrow over the grass to his friends at such pace that rider in the world would have made the attempt to catch him up in the past winter i went to his domain with the intention of capturing one of his children and gave one of my men who accompan ied my riﬂe and revolver in order to make myself light possible i had got great distance from the troop ere the stallion noticed and when the others ﬂed he usual trotted toward i gave czar his head and galloped towards him the wild stallion reared then turned and dashed after his troop and past it in order to assume the leadership at the end of ﬁve miles i caught up the troop again which consisted of about ﬁfty head and selected an mare with black mane and tail which appeared to be between two and old had i possessed any great skill in using the lasso i was near enough to the mare to noose her but it was i could only take advantage of my horse greater endurance and remained close behind the troop up hill and down dale while the stallion ﬂew from one side to the other if encouraging his relatives to persevere and this race was merely play to him the animals became covered with foam their breath ing grew gradually shorter and several left the ranks on either side in order to seek safety in an altered direction at last only four old mares and the followed the stallion who yet displayed signs of fatigue when suddenly the grey turned off into hollow fell into walk and at last stopped so that i could ride up and throw the lasso over her head she was so exhausted that she could hardly breathe and stood motion less while the perspiration ran down her in torrents it was nearly quarter of an hour ere she so far recovered to be able to struggle against the fetters laid on her the noose round her neck tightened she fell to the ground trembling all over and i leapt from my horse to open the noose before she was quite throttled my companion now came up hobbled his own horse and czar and helped to convince the mare by repeated strangulation that she must yield to her captivity we made halter out of second lasso while still keeping the noose round her neck and i dragged her after my horse while my companion urged her on we thus reached home in the evening and in few weeks the mare was so tame that she could be treated precisely like my other horses she was handsomely built displayed all the signs of arab blood and became one of my best horses i said the possibility of capturing this pride of the western the reason of my engaging antonio and we at once set about our preparations to carry out the task i owned mare fancy who belonged to the best blood that ever ran on american soil her sire was the renowned waggoner who was never beaten in speed either north or south and fourteen years won all the great stakes at american races her dam blossom was an english thoroughbred and had been imported to the united states from england she won all the stakes she was entered in the southern states and was purchased by one of the ﬁrst breeders very large sum that he might become owner of her noble progeny fancy then regards breed was ﬁne and noble any horse that ever trod an american course and defeated all her rivals until i purchased her i bought her old when i bade farewell to civilization and took her with into the desert where i frequently rode her when i went out into the prairie with greyhounds to hunt deer or kill wolves on my ordinary hunting trips however she could not take the place of czar or the she was not so attached to by constant riding or so trained and familiar with thousand dangers they were the mare was now treated with very great attention both regards food and cleanliness and exercise she had more grass and the corn given her was previously sifted she was ridden every morning by antonio and the distance she had to gallop was daily increased then she was led about half an hour and when brought back to her stall rubbed down till she the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https dry and cool toward evening she was taken out again half an hour walk and before she went to rest had douche or swim in the river in fortnight she hardly turned hair after galloping several miles she had grown thinner but her ﬂesh was ﬁrmer and her hair so ﬁne that every vein could be traced under the skin in the meanwhile antonio had been practising with the lasso and had horribly tormented my mules with this disagreeable instrument the preparations lasted three weeks after which on cool morning we left the fort antonio riding mule and leading fancy one of my colonists on the and i on order to seek the stallion and if possible deprive him of liberty it was one of those rare in our the sky is covered with thin stratum of clouds which deprive it of its glorious azure and which though it does not conceal the sun breaks the power of its beams at the same time there was breeze so that the day was more like autumn than summer we rode down the river and soon saw the height emer ge from the prairie in whose vicinity the stallion usually had his our horses were very active czar coque tted by the side of his lady friend fancy in his most elegant prancing movements shook his bit and snorted through his moist nostrils while turning his dark large eyes toward the lady fancy conscious of her noble breed walked delicately along and carefully selected the footpaths while still some distance off i noticed to the side of the wood on the knoll dark patch which i recognised through my glass horses but could not make certain whether it was our stallion family we approached slowly and from every new height distinguished more clearly the shape of the animals i had doubt about it being the troop we were in search of although i could not yet notice the stallion broad valley still lay between us when we halted and i saw through my glass the creature rise from the grass and look across at us while many horses of the troop still lay on the ground around him we rode down into the valley the stallion stood motionless and gazed at us but when we reached the bottom he suddenly trotted about among his troop all the horses lying on the grass leapt up looked at us formed into body and dashed at gallop over the heights antonio now sprang into fancy saddle gave his mule to our companion took the lasso in his right hand and only waited my signal to give his horse her head the stallion came toward us at swinging trot while we moved forward at fast pace and bent low over our horses necks ﬁner picture could not be painted he carried his small head high long white locks ﬂoated over his broad forehead and his long mane danced up and down at every step while he raised his tail straight out and its long curling hairs ﬂuttered in the breeze his broad back glistened if carved out of carrara marble and his powerful shoulders and thighs were supported on graceful little feet i rode behind antonio the stallion was not ﬁfty yards from us when i shouted to the mexican forward and fancy ﬂew at such pace toward the stallion that she came within ﬁve yards of him ere he recovered from his terror the moment his fate to be decided had arrived he turned round and made an enormous leap ahead that showed the ﬂat of his hind hoofs while he held his head aside and looked back after his pursuer the lasso ﬂew through the air the noose fell over the stallion head but it hung on one side of his muzzle and the next instant the lasso was trailing on the ground behind fancy the stallion seemed to know that it was fetter which had touched him he shot away from the man like lightning antonio coiled up the lasso again and followed him over hill and vale over grass and boulders at full gallop just the tornado darts from the mountain into the plain czar was beside himself at the idea of being last but i purposely held him back partly not to excite the mare partly to save his strength there was still hope that the stallion living he did on grass would not keep his wind so long our horses and though he was now several hundred yards ahead we might be able to catch him up up to this point however we had not gained an inch upon him and our horses were covered with foam though both still in good wind we had been following the stallion about two hours when he turned off to the mountains and ﬂew up them with undiminished speed the ground now became very stony and unsafe but he seemed to be much at home on it on the soft he had just left he reached the summit between two steep mountains and disappeared from our sight behind them we dashed past the spot where we had seen him last but the noble creature had reached the steep wall on the other side of the valley when we dashed down into it i saw plainly that he had difﬁculty in keeping at gallop on this steep incline we gained deal of ground down hill and through the grassy valley and reached the wall before the the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https at the top of it full of hope i could longer remain in the background digging both spurs into czar i ﬂew on past fancy and reached the summit to ﬁnd the stallion trotting scarce ﬁfty yards ahead of fancy was close behind and i shouted to antonio to follow but my cry seemed to have poured fresh strength through the brave fugitive veins he dashed down into the valley leaving behind the white foam with which he was covered at every bound he made on the rocky ground once again i drew nearer and was only forty yards from him when i saw ahead of us yawning cañon out of which the gigantic dry arms of dead cypresses emer ged here the stallion must turn back and fall our prey while ascending the hill again but he went straight towards the was not possible he could not leap it i remained behind him and in my terror the noble creature life held my breath one more bound and he reached the cañon and with the strength of lion and that desperation which only the threatened loss of liberty can arouse he drew himself together and leapt high in the air across the gap which was more than forty feet wide i turned czar round toward the hill and kept my eyes away from the fearful sight so that i might not see the end of the tragedy but antonio uttered cry and i heard the word over i looked round and saw the stallion rising on his hind legs upon the opposite deeper bank and after glance at us he trotted off quite sound down the ravine and disappeared behind the nearest rock we stopped leapt from our horses and looked at each other long time in silence then i solemnly vowed never to make another attempt to deprive this princely anima l of liberty our horses were in very excited condition the water poured down them in streams and the play of their lungs was so violent that they tottered on their legs we let them draw breath little and then led them slowly back to the mountain springs where we intended to give them rest ere we returned home in the afternoon we reached the spot excessively fatigued and found there our comrade who greeted us with that was pity and had already spread our dinner on we stopped here till the evening and then started the fort which we reached late at night several days after this chase i could not shake off the excitement which had overpowered and even now i feel cold shudder when i think of the chasm and see the noble stallion the pride of the prairie hovering over it i had now given up once all all thoughts of capturing him but i should have felt sorry had he at once left my dangerous neighbourhood because his presence always caused great pleasure and i might have an opportunity of getting hold of some of his offspring i sought him in vain during my hunting excursions the whole of the summer and it was not till autumn when the vegetation probably began to fail in the mountains that he returned to my great delight to his old station but whenever i approached him he did not trot towards but always took to ﬂight soon he noticed my the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https the project gutenberg ebook of the

monotonous events and results still not lose their charm the man who feels true passion the chase otherwise how could veteran sportsman who in his time has shot so many thousand partridges still feel pleasure whenever he brings one down and always ﬁnd something new something peculiar in the fact how much greater and more permanent is this attraction in sports where thousand dangers offer themselves to the hunter is the case in hunting the larger animals of prey i gratefully saluted every new day the offerer of fresh joys disregarding difﬁculties and fatigue i constantly seized my good riﬂe again and merrily followed the same routes the summer was at an end and colder nights set in on an autumn morning i was riding through the prairie about ﬁve miles from the fort the grass was very high and had been perfectly dried up by the burning summer sun while the newly springing up grass grew splendidly in the shadow of the old i had reached bottom which was covered with forest of sunﬂowers which raised their golden disks high above my head and whose long stems were girdled with bright varied creepers i had not left this gleaming forest of ﬂowers far behind when very large deer got up from the grass just before arched its back and then lay down again if it had not seen while i noticed several old deer lying about in the grass czar at once drooped his head i raised the riﬂe to my shoulder i shot the deer but little too far behind it darted ahead and trusty looked up at so imploringly while showing the tip of his tongue that i could not refuse him leave to follow the deer i gave him sign and he shot through the grass along the track i loaded my riﬂe while keeping my eye on the deer which disappeared great distance off in small clump of low elms i had just put on the cap when i heard trusty deep bass i felt certain it was not the deer he was barking at he would have made but slight ceremony in that case so i gave czar his head and in few minutes reached the thicket i leapt down ran in stooping posture under the pendant elms and saw trusty lying on the ground defending himself with widely opened jaws against tremendous panther which was leaping over him and every time it came down lacerated the dog back with its tremendous hind claws trusty recognised the superi ority of this savage foe but defended himself well he could but he hardly saw arrive ere he leapt up with one bound pinned the panther by the throat and wrestled with it while the latter dug its terrible fore claws into either side of his collar at the ﬁrst moment i could not ﬁre fear of hitting the dog the panther saw and tried to get away but trusty clung to it like burr the animal now turned and my bullet passed through its heart and laid it lifeless trusty was terribly maltreated and the wounds on his back were of the width of ﬁnger and i believe that his strong collar had alone saved his life i sewed up his wounds washed them with water and then broke up the deer then i stripped the panther and packed the game on both sides of my saddle laid the skin over it and placed trusty on the top of all i told him that he must lie quiet and started homewards leading czar by the bridle trusty cut the most absurd face but all that did not stir and after he had ridden few hundred yards he helped with his hind legs when he slipped little on one side and i believe he would not have fallen off at gallop it was week ere i could draw the threads the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https the wound and during that period leo had to accompany when hunting at the end of fortnight my faithful comrade had so far recovered that he was able to accompany on short trips about this time i was riding when the sun was rather low up the river to the bank of small stream which joined the leone few miles above the fort and slowly wound between its level banks through the prairie it was here and there covered with bushes and groups of trees while every now and then its bed widened and formed small pools on this stream there were always great many turkeys and indeed the banks were visited by game of every description at all seasons i rode down the quiet bright stream and on coming out of thicket on to small clearing bordered at the other end by tall i saw ﬂock of turkeys stealing away from among the bushes on the bank i ordered trusty on who had his nose already to the ground snifﬁng he was among the fugitives like the wind they ran noisily and loudly pursued by trusty and settled on the trees i rode close up to the wood so long the turkeys see the dog springing about under them they are terriﬁed and look timidly at their pursuer stretching out their long neck in all directions instead of ﬂying away i dismounted shot an old cock on tree growing close to the water and saw it ﬂutter down i then turned with the other barrel to second which was standing on an oak farther in the thicket and fetched it down also i now looked round and missed trusty i had reply to my shout and the agitat ion in the pond aroused fear that he had leapt in and that an alligator such are always concealed in the deeper water of these streams had seized and dragged him down i waited good it grew dark and yet sign of poor trusty beside myself with grief at this irreparable loss i hung the turkey on the saddle and mounted my horse longer waiting would be of use at this moment i suddenly saw trusty at the head of the wood lying down to rest by the side of the gigantic cock turkey my delight knew bounds i galloped up the stream dashed through it and found my favourite on the other bank i leapt from my horse and took him in my arms whereon he gave vent to his joy by widely echoing howl and lashed his tail i hung the turkey which weighed over twenty pounds and which he had carried lord knows how far to my saddle and the faithful dog leaped up to my horse and barked in the utmost delight we proceeded homeward we were busily engaged week in making some machinery on the river by which to employ the water power in turning mill to grind the maize raft was fastened to the bank roller was placed on it from one end of which rather large wheel hung down into the water while the mill was fastened to the other whose hopper we enlar ged so that we might not have to put in maize so frequently it worked famously and we all rejoiced at successful operation which saved us fatiguing job owing to this i had not gone out much and we were all longing good fresh meat there were good many buffaloes in the very neighbourhood i resolved to hunt them on the morning after our mill was ﬁnished one of my men had seen large herds during the day on the prairie across the river the morning arrived but with it sprang up very violent westerly wind and few light straggling clouds proved that it would not sink in such hurry in doubt whether to ride out or wait another day my men persuaded to the forme r course the chase would probably be soon over hence i rode off but left trusty at home on these prairies the dry grass was extraordinarily high and it would tire him too much to force his way through it especially if we had to go quickly i was soon across in the wood where though the wind did not meet still it shook the tall trees so terribly that the dry wood constantly whizzed round my head i reached the prairie on the other side of the forest and saw several herds of buf falo in the distance binding my hat ﬁrmly under my chin i rode through the tall grass in northern direction toward them the storm grew more violent and laid the grass so ﬂat on the ground that i could not think of putting my horse beyond walk in any other direction than with the wind when the wind is blowing ﬁercely all game is usually more cautious than in calm weather it has to make up by the sight what it loses in smell the buffaloes noticed and my horse which was brilliantly illumined with the sun long distance off and took to ﬂight i turned toward another herd but with the same result and saw at last that in this way i should not get within shot after several hours of useless exertion i turned to the east toward spot on which some scattered oaks grew here i fancied it would be easier to approach the game the distance to the ﬁrst hill was about ﬁve miles and i saw through my glass at the elevations behind great number of buffaloes which however seemed to be in the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https of excitement my horse found it hard walking owing to the dry grass in which czar was compelled to part the sharp tangled stalks at every step i looked constantly toward the highland and remarked while the storm howled past my ears that the sky was growing obscured and that the sunshine was not so bright it had been few moments previously i looked around the heavens appeared to be veiled by grey mist and grew darker behind and on the edge of the prairie were perfectly black i felt cold shudder i knew the fearful element which had become allied with the storm and would roar over the plain scattering ruin around the prairie was on ﬁre it is true that i could not yet see the ﬁre but the black smoke clouds rose higher and higher on the horizon and the storm soon bore them past over the last blue patch of sky only one chance of escape remained i must reach knoll where the grass was shorter and without reﬂecting i gave czar the spurs and his head and ﬂew in rivalry of the over the grassy plains before i looked round the whole black expanse behind was gloomy and obscure if night were setting in and beneath the dark rising the deep red glowing ﬂames stretched out their long forks and cast their fearful light over the outlines of the cloudy columns of smoke the whole plain seemed to grow alive far eye could see it was covered with ﬂying herds of the denizens of the desert whose black forms were surrounded by ﬁery halo they pressed over the plain it was like the picture of the last judgment which my fancy had frequently depicted czar ran with long leaps through the tall grass looking neither to the right nor left with every moment it grew darker around and the reﬂection of the spreading sea of ﬂame more and more tinged my horse neck it was not his ordinary strength that urged the horse to reach the knoll but the force which desperation imparts to men and animals but soon wears them out and ends in utter exhaustion the sharp spurs and the thunder behind him urged my horse constantly on at mad speed but i felt his bound gradually lose its lightness and force i was not far from the hill in front of once more the spurs and my shrill and i ﬂew up the knoll and hobbled my trembling snorting horse on the bare which was covered with pebbles and thin patches of grass i ran back to the tall grass with lucifer in my hand lit it and in an instant the ﬂames rose struggling wildly against the storm and darted round my hill till they joined on its eastern side and dashed along like an avalanche with the howling storm i now looked back the ﬁrst time holding my brave horse by the bridle at the fearfully animated plain and watched the dark living forms hurrying past on either side of the knoll the whole animal world seemed assembled here and to be exerting their last strength in escaping death by ﬁre on both sides beneath thundered past in wild confusion herd after faloes horses deer and antelopes were pressed together and betwe en them rushed bears tigers panthers and wolves one after the other with their faces averted from the glow which the storm blew with thick black cloud of ashes over the land dark black night now encompassed only pale reddish glare gleamed through the dense ashes while the hurricane developed its highest fury and blended its howling with the hollow thunder of the ﬂying masses of animals below the sea of ﬁre was scarce half mile from when the ashes passed over my head and granted full look at it the ﬂames right and left far eye could see lay obliquely over the ground and stretched out their quiverin g tongues at least ﬁfty feet over the grass they darted forward with frightful rapidity and caught up countless animals ﬂying before them whose wearied limbs could longer carry them along quickly enough three old buffaloes collected their last strength to reach my knoll but at the foot of it the ﬂames closed over them i saw them rear fall back and disappear the heat was stiﬂing i and my horse who trembling all over yielded to his our backs to it and the stream of ﬁre passed us on both sides crackling and hissing gradually daylight returned and the sky became blue over my head thousands of large and small predaceous birds followed the ﬂames and fell now and then in them on all sides lay the black carcases of the countless victims which this prairie ﬁre had destroyed and many animals struggling with death were rolling in their agony on the plain czar and i were completely covered with ashes i now mounted my horse to get away quickly possible from this scene of destruction and death and reach the green forests of the leone by the straigh test line i rode down to the three buffaloes two of which were not dead and strove to rise but fell back powerless on the earth it was fearful sight offered by these burned monsters and their frightened snapping air and blind rolling of their heads induced to put an end to the the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https the poor tortured creatures i put bullet through each of their ﬂat foreheads and after reloading i rode in southern direction towards the leone i saw many animals still wrestling with death on both sides of the road and might have expended the whole of my ammunition in trying to help them out of their agony most of the burnt animals were buffaloes and deer but i also saw bear and horse and number of wolves lying lifeless on the ground my road over the black bare burnt ﬁelds of desolation was tiring and my horse was so worn out that i frequently dismounted and led him although the wind was longer so violent it brought with it quantity of ﬁne ashes and rendered both seeing and breathing difﬁcult i frequently came across birds of prey whose wings only displayed the bare quills the feathers being burnt off they sate helpless and wretched on the ground and tried in vain to rise into the air when i approached them these birds regularly follow the prairie ﬁres in large numbers in order to eat its countless small denizens after the ﬁre has passed over them and either rendered them helpless or killed them they looked at in terror with their large rolling eyes spread out the quills of their wings and uttered complaining cry i went past them i could not help them about mile from the wood on the leone i saw to my great surprise on my right hand very large deer and horse walking together across the plain to the wood they tottered along slowly side by side and seemed not to notice at all i rode up to them i fancied they had been blinded by the ﬁre but it was not so they now stopped and gazed at with their bright eyes if imploring not to prevent them from reaching the wood both were slightly scorched though the horse had lost mane and tail they appeared to have suffered more from excessive exertion and to be yearning the water of the leone i could easily have killed the deer but i pitied the creature and besides did not care to eat its hunted ﬂesh or put further load on czar hence i quitted the poor creatures and reached the wood which is not very broad here and soon after the river where czar refreshed himself long time in the cool waters annually nearly all the western prairies are burnt by the indians towards spring when they leave the south and go north to hunt they ﬁre the old grass so that when they return in autumn they may ﬁnd on these extensive plains fresh food their large troops of horses and mules they have however i fancy another motive if these plains were not singed with ﬁre perfectly different vegetation would arise on them within few years trees and bushes would rapidly grow up and convert the prairies into an impenetrable chapparal or forest which would be very troublesome to the horse indians in their hunts and journeyings in this way however ﬁre destroys every growth but that of grass if sapling springs up in spring from seed borne thither by the wind or by animals it is burnt down in autumn prairie ﬁres are generally dangerous neither to men nor beasts the ﬁre with an ordinary wind advances very slowly and over limited region if you arrive at very tall grass where the ﬁre woul d kill you have always time to get away from it and when the grass is not unusually high you can always ﬁnd spot to leap over the ﬂames if the storm is accompanied by rain the grass does not burn at all hence only hurricane with clear sky is not rare among us in autumn produces in alliance with the ﬁre such destruction among the occupants of the steppe it was evening when i reached home tired and without booty my people had seen by the smoke which covered the sky over them that the prairie was on ﬁre and they were very anxious about on account of the violent storm i soon sought my bed and slept till the sun rose czar would not get up when i went into his stall while my other horses and mules with the exception of fancy and the r who stood in the large enclosure round the fort had been grazing some time outside fastened to their long lassos i made czar rise led him down to the river where i gave him good swim and then led him back to the rich grass where however he soon lay down again in the shade of an elm the day was ﬁne and perfectly calm and we had fresh meat i determined to procure some without tiring myself excessively the prairie hens had already collected in large coveys and i had lately seen very many of these pretty birds in the neighbourhood of the fort hence i resolved to try my fortune with them saddled the took my shot gun and rode out with tony spaniel these hens are very like our in size shape and manner of life save that they have golden red plumage and the cocks are ornamented with yellow and black collar like the golden pheasant they are extraordinarily shy and ﬂy off in straight line when approached the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https follow them they sit closer and after being put up few times they settle down separately in the tall grass where they hide themselves till the dog puts them up with its nose i had not ridden very far when covey of about ﬁfty got up before my dog and settled again about half mile farther on the prairie i rode up to them leapt from my horse followed the dog and again the covey got up at long distance i ﬁred both barrels among them but was too far off to hurt them much with my rather small shot they ﬂew some distance and i saw them settle on so i reloaded and rode slowly towards it when the dog stood i leapt off went up to it and ordered it on the hens rose and i brought down seven of them with my two barrels while i looked after the rest and saw them settle separately not far from i now hobbled my horse and sought the hens concealed in the grass and in half an hour shot some twenty of them this sport affords much pleasure through the ease with which it is performed and the very delicate game most amply rewards the sportsman the slight trouble i was home again by noon when we had some of the birds dinner number of the others were hung up in the dairy to keep fresh while the rest were cut in pieces boiled in water with laurel leaves spice and isinglass vinegar poured over them and the whole set to cool in large earthenware pot in which the liquid soon becomes jelly game preserved in this way remains several weeks good and tasty the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https xiii the ware indian ne day after dinner when we had drunk coffee my sentry shouted that party of indians were coming up the river and i perceived through my telescope that they must belong to one of the civilized tribes they were not armed with lances and bows and arrows but with ﬁrearms and wore clothes if we may call them such consisting of leathern breeches and jackets and coloured handkerchief wound round the head like turban there were ten indians who halted at the great gate of the palisade which enclosed my fort in large semicircle with both its ends joining the river they shouted captain and then gave to understand that they wished to speak with i went out accompanied by trusty with my large gun loaded with slugs on my arm and found that the men belonged to tribe of friendly delaware indians whose chief i knew and who had several times camped in the very neighbourhood and paid visit they told they had encamped several miles down the river where they had arrived on the last evening their chief had sent them to tell that the prairie ﬁre on the previous morning had been caused by the negligence of his men but that it had spread against their will and had not been purposely caused then they asked whether the chief would be allowed to visit and rode back to camp after i had appointed his visit the morrow the next morning at about seven the chief of the delawares duly rode up with three of his men they bound their horses by lassos to pickets which they drove into the ground carried their baggage into the fort and accepted my invitation to enter the house where our parlour and kitchen were delawares have always been on the most friendly terms with the united states government fought on their side against england in the war of liberation and have assumed number of customs from the whites they have their property district of land on the kansas where their villages are situated and their squaws children and old people carry on agriculture and cattle breeding while the men with some of the squaws hunt in the desert nine months of the year the delawares are generally the men tall and with expressive marked features aquiline noses large dark eyes long black hair and not very complexion the women are small but neat and pretty and in spite of their darker hue produce pleasing impression through their regular features dark curly hair and brilliant eyes they dress themselves with some degree of taste their clothes consist of ornamented with beads and the gayest calicoes which they obtain from the government trading posts by bartering peltry them after our guests had taken their places i lit pipe and handed it to the chief who after taking some twenty pulls at it passed it to his next man and so it went from hand to hand or rather from mouth to mouth till it returned to during this ceremony of the pipe of peace not word was spoken but the chief now broke the silence after pufﬁng out portion of the swallowed smoke in dense cloud from his lips and nostrils he told they were the best friends of the white men and would remain so and intended to stay some weeks in the neighbourhood the purpose of hunting i assured them that we entertained the same feelings toward them and that i intended to pay them return visit at their the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https this dinner was served up which they greatly enjoyed they behaved with great propriety at it were acquainted with the use of knives and forks and it could be seen by their conduct that they frequently came into contact with white men after dinner the chief imparted to that his people wished to have deal with and swap tanned deer and antelope skins powder lead and ﬂints i told him i should be delighted and should expect them in the afternoon one of them who called himself black tiger pleased remarkably he was young man of about eighteen tall thin with an open kindly face and displayed great animation and conversational powers an indian he spoke english very well and seemed much attached to which he repeatedly told and at last displayed more fully by expressing wish to remain with i took it joke laughed and told him that in that case i would build him house himself and give him everything he wished to have they then rode away after indicating the position of the sun when they intended to return in the afternoon the purpose of making the barter at about 4 some twenty delawares dismounted in front of the fort and displayed their wares on the prairie tribe prepares hides so ﬁnely this one and i was very glad to obtain number of them use by myself and my men we made our clothes out of them and were unable to prepare them so handsomely ourselves the exchange was soon arranged to mutual satisfaction although i had given but little powder lead ﬂints and pressed tobacco in proportion the chief was presented with small portion of the above articles is the custom on such occasions and then the whole party followed into the fort where i regaled them with cof fee and bread when they prepared to depart the chief told that one of his men black tiger would stop with i had offered to build him house and give him everything he required he would in return be very good friend to and he the chief would hear on his return in the following year whether he remained delaware i saw now that it was jest and replied that i would be good friend to him to all the delawares on parting i gave him the assurance that i would visit them next morning at their camp black tiger remained behind in great delight carried his saddle and pack into the fort placed his long riﬂe and hunting pouc h in the parlour and then came to begging i would build him the promised house i intimated to him that this would take some time but in the meanw hile i would give him handsome tent i fetched very large white and red striped marquee and asked him where i should put it up him he pointed out spot at the eastern end of the fence under an on the slope over the river and when i told him that i locked the fort gate at night he laughed and replied that in that case he would shut up his house too he was quite beside himself with joy when the handsome tent was up and the long red white and blue american pennant ﬂoated over it he now refused to have another house this one was much ﬁner than mine trench was dug round the tent to carry off the rain water and the ground inside was covered with some buffalo hides after which tiger carried in his baggage and weapons quite delighted with his house in order to delight him even more i hung upon the put in chair and gave my young friend gay coloured silk handkerchief with which he bound his ﬁne black hair on the right side of his head and let the end hang over his shoulder after supper my new guest went to his tent and when we closed the fort merry ﬁre was still blazing before it behind which he sat on his stool and smoked short pipe which i had also given him the next morning almost before sunrise i went to tiger and saw him turning some spits at the ﬁre on which he had placed the breast of turkey while by his side lay another young cock which he said he had fetched he had been hunting on the other side of the river to which he had crossed in my canoe an hour after he came to breakfast with and enjoyed it heartily especially the milk and bread then he went to his tent and slept till i called him to ride with to the camp of his tribe i had mounted czar and one of my men the when my young tiger rode up to us in full costume the lower part of his face from the corners of his mouth to the was painted pure red with vermilion from this black stripe ran to the eyes while the edges of the eyelids were again thickly daubed with vermilion his hair fastened with the silk handkerchief hung over his shoulders and in front of his chest he had hung from leathern thong the from his tent which completely covered it he glowed with pride and joy and was of opinion that his brothers in camp would stare when they saw him with these splendid the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https was mounted on magniﬁcent piebald with an enormous black mane and tail the saddle was of wood and home manufacture and from it hung two large wooden stirrups by leathern straps over the saddle lay shaggy buffalo hide under which the tomahawk fastened to the saddle bow and lasso peeped out the bridle was composed of leathern straps fastened under the horse jaw with slipknot and vermilion dyed strips of deerhide were plaited in the mane the long single riﬂe hung downwards over tiger left shoulder while he laid his powerful forearm on the stock small medicine bag of beaver skin hung on his right side and on the strap passing over his right shoulder number of strips of shaggy buffalo hide were fastened rest the riﬂe the young rider dress consisted of leathern breeches adorned on the sides with delicate fringe of the same material and fastened at top by strap to the short leathern petticoat that was gathered round his hips and decorated with very long fringe on his feet he had deerhide mocassins round his neck was collar of very large white beads very ﬁnely cut out of shells and round his arms was number of polished brass rings he sat his horse nobly and turned his ﬂashing black eyes in all directions we soon reached the delaware camp hobbled our horses in the grass close by and went up to the chief who was lying at his ﬁre in front of his great buffalo hide tent and being served with food by his two young squaws without rising he invited us to sit down by his side and smoke the pipe of peace with him while he silently gazed in admiration at black tiger the camp consisted of some forty tents of white buffalo hides erected under clumps of trees on the river bank and before which an equal number of ﬁres was burning from the trees around hung number of skins of every description stretched out to dry in the sun while men women and children lay round the ﬁre and were eating their dinner heap of dogs were running about the camp while some hundred horses and mules were grazing around we sat down on buffalo hide by the chief ﬁre and he at once told us about his journey which he had made in spring in the rocky mountains he wished to remain during the winter in the south and next spring pay visit to his home on the kansas he described in very animated way the hunts he had made there and the bloody ﬁghts with hostile tribes gave very attractive description of the mountains rivers and valleys of those parts and remarked with slightly jealous look that i occupied the best land i answered him that this land was free before to frien dly indians like the delawares the latter could sleep the more tranquilly because i only pursued the foes of my indian friends and had cast my bullets solely them this speech produced very good effect upon my red friend and with cordial laugh he took my hand in his two and shook it with an expression of the most hearty and sincere friendliness soon after he said few words to one of his squaws and one of his little ones about four years of age came out of the tent soon after dragging an enormous tanned exquisitely painted buffalo hide which he presented to while his father nodded kindly while we were sitting thus cosily together several of the indians in the other tents prepared to go hunting mounted their horses called their dogs and rode off while others got their ﬁshing tackle ready or sported with the girls at the ﬁre two young squaws went out in front of the camp followed by several youths and stood side by side to try their speed in running they were sixteen or seventeen years of age gracefully built and really pretty they only wore their leathern fringed petticoat couple of long red strips of leather round their hanging black hair with beads on their neck and brass rings round their pretty arms with their brilliant ﬁery eyes they waited dancing on their little feet laughing and teasing each other the signal to start and the two goddesses of the desert glided like lightning through the short grass scarce touching the ground with the tip of their feet while their long hair with the red streamers ﬂew out behind them far away on the prairie stood the tree which they touched almost simultaneously and they darted back with laugh that displayed their pearly teeth i involuntarily rose at the sight of these pretty creatures and was surprised at myself years had elapsed since female glance had melted the ice of my heart i looked long time at these graceful little savages they teased each other and bounded about with the most pleasing movements then i once more assured the chief of my friendship and rode back to the fort the young indian was already quite at home and always in good spirits i was thoroughly acquainted with the character of these men who had grown up in state of independence and knew that my only way of keeping him was by gradually accustoming him to the minor pleasures of civilized life while at the same time avoiding everything that might lessen his liberty such he enjoyed in the nomad ic life of his tribe eating played great part in coffee milk bread eggs cheese and butter were delicacies which he heartily enjoyed and he soon grew accustomed to them whene ver his hunting permitted it he was rarely absent from meals at times he disappeared struck his tent and we saw nothing of him several days the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https he stopped at home and hardly crossed the river to shoot turkey or deer it was an incalculable advantage to have trustworthy indian with any hostilities against affected him and consequently his tribe and would be avenged by the latter the delawares are the most respected among the savage western hordes they have better weapons and more weight with the united states govern ment than all the rest hence i regarded this chance enlistment very fortunate and was resolved to make every effort to retain my guest long i could among other amusements which i strove to procure him was chessplaying which he soon learnt and passionately loved he became so excited that he would spring up and dance about if mad and would frequently play far into the night if by chance any of my horses or mules got loose and bolted tiger was soon galloping after them and drove them home it was the same with my milch kine when they did not come to be milked at the regular hour in smoking meat plaiting lassos tanning hides he was very useful to and he very often accompanied on my hunting excursions when he proved pleasant companion and famous adjunct shooting with shot guns was something new to tiger and afforded him great amusement and the clouds of passenger pigeons had arrived to devour our abundant mast crop we frequently went across to the forest in the evening when the birds were settling sent our shot among them and brought down hundreds it is incredible in what countless numbers these pigeons ﬂy i remember on several occasions watching from the fort their ﬂight over the forest when they ﬂew in line from one end of the horizon to the other almost uninterrup tedly two hours in the woods where they settle to devour the mast in few weeks not an acorn is literally to be found and at the spots where they rest at night many trees not retain single leaf on their branches becau the latter are broken by the birds settling on them in masses in those parts of america where pig breeding is carried on extensively these birds are regarded plague they entirely eat up the mast in very short time the pigeons are very good eating but we who had such an abundance of large game only followed these smaller varieties fun and it is rarity to ﬁnd shot gun on the border our horses had enjoyed rather long rest when i one morning rode across the river with tiger to the northern prairies the purpose of procuring fresh meat we had been an hour under way when we reached stream which winds through the prairie to the leone and is densely overgrown on both banks with birch bushes the stream through its windings forms here almost an island it ﬂows past again only few yards from its own bed i saw from distance remarkably fat buffalo in the young fresh grass of this island and on the other side in the prairie herd of about four hundred of these animals i dismounted behind the birches and left tiger with the horses then i sprang through the stream and crawled on my stomach through the grass toward the buffalo trusty following exactly in the same way the buffalo continued to graze and did not seem to notice at all the sun burnt ﬁercely although the breeze was very fresh and i became frightfully hot on this march the buffalo was one of the largest bulls in the herd and seemed to have selected this luxuriant spot itself it frequently looked across to its friends and drove away with its huge fat tail and horns the ﬂies which on this day were most troublesome not far from it grew an old the only one on this round rather large meadow and very long strong but withered branch grew horizontally out of its trunk about four feet from the ground i was near enough to shoot with certai nty but the buffalo was turned from and i was obliged to wait till it moved before i could kill it i lay long time motionless with trusty behind whose head i pressed down to the ground at last the bull started round the ﬂies had probably given it too ﬁerce sting and exposed its whole enormous side to i aimed just behind the shoulder and soon i had ﬁred laid myself ﬂat on the ground the buffalo darted round several times looking its enemy but then tottered against the tree where it leant against the withered branch to keep itself from falling while it burst into fearful roar and rolled its enormous head i gave trusty nod and with few leaps he was in front of the buffalo and pinned it by the nose i had just reloaded when the bushes parted on the other side of the meadow at hundred points the whole herd of buffaloes dashed throu gh and galloped towards they had heard the complaints of their lord and trusty furious barking and hurried up to help their comrade i stood quite exposed and expected that on seeing they would take to ﬂight but they dashed on straight towards the foremost of the herd were only thirty paces from when i took out my white and waved it in the air the ranks now broke and the terriﬁ ed animals dashed past on the right and left upon which i sent two bullets after them which certainly went home but were carried away by the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https tiger at this moment came through the bushes with the horses and said to laughingly that if i had not had the handkerchief the herd would certainly have run over we went up to the shot buffalo while our horses grazed near us paunched it and then put up number of white rags we had brought the purpose and fastened to sticks and laid white cloth over it to keep off the carrion crows then we mounted our horses the purpose of riding home and fetching the meat in the mule cart we were in our saddles when herd of about 400 buffaloes appeared on rise in the prairie halted in long point and stared at us in amazement the distance was scarce 300 yards tiger looked at with smile and cried alligator creek while pointing to the herd i made him sign to ride on and we were soon galloping behind the ﬂying buffaloes which pressed close together and thundered on ahead of us in cloud of dust tiger clear huntin g yell urged the terriﬁed monsters to more rapid ﬂight and in ten minutes we approached swampy stream which crossed the prairie obliquely and which we had christened alligator creek from the number of those animals in it the banks were very steep and above twelve feet high the water almost dried up and the deep bed only contained black thick mud the dense mass hastened before us towards the banks of the river bed and rushed down into the swampy bottom with deafening roars and grunts buffalo after buffalo fell into the ravine till we pulled up on the bank above them and laughed at their confusion and the efforts with which they ascended the other bank all coated with mud i fancied that at least one half must break their necks but not one of them remained in the mud they forced their way to the other bank atop of each other and sprang apparently at least quite unhurt up it i had dismounted and shot fat cow which had borne calf this year and hence was very plump the cows only drop one calf every two years and this reason it is the more inexplicable that the number of these animals is not more rapidly reduced by the great destruction that takes place among them the cow followed the herd but short distance and then fell dead on the prairie we were obliged to go long way up the bank before we could ﬁnd low path by which to cross but soon reached the cow put up rags round it but left the paunching to my people we did not care to dirty ourselves with the mud that covered it we now rode the shortest way to the forest on the leone and again crossed the stream on which i had shot the bull about three miles below the spot where it lay we passed through the thick bushes out into the prairie but trusty did not follow us he trotted down the stream stopped every now and then looked up to and gave his deep bark i looked at him curiously i knew that he was on some track when all at once he disappeared in the bushes and stopped i gave czar whom the voice had rendered impatient his head and soon reached the bushes among which trusty was baying with revolver in my hand i turned czar into gap between the bushes when suddenly the shaggy head of furious buffalo rose above the bank within yard of my startled horse swerved and cleared the bushes by tremendous leap while the monster dashed past with roar and galloped across the prairie i soon got out of the bush however and went after it while tiger came to meet i was close behind the bull when tiger ﬂew past it and gave it bullet from his long riﬂe near the neck the buffalo followed the piebald with terrible fury dyeing the prairie with its blood when i darted past it and gave it bullet from my revolver behind the shoulder which lamed its left fore leg trusty now attacked it in the ﬂank and it stood at bay holding its head close to the ground with its nose between its fore feet and holding one of its short sharp horns against the dog the buffalo stood motionless with its tail erect while trusty sprang barking before it waiting the moment when it should raise its head but its hour had arrive i rode within twenty yards and shot it through the heart it fell lifeless it was one of the bulls i had wounded in the morning when they hurried to the assistance of their comrade feeling bad it had gone to the water to cool itself and trusty had followed its trail to the spot we put up rags round this one too and rode sharply to the fort whence i sent off two of my men with the cart and two mules accompanied by tiger they returned late at night and brought heavy load of meat home which we cut up and salted the next morning of the three hides they only brought the one shot ﬁrst which was employed in making very long lasso hunting occupied us pleasantly through the autumn and tiger grew more and more used to our mode of life it became rare him to remain away several days without our knowing what had become of him he also took greater pleasure in domestic jobs and applied himself to them more frequently than at the ﬁrst period of his stay with us he learned to milk the cows and readily helped in it he was so fond of milk well in making vinegar which he also the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https and which is made of the large wild grapes with which the prairie thickets are covered this purpose i had two large empty whisky casks fetched from the settlement and this year our vinegar turned out previously we had made it in smaller quantities of mulberries plums or honey which was not half so agreeable that made of grapes tiger was able to make butter and cheese and at pinch cook our table was now always well covered we had superabundance of the ﬁnest vegetables the potato crop had turned out very well and we had more especially an extraordinary quantity of sweet potatoes they are called this is tuber like the potato the plant itself consists of tendrils which spread ﬂat and thick over the soil and can be easily multiplied in spring the shoot bears in autumn an extraordinary number of tubers which are employed precisely like potatoes except that they have much more agreeable ﬂavour resembling the chestnut small most proliﬁc bean which we plant between the maize and which spreads over the whole ﬁeld had produced us large stock while the less hardy vegetables such lettuce spinach and cabbage covered the garden all the winter through the winter in this region is very mild and may fairly be termed the pleasantest season of the year we have lasting rainy season although rain falls more frequently then than in the summer months but it rarely lasts longer than day and then the cloudless blue sky gleams pleasantly over us again frost is rare and triﬂing but sometimes it sets in towards morning and will last whole day if accompanied by wind blowing down from the northern rocky mountains these northers are usually called something terrible in the whole of the united states but in reality they not at all merit this reputation certainly the cold is felt much more among us than elsewhere because men accustomed to warm weather we rarely lay in stock of winter clothes the houses too are not calculated cold they are built very airily and lightly and have ﬁreplaces when the northers blow the people ﬂy to these ﬁres while the cattle seek bottoms and dense thickets where they conceal themselves i remember on splendidly warm forenoon the sky becoming overcast from the north and it began to blow and rain which caused the whole country to be covered with ice in short time if such storm assails traveller in his light summer dress he is certainly in an unpleasant position and if he is stranger it easily happens that he tells terrible story about it when he gets home these disagreeable storms from the north however are infrequent we have perhaps six or eight in winter and they rarely last longer than hours and are then driven away by very bright warm days the winter may bring cold does not begin till january frequently later hence we have very long delicio us autumn the days are longer oppressively hot and the nights become so cool that we are glad to snuggle under buffalo robe or woollen blanket this is the season when we recover from the exhausting continuous summer heat and the body regains its ener gy the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https xiv in the mount ains it was on bright healthy morning in november that i accompanied by tiger and trusty left the fort and rode down the river toward the rio grande mountains i had never made any excursions far beyond that river and even when hunting had rarely reached its banks it is enclosed on both sides by savage rocky mountains which neither man nor brute can easily traverse tiger had formerly been several times on the other side of the rio grande and told there was more game and more especially more bears there while rich valleys ran between the mountains hence i resolved to spend some weeks in those regions and provided myself this tour with provisions some buffalo robes and small tent which articles were carried by jack most excellent mule the animal followed my horse without being led and i may say that it could not be kept away from it except by force we had trouble with it but to saddle and load it in the morning and take off its burden again at night it would certainly stop now and then at fresh patch of grass and snatch few mouthfuls but then it galloped after us again and followed at our heels we rested at noon at the mountain springs which i had not visited some time and we were forced to cut an entrance into the little thicket it was completely overgrown they rewarded us on our arrival with some fat turkeys which were never absent there and whose delicate meat we enjoyed while our horses rested from their hot march over the open prairies about 3 we started again and rode in northern direction toward the foot of the moun tains tiger told that higher up river ran towards the rio grande with rather broad valley on either side and i believed that this stream must be turkey creek we crossed the leone toward evening at shallow spot well known to this spot at which i had often rested surprises the traveller coming from the open prairie with very pleasant scene bordered on both sides by the grandest vegetation magnolias and enormous oaks covered with the most splendid creepers the foaming silvery stream dashes between scattered masses of rock with such roar that visitors can hardly understand each other the atmosphere beneath these dense masses of foliage is cool and constantly fanned by the breeze produced by the violent motion of the current it breaks on the rocks and falls over them in countless small cascades when we arrived the scene was enlivened by silver herons and ﬂamingos some soaring high in air others standing on the dry rocks jutting out of the water and forming striking contrast with their white and green plumage against the dark green background we cautiously guided our horses between the rocks while jack followed close behind and the birds raised hoarse croak of surprise over our heads the primeval forest on the other side of the stream is broad and day had yielded the supremacy to night we moved along the buffalo path which was only at intervals illumined by the moon i knew here nearly every step and we reached the prairie all right when we remounted and half an hour later reached the equally familiar sources of stream which falls into the leone little lower down it was favourite spot of mine where we took the load off our animals cheerful ﬁre soon blazed and threw its light upon them while they lay in the young grass aroun d us the moon had not set when we had ﬁnished supper and fell into refreshing sleep the eastern sky was already tinged with red when i woke and saw several spits with meat already put before the ﬁre the horses were grazing round our camp but i missed tiger whose weapons lay on his buffalo hide i went little way round the bushes and saw him on the open prairie on his knees with folded hands and uplifted face awaiting the appearance of the sun in order to offer the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https to it i heard him speaking softly to himself it sent its ﬁrst beams towards us and he continued his prayer till it had fully risen above the horizon then he rose and with pleasant smile came back to his seat at the ﬁre he then produced his small mirror and box of vermilion laid the former on his crossed knees and painted his face he supposed very grandly then he arranged his splendid hair with comb i had given him rubbed it with bear grease and tied it up with strips of red leather during breakfast tiger told about his last tour in the rocky mountains of the mountains covered with eternal snow the beautiful valleys containing famous pasturage his ﬁght with desperate grizzly bear which he killed and accompanied his words with the most animated gestures it is peculiarity of indians to enliven their remarks with signs and gestures which render it easy to understand what they say and tiger in spite of his knowledge of english had retained the sign language which had grown habitual to him i remarked that i felt great inclination to take trip there in the next spring and he was delighted at the prospect of being allowed to accompany it was late when we started and continued our journey in northern direction the prairies here grew narrower the woods closer connected and the country more uneven although we kept far we could from the mountains on our left we crossed small streams which either came down from the mountains and went to form the larger streams with which they ﬂowed through the hills to the rio grande or which had their sources in the eastern plateaus and pursued the same course the country was picturesque the small prairies beset by clusters of bushes and clumps of trees of the most varying shapes were covered with juicy fresh grass and quite new ﬂora here and there huge blocks rose out of it in whose crevices grew large yuccas and mimosas of different sorts cactuses and aloes which represented the southern world of plants on the left the hills rose over each other in terraces and indicated the course of the large river we had ridden the whole morning and not ﬁred shot at game although we had seen good deal our fresh meat was quite ﬁnished and i was just saying to tiger that it would soon be time to shoot something the dinner hour was at hand when i saw turkeys running in small scrubby patch ahead of us and made trusty sign to follow them in an instant he put them up but dense forest rose just before us they all but one entered its impenetrable foliage the latter an old cock rose straight in the air and settled on the top of very tall cypress which grew on the skirt of the forest and whose roots were washed by small spring it waved backwards and forwards on the thin branch if challenging the hunter who would dare to ﬁre at it while trusty leapt up at it and barked loudly tiger looked at laughingly pointed upwards and asked what you think i gave him nod to try his luck he sprang from the piebald took long aim ﬁred and the cock did not stir but continued to oscillate and look down at trusty i felt an itch to try my skill i sprang from my horse raised my riﬂe and with the detonation the haughty bird opened its wings the last time fell like ball and smote the ground heavily tiger laughed and said that he would have brought it down too if it had not swung so on the bough it is curious fact that the indians armed with riﬂes and even the americans never think of ﬁring when the object is moving at all quickly although they have so many opportunities of practising it the chief motive may lie in the very long and heavy guns they carry which can not be moved so rapidly and lightly our riﬂes we could not have chosen better spot than this our rest our horses found the best grass the clearest spring water ﬂowed close past us and the virgin forest offered us its cool shade we therefore quickly unsaddled hobbled our horses and set to work cooking the turkey we unwillingly left this pleasant spot few hours later and were obliged to ride couple of miles up the forest before we found buffalo path wide enough us to pass through about an hour we rode through the leafy labyrinth ere we reached the open plain again on the other side here tiger rode up to again and talking and jesting we kept our horses at brisk amble while jack trotted after us suddenly i heard hugh from tiger lips and pointing to the ground before us he stopped and said that the buffalo dung on the path was quite fresh and the animals must be in the vicinity he galloped on and we soon reached narrow wood which ran through the prairie in nearly the same direction we were following and through whose centre ran small stream we had scarcely reached this wood ere tiger leapt from his horse pointed to the ground before us then pointed to his ears and made motion with his hands if breaking stick he sprang away with the lightness of an antelope scarce touching the ground with his toes and never treading on branch which might produce sound then he suddenly stopped lowered his the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https and listened some minutes after which he shot ahead again at such pace that i could hardly keep up with him he presently lay down on the ground and made sign with his hand that the buffaloes were entering the water just under us and were going across to the prairie in few minutes he leapt up again signed to to follow him and ﬂew down the wood through the stream and up the other bank where we arrived behind the last bush on the prairie just the buffaloes had only gone few yards along it and two of them were standing on the other side of the bush and staring intently at us we both had our riﬂes raised and i gave tiger nod to ﬁre ﬁrst i kept the sight between the eyes of the buffalo stand ing on the right and the ﬂame poured from tiger gun i ﬁred and ran round the bush to be able to use the other barrel but it was unnecessary the two gigantic animals were rolling on the ground at the last gasp tiger buffalo was shot through the heart and the bullet had smashed the skull of mine we hurried to our horses and packed the best bits of our ample booty on faithful jack back the sun was not very high above the mountains but it was too early to spend the night here our cattle had rested little and so we merely allowed them to drink ﬁlled our own bottles and rode merrily on in northern cours tiger was remarkably colloquial on this evening and the time slipped away and we scarce noticed that the night had spread its dark wings over the road which now wound between conical barren hills i remarked to my comrade that we should have hard camp which he denied and moving his hand across long chain of hills in front of us he said that we should sleep softly on the other side of it while saying this he laid his cheek on his hand and closed his eyes it was late when we reached this chain of hills the mountain side was very steep although we selected the lowest spot to cross we were obliged to dismount and lead our horses our foothold grew more and more uncertain on the loose pebbles and our horses too were obliged to exert themselves in clambering over the many large stones with which the ravine was covered while we were clambering on in this way trusty suddenly growled trotted few yards past us with bristling hair and then barked into the depths behind us tiger said jaguar was following us and put his riﬂe under his arm we at length reached the top where we let our animals breathe and looked back long time at the valley behind us but could see nothing of our pursuer although trusty continued to growl we marched along the top which soon sloped down and allowed us glance at the valley on the other side the slope was not so steep the one by which we ascended the valley before us looked gloomy with its black shadows and its depths were covered with white strip of fog while the opposite mountain side illumined by the moon glistened with indistinct bluish tones we descended the hill and in an hour reached the grassy damp bottom where we remounted and shortly after pulled up on the bank of large river whose other side was bordered by thick wood here we unloaded our cattle and soon sank into the most tranquil sleep leaving to faithful trusty the care of our safety his powerful voice soon awoke us however and made us clutch our riﬂes we called him back stirred up our ﬁre and we could see nothing of foe we fell asleep again the faithful dog awoke us again several times but when morning broke he lay rolled up by the ﬁre and was fetching up the rest he had lost in the night we were up at an early hour and tiger found in the dewy grass not far from our camp the trail of very large jaguar which had prowled round it during the night and disquieted trusty we bathed in the deep clear river then breakfasted and set out again the river ﬂowed westward through rather wide vale bounded on the north by wood on our side by rich prairies while range of bald conical shaped lime hills ran along either side judging from its distance from the leone this river could only be turkey creek on whose banks i had spent that stormy night with the unhappy botanist we followed its windings westward several hours crossing number of small streams which came down from the ravines the valley was here considerably broader than at the spot where we passe d the night but in front of us the hills approached each other again then the river turned little westward and afforded prospect between the rocks of the western cedar banks of the rio grande the prairie over which we rode led us to the banks of this large river which runs at depth of at least ﬁfty feet between the widest masses of rock at this time it contained very little water it does not begin to swell to any extent till january and we at once made preparations to cross it we selected from the quantity of dry driftwood with which the steep bank was the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https of light cedar bound them together small raft and anchored it to great tree trunk on the bank we laid our provisions and clothes upon it and tiger leapt in the very rapid stream holding the loose end of the lasso between his teeth and swam to an island covered with willows which lay about ﬁfty yards from our bank when he had swam so far to haul the lasso taut i thrust the raft off and it rapidly followed the current behind t iger who however guided it to this island and landed about two hundred yards lower down then he went to the end of the island dragging the raft after him and pulled it into the calmer water on the other side then he threw the lasso over his shoulders and easily pulled the raft to the other bank where he fastened it to some heav y driftwood he was soon back by my side i hung my holsters over my shoulders took riﬂe in hand and we ﬂew on our horses down the stream obliquely till we reached the island which we soon crossed and guided our horses into the quieter water on the other side we landed on the western bank of the river at the moment when jack who had reached the island uttered frightful bray of delight while looking over at the horses then he cautiously entered the river again and soon trotted up to his comrades who enjoyed the scanty grass that grew on the bank while we were dressing it was noon and high time to eat something we lit ﬁre little higher up the hills under leafy plane and prepared our meal while i reclined on my buffalo robe and gazed in delight at the wildly romantic scene that was expanded before the very deep river bed cut in limestone strata is very wide higher up so that the river when swollen in spring by the mountain torrents quite ﬁlls it up and attains width of half mile on both sides of the bed rise grey masses of rock in the wildest shapes leaving yawning ravines between them through which the torrents ﬂow to the river the mountains on the eastern side are generally bare and bushes only grow in these narrow valleys out of which solitary cypress here and there raises its crown to heaven the western heights on the contrary are covered with dense cedar woods whose dark lustreless foliage added to the grey steep precipices imparts saddening and gloomy aspect to the scenery in face of us however opened between lofty rock gate the pleasant valley of turkey creek throu gh which we had come foaming and roaring it leaps over gigantic strata of stone into the deep bed of the rio grande while on its south side far up the valley the prairie glistens with its fresh verdure and on the north the dark shadows of colossal vir gin forest run along the mountain range we took leave of these banks short period and marched up steep ravine to the dark shade of the cedar woods which soon offered us their agreeable coolness the mountains here were of conical shape and so closely overgrown with not very tall cedars that we were compelled to dismount on our buffalo it had been used by the indians on their expeditions order to get along at all never in my life did i grow so tired of road it seemed if we rode round every hill and after we had ridden an hour and had prospect eastward second the wild rocky valley of the rio grande lay at our feet just if we had but just left it but perfectly new and beautiful ﬂora rewarded the monotonous slow ride in these shadows grew number of exquisite plants whose seeds i collected to transfer them to my home we had been marching three hours through these woods when the country became clearer the mountains formed into large masses and the valleys between grew wider it was twilight and we had i thought surmounted the last short but steep rise when czar suddenly darted back and jaguar appeared about thirty yards ahead gazed at moment lay down ﬂat on the grass and drew up its hind legs spring this did not take an instant and i had pointed my riﬂe over the neck of my rearing steed at my enemy when it made its ﬁrst leap at this moment i ﬁred but heard simultaneously the crack of another riﬂe behind czar turned round at my shot and almost leapt on tiger who was standing behind on foot and then darted down the hill i shouted to him to stop my horse and saw the jaguar appear on the top of the steep i sent my second bullet through its chest and it rolled down toward in the most awful fury i called trusty to and ﬁred couple of revolver shots into the gigantic body of my foe which ere long gave up the ghost with savage convulsions my ﬁrst bullet had passed through its left side but tiger had seriously hurt the spine behind the left shoulder tiger shot had certainly gained the victory it robbed the brute of its springi ng power and it caused him great delight when i acknowledged his victory and surrendered to him the ﬁne large skin which i bought of him on the same evening number of triﬂes to be delivered when we returned home it was rather dark when i lit large ﬁre and we set to work stripping off the ﬁne spotted skin of the royal beast it was very uncertain whether we should ﬁnd water we the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https the cattle and put on the coffee water to boil we soon had the jaguar huge skin off and hung it stretched on young cedar branches on tree close to the ﬁre to dry then we prepared supper drank coffee and ere long were asleep near our horses while trusty patrolled round camp splendid morning awoke us from our dreams and displayed to us the wild but beautiful scenery we had noticed on the previous evening we had camped at the entrance of plateau bordered on the east by the cedar hills sloping down to the rio grande while on the west chain of large mountains ran northward the plateau was abundantly covered with grass but its surface did not display the same monotony those lying to the east of the rio grande it was covered with patches of wood and here and there huge masses of rock arose we marched northward and the mountains to the west appeared to us too difﬁcult we soon crossed splendid small stream where we watered our horses and ﬁlled our ﬂasks three days we followed its course through this park at times over fresh green prairies at others through thick woods or cañons we met great many antelopes and deer but only saw few buffaloes at great distance among others tiger pointed out to buffalo on the western mountain side and said it was lying on the ground after repeated search i managed to discover small black dot in the direction indicated and when i called my glass to my help i really saw an old solitary buffalo lying there among the rocks and was astonished at the extraordinary sight of my young indian friend the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https xv the weicos n the third evening we approached the western mountain chain which bordered the northern end of the plain we were crossing our road slowly rose while we steered toward gap in the mountains where we hoped to ﬁnd an available path an hour our path was steep and vegetation had nearly entirely disappeared only few reeds were visible in the crevices between the rocks deep yawning gorges and cañons opened between the overhanging limestone strata round which we had to make fatiguing circuits while frequently we had hardly room to lead our horses along the precipices over deep abysses the sun was setting and the lofty mountain sides cast their broad shadows over the rocky depths it soon became dark but we pushed on still hoping to ﬁnd suitable spot camping we had almost reached the highest point when we saw gigantic red granite walls rising in front of us like fortress they hung long way over us and the deep abyss from which wildly scattered colossal blocks illumined by the parting sunbeams rose while on the other side of the gorge the mountains were heaped up against the dark purple evening sky our path was very narrow and strewn with small pebbles so that we were obliged to lead our horses with short rein all at once tiger shouted to to halt and immediately after i heard him utter pah in his indian language it was water he wished to indicate and he told he could hear the rustling of stream our path grew rather broader and ran into the granite masses on our left while on our right the slope was not so steep and sank into the ravine between few large blocks of stone we had scarce gone one hundred yards when the road before us proved to be blocked by scattered masses of stone between which stunted oaks and bushes grew while i found myself in short grass which czar greedily attacked i shouted to tiger that i could go farther and he led his piebald up to my side who with the never jack also went at the grass tiger was of opinion that it was famous spot the water was close at hand below us and disappeared among the rocks he soon returned dragging after him several dry branches while we broke up and lit ﬁre which soon lit up the imme diate neighbourhood the rocks on our left were deeply excavated and hung in large strata with broad cracks covering large tract of ground which bore at various points traces of ﬁres which must have been lit by indians who had camped here like ourselves we prepared our supper but had great difﬁculty in putting the spits up before the ﬁre tiger had not lit it on the grass but under the rocks while we were thus employed the moon rose slowly behind the mountain s and threw her ﬁrst pale rays into our wild valley gradually her light became more brilliant and the dark masses around us emer ged in their various shapes tiger now leapt up placed one of my revolvers in his belt took cedar brand and went down narrow path between the rocks carrying our two large gourds by strap over his shoulders i watched the ruddy dancing light of the torch which lit up at one moment the rocks at another the dark green foliage of the oaks it continually grew smaller till it appeared in the depths below like bright point it soon returned however and tiger appeared between the rocks with our bottles full of spring water so cold and clear that my lips had not tasted anything to equal it long time he told that below was small pool into which the springs ran buffaloes must have been standing there little while before and he therefore believed that we should be able to lead our cattle down to water by daylight i gave czar share of the refreshing draught we seemed to have entered the kingdom of owls their hoot was audible on all sides tiger listened awhile very attentively to these sounds but then lay down tranquillized on the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https hide saying that one of the sounds resembled the voice of weico but he had not signalled again or he tiger was mistaken the ﬁre was supplied with large logs and we then wrapped ourselves in our skins and slept till daybreak we blew up our ﬁres put on our horses bridles and led them down the hill side to water along path on which we now distinctly noticed fresh buffalo signs it was tiring road by which we at length reached the bottom where small basin ﬁlled the entire breadth of the gorge into which clear stream noisily poured the basin was washed out of the stony ground and we led our horse s into it after number of mocassin and rattlesnakes had taken to ﬂight with menacing hiss we then turned back to reach our camp again tiger led his piebald in front but stopped and said he felt much inclined to climb up the opposite wall of the gorge it was full of crevices in which doubtless bears were hybernating he also said he had heard from his people that the delawares always shot great number of bears at this spot though he had never visited it before himself i hence took his horse bridle and called czar to follow while jack completed the party and trusty trotted on ahead after fatiguing climb i again reached our camp where i hobbled the cattle in the grass and sat down to the ﬁre to get breakfast ready i had just ﬁnished and lit pipe when the crack of riﬂe reached from the opposite wall and i supposed that tiger had shot bear when few moments later second shot was ﬁred and the frightfully shrill sound of the indian echoed through the gorge there was doubt but that tiger had come into collision with hostile indians the yell rolled down the valley and ere long two shots were ﬁred in rapid succession i quickly threw our saddles and baggage behind large rocks and led the piebald some way down the slope while czar and jack followed then i fastened the cattle up to trees little off the path and sent my hunting cry across the gorge at the full pitch of my lungs tiger at once answered i ran down to the pond and up the opposite wall continually uttering my cry and receiving an answer trusty went little ahead to clear the way and then i climbed on from rock to rock until another shot was ﬁred and i heard tiger yell higher up the mountain i carefully noticed the direction whence the yell came and calling trusty to i ran forward rapidly though cautiously between the scattered boulders i was standing before small mound when trusty growled and sniffed i went up in stooping posture and hardly had reached the top when i saw tiger with his back turned to holding in one hand his riﬂe in the other the bleeding scalp of his murdered foe and gazing at the latter who lay outstretched in the grass without turning he told that the weico had almost sent him to his fathers but his heart trembled and hence he aimed badly tiger had seen his enemy ﬁrst and ﬁred soonest but missed and the other had not hit him either he ran tiger pursued him and both reloaded while running till the weico reached the spot where he now lay and the delaware sprang on the grass plot little higher up the weico ﬁred and missed again and tiger in response sent bullet through his loins though without being aware that he had hit him the weico disappeared in the grass and tiger too he fancied the other was reloading but when he had performed the same operation himself and saw nothing of his foe he crept to an adjacent rock which he mounted and saw the other in the grass reloading upon which he sent bullet through his heart and speedily scalped him tiger now took his conquered foe gun beads and armlets and made sign to return to the horses while he sprang from rock to rock with the lightness of deer we saddled and soon left our camp tiger said there were several weicos in the neighbourhood on the previous evening they had made each other signs with the owl hoot our road ran from here close to the precipice and some few hundred yards was very difﬁcult we were obliged to lead the horses and make them leap over severa l granite blocks while the grass grew to man height between the loose stones and we could not see where we stepped here however the road became better and led us in pretty valley through which stream wound while on both sides granite walls begirt it to height of at least three hundred feet trusty was some distance ahead all the time and was trotting along the bank when he suddenly barked and i saw something leaping through the grass on his left the piebald darted past at the same moment and tiger shouted panther i had inclination however to join in the hunt but merely cantered on saw the piebald leap several times through the bushes and little later heard tiger riﬂe crack but when i joined him he laughed and said that the panther had too many feet and pointed to thicket on the hills in which it had disappeared the valley here became very broad and we saw long distance off three buffaloes grazing under some and when we drew nearer tiger proposed to chase them in the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https close grass there was other way of getting within shot of them suddenly the buffaloes noticed us and ﬂed but tiger set his horse in gallop and stormed after them down the valley i was just able to see that he had caught them up when small blue cloud of smoke rose before him and i shortly after heard the crack of his riﬂe he disappeared with the ﬂying buffaloes on the prairie and i followed him at quick amble at the spot where i last saw my comrade thick bushes ran along both sides of the stream i went into them but was obliged to dismount in order to pass through the thicket crossing the wood i gave my which was answered close by and short distance farther on tiger came to meet and said that it was go with the buffaloes either he had hit one of them clumsily and not killed it the piebald was in frightful perspiration so tiger turned him round and we reached the skirt of the wood where we sat down in the cool shade of the lofty trees while our cattle freed from their loads grazed around us the stream wound out of the forest close by i had gone to it to ﬁll my bottle when i noticed number of bees on the bank which however did not ﬂy into the wood but into the prairie before us i called up tiger who seated himself by my side and we accurately observed their course by the compass and saw that they all ﬂew to an old which grew in the grass about thousand yards from us we went up to the tree and found that the bees went to very large bough which had an opening at the top we fetched our weapons and axes and brought out our cattle under the plane where i also ordered trusty to lie down then we went up to the tree whose stem was at least eight feet in diameter threw lasso over the lowest branch clambered up it and went to the branch containing the bees it was at least foot and in thickness and we had to work with our small axes nearly an hour before it gave way and fell with crash to the ground whereon the startled bees rose like pillar of smoke and swarmed off toward the forest we soon went down the lasso and began eating the clear honey which ﬂowed out of the broken branch we ate and took pieces of the largest combs to our camp where we laid them in the shade europeans will be surprised and ask how it is possible to take the honey from the irritated bees without being stung to death the bees in this country however are not so spiteful in the old world it is only when you are near ﬁlled and strike at the bees with branch or cloth that you are attacked and pursued by them but if you go quickly up to the honey and are careful not to touch any bees you are never stung the honey of these wild bees is far sweeter and more toothsome than that in england it is very spicy but at times so impregnated with pepper that much of it can not be eaten i have often felled whos honey was so clear that it could not be distinguished from glass of water put by its side if you are near home when you cut down you drive the creatures which have collected close by in swarm round their queen into bag take them home and shake them out into hollowed tree nail board at top and bottom cut hole in the lower board and place it at spot protected from the north wind the bees at once set to work continuing it winter and summer and in short time the hive is ﬁlled with honey and wax we only regretted that we had vessel in which we could take supply of this exquisite honey with us we had eaten heartily of it when we set out about 3 and continued our journey down the stream the sun was sinking behind the mountains on our left when we again struck the stream which we had left in pursuing northern course and resolved to pass the night here the valley was narrow to the west and to the east the prairie rose towards the mountains and some old oaks grew on it we had unsaddled hobbled our horses and lit ﬁre when tiger took his riﬂe and went towards the western hills to see whether he could procure any fresh game our stock was entirely exhausted the sun had set the time hung heavy at the ﬁre so i rose took my riﬂe and walked slowly down the stream while trusty ran ahead in the scrub i had hardly gone hundred yards when i noticed that the stream turned to the west little lower down and its banks were covered with rocks suddenly there was crash in the scrub ahead of and i heard loud wail which ﬁlled with terror i knew the sound but too was the wail of jaguar cub which trusty held in his teeth i ran up and saw him shaking one while another was escaping in the bushes i knew exactly what would happen i looked around with my cocked riﬂe in my hand and saw the mother coming down with terrible bounds from the oak clumps higher up there was not tree near and i must await it in the open trusty placed himself close to my side and with every hair bristling he uttered his most savage bass notes through his gnashing teeth the only thing now was to hit or else trusty at least was lost and myself too very probably forty paces from the infuriated brute crouched displaying its fangs and lashing its sides with its long spotted tail when i shot the beast turned over but then ﬂew towards with fresh spring i shot again and it rolled on the ground the ball the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https its spine and unable to move its the raging brute rolled and roared and dug its mighty claws into the grass which it dyed with its blood it was now harmless and i regretted that i had not my with to draw it in its paroxysm of fury it was majestic animal and the splendid golden yellow of its coat with its black and white spots was heightened by the dark red of the blood which streamed from its back and chest lying on the ground with its it stood erect on its mighty and with its thick round neck slightly bent down it raised its savage open jaws towards while the large yellow catlike eyes ﬂashed at the same time the brute made the valley ring with the most fearful roars uttered at intervals so soon i approached it it sprang towards and dragged its quarters along on the grass while showing its terrible claws i went up close to it and ﬁred revolver bullet through its head whereon it fell lifeless after reloading i went back to camp to wait tiger whom i had also heard ﬁring it was dark when i heard him coming and saw his brown elastic form coming through the bushes over his right shoulder hung two deer legs and the f meat of the back was thrown across the barrel of his long riﬂe which rested on his left shoulder he threw down his load lay on his stomach on the river bank and quenched his thirst then he returned to the ﬁre and said that i had been shooting too and intim ated by three ﬁngers the number of shots i had ﬁred i answered him that my deer was lying down the stream but we would sup ﬁrst and then fetch it we now attacked the excellent venison and enjoyed hearty supper when i gave tiger sign to follow i led him to the jaguar and he uttered loud cry when he saw it lying on the grass with the cub by its side the moon lit us while we stripped off its splendid skin which was larger than the one we had obtained few days previously we took the cub to camp tiger told its ﬂesh was great dainty then he stripped and paunched it and hung it up to tree we then stretched out the large hide put it in front of the ﬁre and slept quietly and undisturbed till morning i was very curious about the new dish which i was to taste breakfast the very white meat of the young jaguar which was about the size of an ordinary shepherd colley looked very tempting and i put some pieces of it before the ﬁre while tiger made his breakfast entirely of it i tasted it when it browned and it was very nice though it had musky ﬂavour which prevented from eating much of it hence i applied once more to the deer meat which i liked better and concluded my meal with the rest of the honeycomb which i had carried on jack wrapped in large magnolia leaves and piece of deer hide tiger revelled in his meat and on saddling packed up the rest supper on this day we followed the stream which ﬂowed about ﬁve miles westward but then suddenly turned round tall hill to the east and probably fell into the rio gran here we left it however and rode up small stream which joined it and came from the west we followed the narrow valley through which it ran and found there rather broad though at times stony road it was bordered on both sides by granitic hills and ran rather steeply up to the heights where it expanded into this plate au lay on the top of the mountains which we had seen to the west when riding up and i resolved to follow it in that direction so if possible to reach the declivity on the other side before night surprised us the barrenness of these lofty plateaus recalled unpleasant reminiscences this plateau was about ﬁfteen miles in breadth and in the afternoon we reached its western side where an endless plain stretched out at our feet bounded in the remote distance by very lofty mountains few spurs of which ran out into the valley the valley was thickly covered with grass and it seemed to well watered and wooded from our it must be at least one hundred and ﬁfty miles broad and to the south we could not see its termination the plain far we could survey it was covered with herds of buffalo while nearer to us deer and wild horses were grazing how many thousands of men could easily ﬁnd living here while in old europe are carried on years about an acre of land and yet i was the only white man whose eye had rested on the inexhaustible treasures which nature had stored up here still the time will come when the plough will cross this beautiful plain in all directions the smoke will rise from the hearths of prosperous planters the church bells will summon the neighbours to church and hell in harness the americans call the locomotive will snort and whistle through their valley our road down to the plain though not very steep was fatiguing and wearisome the side was here and there cut up by broad cañons which we were compelled to ride round we were going down one of these ravines one of the beautiful so frequent in these mountains sprang out of the loose stones not far from us i sent trusty after it down the ravine and ere long he began barking we hurried on quickly we could and on looking down the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https the creature crouching on an isolated rock while trusty was leaping round it and barking it was too far to ﬁre with certainty of killing though trusty was quite strong he might easily be so injured to be unﬁtted the fatigue of our tour hence i dismounted and crept near the stone on which the lay i went up high enough to see it and sent bullet through its head the rock was too high to climb up it and fetch the beast down so i was obliged to wait till trusty arrived i raised him on to the rock and he pulled the creature down then i returned to our cattle while tiger stripped the cat and brought the skin these animals are most dangerous to game they kill even when quite full merely the sake of the blood and never miss an opportunity to capture their quarry they creep with incredible skill and certainty well indefatigable patience up to the game on which they leap with lightning speed and not let it go till it has given them its blood when wounded or beset they attack their pursuer with great fury and determination and many an indian under such circumstances has been severely injured by them they generally live and hunt in couples and prefer rocky regions to the plains but also come down to the woods where they leap down from the trees on the game and bite it to death in the neck tiger shot two more of these animals before we reached the plain which took place in the afternoon and we camped on stream at an early hour the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https xvi the bear hole about week we traversed this extensive plain ﬁrst northward following the base of the hills we had crossed and then westward towards the more western ranges everywhere we found the richest soil and water in abundance well game of every description and many wild horses we lived like ﬁghting cocks always had the best buffalo meat many deer we wanted and also killed several antelope in narrow patch of wood trusty aroused old bear from its winter sleep which it was enjoying under some old fallen trees and drove it out into the prairie we followed it and trusty pinned it to the spot by few bites in its breeches i was just going to ﬁre when tiger cried to not to so sprang from his horse and ran towards the bear laughing and leaping with his long knife drawn trusty leaped barking in front of the irritated animal which showed its teeth savagely and kept him off with its forepaws while tiger crept behind it of his past the bear digging his knife into its side the bear made blow at him but too late and trusty attacked it on the other ﬂank tiger soon passed again behind the bear and buried his knife between its ribs and thus the two fought till the bear fell breathless and tiger stabbed it to the heart he was not little proud of his grand exploit laughed and said that he had killed an old bear in the same way once but had unfortunately lost his good dog i was obliged to promise him son of trusty to whom he henceforth especially gave his friendship the bear weighed some hundred pounds and supplied us with excellent meat in addition to its skin we packed good lot of it on honest jack and improved our meal with it that evening at the foot of the rio grande mountains here the limestone rocks ran down to the plain and on the distant heights we could again notice dark masses of cedar forests which had so impeded our progress from this point our road became fatiguing and at times dangerous the whole country consisted of rent limestone mountains through whose gorges and crevices we had to wind our way in the fear of being possibly obliged to camp without water we followed rivulet up stream into these mountains though we frequently had to leave it we still kept close to it we could about noon we reached plateau which was entirely covered with petriﬁed wood of which thick branches and even trunks lay scattered about it was apparently cedar wood and i took severa l ﬁne specimens of it souvenirs in the evening we again reached our stream and though it was still early and the grass not particularly good we unsaddled and arranged our camp while i was thus occupied tiger took his riﬂe and soon disappeared among the rocks which were scattered about in enormous blocks on our left while on the right they were several hundred feet high and displayed numerous rifts out of which tree here and there grew tiger soon returned and told he knew where very old bear was asleep we would go and fetch it next morning it was lying in rock crevice and judging from its track it must be sturdy fellow day had scarce broken ere we quickly ﬁnished our breakfast and in short time came to spot where good grass grew here we unsaddled fastened our horses to tree and then ascended the which became steeper the farther we got quite at the top between the highest peaks tiger went to an overhanging rock and stopped before an opening only few feet wide which ran downwards here he plucked quantity of long dry grass from between the stones rolled it rapidly into long thick loose band and then made sign to stand near the hole he next lit the torch and crawled on all fours with his riﬂe into the rocks i could hear only few minutes the sound he produced by crawling farther into the cave and then there was silence again i stood with trusty some time without hearing the slightest sound when suddenly stiﬂed echo resembling powerful gust of wind came out of the crevice the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https after scratching and rustling were audible advancing towards the oriﬁce till all at once heavy black bear appeared with bleeding face i was standing only few yards from the cave and the sake of tiger wished to let it come out entirely ere i ﬁred i felt convinced that the brute was wounded and by ﬁring prematurely i might turn it back on my comrade i pressed close to the rock and the bear had made some forward bounds when i sent both bullets through it although without checkin g its pace the bear disappeared behind the nearest rock and at the same moment tiger came out of the cave all right and ran off quickly deer after the bear i followed and was compelled to use every exertion to keep tiger in sight when i noticed that in running he reloaded and suddenly sinking on one knee ﬁred but he at once sprang up again and while reloading sprang from stone to stone till he knelt once more and ﬁred i kept close i could behind him and was running up rather steep incline over large masses of stones when i heard tiger riﬂe crack the third time in few minutes i got round large rock table and saw him carelessly sitting on stone and when i went up to him he raised his left arm and pointed to heap of rocks where to my surprise i saw the bear peeping over one of them like preacher in his pulpit it had ﬂown there mortally wounded to defend itself and showed us its bleeding terrible range of teeth i quickly loaded and shot it through the head upon which it rolled down from its elevation i took out my book and made sketch of the rocks while tiger skinned and broke up the bear i did not notice the latter retire but when i missed him i rose and looked about him on going few paces round the rock i saw him on his knees among the bushes praying while before him smoke curled up from ﬁre of leaves i quietly walked nearer and heard him muttering to himself while piece of the bear hung before him on the bush over the smoke he soon rose came up to and when i asked him what he had been about he laughed cunningly and answered that this meal of meat out of the bear chest was the god of hunting other indians were not acquainted with this and hence the delawares alone shot fat bears while the others had lean ones i asked him how it was the bear had not choked him in the cave he said laughingly bear love ﬁre and told that he had crept long way into the rocks till the cave became very spacious then holding his torch aloft he looked about him and saw the bear eyes glittering long way in the backg round he ﬁred at it but his bullet hit the beast on the cheek the bear sprang up and rushed at him but he placed himself close to the rock and held out his torch while the bear rushed past him we hurried back to our horses which took us nearly half an hour although we went the most part down hill they whinnied we approached and waited impatiently to be noticed tiger mounted his piebald and rode back to the bear to fetch the skin claws and some of the meat and was back in camp by noon we merely drank coffee packed our anim als and laid the bear enormous ragged skin with the ﬂeshy side upwards over jack who looked terrible in consequence we still followed the rocky valley up till about evening when we reached capital spot our cattle and i had dismounted to pass the night here but tiger pointed to the north where the sky was slightly overcast and then up the hill where brushwood was hanging about the loose stones and said we must go higher up the stream or else we should sleep in the water he now showed that this brushwood had been lodged among the stones by the swollen stream and we consequently camped higher up the ﬁrst time during this tour our tent was put up and our baggage placed under it then we dug deep trench round it and laid in an ample stock of ﬁrewood we lit the ﬁre under large rock so that it was protected from the north wind and drove strong pickets into the ground in order to fasten up our cattle close to the tent we consequently let them graze by the water side till it grew dark and then led them up to the camp where we secured them we sat till late hour over the ﬁre while all nature seemed to have gone to rest there was not breath of air and only the crackling of our ﬁre interrupted the silence and lit up the great masses of rock around us we were both sleepy i went into the tent and lay down on my buffalo robe but tiger lay by the ﬁre and we were both in the deep est sleep when frightful crash startled and ﬂash of lightning illumined my tent i leaped up and found tiger busied in blowing the ﬁre pitchy darkness surrounded us so that i could not see the horses which were but few yards off suddenly the lightning shot down the rocks accompanied by deafening peal of thunder which was quickly followed by other peals the storm soon rolled over the hills and the rain fell in torrents although we had blown our ﬁre into an enormous ﬂame it was put out by the rain the ﬂashes darted here and there and an uninterrupted thunder rolled along the valley while the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https and plashing of rapid stream became audible and we soon saw beneath us the white foamy crests of terrible stream pouring over the banks of the rivulet where our horses had been peacefully grazing few hours previously we stood by our horses with our buffalo robes over our heads turning our back to the wind and waited longingly the moment when the storm would break it lasted however till shortly before daylight how are we to light ﬁre now i said to tiger our wood was wet and hollow trees grew between the rocks around us in which we could look dry wood he laughed however ran short distance returned with an armful of dry twigs which he had hidden there on the previous evening under rock and said indian more cautious than white men our ﬁre soon burnt up again and produced tremendous glow before which we hung up our buffalo robes and tent to dry the bearskin of the previous day not being dry yet either we also hung it up to the ﬁre and then prepared breakfast meal our cattle were obliged to go without the grass was completely ﬂooded so soon the wet things were dry we started the higher mountains in order to ﬁnd spot where our cattle could satisfy their hunger the road was very bad we progressed slowly crossing great number of morning trails of panthers leopards and ocelots which were deeply trodden into the soft lime soil and reached about noon grassy plateau which extended to the dark cedar woods here we hobbled the cattle while we lit ﬁre against withered tree and enjoyed the delicate bear meat the air was cool and the conical mountain peaks covered with cedars were smoking in the afternoon we rode toward the gloomy forests to try and ﬁnd path through them we certainly found number of small tracks but not one old and used enough us to trust it so we went southward on the plain till darkness stopped our march we stopped the night at hollow ﬁlled with rain water and on the next morning continued our journey along the woods till to our great joy we found much trampled buffalo track by which we entered them it led us down between two high hills and hence i was afraid lest it might be path which made by animals grazing on the hill down to stream would terminate there in hour we reached some large springs which gushed out of rock and ﬂowed in direction through very narrow gorge covered with bushes dry wood and overarching cedars the path however ran hence to our great joy eastward and we dismounted the cedar branches hung too near over the path we had almost reached the top where only few cedars stood before us suddenly i fancied i could hear tremendous rustling some distance off i cautiously ascended to the top of the hill and saw here about forty yards ahead of three enormous condors one of which was standing on the ground with expanded wings while the other two were springing round it and rising each time some feet from the ground i sank on one knee and sent bullet into the broad chest of the ﬁrst while the other two ﬂuttered their wings with frightful yell and soon rose high in air above just i was going to ﬁre the second barrel tiger riﬂe cracked behind and the eagle i was aiming at turned over in the air and ﬂuttered down i turned round to the third and ﬁred at it it was soaring over the depths near us i saw the bullet enter the soft feathers under the belly and it shot like dart with outstretched wings between the hills where it disappeared among the dark cedars tiger had cut off his eagle head by the time i ran up to mine and found under it an antelope which the brave bird had just killed and which had only lost its eyes and tongue its body was but slightly ripped up but the whole back was covered with blood which ﬂowed from countless small holes produced by the long claws of these rulers of the air tiger was beside himself delight the wing and of these birds are the greatest ornaments an indian knows and he will readily give his best horse them he wears them on the band which conﬁnes his hair and the claws sewn on strap form necklace i told him i intended to skin mine and take it home to stuff but he was of opinion that he must fetch the feathers of the third condor which had fallen into the valley and he at once disappeared i did not consider it possible to get down there and utterly so to ﬁnd the eagle i had watched it ﬂy at least mile i at once set to work skinning my bird and had not ﬁnished when trusty growled and tiger really soon ran up with the spoils of the other bird these condors rarely come down into the lower hills they live exclusively on the highest points of the andes which human foot treads and from the lower lands can only be seen the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https dots on the blue sky the last night storm must have surprised these wanderers in their eyrie and carried them before it till they sought shelter in these mountains starving from their involuntary journey they wished to taste the delicate game of these countries which are not situated so near the clouds when our bullets cut off their return home the condor i ﬁrst shot was by far the largest and probably the mother of the other two which she was training to plunder while on the division of the spoil she reserved the right of taking her share ﬁrst the outstretched wings of this bird measured from end to end very nearly ﬁfteen feet it was noon when we mounted our horses and rode down the stony incline we moved along around the hills again and seemed hardly to leave the spot we frequently rode half an hour and then suddenly found ourselves again in front of an old withered tree or rock emer ging from the cedars which we had seen before we rode without interruption until the sun hid itself behind the highest peaks and cast long shadows over the hills glistening in the evening light the sunny spots on the mountains constantly grew smaller until at length only single cone stood up if gilt above the dark country we had not yet seen trace of the rio grande and we must still be good distance from it from the highest points we crossed we could see nothing far the horizon except the same conical hills covere d with gloomy foliage we halted in one of the countless hollows of these stony mountains where had collected and decent grass grew on small open space took the burdens off our very wearied horses and soon lay on our skins near the ﬁre very large dry cedar trunk rose with its upper half out of the coppice we lit our ﬁre against its side so that it soon began to smoulder and gave out great heat during the night we scarce needed to look at it and in the morning found small ﬂames still playing round the tree strong breeze was blowing when we crawled out from under our buffalo robes we threw plenty of wood on the burning trunk and felt very comfortable in the warmth while our cattle were eating their scanty breakfast we roasted bear and antelope meat and drank in coffee the health of the condors that had supplied us with the game ere long however we mounted in order to bid farewell the sooner to these inhospitable forests and see once more the frontiers of my rio grande we pressed on uphill and downhill at one moment riding at another leading our horses and frequently impeded by wide torrents and broad ravines about noon we had prospect of deep rocky valley on whose sides cedars were to be seen and greeted it the bed of the river the mountains sank our path ran in straighter line towards the valley and in little more than an hour we were riding in long broad gully through the rocks which bordered it the familiar river lay before us little deeper than we swam through it little while previously but to our sorrow the rocks on the opposite side far we could see were so steep that it was impossible our cattle to climb up them nor was it possible to ride down the river owing to the boulders and masses of which covered the whole bank and hence nothing remained but to ride back and seek passage to the south among the mountains our cattle certainly shook their heads when we turned them back into the gully but tiger laughed and said that we should still sleep this night across the river on reaching the summit we at once selected the nearest hollow and turned to the south following the river it was fatiguing journey through loose stones fallen trees and at times dense cedar woods but all that we progressed better than i had feared and at the end of an hour we saw at an angle of the river that another large stream ﬂowing from the eastward fell into it which seemed to to be the leone we were obliged to go higher up the hills here on account of numerous obstacles and lost sight of the river awhile still the sun had good hour before setting when we entered broad buffalo path which led down in straight line to the river i soon recognised on this road objects i had seen before and was now certain that the eastern river was the river of my home so we found it to be when we rode down the rio grande and unsaddled our horses there we consulted in what way we should get across and agreed to make raft again we soon had couple of cedar logs fastened together heap of brushwood laid on them and our baggage on the top and lastly we covered it all with the large bearskin and secured it all round with straps tiger left his riﬂe behind and rode into the stream which was not very deep here he held the end of the lasso fastened to the raft in his right hand and thus dragged it along when he had gone across about third of the river his horse was obliged to swim the current pulled him down stream and he was compelled to follow with his horse he was now in the strongest current and i noticed that he had great difﬁculty in keeping on his horse when he suddenly fell off it but kept the line between his teeth and worked his way into dead water he soon reached the other bank and gave loud yell while his faithless piebald had turned back in the middle the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https river and trotted up to shaking himself tiger secured the raft ran little way up the bank and swam across to with incredible speed we now mounted our horses and swam across jack saluting his native land with song of joy the sun was setting we trotted up the leone in order to reach camping place in the hills where i had rested many night undist urbed and to which i knew the road perfectly it soon became dark but the stars were shining we could see enough not to lose our way and hurried forward wrapped in our buffalo robes the wind blew hard and we had become chilly in crossing the river when near our destination we were riding slowly up the last ascent when tiger uttered his familiar expression of surprise hugh and turning round pointed behind him to the rio grande i looked back and saw column of ﬂame rising on the hills on the opposite side which rapidly spread southward the ﬂames covered the whole hill and the brilliantly illumined smoke clouds rolled away over them the ﬁery waves poured savagely and uninterruptedly from hill to hill checked their speed but short time in the deep valleys and then darted with heightened fury up the next hill devouring everything that came in their way the cedar woods were on ﬁre and probably our last night camp ﬁre was the cause of it the violent wind had doubtless blown the ashes of the burning trunk into the coppice and assailed the surrounding cedars ere long the whole southern horizon was sea of ﬁre out of which here and there isolated hills spared by the ﬂames rose like black islands we lay till late at night by our small camp ﬁre and watched the scene regretting our incautiousness or neglect which had entailed such fearful destruction how many thousand anim als had found martyr death on that night and how probable it was that indians resting there had been devoured by the ﬂames after lying silently long time looking across tiger uttered the words poor indians sleep warm accompanied by deep sigh it was not till morning that fatigue overpowered us and we fell back on our saddles we awoke when the sun was pouring its golden light over the world and brilliantly illumined the gloomy scene of desolation the bare black burned lime hills rose there above each other wrapped them selves in black and seeme d to accuse us to awakening nature the cause of the disaster it was really disagreeable reproach cast at by those hills and we soon set out in order to escape the sad sight and refresh our eyes soon possible by view of our cheerful home we crossed the leone about noon at the same pretty spot when we began our journey and soon saw the pleasant mountain springs on our right our cattle also knew that we were going home and increased their pace at length we reached the hill where the ﬁrst view of the fort could be obtained and joyfully greeted its grey wooden walls it was still early when we rode up to my settlement from the adjoining valley and two shots of rejoicing welcomed us from the western turret of the fort to which we responded by ﬁring our riﬂes everything was in the old

dozen little pigs more were running about the the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https xvii the comanche chief i fel t very comfortable in my pretty house and tiger informed with great satisfaction that one had been in his tent during our absence in accordance with promise i gave him when we set out some days we hardly left the fort but enjoyed rest tiger tanned the skins we had brought home i stuffed my condor at which my young friend was greatly amazed and ﬁrmly declared that i restored the bird to life after this we rolled cigars made new clothes repaired our saddles and bridles and employed ourselves with the thousand domestic jobs which gather even during short absence but after we had attended to the chief matters several wants became visible which we could only satisfy on the prairie thus among others our substitute sugar honey was expended and at the supper table we resolved on going out on this hunt the next morning if it was ﬁne the morning dawned bright and calm and both conditions are required winter bee hunt at this season the bees only work in warm weather and their course can not be watched when the wind is blowing hard we got ready immediately after breakfast tiger and i armed usual but antonio and one of my colonists provided with heavy sharp axes and buckets while jack carried two empty casks copper kettle large wooden spoons and tin funnel thus we trotted over the spangled prairie across to mustang creek crossed it and its thick wood by broad buffalo path and then rode down the prairie to fork formed by the forest on an afﬂuent of the mustang joining that on the latter river here we halted stuck long pole on which small tin was fastened into the ground lit dry touchwood in it and laid on the top piece of comb in which some honey remained not far from this we put up another pole with paper smeared with honey upon it the smoke of the boiling wax and honey serves the bees cruising over the prairie guide to the paper and soon the busy gatherers arrive from all the in the neigh bourhood load themselves heavily they can and then go straight home in direct line the hunter now observes in which direction the greatest number of the insects swarm because this leads him to expect richer tree well shorter distance to go when he has decided on his route he follows the swarm with his bait far he can see it then puts up the pole again and waits till they settle or the honey ones move and then ﬂy home thus he follows the industrious insects till by their restless activity they show him the spot where their treasures collected during many years are concealed and he then disturbs the colony with cruel hand robs it of its laboriously gathered stores kills thousands of the colonists and drives the rest away homeless we our part behaved better except that we had brought sacks in which to carry the shelterless bees home and give them an abode very large swarm went toward the leone and another to the afﬂuent on the left we decided the former however and in less than half an hour found ourselves in front of gigan tic maple that grew on the skirt of the forest in whose long trunk between the lowest branches the oriﬁce of the tree was completely covered with the insects we hobbled our horses some distance from the tree lit ﬁre near it and two of us set to work with the axes to cut it down tiger and i had the ﬁrst turn and when we were tired the two others took our place till we thus working in turn made the proud tree fall with its whole weight on the grass where its splinters ﬂew long way the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https of us seized ﬁrebrand and ran with buckets spoons and knives to the cracked part of the trunk where the honey was exposed while the bees circled high above us in the air in dense swarm the ﬁrebrands were laid on the ground near the honey old damp wood was laid on them to increase the smoke and we hurriedly cut out the comb and poured the liquid honey into bucket which we emptied into the kettle which was slightly warmed by the ﬁre honey runs from the cells with gentle heat and when it is liquid enough the latter are pressed between two boards till all the honey runs out after which it is strained through coarse sieve into the cask by the time we had secured our booty it was noon and we recovered from our fatigue over cup of coffee and maize cake then we went back to the spot we had started from and followed the swarm to the small afﬂuent where we found the bees in another old plane close to the prairie we also robbed this tree it was even richer than the ﬁrst and contained layers of honey probably ﬁfteen years old the oldest of which were nearly black when we had ﬁnished this job our two casks were full and the bucket loaded with quite fresh comb evening had arrived and the bees had collected in dense mass on branch of the felled tree we held an open sack under them shook them in and then rode back to the ﬁrst tree whose colony we also took we returned home with our sweet stores emptied our sacks into two hollow trees and placed them on scaffolding near the fort the honey was conveyed to the storeroom and the wax melted and laid by when cold in plates the indians keep their honey and bear lard in fresh deer hides which they slit little possible in skinning they cut off the neck and legs sew the openings up very tightly with sinews ﬁll the skin and close the last opening in the same way into whic h they thrust reed and squeeze the honey they want it through the latter the honey keeps in this way very well and is easier to carry on horseback than in hand vessels we employed the honey in every way sugar is used in the civilized world we sweetened our coffee and tea with it employed it in cooking various dishes in preserving fruit such grapes plums mulberries in word it fully took the place of that expensive and hardly procurable product of civilization and could always be obtained in such quantities that we never ran short of it when hunting in the neighbourhood we very often found bee trees which we marked in order to plunder them we wanted our table was now enriched by fresh delicacy which we enjoyed during the winter months it consisted of wild ducks and geese these birds visited our river at this season in great numbers and spread in ﬂocks over the water the very lofty banks the numerous sharp turns and the insigniﬁcant breadth of the stream rendered it extraordinarily easy to kill heaps of these birds in short time i usually took with two guns and man with pack horse who followed at some distance and placed the dead birds on the saddle i followed the steep river bank every now and then creeping down to the incline and could then see from one bend to the other where the birds were resting on the water i generally contrived to creep through the wood exactly over this spot without the birds perceiving i then whistled while holding the muzzle of my very large gun over the bank and the birds in their fright drew closer together then i sent charge of shot among them and ﬁred the other right among the rising ﬂock then i took the other gun and sent the conte nts of both barrels after the ﬂying ducks or geese i frequently shot in this way twenty in one ﬂock the remainder generally joined the next ﬂock farther down the stream trusty and some spaniels accompanied on this chase and fetched the shot birds most of the ducks and geese that visited us were very like the european though rather larger both are very fat and well tasted which is probably caused by the splendid acorns they ﬁnd among us we generally carried whole load home from which we merely cut the breasts legs and livers and boiled them into jelly one afternoon when tiger had ridden off at an early hour in pursuit of game i took my gun to go after geese down the river which i heard croaking from the fort i went out without calling dog and ran down to the water i passed the garden and the ford where the river winds to the north in the wood and went into the bushes in order to approach the geese which i had seen about hundred yards farther on all at once i heard something like the footfall of horse echo through the forest on the opposite side i listened and convinced myself that i was not mistaken tiger had gone southward in the morning to mustang creek and i could not imagine how he was now returning from the north i lay down among the bushes so to keep an eye on the ford the noise drew nearer till mounted indian appeared on path on the opposite side who stopped there and looked cautiously the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https while the redskin crossed the ford ascended the opposite bank and taking his long riﬂe in his right hand he led his horse into thick bush about forty paces ahead of there he fastened it up laid his riﬂe across his left arm and shook fresh powder into the pan from his horn what could the indian intend and to what tribe did he belong these questions occurred to simultaneously with the suspicion that he might probably have hostile designs my gun was loaded with not very heavy shot but it carried far the indian riﬂe though it did not kill so certainly i had however some slugs in my hunting pouch and while he was repriming i i lay ﬂat on the ground pulled out two of the largest bullets that ﬁtted my gun i thrust them both into the barrels and then slowly drew the ramrod pressed two paper wads on the bullets and returned the ramrod to its place during this the indian had returned his powder to its place taken his tomahawk from the saddle and thrust it through his belt woven several large leafy branches of evergreen myrtle and rhododendron under his saddle so that they concealed the colour of his light horse and then leaving the path went in stooping posture through the wood toward my garden i cautiously followed him at distance of about one hundred yards bending down close to the ground continually keeping behind the bushes and disappearing in the grass when he stopped or made movement if to look round he seemed however only to keep his eye on the garden and bent lower the nearer he got to it suddenly he fell into the tall grass between the evergreen bushes and disappeared from my sight had he heard or seen fall down the point now was which of us should see the other ﬁrst the grass in which i lay was not very high but green bushes hung down to the ground in front of too close to be seen through by my foe but still leaving sufﬁcient gaps through which to peep while the bushes round him were scrubby and the grass alone concealed him if he had seen he would certainly not remain lying he would have the worst of it i had raised myself sufﬁciently to survey his place and after while notic ed the grass waving little to the left of the spot where i had last seen him everything became still and motionless again and we lay thus nearly quarter of an hour when i saw the indian raise his head out of the grass and look about him he had not noticed yet or else he would not have exposed himself so recklessly to my ﬁre he rose slowly and glided towards the garden he got close to the fence which was made of ten logs placed in zigzag over each other and on the outerside were heaped up the branches of the trees from which the wood the palisades had been cut i had put this up to prevent the buffaloes and deer from forcing their way into the garden the indian now stepped close to the wall of dry branches while i lay in the bushes about hundred yards behind him he stopped looked into the garden long time and then round the wood he then stooped and crept under the brushwood up to the fence seated himself crosslegged close to the latter and laid his riﬂe across one of the logs while he was working his way through the branches and brushw ood i crept on nearer to him and remained behind an oak about forty yards from him just i reached the tree i broke thin dry branch with my hand and the very slight sound scarce reached the savage ear ere he started round and gazed intently in my direction i did not stir but held my gun ﬁrmly with the determination that he should not leave the spot alive he looked towards nearly quarter of an hour still trusting to the sharpness of his ears when suddenly one of my men who was coming down from the fort with two buckets to ﬁll at the spring could be heard whistl ing on the other side of the garden the indian started round thrust his riﬂe through the fence pointed at the spring and knelt down behind its long barrel at the same instant i sprang out from behind the oak raised my gun and sent the charge of the barrel between the savage shoulders he leapt up and while doing so i gave him the second charge after which he fell backwards into the brushwood i shouted to my man who in his alarm was running back to the fort and rushed to the indian who was writhing in his blood and striking around with hands and feet my comrade hurried through the garden and clambering over the fence gazed down at the shot man in horror i explained to him in few words how accident had preserved his life the savage had been lying in wait him and had his riﬂe pointed at him and i then buried my knife in the heart of the quivering savage we took his riﬂe and medicine bag fetched his horse after i had reloaded and took it up to the fort where we fastened it inside the enclosure i impatiently waited tiger to obtain an explanation from him i feared lest the shot man might be delaware the evening came and tiger was not back yet thousand suppositions thousand suspicions involuntarily crossed my mind could tiger be traitor the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https the delawares have broken their friendship with the white men we drove our cattle in earlier than usual rode them down to water laid our weapons ready to hand and prepared to oppose any possible attack i went to the eastern turret and gazed over the wide prairie when i suddenly noticed far on the horizon black point that seemed strange to i looked through my glass and to my great delight recognised the large white spots of tiger piebald i now felt lighter at heart ran down and waited him at the gate at length he rode up to from the last hollow loaded with deer and bear meat and the hide of small bear leapt from his horse and heartily shook my hand i told him what had happened and he listened most attentively his eyebrows were contracted and his usually pleasant eyes ﬂashed savagely he said nothing but kitchi kattuh made sign to enter the fort and when we reached the where the dead man lay he cried kitchi placed two ﬁngers of his right hand before his mouth so that they seemed to be emer ging from it and repeated kitchi two tongues he then led out of the fort when he stopped and said to that the false kitchi had laid watch him in the garden and intended to take his life so that the delawares might fancy we had killed him and take their revenge on us it had indeed gradually grown custom in the fort that tiger when he was at home fetched fresh water from the spring before supper and his supposition appeared to be well founded still the unexpected appearance of one of my men seemed to have turned the kitchi from his original purpose because he was on the point of sending the bullet intended tiger through the chest of the latter we now helped to hang up the meat brought in by tiger and sat down to supper when the occurrence naturally became the sole subject of conversation and was regar ded from every side we agreed to bury the indian and i went accompanied by antonio and tiger with spade and cedar torch through the garden to the dead man tiger drew him out of the brushwood took off his beads armlets and leathern breech clout and then dragged him with antonio help nearer the river where we dug deep hole and buried the corpse we soon forgot this incident and went on with our winter avocations before we slightly enlar ged our ﬁeld which was fatiguing job it lay in the wood and the bushes grew very close together there these and the smaller trees were cut down and piled up round the larger ones after the latter had been out into the wood after they had dried week they were kindled which dried the bark of the large trunks and thus killed the tree we then set to work with heavy plough to turn up the ground this operation is always performed twice or thrice through the winter before the seed is put in the ground in spring it may be asked why we did not lay out our ﬁeld in the prairie we should thus have saved this labour the reason is that the prairie soil is remarkably difﬁcult to plough because it consists of black hard earth in which the delicate young plants have unusually large roots hard glass i afterwards cultivated land of this sort and at the ﬁrst breaking up had six or eight draught cattle fastened to the plough then again this land owing to its hardness produces scarce crop in the ﬁrst year in the second very poor one in third moderate one and not till the fourth full crop it is always much more difﬁcult to cultivate than the forest land the heavy rains in the winter season always more or less restore its ﬁrmness while the forest soil bears proliﬁcally in the ﬁrst year in the garden we had plenty of work too the potatoes were laid in beds in order to grow the tap roots which are cut off in spring and planted out in the ﬁeld then the tobacco beds were put in order from which the young plants were transplanted in february the same plant produces among us three or even four crops we always leave young shoot to grow when the leaves are ripe enough to cut then there were vegetables to sow vines to prune to graft in short we had our hands full and i only went with tiger away from the fort to hunt bears whose fat we were obliged to collect at this time it is not nearly so abundant at other seasons one morning i resolved to go to mustang creek and choose suitable spot where i could build carriage bridge across it i frequently had meat to fetch from the prairies on the other side and i also intended to make by degrees passable road to the settlements i rode away at an early hour accompanied by trusty but at some distance from home i noticed that milo an old was running after which was bore the good old dog if he by chance hit on fresh trail would be sure to follow it and i had not intended to hunt bears on this day the dog was much too slow and deaf and i only gave him food the many faithful services he had rendered i did not care to ride back and hence called him closer up to my horse and continued my journey the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https soon reached the river and was busy examining the banks when suddenly old milo gave tongue and had run too far into the bushes to check him i was sorry if the old fellow had row with bear by himself it would be all over with him i heard his bark going farther and farther and though i felt grieved i was obliged to leave him to his fate after while i fancied that i heard him continually barking at the same spot i listened and it seemed more than probable that he had attacked bear i must hurry to his assistance so i rode far i could into the bushes tied up my horse and forced my way through the thicket i soon leaped through the last bushes and to my surprise saw milo sitting in front of an old cypress and barking up at it i examined the gigantic trunk and clearly saw on its bark the traces of bear which had climbed up it in the ﬁrst fork the tree was hollow from top to bottom and i did not doubt moment but that bruin was having his winter sleep in it to cut down the tree was heavy task it was above eight feet in diameter and then too it stood among number of other giants against which it might easily lean in falling when we should not be able to get at its occupant i tapped round the tree to see whether it was hollow far down but i could not settle the point satisfactorily i had axe with which to hit hard enough i quickly formed my resolution caught up milo carried him away from the trail and hastened to my horse which speedily bore home tiger was at the river washing deer hides when i arrived on the bank and informed him of my discovery he quickly packed up his skins ran to his tent and hurried to the prairie to fetch the piebald in less than half an hour we were en route the bear accompanied by antonio and one of the colonists armed with axes while jack followed us with large pack saddle and trusty leaped ahead of us we soon reached the river led our horses some distance down it and tied them up in the thicket then we went to the cypress in which our sleeper was we examined it and found it quite sound over eight feet from the ground but from that point hollow and more so on the western side we soon raised framework of thin branches round the tree on which one of us was raised by turns and cut an opening in the trunk at the spot where the hollow began while one was engaged in this way the others brought up dry wood which we piled up against the opening like bonﬁre we then lit it and ere long the ﬂames crept up the stem and the dried bark fell off with cracking sound into the ﬁre we arranged ourselves round the tree at some distance in such way that we could cover it pretty well from all sides and expected every moment to see the bear quit its winter quarters we had been standing there however above an hour and the gentleman did not make his appearance though the smoke was rising from the hollow the bear probably lay below the hole and the smoke passed over it without annoying it all at once i saw sparks ﬂying out of the tree which proved that it was beginning to catch ﬁre inside i shouted to the others to look out and just after i heard crash and with it appeared the black form of very old bear between the ﬁrst branches the fright and embarrassment of my gentleman were extraordinary when he looked down into the ﬁre under him and moved backwards and forwards undecided what path to choose i had told my men not to ﬁre so long the bear was over the ﬁre but to let it advance on the long branches far enough not to fall into the ﬂames which would have deprived us of its splendid skin master bear had by this time selected very stout branch and crept cautiously along it looking down ﬁrst on this side and then on that at the ﬂames and was on the point of making itself into ball to have drop when i ﬁred at it and in falling it clutched the branch with its claws in order to drag itself up again at the same moment however four more bullets ﬂew through it and it came down with an enormous blow i ran up with revolver and shot it through the head whereupon it became quiet it was one of the ﬁnest bears we had killed during this year and gave us large quantity of fat and splendid skin we broke it up packed on jack much he could carry and distributed the rest among our horses we then went home heavily laden and sat till late in the kitchen busied in melting down the grease after enjoying some roast bear ribs supper at times there were slight domestic annoyances pig or calf was torn by the wolves few hen nests plundered by the racoons dog killed by the snakes or horse ran thorn into its foot however up to the present we had preserved our health we knew naught of sorrow and the thousand passions which civilized life entails and which become the source of endless suffering were entirely lulled to sleep among us on the other hand we were deprived of many enjoyments which social life affords but at the same time had countless pleasures which must be given up there the hardest thing to was that i could not obtain books without great trouble and expense while events in the civilized world were more or less unknown to the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https i received packet of old newspapers whose fragments however only helped to render my confusion worse confounded to tell the truth i was beginning to yearn nearer connexion with the world and little more society one morning the dogs barked in an unusual manner and one of my men ran up to and told that one of my buffalo calves which i had captured in the last summer and of which i possessed eight had leapt into the river because the dogs were tormenting it i ran down to the river and after considerable exertions we succeeded in getting the animal out uninjured but very fatigued these calves were remarkably tame more so than those of our cows and never went far from the fort in spite of their terrible appearance they were very comical all had names to which they answered and caused us much fun i intended to train them working and to breed mixed race with my cattle which however only offers an advant age in meat and size the buffaloes yield much less and worse milk than our domestic kind it is not possible to produce breed between our tame cow and the buffalo the cow can not give birth to the calf owing to the hump on the shoulders and almost always is killed by it but the opposite breed ﬂourishes and is capable of further procreation buffalo oxen are excell ent work they grow very tame and possess enormous strength the only fault is that when they are thirsty power on earth can restrain them from satisfying their thirst i knew planter on the rio grande who employed couple of these animals that ran away once with heavy cart to the river and dashed over its steep bank to satisfy their thirst but he got them out again all right just we were taking the saved buffalo up to the fort the sentry came to and announced that ﬁve white men were riding down the river upon which i went to the turret and saw that the new arrivals were three white men negro and mulatto about half an hour later the strangers rode up to the fort and dismounted at the gate while the coloured men took their horses and unsaddled them ﬁne looking man of nearly sixty years of age advanced to shook my hand and introduced himself to lasar from alabama one of his young companions his son john and the other his cousin henry of the same name the old gentleman had something most elegant and attractive about his appearance which evidenced lengthened intercourse with the higher social circle s over his high bronzed forehead shone his still thick though silvery hair while long black eyebrows overshadowed his light blue eyes and his fresh complexion seemed to protest against his white hair though fully six feet high he carried himself with the strength of man of thirty and his bright merry eyes proved that his mind was still youthful he was an old spaniard had settled when young man in alabama and though the blue eyes contradicted his origin it was manifested in all the rest of his countenance his son john was shorter and lighter built with black curling hair and very dark but pleasant eyes nice looking youth of seventeen and cousin henry young man of twenty odd of middle height and narrow between the shoulders showed by his auburn hair and grey eyes that his blood was mixed i conducted the strangers to the parlour and set before them breakfast among the dishes being one of duck breast in jelly the old gentleman was greatly surprised and said that he had not expected to ﬁnd anything at my house beyond very good game and roasted marrow bones when i treated them to french wine and cigars and they surveyed the ornaments of my room they expressed the utmost surprise at the amount of comfort they found and john said that i had everything precisely his father intended to have it when he settled here the old gentleman now informed of his intention to come into my neighbourhood and requested my advice and aid he had cotton plantation in alabama but the number of his negroes had increased so considerably that he could not employ them all on his estate and must hire out the majority at very low wages land was too high in price there so he preferred taking up government land here and submitting to the privations and dangers of life on the border he now proposed to inspect the land then return and send on john with ﬁfty negroes so to get maize crop ready while he would follow in autumn with his family and ﬁve hundred slaves i was very glad to have such neighbours so i gladly offered him my services in showing him much ﬁne land he wanted close to mine my guests rested few days and amused themselves with inspecting my farm and arrangements and making small hunting trips in the vicinity in which old lasar eagerly joined it is true that he shot deer and turkeys with his large loaded with swan shot through which many head escaped him and i reproached him doing so i considered this shameful butchery he allowed his fault but said that other weapon was employed in shooting where he came from but when he came out to join he would also introduce the the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https my guests had rested sufﬁciently i rode with them over to the mustang river passed through its woods and followed its course southward to its junction with the rio grande here we turned back up the stream and rode along the forest to our morning track so that the strangers had ample opportunity examining the land on both sides of the river lasar was much pleased and at once decided on this land it fully satisﬁed all his wishes we reached home at late hour and lasar was so perfectly contented that he proposed returning home at once but i urged him to look at other land to the north of which tour we made our necessary preparations on the next day on the third morning we rode up the leone to the spot where my border line crossed it two miles from the fort from this point to the source of the river lay very ﬁne land too although the woods were not so extensive lower down it we spent the night at the wellhead and then rode northwards to turkey creek in which tour we found great deal of land well adapted ploughing although the smaller quantity would have rendered it better suited small settlers still the country here aroused lasar admiration and he declared that before two years had passed it should be all occupied by friends of his from alabama i reminded him of the human skulls and bones which i had shown him at the sources of the leone belonging to settlers murdered by the indians who had come from geor gia and only enjoyed the pleasures of border life few months he said however that so many families must arrive simultaneously would hold the indians within bounds his own part he decided on mustang river and on reaching the fort again he rested two more days with which we employed in talking over and settling everything on this occasion i proposed to hire of him twelve negroes whom he could send with his son i wanted to begin cotton planting he agreed most willingly when he settled he would require good many things of such maize pigs cows fowls tallow bear grease and we could deduct their value from the rent on the third morning i accompanied my guests some distance and then rode home with the brightest prospects the future most unexpected event brightened my hopes the future even more few days after lasar departure party of seven comanche indians came riding up the river armed with unstrung bows and lances they rode up to the fence and one of them captain good friend and i went out to them and asked what they wanted one of them spoke english very well and appeared to mexican who had probably been stolen by them in childhood and had since lived among them he said that the chief of all the comanches pahajuka the man in love had sent them to ask whether he might come and make friendship with he had heard that i was good friend to other indians and wished to become his friend well the message greatly surprised hitherto when i had come in contact with men of this nation we had used our weapons my ﬁrst feeling was suspicion that they wished to effect by treachery what they had not been able to by arms still i would not entirely repulse them and said that if they were speaking to with one tongue and desired my friendship i would readily give it to them but if they were i would become still more their enemy and in that case they would not be able to sleep peacefully in these parts i told them at the same time that i should expect their chief on the next morning on which their speaker intimated that their tribe were encamped long way off and pahajuka had sent them down from there but when the sun rose the tenth time he would be here i promised to wait him on the appointed morning and then the savages rode away and soon disappeared behind the last hill on the prairie whatever might be the results of the impending conference i was resolved to make every effort to produce if possible more pleasant relations between myself and the comanches by far the greater number of indians who visited our country belonged to this nation and the incessant hostilities with them became the more annoying to in proportion my cattle and property became augmented it was now winter and in addition to our domestic tasks we principally employed our time in hunting bears i greatly needed their grease on the arrival of the expected new settlers and could sell it very proﬁtably the sake of fun we also went out singly at night to shoot deer by the system of so usual in the eastern states but which i rarely employed although it is remarkably productive this hunt is effected on horseback the sportsman carries over his left shoulder stout stick about six feet in length to the upper end of which with high rim is fastened in this pan he lays some pieces of which when kindled burn long time with very bright ﬂame and allow him distinctly to see every object long distance while himself seeing nothing of the ﬁre behind his back deer antelopes and other animals when they see the moving ﬁre hurry up to it in order to satisfy their curiosity the hunter can see the animal eyes glistening at distance of the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https while he is scarce visible himself he rides nearer up to distinguish the body more clearly but generally contents himself with the eyes which he takes his mark and dischar ges his riﬂe at them owing to the light which falls from behind on the barrel and the back of the sight most careful aim can be taken and rule you can ride up to within thirty or forty yards of the animal even after the shot i have seen the unhit animals only run few yards and then stop curiously so that i have been able to give them second barrel over the horse quarters large wet blanket or hide is laid to protect it from the sparks or coals that might fall out of the pan it is the easiest way of killing game and in places not thickly covered with wood this mode of hunting promises an extraordinary charm through the wondro us illumination which the ﬁre produces on the green foliage whole forest may be depopulated in this way and hence i regard it quite unworthy of true sportsman all that we now and then went the sake of the fun but never shot till we could plainly distinguish the animal which prevented any butchery in the old states where people only care about killing the game this mode of hunting is almost exclusively employed and in those regions where game still exists you rarely enter planter house without seeing pan behind the door very frequently though in those inhabited districts the nightly sportsman is disagreeably undeceived by the yell of agony from his own steer mule or horse which he has attracted from its pasture by its ﬁre the ﬂashing eyes not tell the nature of the animal i remember going one night on foot with the pan on my shoulder round my ﬁeld to check the deer which were doing great damage to my beans suddenly i saw pair of large eyes gleaming before which slowly approached and constantly became larger and more ﬁery they came slowly along the fence to and seemed such height from the ground that i could not imagine to what fabulously large anim al they belonged they stopped but i did not know whether at distance of twenty or ﬁfty yards i ﬁred heard something dash across the ﬁeld and the eyes disappeared the next morning i went with trusty to the spot where i had ﬁred and we soon found dead lynx which had come toward in the darkness walking on the fence in those parts where the cattle graze at liberty this sport is consequently most dangerous you run much chance of killing your best horse deer or tiger we also had great fun this winter in destroying the wolves which we pursued in every possible way they were very dangerous to my cattle the easiest way of killing them is poisoning with strychnine but i did not employ it near my house through fear of hurting my dogs this object we always rode some miles away threw fresh on the ground and trailed it after us by long rope thus we rode past the wood out into the prairie where we pulled up the paunch at spot which displayed little grass and then scattered the little lumps of poisoned meat this was always done in the evening and on the next morning we rode back to the spot where we found the dead wolves lying about which rarely went hundred yards from the spot where they devoured the meat it caused us greater pleasure however to capture them in traps quantity of which we always had set round the fort they were made in the following way stout posts were driven into the ground forming square of about four feet and inside of them other longer posts were laid till they formed walls about three feet in height we then drove four more posts into the angles of the walls and fastened them securely to those outside in these chests we placed ﬂooring so that the captured animal could not escape by scratching up the ground and on the top of the cage cover weighed down in front by large stones the other end of the cover was fastened to the trap with very strong withes and the forepart was raised prop was placed under it which fell at slight touch and caused the cover to shut at night we trailed fresh from long distance to the trap threw meat in then dragged it to the next trap and so on till all were baited we caught great many wolves in this way which we often took home alive and let the dogs hunt them to death on the prairie in order to take them alive out of the trap we used an iron fork which we struck into the ground over the wolf neck and then pressed its head down till we had fastened its feet it is remarkable what an innate dislike dogs entertain these animals frequently when i had killed one of them whose skin was not worth taking home i merely cut off its nose and threw it on the ground near the fort upon which all my dogs gathered round and kept up the most fearful barking hours at length the day arrived on which the chief of the comanches had appointed his visit and at about 7 three of these savages came up to the fort to inform that their leader was encamped distance off in the woods of the leone and expected there i asked tiger advice and he advised to ride out the comanches meant hone stly i therefore saddled and rode accompanied by tiger one of my colonists and trusty out to the indians the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https them they could ride on and i would follow we soon reached the spot where pahajuka was encamped and i noticed to my satisfaction that only squaw and single man were seated at his ﬁre i dismounted left my man with the horses and walked up to the chief who now rose and folded in his arms twice then his squaw came to and evidenced her friendship in the same way pahajuka was man of about sixty years of age of middle height plump and possessing very pleasant kindly appearance he was entirely dressed in had very ﬁne beads round his neck and in his raven black hair he had fastened tail of plaited buffalo hair ﬁve feet in length on which dozen round silver plates four inches in width were fastened he wore this tail hanging over his right arm and it seemed to if this ornament was only worn on solemn occasions i never saw it again though i met this savage frequently the squaw was powerful stout extremely pleasant matron who appeared to take great interest in establishing friendly relations between us she was very talkative and the interpreter could scarce keep pace with her tongue after the ﬁrst explanations why they desired my friendship the squaw fetched several sorts of dried meat in leathern bags spread them on buffalo hide and begged to take the meal of friendship with them tiger too sat down and my other companion was obliged to the same it tasted very poor to us whose tongues were spoiled by the culinary art still we did our best and the same with the pipe which paha juka sent round afterwards when these forms had been gone through the old squaw packed up her traps again on her mule and mounted it while the chief seated himself on similar animal which was of very rare beauty we now rode followed by the indians to the fort where the latter camped outside while pahajuka and his squaw sat down in our parlour i had coffee and pastry served up to them both of which it seemed they had taken before and they disposed of them heartily then i gave them both pipe and tobacco and then the conversation began in which the interpreter services were greatly called upon they told that before i came into these parts the comanches had always been able to sleep here quietly and their children and cattle had grown fat but since i had been here their hearts had always beaten with terror and they were unable to sleep at their ﬁre at night they now wished to make peace with and when they came to carry their weapons into my house and fold their arms so that their cattle might graze in peace and their children grow fat after this affair had been long discussed and all possible assurances of friendship given on both sides i turned the conversation to my guests and heard that pahajuka was supreme chief of the whole comanche nation and his wife person of importance in all consultations the old lady was very sensible and really amiable she moved with great deal of gracefulness and was constantly in the merriest temper she laughed and joked with her husband if she were young girl and if he reproached her it by serious look she turned laughingly to and asked if she looked so old not to be allowed joke at dinner the two old people behaved very properly although they could not quite manage to eat with knife and fork and frequently helped with their ﬁngers they enjoyed everything excessively and said they would take with them bit from each dish i was curious whether they would sleep in the fort or prefer the camp of their people the evening came and after we had supped and food had been given the indians outside i prepared bed the old couple in the parlour put up two tallow candles them and told them when one was burnt out to light the other candles delighted them uncommonly then i intimated to them that i always closed the fort at night they must tell their indians they were quite satisﬁed and lay down on the unusual bed laughing and jesting i chained up all the dogs during the night to prevent any disturbance of the peace and was awakened at very early hour by my new friends rapping at my door they had both slept famously and assured that ere long all the chiefs of their nation would come to make friendship with and wherever comanches lived i could now ride and lie down to sleep in safety the old people had something so honest in their manner that i longer doubted the truth of the sentiments they expressed and though i never carelessly trusted to the honesty of isolated indians of this tribe the assurance of the couple was conﬁrmed and i was never again engaged in hostilities with these people my guests remained three days with after which i dismissed them with numerous triﬂing presents consisting of articles of clothing coloured handkerchiefs tobacco couple of blankets small i accompanied them on their ﬁrst day journey slept with them that night and then took leave with promises of speedy meeting afterwards they the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier

my alabama friends left and i had heard nothin g more of them when one morning the watchman told with great joy that long train of men draught cattle and carts was coming down the river i soon recognised through my glass young lasar and his cousin henry surrounded by large number of negroes the train moved very slowly onwards and did not stop before the fort some hours when i greeted the most heartily john had sixty odd strong negroes with him twelve of whom were intended and brought stores and tools with him on ﬁve large waggons each drawn by six oxen he had made the journey by steamer viâ new orleans and partly on the rio grande when they landed he bought the draught cattle and had reached without any accident i kept them few days with to let them rest and then proceeded with them across to mustang river where they camped on the ground selected by mr lasar they chose their spot in the advance woods where the soil was rich and loose and the trouble of blazing the trees and ploughing round them was saved the negroes advanced in their job with almost incredible rapidity and in short time ﬁeld of some hundred acres was cleared ploughed and fenced up to that time the negroes lay at nights under tents or in their carts but now they built blockhouses and put up fences in which the mules and horses rested at night john rode over to regularly to spend the night with and on sunday we hunted in the neighbourhood he was good shot laid aside the the riﬂe and pistols and soon learned to use these weapons excellently my life from this time underwent change i had twelve negroes at my disposal and must so employ them not only to get their hire out of them but also attain the object which i had hired them namely making proﬁt with this the careless happy life which had surrounded years far from humanity was at an end and the god of gold with his thousand sufferings hatefulnesses and sorrows began to establish his despotic rule even here i now made second extensive ﬁeld which was sown with maize by the side of my old one while in the latter i planted cotton this plant does not ﬂourish in new ground i took young oxen from the pasturage and forced them into the strange yoke my mules which had hitherto only fetched at rare intervals our few wants from the settlements were now attached to the plough at daybreak and forced with the whip to toil till sunset my colonists had so much to all day that they went to bed at an early hour and we longer sat of yore cozily round the table talking and jesting about the unimportant events which had occurred during the day in word the whole colony felt the change peace had departed and made room the restless activity of civilization tiger did not like the change although i carefully avoided everything which might render his residence among us less agreeable he was now obliged to ride out hunting alone while we required far more meat than before still i frequently tore myself away and went with him three or four days into the desert in order to recall past times if only temporarily summer arrived with rich harvest and with it again fresh uninterrupted toil my neighbours had also been rewarded their exertions by an immense maize crop and employed the late summer in building larger houses the reception of lasar and his family strangers came to prospect the land in our neighbourhood and all went away contented with an assurance that they would soon settle here among them were many unpleasant characters but i consoled myself with the thought that they would not become near neighbours of mine i possessed all the forest land down the river so far it was suitable cultivation and up stream lasar had purchased large district adjoining my frontier they could not settle on the open the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https water or wood and hence they must proceed to the streams farther north where i was tolerably out of their reach in autumn lasar arrived with his wife two daughters and younger son and brought with him about ﬁve hundred negroes number of ﬁne horses and splendid cattle our social circumstances thus advanced stage this highly educated and amiable family offered pleasures which appeared to quite new and attractive and i did not reﬂect that i had bidden farewell to them some few years back through sheer weariness the dress was now frequently changed the costume of former days the razors looked up an old negress hired who knew how to wash and iron and imperceptibly many gotten follies and considerations crept into our simple natural life civilization however had set its foot in our paradise once all and nothing was able to oppose its rapid advance the winter brought several large planters to mustang river above lasar estate and the land toward the northern rivers was occupied by others while to the south of us the settlements of the rio grande also increased all these were persons who occupied large districts by which the disagreeable small neighbourhood was avoided still few squatters had already settled here and there on the less valuable small lots between our estates and among them were some most unsatisfactory persons one sunday morning i was riding several miles above the fort through the woods in the direction of the leone i had thrown the reins on czar neck and was great distance from the river bank when trusty stopped and looked round to with growl i calle d him back and rode slowly up the small elevation whence i could look down at the river to my surprise i saw there pretty young woman with man arm round her waist sitting on the bank where they had made coffee over small ﬁre and were now comfortably drinking it not far from them powerful horse was grazing and close by stood cart which contained some household articles and provisions the long single riﬂe lay by the man side and couple of deer legs and turkey were hanging on the tree behind him hilloh sir you are on indian territory i shouted to the stranger and he hurriedly leaped up riﬂe in hand but i rode up to him with smile and blamed his recklessness remarking that if i had been an indian he would longer be among the living i was surprised at the beauty of the female whose raven shining hair formed an admirable contrast with the deep carmine of her cheeks and lips and the transparent alabaster of her delicate skin she also rose and looked at with her large blue eyes from under her long lashes loose light dress was fastened round her waist by red silk handkerchief and advantageously displayed her tall graceful ﬁgure and little feet thrust into light shoes of hide i asked whither they were going and if they were acquainted with the country the stranger said that he intended to settle in the neighbourhood he had followed the wagon trail of the planter who had settled on the mustang and was told by him that more land was to be had here hence he resolved to go farther north and look farm the restless shy look of the man displeased and hence i did not invite him to rest with and lay in fresh provisions but wished him luck in his undertaking and continued my journey i heard afterwards that he was living twenty miles to the north of that the woman he had with him was the wife of prosperous planter in kentucky whom he had murdered they ﬂed together and reached the desert where human justice could not follow them some years later i saw him again near his small log hut wretched and wasted and shortly after he died of an arrow wound in the chest which an indian dealt him such persons unfortunately are always among the ﬁrst pioneers of civilization and disturb the social relations of the borderers although our changed mode of life offered many pleasant and interesting hours still i was unable to drive from my heart the yearning the old utter independence which had almost grown second nature frequently when i rode at an early hour through the dark woods the sounds of my neighbour axe aroused from my dreams or when i rode over the wide prairies where i was accustomed to see the endless expanse covered with grazing herds of buffalo i now only noticed here and there small bands of these animals passing hurriedly and timidly if frightened at having strayed among the settlements the antelope that ornament of the prairies could only be seen on the most remote heights the deer had remained more constant to their but they too had grown more restless and attentive to the heightened danger the other side of the rio grande was less changed and game will be protected there many years to come by the insurmountable mountains that surround the valleys but it the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https much greater outlay of time to seek the game there which formerly animated the immediate vicinity of my residence tiger was beginning to grow impatient and often said to that the game in our vicinity had now got too many eyes and feet and he would go northwards to the great mountains before spring arrived long time past i had been desirous of passing through the rocky mountains but never was the yearning greater to throw myself once more into the arms of virgin nature than at this moment when civilization drew back by force into its sphere in spite of the repeated representations which reason and my material interests urged against such an undertaking i resolved to start in february these unknown countries one of my men was an excellent farmer and in every way deserving of my entire conﬁdence so that i could with safety place the management of my settlement in his hands while one of the other two of the name of königstein insisted on accompanying to which i readily assented he had given thousand proofs of his ﬁdelity and devotedness with these qualities so valuable he united determination and courage which nothing could daunt and i have often seen him in the most desperate circumstances laughingly defy the danger john lasar was enthusiastic when i told him of my intention he earnestly desired to accompany and begged to procure his father consent the enterprise appeared to the old gentleman rather daring and he made all possible objections but he at last yielded to our entreaties and equipped his son with brace of splendid revolvers while i supplied him with one of my double guns königstein was armed with double riﬂe but also carried in leathern sheath fastened to his saddle four gun two pistols in his belt and two in his holsters while we were engaged in making our preparations the great journey several of lasar friends arrived from alabama among them being two young men macdonald and clifton who came to with john and earnestly asked my leave to form the party i was glad to have them their exterior was very pleasing and our number was still small journey in which thousands of dangers and fatigues awaited us we worked hard at getting ready in which john elder sister materially assisted us new suits of were made two small tents prepared and large sheet varnished to make it water and thus protect our baggage from the rain then biscuits were baked coffee salt pepper and sugar stamped into bladders small cask ﬁlled with cognac cartridges made and our saddlery inspected in short there were thousand matters to attend to and thus the last days of january found us with all hands full of work our expedition while we had appointed february 1 the start on the last day of january there was grand review in front of the fort where we appeared fully equipped start in order to inspect everything and discover anything that might still be wanting an invention of mine caused us great amusement it was transportable boat to convey our traps across large rivers consisting of large round very ﬁrmly sewn piece of linen resembling an open umbrella put on its point the edge was covered by very broad leather in which was drawing cord the linen was thickly covered with linseed varnish and hence quite waterproof when in use eight stout sticks were laid crossways with the ends thrust into the edge of the linen so that they expande d it and drew the running cord tight we expanded it carried it to the leone placed antonio in it and tiger swam through the river on his piebald and dragged the vessel after him to the other bank and back again while antonio was not touched by single drop of wet after the sticks had been taken out the linen was rolled up and formed small bale which was packed with other articles on the mule i had seen something similar among the indians who take this purpose fresh buffalo hide and stretch out in similar way with staves our equipment was hence perfect it could be journey on which the traps can only be carried on mules and the second of february was appointed the start while we would take leave of the lasars on the ﬁrst pleased and full of enthusiasm about our enterprise we spent the day and on saying bye in the evening lasar promised to accompany us with his family and spend the ﬁrst night of our camp life with us the next morning found us busied at an early hour in arranging our baggage and dividing it among our cattle czar displayed his full beauty and strength and expressed by loud neighing his delight at starting this time with so large party königstein saddled the himself who also looked the picture of strength and proudly raised his long black tail over his croup tiger piebald impatiently stamped with his forefeet and responded with neigh to every mark of joy from czar and the antonio saddled himself the mare and decorated its bridle and saddle with gay ribbons and strips of leather honest jack was loaded with provisions and other effects which were placed in two baskets while our tent was laid atop and the whole covered with the waterproof linen trusty was still chained up and attentively watched our movements but knew already that the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https going to accompany i frequently spoke to him and had put him on his new broad collar we had almost completed our preparations when we saw long train of riders coming from mustang river over the prairie led by gentleman on powerful and lady on black horse they were our friends from the mustang at their head rode old lasar on ﬁne virginian thoroughbred and by his side pranced stallion who did honour to his pure andulasian descent from his muzz le to the tip of his ﬂying tail and proud of the load he carried on his back bowed his strength before the delicate hand which guided him by dazzlingly white bridle julia lasar eldest daughter was the mistress of this splendid animal her tall graceful form her brilliant black locks falling under her tall hat her dark eyes overshadowed by long lashes and the long white feather which waved in her hat reminded of her noble ancestry in the days of ferdinand and isabella behind them rode john lasar by his mother side on chestnut mare of pure arab blood then came the youngest daughter and the youngest son macdonnell and clifton several neighbours from the mustang and lastly loaded with number of mules the caravan came over the last height to the fort and was joyfully welcomed by us cup carved out of buffalo horn ﬁlled with sauterne was handed to the guests on horseback and then also emptied by us to the toast of pleasant journey and fortunate return and we at once took leave of home an indeﬁnite period the end of our journey we had temporarily arranged was the highest yet known point on the rocky mountains the bighorn which is situated in the of latitude and to which we had distance of about eight hundred miles to ride our road ran eastward from the mountains and did not ascend the rio grande along whose bank is the road through the several old spanish forts which begins at el paso del norté and passes through santa fé to taos if it is borne in mind that the entire distance had hardly ever been trodden by white men and that consequently settlement existed there that other roads led through the rocky mountains and almost impenetrable forests except buffalo paths that our journey would be made through the grounds of the most savage and hostile cannibal will be felt that the moment of parting was an earnest one the charm however which dangers privations and difﬁculties possess thought that entirely new scenes of nature whole new world was about to be presented to us rendered the light and so we turned our horses away from home toward these unknown regions tiger led the ﬁle and at once commenced his duties guide i followed by the side of julia lasar whose proud steed appeared to be jealous of czar then came the other friends in pairs till our completed the train trusty bounded before us and expressed by barking his delight at the large party which was novelty to him little way below the fort we crossed the river where each watered his horse and then proceeded towards the wood on the opposite side along narrow buffalo path i cut away the creepers and vines hanging over the path in which tiger helped this was the ﬁrst time it had been ridden by white ladies on reaching the prairie on the other side of the wood where the grass was still very short and offered impediment to our horses we rode in frequently varying groups galloped from one to the other tried the speed of our horses and shortened the length of the road by jokes and laughter we had chosen turkey creek our and rode at quick pace in order to reach our by daylight at noon we made short halt at an afﬂuent of the leone to give our ladies time to dine and at the same time allow our horses to graze during this short delay the ﬁlled with wine was passed round and was accompanied by singing and merriment one appeared to reﬂect that the next morning would bring parting more or less hard us all but all yielded to their gay humour without check at about one we held the ladies them on their horses again and ere long the whole party were moving northward the short rest had done the cattle good and they hastened in quick amble across the prairie which was already beginning to be adorned with its spring beauty the breeze was fresh the sky clear and diaphanous and everything around seemed to be powerfully cheered by the splendid weather snorti ng and neighing our horses pranced after tiger ﬂying piebald and right and left amazed deer and at greater distance rapid antelopes leaped up while riding through narrow coppice we suddenly saw before us at great distance herd of grazing buffaloes who moment gazed at us in astonishment and did not appear to have formed decision to whether they should bolt or stand an attack loud hunting shout ran along our ranks and i saw on all sides pistols and revolvers being torn from the belts in vain did i strive to master the enthusiasm of my comrades and hold them back by the observation that we were heavily loaded were not hunting but commencing long journey the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https we must spare the strength of our horses away the cavalry ﬂew after the piebald i could hardly hold back my impetuous steed by the side of miss julia black whom the very sharp bit alone prevented from bolting till the lady uttered wish to follow the chase these were the ﬁrst buffaloes she had seen her younger sister joined her and thus only lasar and his wife the negroes and pack animals remained behind on ﬂew the noble black stallion guided by the steady hand of his young mistress from whose hat the white feather ﬂoated while the ends of the long red scarf tied round her riding habit ﬂuttered behind her i held czar in little so not to excite the black horse too much while julia sister pony followed us at some distance and behind it honest jack came panting whom the negroes had been unable to keep in the ranks of the pack cattle we were soon close to the ﬂying herd whose thundering hoofs drowned the sound of my comrades pistols we dashed past an enormous buffalo which had sunk seriously wounded with its hind quarters on the ground and standing on its huge was holding its broad shaggy head towards us immediately after we saw another quit the ranks in front of us and dash after john who was ﬂying before it on his fast mare i shouted to julia to check her horse in which she succeeded after some efforts and we now rode up to the wounded buffalo which with head down was preparing action we stopped about ﬁfty yards from it when john who saw that i had raised my riﬂe shouted to not to ﬁre he wished to kill the animal himself he ﬁred and the buffalo rolled over in crashing fall our comrades also collected in the distance round one of the animals which being wounded stood at bay and was soon killed then they rode back with shouts of triumph and stopped with us till and lasar came up the ladies were delighted with the savage though splendid scene and confessed that hunting possessed an attraction which might easily render man passionately fond of it we left the negroes behind with few pack animals to take the hides and best meat from the killed buffaloes then ordered them to follow our trail and rode on to the on turkey creek which we reached at sunset lasar spacious marquee was quickly put up and the long pennants hoisted over it in front of this tent large ﬁre was lit and buffalo hides spread round it on which the ladies reclined we attended to the horses carried our baggage to other ﬁres at which we intended to spend the night and then gradually collected in front of lasar tent where the coffee was already boiling and various kettles supper were standing in the ashes the negroes too soon rode up with cattle and each of us put some of the meat on spit in front of the ﬁre or laid to roast the night was magniﬁcent not breath of air stirred the dark leaves of the primæval evergreen live oaks which spread out their long horizontal branches over our heads between them the moon in its ﬁrst quarter spread its silvery light over us and the sky was covered with twinkling stars in the dark distance we could hear the notes of nocturnal birds of passage which proved to us by their northward ﬂight that the winter there could longer be very severe till these notes were lost in the rustling of the adjacent stream which ﬁlled up every pause in our animated conversation we sat long time round the ﬁre till the ladies retired inside the tent and we proceeded to our several ﬁres and wrapped ourselves in our buffalo robes trusty alone still sat with his nose in the air when my eyes closed and it was his voice woke when one of lasar negroes rose i also leaped up led he felt particular inclination to the grass took my riﬂe and went to the river where i could hear the gobbling of the turkeys it was still too dark to shoot with certainty when i got under the lofty trees which stood on its banks on their highest branches the birds were sitting and saluting the dawn i listened to them long time ere i raised my riﬂe and sent bullet through one of them it fell from branch to branch and startled the others which ﬂew off noisily while the hundreds standing on the trees around timidly thrust out their long necks but would not leave their night quarters the cock had fallen into the river and was ﬂapping its wings violently in the quiet waters so i cut stick with hook in order to pull it in i had scarce secured it ere platoon ﬁre burst forth all round from my comrades riﬂes whom my shot had aroused from sleep and now ran up to take part in the morning sport they produced terrible slaughter among the poor foolish birds and each of them carried at least two to camp i went down the river little way however to have bathe when i returned all were busy and seeking by occupation to avoid beginning conversation which must necessarily hinge on the approaching the ladies helped in getting breakfast ready the young men packed up their traps the negroes struck the tent and rolled it up and old lasar went from one to the other offering his advice the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https nothing more was left but to eat breakfast saddle the horses and say we silently collected round the large ﬁre coffee was swallowed and with it many tear which involuntarily ran from the eyes one ate properly even tiger thoughtfully scraped bone with his knife solely by this employment to make the heavy time pass more quickly at last feelings could longer be found vent in tears words and sobs and without further delay we exchanged assurances and signs of affection and friendship when all were mounted we turned our horses toward the river waving farewell to our friends long we could see them we soon passed through the wood on to the prairie which ran along its north side and halted to have last inspection of our small corps i who had been elected captain now assumed my duties from this moment our journey really began i examined how the goods were divided among the mules of which animals two others accompanied us besides jack sam and lizzy whom john lasar had supplied it is important on such journey to take the greatest care that the animals are not galled by the saddles or baggage the best protection against this is thick blanket of woven horsehair which is laid on the animal back under the saddle the hair through its elasticity always offers passage the air and hence avoids the great amount of heat produced by woollen cloths when i had convinced myself that everything was in order i called my party attention to the fact that strict obedience to my regulations was indispensably necessary our common safety tiger was entrusted with the guidance and always rode about hundred yards ahead while one of us formed the by the mules i had with tiger long consultation to the route we should follow and while i proposed to keep more to the he insisted on due north direction i was of opinion that the lowest passage to the north would be found at the spot where the rio grande mountains sloped down to the east and joined the san saba mountains while on the other hand tiger asserted that the mountain chain could be passed most easily due north near the sources of the rio colorado it is remarkable with what certainty the indians know the nature and course of mountains and rivers well the climatic circumstances of the country and judge distances the sense of locality is marvellously developed among the savages without being able to explain why it is so the savage will indicate in an any exam ination of trees rocks exact direction of the point he wishes to reach animals and especially horses and mules obey the same instinct frequently when i have been hunting buffaloes in all directions over the prairie and evening warned about returning home i have been in doubt to the direction in which the fort lay i certainly knew that instance i was on the north side of the leone and hence must ride southwards but i could not determine whether i ought to proceed farther east or west and an incorrect course might easily bring to the river miles above or below the fort the horizon was bounded by the sky if i were at sea and not hill or forest reminded of any familiar point in such cases i laid the bridle on my horse neck let him graze awhile and then told him to go on though without touching the bridle the horse missing the usual guidance looked around him few minutes with upraised head and then went in straight line homewards remembering this i followed tiger advice and went due north the weather was glorious and the sun poured down its cheering beams upon us from clear sky with jokes and anecdotes our hearts ﬁlled with expectation of the marvels that lay before us we trotted after the piebald who appeared pleased his master to leave the civilization of the pale faces behind him it is true that the grassy plains over which we rode were not spangled with ﬂower of every hue in spring or autumn but all that the illimitable expanse did our sight good while we were greeted by few budding ﬂowers even though the coppices rising every now and then from the prairie were not clothed in the luxuriant dark foliage of other seasons still they did not display that picture of utter death which the traveller ﬁnds during winter in the forests of northern climes the soil of the forests is at this season covered with wild oats growing to height of four feet the scrub consists principally of evergreen bushes above it rise many varieties of trees of moderate height which never entirely lose their glistening leaves and these again are crowned by the different families of the magnolia whic h not lose their ornament either evergreen creepers climb to the highest branches and hang down from the airy height in long streamers which serve plaything to the slightest breath of air four ﬁne days we passed over these extensive plains from whose lap higher and steeper hills gradually rise until the latter form into chain and impart to the landscape the character of mountainous scenery we were among the spurs of the san saba mountains which not

the mountains with considerable difﬁculty when one afternoon we reached splendid pasturage where we resolved to let our cattle rest it was at the same time warm we had doffed our leathern jackets and felt very comfo rtable when we found thick cedar wood on the western side of this meadow and were able to rest in its shade we had scarce lit our ﬁre to prepare dinner when tiger sprang up pointed to the north where several small clouds were rising and then laid his ear on the ground hurricane fearful storm frequent in the rocky mountains is coming up we must place our cattle in safety he said he leapt up and we all set to work dragging our traps to the other side of the meadow where low rock hung over and covered considerable space after carrying across our traps partly on our animals partly in our arms we hastened to collect large supply of dry wood we could in which an old trunk lying near the rock was of great service to us this was cut into several pieces which were rolled unde r the stone roof and ﬁre was lit against one of them while our horses were quietly grazing we had scarce completed these preparations when the sky grew dark and we heard roaring and hissing which quickly increased with the growing obscurity we brought our cattle under the rock and fastened them to pickets we drove into the ground the cloud grew heavier and darker with each moment and rolled over the mountain crests in southerly direction with the roar of the wind was blended dull thunder and an icy cold spread over the ground these were merely the announcers of the frightful hurrica ne which now dashed down from the rocky mountain s and announced its approach with crash that shook the earth the thunder was so deafening that we could not hear each other speak and standing silently by our trembling horses we watched the storm drive the clouds of icy rain in almost horizontal direction over our heads and level the cedar so that the roots stood up instead of the crowns the cold increased every moment and ere long everything was covered with thick crust of ice while the rain was frozen and hurtled round us in heavy hail the ground shook under us and the peals of thunder were repeated by thousand echoes on the sides of the mountain under these circumstances we could consider our situation fortuna one if we had been surprised by this storm we might easily have fallen victims to it or at least we must have lost our animals which human strength could have mastered in the icy rain though pressed closely round the ﬁre and wrapped in our buffalo robes we shivered from cold the storm howled till late in the evening at which time though dense rain fell the wind had sunk and by nine the clouds broke too dead frozen landscape surrounded us the moon bright light shone down into our frozen gully into palace of glass and wherever we looked we saw transparent masses of ice while the reﬂection of our ﬁre glittered in brilliant colours on the crystals of ice near us not breath of air stirred and had it not been the numbing cold and the glistening ice around to prove the reality of this fearful scene we might easily have been tempted to regard it dream our cattle too felt the cold greatly and trembled all over we covered them with all the blankets we could spare and i took special care of czar whom i fastened up near the ﬁre i could we made tremendous blaze in order to render the cold to some extent endurable one of us was obliged in turn to watch at the ﬁre during the night while the others lay round it and stretched out their feet to it morning arrived and with it we welcomed the sun which the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https the mountains in the blue sky everything glittered and shone around if the world were covered with sheet of glass and brilliants the grass plot was hidden by layer of transparent pieces of ice which brilliantly reﬂected the sunbeams every bush every shrub glittered with the hues of the rainbow and the ice almost blinded our eyes the sunbeams gradually rendered the cold more endurable we crept out from under our rock and tried to warm ourselves by jumping we were compelled to leave our horses tied up the grass was covered with ice even where there was drift we could not go up to the spring which bubbled up in gorge below the destroyed cedar because the path leading down to it was too smooth and slippery hence we ﬁlled our pots with hailstones and thus procured water our breakfast the ice disappeared again quickly it had fallen on the unusual ground it was only where the hail had drifted in lar ge layers that the masses of ice lay longer period we resolved to remain here till the next day because both our horses and ourselves required rest my comrades wished to obtain permission to go out hunting tiger had already done so without asking my leave he paid little heed to our laws john lasar and mac we called macdonnell the sake of shortness went off in different directions the former followed the spring which joined stream about mile from us whose banks were covered with dense under growth while mac went north into the hills the rest of us remained in camp shortly before sunset mac returned told us he had shot large deer and two turkeys close at hand put on sam and went with antonio to fetch the game he had scarce left ere tiger came in and triumphantly informed us that he had killed big bear in its lair and we must go and fetch it in the morning it was dark when mac and antonio returned with the game and john had not turned up yet which rendered us rather anxious still i had heard him ﬁre several times so he could not be far off but i was afraid that an accident had happened to him it was now getting on nine we repeatedly ﬁred our guns and though it was so late tiger went down the stream and raised his hunting yell but received reply at night it was impossible to follow his trail so we lay down to sleep but at daybreak we swallowed our breakfast and prepared to go in search of john i took tiger and mac with and told antonio to follow us on jack trusty trotted ahead and we had not gone many hundred yards from camp when john came riding down between the hills we were very anxious to learn what had caused him to spend the night away and he now told us that he had got among herd of peccaris in the wood and after shooting one of these animals was compelled to seek shelter in tree which they invested although he shot several of them they did not retreat and hence he was obliged to wait daybreak of course he had passed the night in the cold shelterles s and was now very anxious rest he rolled himself in his buffalo robe while i with tiger antonio and mac left camp in order to fetch the bear we took jack and lizzy with us to carry ropes and an axe we ascended the hills on the east about half an hour till tiger went round lofty rock and showed us small round opening about six feet above the spot where we were standing tiger crept into the hole with lasso to noose the bear throat he soon came out again and we all three tried but in vain to drag it out with the rope we harnessed jack in front and tiger crept in again to the bear to push now matters went better and the black monster soon appeared in the opening and rolled down the little slope to us jack and lizzy startle d at the sudden apparition leapt on one side but were soon paciﬁed and we began skinning and breaking up the animal i was anxious to have look at the interior of its abode and crawled into the entrance which was at ﬁrst very narrow but then widened and at length became two walls leaning together at the top but about eight feet apart at the bottom the ﬂoor of the cave was covered with cedar branches on which the bear reposed i lighted and was thus enabled to examine the cave narrowly tiger had crept up to the bear with lighted wisp of grass in his hand shot it in the left eye and killed it on the spot we packed the best of the meat and fat well the skin on our mules and returned to camp where we arrived at about ten we packed up and were under way again by two following tiger who led us through the mountain passes which here became much steeper we rode nearly the whole day up hill and only at intervals came to small on which our cattle rested while trees grew rarer here and there small clump of cedars rose from gorge or an isolated group of prickly yuccas decorated the rocks and at times mimosa hung over our path from crevice plant whose three feet long narrow leaves grew out of the rock in tufts and are used by the indians plaiting baskets and mats was very common here in the spring it has whitish yellow ﬂower which grows on stalk nearly six feet high and through its graceful form is real ornament to the the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https tiring ride the sun began to decline and illumined the red bare granite mountains that now rose before us and which we could still have reached but we found grass and water here and our cattle longed rest we halted and made our camp we were all hungry and tired and hence enjoyed the capital bear meat and stretched ourselves before the ﬁre in our buffalo robes where we awaited the morning without any disturbance refreshed and strengthened we gazed down from our elevation at the dense clouds which ﬁlled the valleys below us while the dark sky in the east over the mountains continually became redder until all at once the sun appeared like burning ball over the distant misty blue range of hills it shot few golden red beams over the awakening earth and quickly rising poured its ﬁery stream of light over the world from the sea of mist beneath us the sharp howling of the jaguars reached us and we saw long train of rapid antelopes probably ﬂying before these beasts of prey darting over hill that emer ged from it we had soon ﬁnished breakfast and the mist in the valleys had not entirely dispersed when we guided our horses up the hill of granite before us the air was so cool that we buttoned up our jackets and pulled over our laps the part of our hanging over the holsters before us the mountains illumined by the morning sun rose ever higher and higher while the valleys between them were wooded and seemed to contain great many evergreen oaks our path ran at rather great height along precipices and it was not till noon that we crossed ridge where valley ran across before us and we were compelled to go down to it this valley which was not more than three miles broad surprised us by its peculiarly beautiful appearance it was literally covered with rocks of the most gigantic size which lay near and on each other if rained down from the sky in some places these were so piled up that at distance they resembled castles with their turrets and keeps between these red masses of stone groups of live oaks emer ged and here and there small ponds could be seen glistening we had long time been enjoying this strange scene and were on the point of going down to the rocky valley when loud yelling and barking was heard on our right beneath us which rang through the valley if raise d by thousand animals it rapidly drew nearer and on looking in the direction of the sound we saw at the foot of the precipice on which we were standing old buffalo dash past with pack of about ﬁfty white wolves at its heels the old fellow seemed very tired and with ﬂying mane raised its weary feet in its gallop spurred on by the yells of its bloodthirsty pursuers it soon disappe ared with its tormentors round the rock and far into the valley we heard the wild chase but certainly the hunted brute eventually fell prey to the furious band it is only at this season that the white wolves collect in large packs when they make very daring attacks on the largest animals and even man and many western hunter has before this fallen their victim we rode down into the valley following very buffalo path which ran between the blocks of granite some of which were tall house and at noon reached small stream in its centre which ran westward its water was clear like all the small streams in the west and was thronged with ﬁsh and turtle mac and clifton soon threw their lines in and fetched out the ﬁsh quickly the hook fell they had pulled out several cat and buffalo ﬁsh weighing twenty pounds apiece when mac hooked very large turtle and was afraid lest it might break his line john who was known good ﬁsherman ran to his help took the rod from mac but slipped the turtle gave sharp tug down the steep bank and sank up to his head in the clear waters he was an excellent swimmer like all americans at once came up and darted after the rod which was hurriedly following the stream we threw him lasso and pulled him and it out then we let down lasso which antonio managed to put over the turtle and we dragged it ashore it weighed some thirty pounds and afforded us dinner with the ﬁsh our horses had here excellent grazing grounds which are much larger than they had appeared to us from the mountains and we did not wish to hasten our journey and reach the north too soon where the vegetation was still dead we resolved to rest here few days still the stream might perhaps swell rapidly we thought it better to pass it and camp higher up it was about ﬁfty yards wide and rather rapid and the buffalo path on which we were went down into it at such pitch that it was difﬁcult to convey our traps across tiger and i consequently went up the stream in search of spot easier of access we had hardly gone mile between the rocks when we saw four large elks grazing on meadow which did not notice us we were obliged to make lengthened ascent to get to windward and after fatiguing clamber up and round the stones we at length reached large rock about eighty yards from them we marked the animals we would ﬁre at and pulled triggers almost simultaneously tiger elk the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https but mine got up and went off with my second bullet which i gave it though it was in very bad case i sent trusty after it and heard him bark once and then become silent the distance at which i had heard him was too far to run the risk of seeking him and hence i sounded couple of notes on my huntin g horn to recall trusty while we broke up the elk the faithful dog came in bearing the signs of victory on his coat we followed him to the elk which he had captured and found it dead with its throat torn out we broke this one up too and then returned to the river to ﬁnd convenient passage about mile farther on we came to buffalo path so deeply trodden in the bank that it led with lower pitch to the water while on the other side the bank was low and the stream shallow we therefore hurried back to camp and marched up the river with our baggage tiger königstein and antonio rode off with two mules to fetch the game and rejoin us at the indicated spot on the river on reaching the latter we at once prepared to cross and on this occasio n our boat was used the ﬁrst time we unpacked it laid it on the grass and expanded it after which we carried it to the river and secured it with lasso to the bank it ﬂoated splendidly and was packed with those articles which must not get wet ere long our comrades came in with the game of which they had only taken the best joints antonio laid down his weapons and bags and rode into the river with the cord in his hand which was fastened to the coracle he got across all right but the water was too shallow to bring the boat close to bank and he had nothing to which he could fasten it in the stream but tiger soon helped by jumping into the river swimming across and carrying the articles severally on land then he brought back the coracle to us there were several more articles which must be protected from the wet and because he also wanted to cross the river with car go we packed our boat again and tiger laid his long riﬂe on the top though we dissuaded him from doing so he swam off and had reached the middle of the river when the riﬂe lost its balance through pull at the lasso and sank in the river before tiger could catch it he seemed however to care but little about the accident he laughed heartily and swam quietly across to antonio who held the boat while the indian carried its contents on land when it was unloaded it lay light feather on the water and was pulled up and fastened to the bank the young savage now leaped into the river again dived like stone at the middle of it and came up few seconds later with his riﬂe in his right hand while he swam with the left he mounted his piebald and we all followed him into the stream holding our weapons above our heads and reached the other bank all right when in camp on an elevation short distance from the bank tiger lit ﬁre and laid his riﬂe barrel in the ashes until the damp powder in it exploded and drove out the bullet after which he ran down with it to the river and cooled it in the water three days we rested our horses here and amused ourselves with ﬁshing and hunting which the valley afforded every oppor tunity all sorts of game swarmed and the covered ground enabled the hunter to approach it at night the whole valley seemed at times to be alive the tramping of ﬂying buffaloes rang on our ears which were close to the ground and the yells of hunting wolves could be distinctly heard now and then the terrible roar of the jaguar rang through the damp moonlit night and often so close to camp that we leaped up and seized our riﬂes while trusty replied with furio us barking the couguar or maneless american lion panther which is very frequent here often raised its plaintive cry while the hoarse dull growl of the bear echoed through the rocks countless owls ﬂoated spectrally with lengthened ﬂapping of their wings over this nocturnal landscape or glided like breath over our camp although we were frequently roused from sleep by this night life of the animal world it never disturbed us long so soon we convinced ourselves that there was danger us we fell asleep again during our stay we killed great quantity of game of which we only used the tidbits and thus behaved better than all these beasts of prey whose behaviour is after all far more chivalrous than ours on the morning we had appointed our departure i was awakened by the yell of jaguar i sprang up and heard it again at great distance from our camp our ﬁre was rather low and hence it had ventured rather nearer to us and our cattle had probably aroused its appetite blood i made tiger sign to go with took my riﬂe and crawled with trusty at my heels in the direction whence i had heard the jaguar the grass was very damp so that we could creep on without making the slightest noise we stopped and listened i fancied i had heard the pufﬁng sound i had previously noticed with these animals and which i believe is produced by their blowing out the dew which impedes their organs of scent i heard it again and not very far off when suddenly the sharp snapping yelp was raised close before us i hurried up some rocks and saw the huge creature standing on small clearing about thirty yards from the grass the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https it was standing was still rather dark and only the highest haulms display ed heavy drops of dew while the breaking dawn was reﬂected in the brute smooth spotted body i had fallen on one knee on the grass when the royal brute again raised its throat and uttered its murderous cry accompanied by blast of its hot breath which rose like strip of mist in the cold breeze it stood motionless i rested my arm that held the riﬂe on my knee and everything was so still that i could distin ctly hear my heart beat i now ﬁred and with an awful roar the brute ﬁrst rose straight in the air then turned over and writhed in the grass i had shot it near the heart and in few minutes it was quite dead tiger was greatly delighted with the splendid skin which he stripped off the brute with extraordinary skill and left the huge claws on it at about ten we were ready to start and rode through narrow gorge toward the hill ahead of us which soon brought us to wide plateau on which we and our horses were greatly troubled by the sun the breeze was very slight several days we proceeded without any great difﬁculty through the mountains which constantly surprised us both on the heights and in the valleys with the most beautiful landscapes the wildest rocks cascades uprooted trees piled on each other and then again the pleasantest and most peaceful valleys in which we every moment expected to see the smoking chimneys of settlement or slowly turning the mountains now grew much more impracticable their sides steeper and the valleys narrower our paths frequently led us from our course wound round the precipices and at times trended due south so that during day ride we only advanced few miles to the north we reached small river which wound through the rocks from the and which tiger told us was the rio colorado which ﬂowed in great curve through these mountains and texas to the gulf of mexico we had great difﬁculty in passing its steep banks and spent half day ere we found spot where we could ride through it on its banks we found enormous cypresses and live oaks and generally rich vegetation these regions and above all musquito grass which was of incalculable advantage our cattle we had hardly scaled the heights on the opposite side and were riding through narrow path between two not very steep slopes when we heard the barking of hunting dog rapidly advancing towards us i leaped from my horse and at the same moment there appeared on the precipice ﬂying antelope and at some distance behind it black and white spotted dog which only barked faintly at intervals the buck was very fast and took enormous leaps over the loose boulders and when it passed within hundred yards of us shower of bullets was sent after it it turned somersault and rolled down the precipice to our feet when we cut it up and divided the game among our mules the dog however halted on the rock with hanging tail and looked at us while thoughtfully then turned and slowly made back tracks tiger said it was an indian dog but not thoroughbred the latter never bark i not know whether they can not but i never heard them bark we rode along we looked the dog master but did not catch sight of him the farther we went from the river the less steep the mountains sides became and the valleys widened again on the following day we crossed two other rivers which were also arms of the colorado and went down toward the northern spurs of the san saba mountains the mountain chains here ran severally over larger surfaces on which great many hills rose but they had nearly all already donned the garb of the prairies they were covered with red grass that is rather hard but does not die in winter while in the lowlands grew the ﬁne musquito grass numerous patches of postoak crossed this country and here and there the hills were covered with thick leaf wood the streams begirt by ﬁne forests all ran eastward and were all full of ﬁsh and the crystalline water which so greatly distinguishes western america from all other countries we found here again large troops of wild horses though we had seen none on the mountains and enormous quantities of game of all sorts the prairie more especially was covered with buffaloes far we could see we were constantly supplied with the ﬁnest meat which we shot in passing without stopping any length of time or tiring our horses one afternoon however we noticed among herd of buffaloes two white ones which excited our cupidity and we resolved to hunt them we left antonio and königstein behind with the mules laid aside our superﬂuous baggage and slowly approached the buffaloes they were standing on knoll on the prairie and allowed us to ride rather close up ere they took to ﬂight we galloped after them and were soon in their ranks which gave way we pressed in and spread on both sides with such roaring and snorting deafened the thundering noise of their hoofs the two white animals an old bull and cow were right in the front in spite of the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https cloud of dust in which we were enfolded we kept them in sight and at last got up to them tiger was some paces ahead and ﬁrst up to the buffaloes but at the moment when he raised his long riﬂe to ﬁre the bull turned on him and the piebald gave tremendous start tiger lost his balance and would assuredly have fallen had he not caught hold of the mane and sprung from his rearing horse at the same instant the buffalo received our bullets and dashed furiously ﬁrst after one then after the other while being continually wounded afresh until it at last sank on its knee exhausted and received the death shot from tiger riﬂe i now rode back to those in the rear and brought them to the dead bull while the others skinned it the hide was splendid very long haired and shaggy and snowy white without spots white buffalo is rarity the savage indians regard it with superstitio us awe and make sacriﬁce of sumach leaves ere they attack and kill it they set an extraordinarily high value on the hide of such an animal and either use it valuable present or sell it large sum after the bull was killed i had the greatest difﬁculty in keeping tiger from following the herd which was out of sight in order to take the hide of the white cow and it was not till i assured him that the hide of the dead one belonged to him and that i would purcha it of him that he remained with us an hour later the bargain was concluded and my indian perfectly contented white deer antelopes and bears are more common but all that are regarded rarities the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https xx the rocky mount ains w now reached open plains where only here and there an isolated musquito tree or thickly foliaged elm offers little shade on the boundless glowing surface and the sky forms the horizon all around to these single shady trees the deer and antelopes ﬂy in the midday heat and lie down close together so that you may be always certain to ﬁnd game under these trees so long their leaves are standing at the same season the grass is high also and it is easy the hunter to creep unseen within shot and shoot the fattest deer through the head even at the time of our visit when the leaves had fallen these animals frequently reposed under the scattered trees and rose we passed forty or ﬁfty in number gazing anxiously at us the buffalo on the other hand always remains in the sunshine and seems able to endure the greatest heat but also the greatest cold before all other quadrupeds it marks its endless marches from north to south and from south to north by its skeletons which bleach many year in the sun now when the grass was short the whole surface in the distance had whitish tinge which is produced by these bones out of which the skulls rise like shining dots about week we rode through such land only here and there interrupted by small elevations and frequently suffered with our animals from drought during this period we were often obliged to quench our thirst with standing water with which the heavy showers ﬁll great hollows in the prairies and which remains in them even at the driest season the inhabitants of these plains and especially the buffaloes must also quench their thirst in them and also wallow there we frequently found the water thick and warm chocolate and were obliged to strain it through cloth to get rid of the hairs before we could drink it after very hot day on which we had suffered greatly from thirst we suddenly saw from knoll large expanse of water before us and greeted it at the ﬁrst moment with great delight we hurried on in order to reach this oasis soon possible but surprised to see bushes or trees on its banks and even more when on drawing nearer we found far around only thin dark grass between which the ground shone quite white tiger shouted to that it was salt water and neither we nor our horses could drink it this affected us the more deeply we had indulged in the hope of hearty drink and we silently turned again to the west in order to ride round the lake tiger laughed and said that we should have good water several large streams ﬂowed into it from the west this proved to be the case after riding about ﬁve miles along the bank of the lake we reached perfectly clear stream we halted in order to refresh ourselves and our cattle but we were obliged was the case nearly the whole week to kindle ﬁre of bois vache to prepare our supper at times when in passing over these prairies we found dry musquito tree we fastened few logs to our saddle so to have ﬁring the evening but this was too tiring and we always hoped to come across wood whence this precaution was generally neglected in such regions there were objects to which we could bind our horses but this is easily managed by cutting long sharp wedge out of the very ﬁrm soil thrusting the knot of the lasso in far possible and stamping in the wedge again with the foot the bound animal pulls almost horizontally at the very long lasso while its end goes down nearly perpendicularly into the ground the rope offers such resistance that it will sooner break than be pulled out of the ground gradually we saw more hills and among them forests while few distant chains of mountains ran from west to east one afternoon i was riding with tiger about mile ahead of our party in order to have better chance of approaching game when we heard two the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https us we looked round and saw our friends gathered in knot on small knoll and swarm of about ﬁfty indians galloping round them we gave our horses the spurs and ﬂew back to them while tiger raised hideous yell in which i supported him to the best of my strength our friends now ﬁred general salvo at the assailants which knocked over two horses but their riders were immediately picked up by their comrades on seeing us the savages took to ﬂight with gruesome yells we rode up to our companions who had placed all the animals in the centre to protect them königstein had luckily seen some horses heads over the crest of the next hill which aroused his suspicions and had employed the time in assuming posture of defence or else we should probably have lost our mules tiger saw from the saddles of the shot horses that they belonged to the mescaleros who are considered the most savage tribe in the west and would certainly not have given up their attack so soon had they not recognised tiger whoop that of the delawares the number of mescaleros is not large and they are constantly at war with many other tribes so that they not care to make fresh enemies among their red brothers this little danger which we escaped without loss was not unpleasing to our precautions which had nearly been gotten were aroused once more by it about week we marched through very pleasant country and arrived at rather large river which tiger stated to be the brazos and which falls into the gulf to the eastward of the colorado i had seen it before at san felipe and would not have recognised it there it moves sluggishly through bed of heavy clay and has dirty red colour while here it rolls merrily over rocks and its crystal surface is covered with foam from this point we proceeded to the tiger noticed that we had gone little too far east and would have much greater difﬁculty in crossing the rivers than farther west where though the country is mountainous the streams nearer their sources are smaller and more frequent the mountains were composed of limestone and contained exquisite little valleys where the vegetation was already bursting into new life all the softer trees were budding and the ﬂowers were springing up all over the prairies we seemed to keep equal pace with the reawakening of the vegetable world northwards and even to go faster than it on warm day we had been riding without halt over desolate stony hills and were quite exhausted when our tired and thirsty horses clambered up barren height we suddenly looked down into lovely valley covered with fresh verdure through which broad stream wound the view soon enlivened horse and rider and we merrily hurried down to the bank of the stream we had hardly reached it and ridden our horses in to let them quench their thirst when long train of indians appeared on the opposite height bordering the valley and came straight toward us tiger looked at them moment and told us to wait here while he rode across to see who they were we dismounted led our horses together and got our weapons in readiness tiger galloped through the valley to the hill side down which the indians were coming and checked his piebald at its foot we saw him making signs from distance to the approaching horsemen which were answered in the same way and ere long the whole party pulled up around him they held long consultation and then rode toward us with tiger at their head they were kickapoos out on hunting expedition and had recently left their villages on the platte where they have settlements like the delawares and their squaws and old men grow crops and breed cattle i had long conversation with the chief in which tiger played the interpreter told him the purpose of our journey invited him to visit on the leone next winter and asked him how far it was to the next water he assured that we should come to good water and grass before the sun sank behind the mountains and so we parted very glad to get away from the fellows whose appearance was anything but satisfactory the party consisted of about eighty men twenty squaws and number of small children the ﬁrst were dressed in and had round the body leathern belt through which very long and broad strip of coarse red cloth was passed whose two ends were pulled through between the legs and fastened into the belt behind in addition several of them had deerskin coats others calico coats but the majority merely wore buffalo robe over their bare shoulders and nearly all were armed with riﬂes the squaws wore short leathern petticoat round their loins and buffalo robe on their shoulders while those who had infants carried them fastened to board upon their backs they had already unpacked their horses and prepared their camp to halt here we rode away from them over the hills and tiger came up to saying kickapoo tongues i had heard before that these indians were false spiteful and hostile to white men and only the advantage they derive from being on friendly terms with the united states induces them not to appear publicly their the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https quickly advanced and reached at rather early hour valley in which we found grass and water and chose our camp at spot where the stream ran close under precipice while on this side was small copse in which we could fasten our cattle at night it was an almost circular kettle enclosed by steep limestone walls which had an opening only on one side through which the bright stream ﬂowed the sun was sinking behind the lofty gray rocks and dyeing the dark blue sky with glowing tint which artist would venture to reproduce on his canvas about midnight trusty aroused us by his loud savage bark he was at the opening of the valley and would not lie down again but we could not discover his motive it was quite dark tiger fancied however that the kickapoos were trying to steal some of our horses when day broke and cast its ﬁrst faint light over the gray walls of the valley i awoke and saw at the entrance herd of deer apparently browsing down the stream it was still rather dark i hoped to be able to approach them behind the few leaﬂess bushes that grew on the bank crawling through the dewy grass was too fatiguing job to be rewarded by deer especially we still had supply of game ocelots hunting in couples i crept down the stream and had got within shot when i made forward leap in order to reach rather thick bush from which i could ﬁre more conveniently at the same instant the deer started apart in terror and i saw that an ocelot had leaped on the back of one of them which laid back its broad antlers and galloped down the stream while second cat followed it with long high bounds two of the terriﬁed deer darted past but i did not ﬁre i felt an interest in watching the hunt of the two beasts of prey which i followed quickly i could out of the valley the deer ran about mile down the stream then reare d and fell over backwards when the second cat also sprang on it and hung on its neck the deer collected its last strength and tried to rise on its hind legs but sank exhausted and sent its plaintive cries echoing through the mountains i crept unseen by the beasts of prey within thirty yards of the scene of battle and shot the ﬁrst while i missed the second it bolted but sent trusty after it and soon heard him at bay lower down the stream i soon reloaded and hurried after trusty who was barking round small oak in which the ocelot had sought shelter i shot it down and dragged it up to the other which was lying by the dead deer all were up in our camp they had heard my shots and john and königstein hurried toward to see what i had killed my clothes were wet if i had been in the river and i turned myself before our ﬁre while the others went out with jack to bring in the game higher north i did not come across these small leopards while farther south they are very frequent several days longer our road ran through mountains which were bordere d by savage precipices and crossed by grassy valley s then we rode some days across open the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https and again reached low ranges of hills between which we crossed the southern arm of red river which divides texas from arkansas and falls into the mississippi in arkansas after ﬂowing distance of nearly one thousand miles there it is of dirty red and muddy and moves sluggishly between lofty poplars and planes which overshadow its ﬂat banks while the long gray grass hangs down from thence to the surface of the water and literally covers the trees this moss hangs from every branch in creepers twenty feet long and conceals the swampy soil in which those fearful monsters the alligators lie by thousands and await in their pestiferous lair the unhappy victims whom accident leads to them here and there decayed blockhouse peeps out from under these weeping banners and everyth ing there offers the picture of rapid desolation you see in this house where so many families have died out one after the other the pale yellow wasted faces of the peering out like candidates death till it becomes too late to escape from this pestilential abode how perfectly different however the river appears here clear crystal to the bottom it dances from rock to rock refreshes it darts past the luxuriant ferns and the ﬂowers with its waves and displays to the visitor its living wealth well the vegetable world on its bed in the most brilliant hues the purest lightest breeze sports over its high banks and drives the diseases which are the curse of america out of the paradise which lies beneath the haughty cypresses pecan planes maples and colossal trees that border it how is it possible that men can be terriﬁed by the dangers of the west and patiently expose themselves to certain slow awful decay in those poisoned forests where death inexorably swings his scythe all the year round the rocky mountains now rose in the west and glistened with their snowy peaks while around us the plants announced spring by their bursting buds we drew nearer to them although in this way our route became far more fatiguing than farther eastward where the wide prairies extend to the north but tiger employed this precaution in order to get out of the way of the great indian hordes pursuing the buffalo who not ﬁnd in these mountains sufﬁcient food their troops of horses and mules and can not hunt the buffaloes there so well on the prairie hence our journey was continued more slowly but at this season we could reckon on water and the small valleys offered our few cattle abundance of food the mountains constantly afforded us more game than we needed our support and we could approach it with greater ease than on the prairies we had been winding some days through wildly romantic mountain gorges and our eyes were involuntarily ﬁxed on the distant reddish mountains which rose in the north toward the transparent sky we had left many charming valley turbulent current and precipice behind when at about noon one day we were stopped by deep ravine through which noisily dashed one of those mountain torrents which escape from the snows of the andes and make their long course through the valleys to the gulf of mexico here we could not think of riding through the precipices on either side were at least ﬁfty feet deep while the width of the cavern was several hundred paces we rode up the ravine and got among such rocks and loose stones that we were forced to dismount and with the greatest difﬁculty reached plateau where the banks of the stream were not so tall and steep and we were able to remount few ﬂat rocks were scattered over the bank where we were while the opposite one rose steeply and was covered with thick scrub and low wood i was riding with tiger ahead of our party when on turning rock we saw very plump bear leap from the bank through the shallow but foaming stream and disappear in coppice opposite it was too quick to enable us to ﬁre and when we reached the spot where we ﬁrst saw it we found large elk lying behind some thick prickly bushes which was still warm and hence must have been recently killed one leg was torn up but the rest was in good condition and we halted to await our friends and put the game on the mules when i was about to dismount tiger remarked that the bear would return to the elk in the evening and we should soon be obliged to camp owing to the growing darkness we could hunt it our friends came up and we marched about mile farther where we found excellent grass in gorge on the left of the river we unsaddled hobbled our cattle and prepared supper although it was rather early the question then was who of us should go after the bear and all wished to so we agreed that the dice should decide the lot fell on myself clifton and königstein and without delay we took our weapons and walked down the stream to the spot where the elk lay we advanced cautiously the bear might already be at its quarry and we noticed nothing of it we selected our posts great distance from the elk i was at the centre behind the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https rock königstein lay on my right near the stream in the dry grass behind some bushes and clifton was on my left covered by fallen dead tree we had good wind and if the bear returned we should have it under our guns and it would hardly be able to escape we sat without moving the sun sank behind the mountains and scarce illumined the heights while around us the gloom was already gathering there was not breath of air and only the buzzing and chirrupi ng of insects and the rustling of the stream disturbed the silence trusty who had hitherto been lying at my feet raised his head looked at the thicket opposite and then up to i shook my ﬁnger at him not to growl which he quite understood and thrust his head down on the ground directly after i heard cracking in the thicket which soon became more distinct at length the bear burst out of the scrub and came down small path to the stream we had agreed not to ﬁre until it reached the elk on this side it stopped few minutes in the water to drink then leapt from stone to stone up the bank and walked slowly toward the elk the bear had scarce reached the prickly bush ere we ﬁred simultaneously and it rolled over but got up again and leapt into the water clifton and königstein sent two bullets after it which however did not seem to hurt it much it dashed ahead to the other bank königstein at once leapt revolver in hand into the stream after the bear and was standing between it and when he put bullet into its leg at short distance the bear noticing its pursuer turned and went toward him with hoarse roar while königstein still standing in the water put second bullet into its chest i ran up and ﬁred my riﬂe bullet into the left breast of the furious animal while clifton gave it another in the belly from his long pistol the bear fell into the water but few yards from königstein who seeing it rise on its fore paws shot it through the head with his revolver though the water was shallow it was so rapid that it would have carried the bear away so we both threw away our weapons leapt into the stream to königstein and dragged the beast on land here we let it lie reloaded and returned to camp where our comrades were greatly pleased at the lucky result of our hunt we waited till the moon had risen then took two mules and i proceeded with tiger and john to our quarry in order to fetch its skin and the best meat it was late when we got back to camp still our appetite had been excited again and instead of going to sleep we sat joking round the ﬁre each with some spitted before him the also went the round and the steaming pipe accompanied us to our buffalo hides on which we lay conversing some time clifton insisted that he ought to be rewarded handsomely by königstein saving his life by the while the latter tried to prove to him that he had aimed too low to hit the bear heart and hence punishment ought to have its paw stuck on his hat the answers however gradually became rarer and we soon were all fast asleep excellent health and consciousness of strength of which the polished world is ignorant are the blessed companions of such natural life and awful nightmare frightful dreams such visit the silken beds of civilization venture to approach the hard couch of our western hunters i was awakened by the cold about an hour before daylight sprang up poked the ﬁre which was nearly burnt out wrapped myself in my buffalo robe and fell asleep again soundly till my comrades shouted to that the coffee was ready the whole neighbourhood was covered with thick white rime and though the frost was not heavy we felt it severely our large ﬁre however soon dispelled the cold and we lay very cozily round it eating our breakfast we soon mounted crossed the stream without difﬁculty and followed up the hills our journey during the last day had been fatiguing the horses and in spite of the long distance we had ridden we had advanced but little northwards so we gladly followed an easterly course which brought us nearer the great prairies from here we also noticed that the highest mountain peaks were little farther to the west and consequently of f our track the sky became overcast and in the afternoon it began raining so that we were obliged to put our buffalo robes over us and at night pitched our small tents to protect us from the heavy incessant rain tiger though refused to crawl into the tent but collected great heap of brushwood near the ﬁre laid his on it sat down with his knees drawn up to his chin and pulled his with the hairy side out over him tucking it under him so that he looked like huge hairy ball during the night we were frequently obliged to feed the ﬁre to keep it burning and in the morning we saw sign that the clouds were about to break we could hardly distinguish the nearest peaks and round our camp rivulets had formed that conveyed the rain to the valley we could not think of starting all our traps were wet through hence we grinned and bore it killed time with eating and smoking and looked at our cattle which with hanging head and tail let the rain pour of f the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https the whole day and the next night passed and it was not till ten the next morning that we saw patch of blue sky this lasting heavy rain proved to clearly that we were already in more northern region in our country the showers are much heavier the time but never last longer than day we lay up this day too to let the ground dry little and strong cold wind which had sprung up helped to effect this our cattle had good grass we were amply supplied with ﬁrewood and had abundance of the best game so that we wanted nothing john and mac went out shooting together and killed some turkeys and deer which they brought into camp on sam tiger went out alone and returned in the evening with two deer legs and beaver having surprised the latter on land while nibbling off the branches of fallen tree our supper was hence splendidly covered again and we greatly enjoyed the beaver tail which is one of the best dishes the west of fers our various skins tents blankets were now tolerably dry and the next morning we left camp and travelled northwards towards the sides of the mountains and the spurs they shoot out into the great prairies the sky was still covered with few clouds between which the sun shone warmly and pleasantly two days later we altered our course again to the west in order not to leave the mountains which here enclosed large patches of crossing these low mountain spurs we passed through many extensive valleys with excellent soil ﬁrewood especially oak and abundant water which assuredly ere long will be sought by civilization advancing from the east in the west the mountains now rose higher and raised their white peaks far above the clouds they were probably hundred miles from us and the horizon was enclosed by mountain ranges like an amphitheatre the mountains rose higher and higher above each other in the strangest forms and colours terminating in peaks on which the heavens seemed to be supported tiger called them the sacramento mountains which run southward nearly to santa fé one evening we reached stream which came down from these mountains through rather wide valley which tiger told us was an arm of the canadian river that falls into the arkansas between which and the kansas the territory of the delawares is situated when boy tiger added he had often been hunting up this river and in these mountains with his father and in few days we should reach another arm of this river on which his father brother was torn to death by grizzly bear on that river there was very large iron stone which had fallen from heaven and with which the god of hunting killed weico who was hunting here improperly when we reached the river bank we found its water very turbid and so swollen that we could not ride through owing to the furious current hence we unloaded though it was still rather early and found ourselves on steep bank where the stream could not hurt us even if it rose higher tiger was of opinion that the water would have run off by the next day and enable us to continue our journey these torrents rarely last longer than day john and mac went down the river to hunt and tiger went up it while we looked after the cattle and prepared the camp the ﬁrst two came back early with an antelope while tiger was not in camp when night had settled on the mountains i had heard him ﬁre twice and we were beginning to fear that an accident had happened to him when he came out of the gloom into the bright ﬁrelight with his light step but without any game which was rarity he had ﬁred thrice at black bear followed it long distance but had been obliged to leave it owing to the darkness especially he had hit it awkwardly and it was strong enough to run long distance the night passed undisturbed morning displayed bright cloudless sky and promised us beautiful day but the river had not fallen so much we expected and we preferred awaiting its fall here to going higher up and seeking shallower spot the sun had scarce risen over the low hills in the east when i took my riﬂe and went down the river with trusty to try my luck in hunting i soon reached low thin skirt of bushes which covered the valley and through which many small rivulets wound to the river i had not gone far into it when i noticed great number of turkeys running about among the leaﬂe ss bushes i ran up to them frequently crossing the brook till i at last got within shot of an old cock and toppled him over i hung the bird on tree close to the brook which i fancied was one of those that came down the valley great distance from our camp and had scarce gone hundred yards beyond the brook when i saw some head of game which were too large our ordinary deer and too and yet did not resemble elks i crept nearer and convinced myself they were giant deer which are not unco mmon in the andes i shot at very large stag which had already shed its antlers and it rushed upon but soon turned away and i gave it the second bullet it went some hundred yards bleeding profusely so that i expected every moment to see it fall then stopped and i employed the the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https reload and get within eighty yards of it i was on the point of ﬁring when it dashed away and got out of sight i put trusty on the trail and followed him crossing the brook several times up the valley toward our camp i fancied at length i saw the stag standing under an old oak and i succeeded in getting within shot i ﬁred and saw the bullet go home but all that the deer ran up hill on the left and disappeared my eagerness in following the anima l was more and more aroused i reloaded and went with trusty after the bleeding trail over the hill and down the other side then through thicket in the valley and over another hill to stream where i at last found the stag dead it was splendid giant deer distinguished from our royal harts by its size coat and proportionatel y higher forelegs i broke it up gave trusty his share and it was not till i was ready to start that i thought of my road to camp the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https xxi lost in the mount ains it was near noon and i had generally walked fast i looked around and tried to recollect the numerous windings i had made but soon saw it was impossible to recall them i had paid attention to them during the chase i now looked at my compass i knew that the stream on which we were camping ran down the valley from west to east and that hence i was on its southern side to the eastward of our camp i must therefore go due north to reach the stream and then follow it in order to reach camp the calculation was correct and could not fail to bring home soon i therefore walked on quietly and every now and then blazed tree or laid bush upon rock to be able to ﬁnd the stag when we went to fetch it the ﬁrst hour passed at one time i walked through narrow valleys then over stony hills or crossed small streams and grassy meadows but saw sign of the river the second hour during which i doubled my pace passed in the same manner and yet i saw nothing of the river i looked repeatedly at the compass on my riﬂe stock and the one i carried in my pocket my calculation was correct of that there could be doubt but how was it that i had not yet reached the river it might possibly make small bend northwards here but i must strike it it belonged to canadian river and all the waters from these mount ains ﬂow to the east i was certain of my matter and laughed at myself imagining moment that i had lost my way i marched cheerily on especially up the hills i fancied i should see the river from each of them and did not notice that i was exerting myself excessively certain anxiety crept over involuntarily i hurried on the faster the deeper the sun got behind the mountains i ran down the hills and hurried up them dripping with perspiration with strength which only the feeling of impending danger can arouse my energy and presence of mind still mastered my growing anxiety i hoped felt almost convinced that i should soon reach the river which had disappeared in so extraordinary way until at last the sun sank behind the highest peaks of the cordilleras and the gloom of night spread its mantle over the earth exhaustion followed long unnatural exertion so suddenly that i sank down on the last hill i ascended and my strength of mind and body gave way utterly in few minutes i fell into deep sleep and must have lain there ﬁve hours when i woke i felt on my watch that it was midnight i remembered everything i had hitherto done and the last thought which had accompanied up to my unconsciousness startled out of thought that i had lost my way when i got up my faithful trusty nestled up to and licked my hands if wishing to remind that he was still with and i was not quite deserted i threw my arm round his strong neck and pressed him ﬁrmly to at this moment he was an unspeakable comfort and restored my resolution and strength of will i soon reverted to my old rule which i had kept years of always assuming the worst in disagreeable situations and making myself familiar with it then man has nothing more to fear i had lost myself and must seek my road to camp in some direction alone i felt strong enough to so but must reﬂect on the mode of doing it i had sufﬁcient powder and bullets my weapons this was precaution which i had constantly urged on my comrades since our start never to go out with powder or few bullets the sake of convenience my box was full of lucifers and i had also ﬂint steel and punk i carried bandages and housewife well little bottle of old brandy in my knapsack and rather large gourd at my side i was fully equipped to make this tour which honestly speaking was now beginning to appear interesting to and i laughingly thought of the friend of my childhood the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https robinson crusoe who at that day sowed the ﬁrst seed of my later irresistible desire such life i was soon decided and regained my entire calmness i sprang up and went cautiously down hill to reach the valley in which on the previous evening i had looked in vain the river the darkness and the rocky sloping route made my walk very difﬁcult but still i reached my destination at the end of an hour and entered very narrow valley in which i soon found enough dry wood under the trees to light ﬁre i had turned cold and the warmth it spread around did good close by i found fallen tree to which i carried the burning logs in order to produce longer lasting ﬁre to throw out more heat then i piled up heap of bushes and brushwood laid myself on it with my bag under my head and after drinking some brandy and water fell asleep soundly if i had been in my bed on the leone the sun was high in the heavens when i awoke i felt strong usual and lit ﬁre breakfast drank some more water from my gourd and went northwards in good spirits i thought of the possibility that this river might not be the one named by tiger and might lose itself in subterranean bed but extraordinary to tell i did not moment reﬂect that it could run due north parallel with mine my only idea was that it perhaps made great bend i had been walking near an hour and had crossed several stony hills when i looked down into narrow gorge in which alders and poplars grew leading to the supposition of water and on going down i noticed an old animal quietly grazing i crawled very cautiously nearer to it now i seriously needed some meat and on looking up from deep ditch excavat ed by the rain i saw small deer by the side of the old one which was staring at over the bushes i ﬁred and saw the deer dart among the bushes but knew that it bore death in its heart the old animal dashed close past but i did not ﬁre i was certain of securing the deer and did not care to waste bullet unnecessarily i reloaded went back to the bloody trail and found the deer dead about thirty yards ahead i broke it up skinned it and placed the rump and bits of the liver before the ﬁre which i lit while trusty had the kidneys and then amused himself with the shoulder blades i stretched the skin out before the ﬁre i intended to take it with to sleep on i enjoyed my breakfast to which i ate but little of the salt i carried in my bag in bladder in case of need trusty had also eaten heartily and paciﬁed his hunger i cut some good lumps off the deer back ﬁlled my ﬂask with fresh water and set out once more still hoping to reach the river i walked up hill and down having on my left the lofty mountain ranges and in front of sea of rocks whose end i could not see i was accustomed to such scenes of solitude still i now greatly felt what difference there is in looking down from the back of stout horse on the desert and having to cross the enormous tracks on foot the only anxiety that oppressed was the agony my comrades must be feeling about they would naturally suppose that some accident had happened to i knew they would not quit these mountains till they were certain of my fate and i listened continually signal shots i dared not ﬁre them fear of expending my ammunition and it would have been unnecessary they would certainly not neglect this method of showing the road to them the day passed without my hearing the echo of shot and the sun was rathe r low when i reached small stream whose banks were both rather thickly covered with wood i resolved to spend the night here i had wood and water and was protected from the weather which had got up rather ﬁercely since the afternoon i looked suitable spot carried wood to fallen tree and was about to light my ﬁre when i looked up at the hill before and felt desire to take look from it at the valley beyond to see whether the long river was there it was still early the sun had not yet set and though i was tolerably tired i set out i walked up steep gorge into which several narrow passes opened on both sides it was cove red with several large masses of rock and loose stones and the nearer i got to the top the narrower it grew and the steeper were the precipices enclosing it i had just passed one of these narrow gorges on my right and was approaching second when i noticed an opposite pass on my left i cautiously crept along the rock to be able to have peep into this pass and see whether there was any game in it and was only few yards from the angle of the wall when suddenly small bear which i took black bear though it looked different sprang from the pass on my right and hastened up the opposite one i said it appeared to rather smaller than black bear but there was time reﬂection and its skin might be of great service to i raised my riﬂe ﬁred and saw the bear roll over the stones like ball uttering plaintive cries like those of child at the same instant the hasty bounds of heavy anim al reached my ears simultaneously with an awful roar it became dark at the angle of the precipice before and the upright gigantic form of the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https appeared only few paces from i fell back step in horror involuntarily stretched out my riﬂe to keep the bear off and at the same moment saw trusty ﬂy past under its belly the riﬂe fearful blow hurled back several yards against the precipic eyes ﬂashed lost my senses and fell i must have lain here about half an hour and on opening my eyes again felt that my forehead was wet and cold i saw that trusty was standing over with his honest face and licking i got up and sprang on one side in horror close to lay the shaggy body of the bear with widely opened throat from which stream of black curdled blood ran under it was she bear whose three months old cub i had shot and she had wished to avenge its death my guardian angel had saved my bullet which entered its throat and passed through the skull had killed the bear on the spot in its fall it had torn the riﬂe from my hand and forced back so violently that i had struck my head against the rock and the pain deprived of consciousness on so many previous occasions an invisible hand had again saved from terrible danger whose extent i could appreciate now that i saw the monster lying before i stood motionless reﬂecting on my posit ion when the hoot of passing owl reminded that night had set in while reloading i remembered that this was the pairing time of the bears and that very possibly male bears would be following the female and hence this was the most dangerous spot i could select i went up to the cub threw it on my back and hurried down the gorge to my camping place where i at once made blaze the safest and only way of protecting oneself against the denizens of these regions i now saw the ﬁrst time that brave trusty was covered with blood and had three severe wounds on his back dealt him by the bear two of them i at once sewed up and washed them repeatedly with the clear cold water by which i was camped i then skinned the cub put sufﬁcient quantity of its tender fat meat to roast at the ﬁre made bed of brushwood and after supper i rolled myself in the shaggy fresh hide upon my deer and fell into my usual sound sleep i had not been sleeping long when trusty barked sharply several times and i sat up and seized my riﬂe frightful howling of wolves rang from the heights through the valleys and between it hollow roar resembling that which the bear raised when she attacked the night was very dark and the ﬁre which had burnt down solely lit up the nearest spots while i could only distinguish the outlines of some evergreen around standing out against the clear sky i quickly threw some small wood in front of the glowing trunk and blew up the ﬂame at this moment i heard something dash away close by and directly after at the foot of the ravine renewed howls and roars while trusty stood close by my side growling i carried some heavy logs to the ﬁre rolled myself again in my warm skin and fell asleep though i only allowed one ear to sleep tiger said the howling lasted the whole night i looked after my ﬁre every now and then and was waked by the dawn without having had my sleep any further disturbed after breakfast i hung the two skins on my back and followed the valley about three miles ere i crossed the heights to the north i wished to avoid the spot where the bear lay upon which the wolves and bears had held grand feast during the past night on reaching the saddle of the mountain the idea occurred to the ﬁrst time that the lost river must necessarily ﬂow to the north and i was amazed at myself not thinking of this sooner hence i marched due west and saw about noon chain of hills whose direction lay northward which animated with fresh hope of ﬁnding my comrades again at the foot of these hills from which spurs stretched out eastward like ribs the valleys were thickly wooded and displayed generally richer vegetation than the small gulleys in which i had hitherto been marching with much difﬁculty and toil i reached the mountain chain in few hours exhaust ed and starving but the longing to learn whether i should ﬁnd at its top pleasanter change in my prospects did not let rest i selected the least steep spot and climbed up over loose boulders which constantly rolled away under and brought down i had only one hand at my service to hold on to the few mimosa bushes or to pull myself up i carried my riﬂe in the other and would sooner have injured myself than it at last i climbed the last patch bathed in perspiration and and words fail to describe the joyous surprise which befel on seeing before the wooded vale and river which i had been seeking so long in vain in the ﬁrst joy of my heart i forgot that it was still very unce rtain whether i should ﬁnd my comrades there and that my existence might depend on charge more or less in my possession i ﬁred my riﬂe and listened attentively to its echo it rolled away along the mountains i halted long time awaiting an answer but to effect i looked long up the river with my excellent telescope to try and discover smoke but also without success far and wide the rocky landscape lay before with other sign of life than that of the buzzards circling round the heights i had been resting about half an hour and coolin g myself in the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https breeze when i seized my riﬂe and proceeded down to the valley which i reached in much shorter time i went up it to the foot of the hills where i had fewer obstacles to contend with than in the wood that covered the river banks till the declining sun well hunger and fatigue warned to select my camp i had gone considerable distance when the sun stood over the distant hills i had walked on without resting and had rocks to scale i turned off to spring in the wood and threw off my skins on the ﬁrst bushes i came to they fatigued too much though their weight was not great my ﬁre was soon lighted at the roots of stump stock of wood collected my meal made and supper eaten which consisted of the remainder of the bear meat before i entered the wood i had looked up to the hills above and reﬂected whether at nightfall i should light ﬁre there which would certainly be seen long way down the river i might possibly give my friends hint of my whereabouts but equally well betray my to hostile indians who if any were in the neighbourhood would see something unusual in it but then again it was an easy matter to hide myself from them and i was without horse seek refuge which could easily be defended i resolved to carry out my design took my weapons and went up the hills whose summit i reached at nightfall i then collected fallen branches and brushwood round an old stone piled them up to great height and the ﬁre quickly darted up crackling and roaring i carried up great number of logs from the trees lying around and threw them on the ﬁre which reminded of the bonﬁres we used to light at home when i was boy when i thought the pile of wood large enough to last at least an hour i left the hill and went to the nearest knoll where i sat down near some rocks and lit pipe which enjoyment i only allowed myself morning and night in order to make my tobacco last long possible the leaves of the sumach which are good substitute tobacco were not to be had i had been sitting there about half an hour when trusty got up uttered an almost inaudible growl and gazed at the slope under my feet i pressed his head to the ground laying myself on the top of him and distinctly heard beneath light human voices and some footsteps which went under the precipice to the hill on whose top my ﬁre was burning what had i better should i call out they might be my friends but if they were strange indians i should expose myself to unnecessary danger if they were my friends on reaching the ﬁre they would certainly make themselves known by their voices or by ﬁring i remained perfectly quiet and gazed steadfastly at my ﬁre after while i saw dark object moving before it then another and another and i was soon able to see clearly through my telescope that the men moving round it wore hats they were consequently indians and i was very glad i had not betrayed myself all at once i saw long way off to the light which rapidly grew larger and in spite of the great distance so increased that i could distinctly perceive the smoke through my glass i greeted it with loudly beating heart the answer of my friends one in these dangerous regions lights widely gleam ing ﬁre save under such circumstances and i was now certain i should join them again next day they were safe to keep up the ﬁre so to show my course by its smoke i remained quietly seated under the rocks and did not think of sleep though i was very tired i did not dare return to my camp the ﬁre was certainly still burning there and the indians would have seized my skins whose absence i now severely felt i was beginning to chill and i could not await daylight on these bare heights i resolved to march during the night well i could i crept in stooping posture from my seat to the nearest hollow which ran down from the hills to the valley and on reaching the foot of them i walked slowly on through the darkness i had been walking about an hour and had fallen several times though without hurting myself when i heard shot right ahead of it was doubtless ﬁred by my friends who were seeking in spite of the darkness my fatigue disappeared and i walked with greater certainty over the bare sloping ground i soon heard another shot and now could longer refrain from answering it i ﬁred and soon after heard two shots responding to it was terribly tiring walk though it was bright starlight i could not distinguish the boulders and small hollows sufﬁciently to avoid them i also got several times among prickly scrub and swamps between the hill sides i was just forcing my way out of such damp spot overgrown with thorns when the crack of riﬂe rang from the hill side in front of and i at the same time heard tiger hunting yell though long way off i ﬁred again and was again answered by two shots i breathed freely and hurried over the slippery rocks and just i came under hill slope i heard tiger shrill yell over i answered with all my might and ere long this faithful friend and the equally worthy königstein welcomed their joy their delight were indescribable trusty sprang round us the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https mad in order to display his sympathy and i was obliged to call to him repeatedly and order him to be quiet ere he mastered his delight it was strange meeting among these wild mountains whose dark forms we could now distinguish against the starlit sky while the deepest night lay around us tiger proposed to light ﬁre but when i told him that indians had passed and gone to the ﬁre he said it was better us to keep moving i was too tired however and must rest ﬁrst so we lay down under some large rocks where the wind did not reach us i took trusty in my arms and pressed him to to keep him warm in order not to fall asleep i now told my comrades how i had fared and heard that tiger had explained my disappearance to my friends precisely in this way at length the ﬁrst gleam of coming day showed itself and was saluted in the valley by the voices of numerous turkeys we leapt up went down to the wood where these early birds were standing on the trees and brought two of them down ﬁre blaze d and the breasts of the turkeys twirled before it while we warmed ourselves at it königstein had tin pot and coffee with him which improved our meal and when the sun was beginning to shine warmly we started the camp from which we were about ﬁve miles distant and where news of was anxiously awaited the joy at meeting again was great from distance we were welcomed with shots all ran to meet us and each wanted to be the ﬁrst to shake my hand and express his joy at my rescue they all except tiger had given up lost czar raised his head and the forefoot buckled to it and neighed in delight at seeing while trusty ran up to him and leapt on his back all were in the most cheerful temper and thousand questions and answers ﬂew round our camp ﬁre my friends had gone in search of on the evening when i did not return to camp and tiger had found the turkey shot by and followed my trail to the ﬁrst stony knoll over which i pursued the wounded stag but from this point he had been unable to ﬁnd my track and returned to camp when darkness set in the next morning at daybreak he returned to the same spot and had gone ahead of my trail in wide curve in order if possible to recognis it in crossing toward evening he had really succeeded in ﬁnding ﬁrst trusty trail and then mine in the valley where i shot the deer on the ﬁrst morning and reached the spot where i made my breakfast off its meat but from this point every sign disappeared and any further search would be useless night had set in afterwards they lit large ﬁre on the nearest height and kept it up all night though i had not noticed it on the next morning tiger left camp at an early hour with königstein and told the others that they would be back in eight days if they did not ﬁnd before they looked during the whole day and had just collected wood on knoll over the river to light signal ﬁre when they saw mine ﬂashing against the dark sky and hurried toward after all the events of the last restless days had been sufﬁciently discussed i longed rest i made my bed in the shade of live oak covered myself with buffalo robe and giving my comrades directions not to wake under any pretext i slept undisturbed till the sun withdrew its last beams from the valley and sank behind the glittering peaks of the andes i felt strengthened and after dipping my head in the river to refresh i sat down with my friends and ate hearty supper composed of all the dainties of hunters fare the next morning found us mounted at an early hour to scale the heights on the other side of the river whence we followed its course in the next valley toward noon however the road became fatiguing we had to climb rather large hills that jutted out from the mountain chain on our right and we were soon so wedged in among steep precipices that we saw prospect of advancing after many attempts nothing was left us but to turn back and recross the saddle we had last surmounted after which we followed the valley to the here too our road was rendered very tiring and dangerous by huge scattered masses of rock we often had to lead our horses over them and they might easily have been injured by slipping upon them we wound our way through however without any accident and were riding towards evening over grassy meadows under steep precipice when we noticed on the top of it herd of about twenty buffaloes following path that ran over plateau several hundred feet above our heads it was remarkable with what certainty these apparently clumsy creatures followed the path which was at times hardly foot in breadth close to an abyss on which man might have hesitated to venture i dismounted and aimed at an old bull which led the ﬁle while i shouted to my comrades to ﬁre at the ﬁfth head in the herd which was cow that would not bear calf this year and hence must be very plump which can be easily seen by the dark glistening hair we shot the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https my buffalo made spring forward rose on its hind legs and fell over the abyss falling on projecting rocks till it came down to us in the valley regularly smashed the cow hit by many bullets fell on its knees and if foreseeing its fate remained in this position some minutes till its strength deserting it it lost its balance and fell from rock to rock down to us both animals were frightfully smashed their ribs and bones protruded from their torn hides and large pieces of rock had been forced into their monstrou s carcases the other buffaloes trotted along the path till they disappeared from sight behind knoll the smashed animals were perfectly suited our use we only took the best bits and especially the loins from the spine cut the tongues out of the broken jaws and removed the bones leaving the rest to the vultures and buzzards which soon circled over our heads towards evening we reached small stream which wound through the mountains to canadian river and offered us very pleasant through the ﬁne grass on its ﬂat banks well an abundance of dry wood we were lying in the twilight round our ﬁre when we heard long way up the valley the hoot of an owl and at the same time saw large very white bird ﬂying along the dark precipice we all seized our riﬂes to bring it down when it settled on projecting rock opposite to us none of us had ever seen bird like it before several of my comrades ran up nearer to it and ﬁred simultaneously it swung itself in the air however with loud ﬂapping of wings and circled round our camp ﬂying great distance above i had more luck than my friends i tumbled it over with broken wing it was snow white owl of extraordinary size and with such beautiful plumage that i kept its skin to stuff i therefore killed it hung it up and on the next morning skinned it and prepared the skin carriage the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https xxii bea ver hunters w left our camp at rather early hour and soon found below it numerous signs of beaver trees foot and half in diameter lay with great number of smaller ones along the banks of the stream and farther in the wood we saw trees glistening whose bark had been peeled off several feet above the ground any one unacquainted with these animals and their habits would surely have believed that new settlers had been busy here and cut down wood their block houses the splinters lay in heaps round the trees if we had been in carpenter shop and many of the felled trees had been stripped of their branches these most interesting animals generally settle on the smaller streams and brooks and their families at ﬁrst consist of but few members on such stream they cautiously select spot where several tall trees such poplars aspens ashes maples stand on both sides of it then proceed together to one of the trunks stand on their hind legs and follow each other slowly round it tearing out of the tree at each bite great bits of wood if they had been hewn out with an axe they cut away more wood on the side of the tree turned to the river than on the opposite side so that it becomes overbalanced and falls over into the water thus they fell one tree after the other across the stream nibble off the branches and carry other bits of wood between and under these trunks down to the river bed while they ﬁll up the interstices with twigs after this is ﬁnished they fetch on their broad ﬂat tails mud and earth from the bank and plaster the wooden dam till it becomes so tight that the water rises before it and overﬂows on both sides frequently miles in this lake produced by their art the beavers build their houses which are generally of three storeys though at times of four they are round and pointed like sugar are about twenty

entrance is at the bottom of the water and generally only the highest ﬂoor emer ges from the water so that the latter is always dry the creatures build their house of branches three feet in length which they bind together with twigs and earth and make the walls nearly foot thick they thus build one ﬂoor over the other each higher one being smaller till the highest one terminates in point they

seen lodges in which dozen houses peeped out of the water the beavers however not fell the trees solely to build their houses but also to procure food from the tender bark of the thinner branches they convey these branches in autumn cut in lengths to their houses and pile up large supply in the lower rooms on which they live in winter they go on land at this season too and this purpose keep holes

creation and it is very difﬁcult to get at it on land and kill it with ﬁrearms on the other hand it is wonderfully easy to capture in traps and in this way an entire colony can be extirpated to the last one in very short period the male beaver carries in two bladders the castor eum ofﬁcinale very oily ﬂuid which the hunter collects in bottle and mixes with spirits partly to keep it from putrefying but principally to impart to it another odour by which the beaver is induced to believe that it emanates from stranger in this bottle the hunter thrusts twig the point of which he moistens with its contents then thrusts the other end of it into the bank of the beaver pond so that the point projects over the water at spot where it is not very deep exactly under this twig he places in the water his heavy iron trap to which he fastens by long thong very large bush which he throws on the bank so soon beaver raises its nose on the surface of the pond it smells the castoreum on the twig swims up to convince itself whether it emanates from stranger and while going on land steps on the trap which closes and catches its forefeet it darts away with the trap into deep water and wrestles furiously with the torturing iron which reason beaver thus captured is never found to have sound quite exhausted it tries to rise to the surface to breathe the trap however keeps it down and the prisoner is drowned in its own element the next morning the hunter sees the bush ﬂoating over the spot where the beaver is lying and pulls it up with the trap the beaver hunters who visit these western deserts often take some dozens of traps with them so that when they arrive at colony it is speedily destroyed on which occasion they also capture in the same way the otters living the project

take out the captured animals whose skins they dry before the ﬁre while their ﬂesh serves them food when they have cleared out the spot they pack up the skins conceal them in caves under rocks and in hollow trees and go farther with their traps in winter when the hunt is not very productive they build huts of skins or seek cave in the rocks in which they ﬁnd shelter from the harsh climate and hunt other varieties of game while they keep their horse alive on stock of dried grass collected in autumn weeds or poplar bark at the end of some years during which such hunter has collected large stock of skins he proceeds to the nearest settlement fetches pack animals thence takes sufﬁcient number of men into his service and proceeds to his in order to carry to market the produce of his lengthened labour it is often the case that such hunter receiv es from three to four thousand pounds the skins collected during this period but still more frequently he pays his daring with his scalp and his life the indians themselves not kill beavers but regard the trappers the pioneers of the white men who eventually advance farther into their grounds and take from them one piece of land after the other by which they are daily driven farther back and come into hostile collision with one another hence the trappers are hated by all the indians and pursued by them whenever they are seen only the great concealment and difﬁcult approach to the regions where they hunt and the great caution with which they manage to hide their abode from the eyes of the indians render it possible them to lead this life years and constantly deceive the savage s when they accidentally acquire knowledge of their presence it is incredible what acuteness and skill such iron characters develop and we must feel

earliest youth and returned to it when although able to live comfortably on their savings in the civilized world the seafarer dies on the water the desert becomes the element of this hunter and he rarely closes his eyes the riﬂe on his arm the sign of beaver lodges which we saw was so fresh and numerous that probably one had yet appeared here with traps the stream spread far over its bank and form ed very large pool from whose surface number of houses peeped out but we could see nothing of the mysterious denizens of the settlement we were compelled to ride close under the precipice on our right where our cattle were up to their knees in water in order to cross the inundation while below the dams the stream remained in its narrow bed we reached canadian river which however here trended so to the east that we took the ﬁrst opportunity of crossing the hills that bordered it and pursuing our course toward the north on the other side of them which we reached about noon we came to another small stream on whose banks we saw number of peeled trees and also found here beaver lodge we rode through the stream and had left it about mile behind us when we suddenly heard shout in our rear and saw man who had stationed himself on an isolated rock and was making signs to us tiger told he was beaver trapper we rode back to bid this son of the desert good day and hear whether we could be of any service to him when we drew nearer the tall dark form disappeared from the rocks and man stepped from the thicket on our left with long riﬂe in his hand and came up to us with the where from strangers he was above six feet high thin but muscular with extraordin arily broad shoulders dark bronzed face and neck long grey beard and haughty demeanour his small eyes ﬂashed with great resolution under his thick black brows while pleasant smile softened the impression which his glance might have produced on stranger his exterior revealed at the ﬁrst glance that he had endured good

missouri my has been known the last forty years in the rocky mountains and i have now been back year from the old state he invite d us to go to his camp and spend the night with him he longed to hear something about events in the the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https we accepted his invitation and followed him along narrow path through the bushes and rocks to spot some hundred yards above the pond where we dismounted in front of some thick scrub and passed through it with our host we stepped on to cleared spot from which the axe had removed the bushes at whose northern end heavy masses of rock rose above each other and hanging over at height of thirty feet covered large space over the whole place number of dried beaver skins was suspended from the branches well the hide of grizzly and many others of deer and antelopes under the rocks lay several bundles of beaver skins while one of them drawn up near the ﬁre seemed to have served our host seat antonio and königstein went down to the pond with our horses where there was excellent grass and watched over them in turn with my other comrades i saw track of horse leading to our host abode and asked him whose it was to which he replied that on this trip the ﬁrst time in his life he had taken partner young kentuckian of the name of gray who was at present out hunting on horseback to get some venison they were sick of beaver meat the next day he said they intended to leave their camp they had trapped all the beavers round otherwise he would not have been so incautious to lead so many horses to his and thus betray it to passing indians he always led his own horse through the scrub up the stream and let it graze on the opposite side so that its track might not lead to his camp our host now ﬁlled cup from small cask of whisky three of which lay under the rocks and he told us constituted his sole luxury he loaded an extra mule with them when he started but it had been killed some months previously by couguar it had got loose at night he readily offered us his favourite liquid and cup of fresh spring water and after taking hearty pull himself he put six beaver tails in front of the ﬁre and we put all our coffeepots with them and unpacked our small stock of biscuit while we set the remaining from yesterday to roast the sun had not set when our friendly host partner arrived with his horse loaded with deer meat he was greatly surprised at ﬁnding so large party and very pleased to have an opportunity of hearing news from the states even though it was not of the freshest he was young and tall with healthy merry face brown eyes pleasant mouth commencing beard and long dark brown curls hanging over his shoulders his leathern dress was made with more coquettishness than armstrong and displayed his handsome person while brimmed black beaver hat slightly pulled over one ear imparted to his whole appearance something resolute and determined our cattle were now brought up and fastened to the withered trees in the open we lay down on our skins round the ﬁre and enjoyed the beaver tails while our hosts paid special attention to our biscuits and coffee which were rarity them after supper armstrong sent the round again then pipes were lighted and we ﬁrst answered the thousand questions asked us about the state of affairs at home and which principally referred to politics when this subject was exhausted armstrong spoke and told us the principal events of his life since he last bade farewell to civilization his various bloodthirsty ﬁghts with the indians the dangers they had often escaped with difﬁculty and the fatigues and unpleasantnesses they endured among which he mentioned the hailstorm which had also annoyed us he told us of successful hunts with the traps and promised to show us the next morning the last beaver to be found in these parts then he told us how the of the monstrous bearskin which hung behind us on tree had paid visit one evening to their camp and how they killed it fear of the indians they dared not light large ﬁre and the few coals had not frightened the bear which advanced within few yards of them when both ﬁred their riﬂes at its head and laid it dead on the ground while telling this story armstrong pulled off his shirt and showed us on his sides and back regular mass of scars which he had received from the embraces of dying grizzlies he narrated so picturesquely that the matter was fully brought before the listener his powerful deep voice which kept pace with the ﬁre of his narrative the passionate gestures by which he accompanied his narrative well his coarse form illumined by the ﬁre and the surrounding scenery produced remarkable and permanent impression on we listened to the stories till late hour when fatigue at length closed our eyes at the ﬁrst beam of dawn we led our cattle into the grass got breakfast ready and then went with armstrong about half mile down the stream where he had traps still set we pulled up three beavers with the bushes ﬂoating on the water and our host remarked that now there was only one old fellow left who had escap ed his traps several times and would not go near the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https in hurry on returning to camp we packed our animals and took leave of our kind hosts to whom to their great joy we gave portion of our stock of coffee we then described to them accurately the district where we had seen the numerous beaver lodges and wishing them all possible luck rode again up the mountain side where we had heard armstrong shout several days we followed our course without any particular difﬁculties while the country retained much the same character the sacramento mountains seemed to run farther to the west and attained their greatest height here we soon got among higher mountains and found we should have done better by going more to the east into the prairies we were obliged to turn and ride long way back we could not pass through the mountains at length however we reached river of some size which ﬂowed to the and resolved to follow it until we reached lower and more accessible regions where we could pursue our course again we spent the night on the north side of the river and found after riding few miles down its bank that the valley through which it ﬂowed constantly grew narrower and the precipices on its sides steeper it was still early and the sun had been unable to overpower the thick fog which had gathered in the valleys during the night it appeared indeed still uncertain whether it would rise or fall it hung about the rocks in long narrow strips it was cold on damp autumn morning the grass and bushes were wet after heavy shower and heavy dewdrops hung on the old spider webs between them we had put on our buffalo robes and guided our horses between the many loose blocks of stone and strata while the river constantly displayed larger and smaller cascades some of which were twenty feet high and its bed continually became deeper we had just reached one of these falls when we noticed on the other bank two very large grizzly bears one of which squatted on its and stared over at us they could not hurt us the stream above the fall was too rapid them to swim across without being carried so far that they would go over the fall and below the latter the banks were at least ﬁfty feet high and so steep that it was impossible to climb them tiger all that advised us not to ﬁre at them he was of opinion that they might ﬁnd spot where they could cross to us and then they would give us good deal of trouble we therefore rode past without disturbing them and only watched them they licked their paws and passed them over their clumsy heads while snifﬁng at us from time to time and even following us few yards along the bank the gorge down which the river dashed grew deeper and our route the more dangerous until we suddenly came to ravine which ran across our road into the river bed our farther progress was here checked and we were obliged to try and make path up it which was effected with great difﬁculty the stones lay wildly about we soon reached an old very practicable path which it appeared to us was used not only by buffaloes but also by indians and which ran tiger was of opinion that this was the road through these mountains to santa fé which the foot indians employed they avoid the prairies in order to get out of the way of the mounted tribes and because travelling in the tall grass is too fatiguing pedestrian we gladly followed it the road through the rocks was more impassable than ever it ran up hill rather sharply toward the highest mountain saddles the nearer we advanced to them the better and more passable the path became and our horses scaled these high hills at good pace and at times had an opportunity of drawing breath on small plateaus the sky was perfectly cloudless and the sun warm so that we welcomed the light north wind eastward the low hills lay at our feet in the extreme distance between which we could watch the various mountain torrents long way while here and there the rich green of the fresh turf peeped out between the red masses on our left the mountai ns were piled on each other in the strangest forms until their glistening rose into the azure sky our path frequently wound along the precipices where it could be seen long distance like white stripe and it did not seem possible to pass along it but when we reached the spot our horses stepped lightly over it and we found that it looked worse than it really was thus toward evening when the sun was sinking behind the mountains we saw our path suddenly disappear behind an abrupt precipice and expected dangerous bit when we arrived there we considered it really better to dismount and lead our horses the path constantly grew narrower under the precipice and the abyss beneath us steeper and deeper at every step we advanced it was longer possible to turn back and with each foot our situation became more serious we wound round the face of the rock and looked down into dizzy ravine whose bottom was already hidden by the gloom the path was only few feet wide and at many places washed away by the rain tiger with his piebald was ahead of and was leading his horse by long bridle all at once he cried to take care and i saw his horse step the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https then spring up again the rain had excavated the path here to some depth and by its side the rocks went down sheer without hesitation i seized the end of the bridle quickly crossed the dangerous spot and czar did the same gallantly königstein followed and then one after the other till the mules at length came up jack was ahead he went cautiously up and down and i saw the basket on his left side graze the precipice still he got across safely lizzy followed at his heels but sam swerved when he arrived at the spot made leap to get across struck his basket against the precipice and was hurled out into the abyss down which he fell with all four feet in the air general ah was the sole sound that passed our lips we were not yet out of danger ourselves ere long however the path grew broader and ran over grassy plateau whence we could look back at the dange rous point and into the dark abyss had we arrived from this side not one of us would have dared to lead his horse over it and we should have been obliged to ride round long way the loss of sam was serious to us he carried our coffee spirits several buffalo robes and articles of clothing little coffee was still packed on jack we had opened fresh bladder that very morning and that animal carried all the articles daily consumption still the matter could not be helped and we regarded the loss very fortunate one we might just easily have lost one of our horses which would have been far more serious we unpa cked the sun had set and we did not know what roads we might still ﬁnd we had grass our hungry cattle and water ourselves we carried with us we made small ﬁre of bois vache to which tiger presently brought few twigs of mimosa so that we were able to cook our supper then we supplied our friends whose bedding had fallen into the abyss with such blankets and hides we could spare the night was very cold and we missed good wood ﬁre terribly we rolled ourselves tighter in our blankets and skins but could not keep warm and were glad when daylight came and we could make our blood circulate by moving about all of us except antonio hurried off to look ﬁrewood in search of which we had to go some distance still the movement did us good and each brought an armful of wood back so that we soon had good ﬁre at which to warm our benumbed hands it was very early when we rode off with our buffalo robes over our shoulders we pulled the large woollen blankets that hung over the saddle across our lap so to keep our knees warm and throwing the bridle on the horse neck we put our hands in our the whole landscape looked if sugared the grass and bushes sparkled in the sunbeams with their coating of hoar frost and the rocks completed the wintry scene by the cold blue tinge they had in the shade this picture however passed away very rapidly and in an hour the rime was hardly to be seen even at the shadiest spots our path continually ran upwards and went up and down from one mountain saddle to another we saw several bears climbing up the rocks in these remote regions they are not very particular to the mode of going home and came across herd of antelopes some of which we shot about noon we reached hollow between two ranges of hills where we found fresh grass and stream whose banks were covered with low bushes we noticed about mile to our left at the spot where the stream ran out of precipitous and very narrow gorge eight buffaloes quiet ly grazing and resolved to hunt them we left our cattle under antonio charge and crept toward the animals here my comrades hid themselves in dry bush overgrown with raspberry creepers that stood nearly at the centre of the opening and tiger and i crept up to the buffaloes which were standing at the highest point of the ravine we reached some bushes not more than ten yards from the animals without their perceiving us and lay down on the ground in the midst of them we had each selected buffalo when they stared into our bush with tails erect they had probably scented us we ﬁred together and at the same moment there was trampling over us if cavalry regiment were charging i jumped up and ﬁred again at the ﬂying monsters which now had to run the gauntlet of my comrades guns one dropped close to them and second fell little farther on while the rest galloped down the stream tiger sprang up too and cut off buffalo near our bush which he said was the one i had shot his had ﬂed with the others my part i had not seen it the powder smoke still hung over my riﬂe when the brutes charged over us and we might consider ourselves fortunate that they had not trampled us with their huge feet we skinned one of them in order to use the skin substitute the one we had lost although an untanned buffalo hide is very clumsy thing to carry on we laid in stock of the best meat took all the and tongues and then followed very decent path which here left the main road and went down the stream eastward after little while the path trended more to the northern hills where we saw the smoke the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https ﬁres rising farther to the north tiger said it was lucky we had chosen this road on the other we should have ridden right into an indian camp two days we followed our path and crossed various streams which ﬂowed more to the south till the low hills became more scattered and the glens between them wider the vegetation was springing up here and the good pasturage induced us to grant our cattle some days rest they had been on short commons lately we selected very pretty where small stream ran under precipice and was covered on one side with scrub and few leafy trees while on the north and east rich prairie opened out and to the west the forest became thicker we had abundance of game of every description and many head bled to death around us merely the sake of the fascination which hunting exerts all had left camp in turn to hunt except clifton and myself and the latter asked leave on the second morning to try his luck it was ﬁne day and i proposed to accompany him but stipulated that we should ride clifton was delighted and quickly saddl ed his horse of remarkable value who up to the present had been the least fatigued of all our cattle by the journey we rode away from camp and received from our laughing comrades seasonable hint to take care and not lose ourselves we rode up the stream from which thick wood soon separated us on whose skirt we had followed the prairie we had ridden about an hour when we noticed little distance off some wild cattle proceeding toward the wood clifton was very eager to kill one of these animals but i warned him to be most cautious and reminded him that this was most dangerous hunt we rode slowly to the skirt of the wood and reached the spot where the herd had entered it when clifton pulled up under young oak wound his horse bridle round branch and ran off with his riﬂe and knelt behind large plane tree he had done this almost before i knew what he was about i rode few paces farther and saw large bull grazing with its head turned towards us but at the same moment clifton ﬁred the bullet was hardly out of the riﬂe ere the bull rushed at him with lowered head and clifton throwing away his gun took to ﬂight he reached young tree and swarmed up it while the savage brute dashed under his swinging legs and charged the y which attempted in vain to tear away its bridle from the branch in an instant the bull drove its head under the poor horse and with its monstrous horns tore its entrails out the horse fell to the ground with fearful piercing cry and at the same moment i sent bullet through the bull shoulder it turned and followed furiously into the prairie where i ﬂed before it in wide circle it became exhausted stopped and uttered furious roar while hurling up the turf with his horns and stamping on the ground with its feet i turned czar little to the right kept trusty back and sent my second bullet between the bull shoulders upon which it sank on one knee and soon rolled over i now hurried to clifton who was standing with tears in his eyes over his dead horse and repenting his want of caution but too late mourning over this sad loss we went back to camp on foot and there aroused great sorrow by describing our misfortune we consulted to what was now to be done and there was choice left but clifton to ride the mule lizzy while we divided her load between jack and antonio mare we sent to the scene of the accident to fetch clifton saddle and some meat from the bull and remained all day in camp in sorrowful the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall

supper in small wood at spring when trusty began barking and we heard the sound of horses we all ran to our horses and brought them together while we got our weapons in readiness when tiger leapt out of the bushes and shouted some words we did not understand to which answer was given though the sound of the horses hoofs ceased tiger hurried back shouted to us to fasten up our horses in the thicket which was effected in moment and then post ourselves round it behind the trees he believed that they were hostile indians all at once single voice was heard not far from us whose language was equally incomprehensible to us but which tiger at once replied to and springing up behind his tree he uttered his hunting yell he ran in the direction where we had heard the voice and shouted to they were friends delawares our joy was great our position would not have been favourable one if we had been attacked here by superior force it was dark and our thicket was commanded by thick scrub and trees so that our cattle at any rate would have been exposed to bullets or arrows from close distance tiger now came up to our ﬁre with an indian whom we soon joined and he introduced to us his friend the chief of delaware tribe whom he called young bear several of his men soon joined us most of whom spoke english and all were very friendly to us they seemed all to have known long time that tiger was living with us every one questioned him and appeared satisﬁed with his answers the chief remained at our ﬁre while his people went to camp close at hand he told us they had just left their settlement and were going to the southern prairies where the most buffaloes were but intended to march down the mountains to kill bears and lay in stock of grease and skins farther east there were great many indians on the prairie and we should better in not leaving the hills entirely although tribe would venture openly to attack us so long tiger remained with us he stopped to supper and then returned to his camp the next morning we visited the delawares and were pleased at the cordiality with which they welcomed us there were about forty warriors about half many squaws and heap of children they had at least hundred horses and mules with them some of which were remarkably handsome clifton requeste d to ask young bear whether he could supply him with good horse his people appeared to have more than they required the chief spoke to them on the subject and ere long several came up with horses which i advised clifton however to decline they were not good i was aware they would produce their worst horses ﬁrst after we had inspected and declined number of horses young indian came up with black horse which was really handsome it was powerful animal and showed in all points its noble breed the price he asked was two hundred dollars upon which i offered him thirty and after long chaffering we agreed on ﬁfty which clifton paid he was delighted with his purchase and had long reason to be satisﬁed the horse turned out most useful and excellent in every respect we breakfasted young bear sharing the meal with us and were busily preparing start when the chief came to and said that one of his men was inclined to go with us and it would be better us to have him with us he had often been on the rocky mounta ins and was acquainted with the tribes living there while tiger was only young man i was very pleased the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https offer which seemed to to be made chieﬂy on tiger account i told the chief i should be very glad and we would pay the man his services he had better ask him what he expected the indian powerful man between thirty and forty years of age now came forward and we agreed that we should pay him ﬁve dollars every month he spent with us till we returned home he was very pleased fetched his horse and joined our party we stopped at the camp of our friends bade them hearty farewell and marched northward animated by fresh courage our new comrade whose name was white owl was very quiet and sensible man who in short time gained the goodwill of all he helped us in everything and appeared anxious to supplant tiger in our favour by his activity and valuable services he was at the same time hunter and good shot so that he rarely returned to camp from hunting without game in few days we reached open prairies the mountains to the west seemed here much farther off and resembled blue clouds these were the mountain chains in which santa fé lies and whence annually enormous sums of silver are sent to mexico on the eastern side they are bordered by rich boundless prairies while their western slopes are washed by the rio grande on these plains we found vegetation more advanced and though the fresh grass was not enamelled by such varied ﬂora the prairies on the leone at this season still we saw around us several pretty ﬂowers which offered an agreeable variety to the eye small knolls and bushes well clumps of trees frequently broke the dead level and saved the eye from resting on an indistinct horizon at the same time these plains were enlivened by an extraordinary number of buffaloes large herds of wild horses antelopes and deer so that at every moment the hunter straying eye rested on something to interest him we marched eight days due north during which time we crossed many rivers ﬂowing to the east and came across tribes repeatedly one night we camped with party of shawnees whose chief was called greengrass and who behaved in the most friendly manner to us he promised to visit us next winter and made us present of several beautifully dressed he thought we should soon want them in addition we met osages creeks choctaws and small tribe of pawnees the latter displayed unfriendly intentions but we treated them sternly and resolutely they soon quitted us tiger shouted to them on parting that we could see their scalps at night well and so they had better keep away from us the pawnees are the most warlike tribe among the northern indians are splendid riders have horses and live between the platte and missouri rivers in proportion to the other northern tribes they are armed with but few ﬁrearms but use the lance and lasso with remarkable skill at the sources of the northern arm of canadian river we crossed the path which runs from santa fé to fort bent on the arkansas and thence to fort leavenworth on the missouri and few days after crossed another road running from independence on the missouri viâ taos in new mexico to francisco and saint fé the country here became very hilly the vegetation had scarce sprouted and the nights were cold our cattle were badly off here grass was scanty the roads very stony and covered with loose boulders of red granite which hurt their bare feet and they also suffered severely at night from the cold we now began to feel the loss of our coffee which lay buried between the mountains with sam and we equally missed on these cold nights the brandy which had shared the same fate in few days however we shook off these habits and our meals did not taste the worse without these articles of luxury we proceeded in order to enter the real rocky mountains and see the spanish peaks the highest in this range which lie to the south of the arkansas from which river we were now great distance the weather favoured us it was warm in the day and the young grass was sprouting in the valleys during these days we generally ascended and crossed number of small streams that ﬂowed from these mountains to the arkansas and always found good provender our cattle on their banks the mountains in the west continually rose and the spanish peaks of which three were much higher than the rest stood out more and more distinctly against the blue sky we reached mountain saddle and on its plateau rather frequented path which appeared to have been originally made by buffaloes though we noticed old upon it it trended to the north we followed it it must certainly lead to the banks of the arkansas the path became very fatiguing our cattle it was covered with ﬂinty boulders some of which had very sharp edges and injured the hoofs at the same time we found but little food them on this bleak elevation and noticed with sorrow that they were losing both ﬂesh and strength we had been following this path four days when we were compelled to lead our horses and expose our own feet to the sharp pebbles all were more or less lame and unable to the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https any farther jack was the only one that underwent change though he placed his little feet very cautiously on the ground we marched from sunrise to dusk without meeting with grass or drop of water our feet were painful too and we eagerly scaled every elevation in the hope of ﬁnding consolation on the opposite side the sun had set and night would long before have put an end to our journey had not the moon lighted us tiger who had gone on ahead awaited us on knoll with the cheering news that there was excellent pasturage here our cattle and water probably great distance off we passed through into glen where we soon stood in high grass and our animals greedily bit at it while we hobbled them and tiger went off with owl to look water the latter soon returned and told us that stream ran along the valley on the right after which he informed tiger of his discovery by several shrill yells and we now rose from the stones among the grass on which we had sunk greatly fatigued to reach the desired water tiger soon found us and he and owl led us between huge masses of scattered rock down to the stream where we refreshed our cattle crackling ﬁre of brushwood soon illumined the surrounding scenery we found plenty of wood to keep it up late at night we lay round it and watched our cattle enjoying the sweet grass we felt reluctance to fetch them in and tie them up at last however weariness compelled us to place them in our vicinity under trusty char ge so that we might rest after our exertions morning showed us that we had camped in small glen which being watered by numerous springs displayed rich vegetation its elevated situation the grass was fresh and mingled with many juicy plants which our cattle seemed to be very fond of the stream on which we had camped had good deal of bush on its banks out of which grew few stunted trees which by their growth and the moss covering their bark clearly showed that they did not feel at home in this region we were very pleased to have reached this oasis and resolved to let our cattle rest here at least week not only to enable them to regain their strength but also to give vegetation more time to sprout we made many hunting excursions but always on foot we wished to grant our cattle perfect rest and we could get through the mountains better in this way we did not ﬁnd the common deer here but the elk whose dry ﬂesh soon became repulsive to us now and then we killed an antelope and tiger brought in one evening mountain sheep an animal exactly like the ibex which lives in large ﬂocks in these mountains its meat is agreeable and tender and its skin produces leather clothes our stock of game was again reduced to the dry ﬂesh of an elk when at daybreak i cooked bit of it breakfast and after eating it seized my weapons and left the camp with trusty to go in search of better game i followed the stream some distance and soon reached the bare slopes which ran down to the arkansas here i turned to the stream which ran through the valley about six miles under and its banks were covered with green meadows and numerous bushes down to it ran bare smooth strata of rock between which countless gorges opened on to the stream which had been hollowed out by the mountain torrents in their furious course between them lay on the steep slopes patches of large and small rocks often piled up on each other if human hands had arranged them little vegetation was to be seen here few bushes rose from among the stones while here and there the broken withered stems of torch weeds which plant seemed the most common here stood in groups not tree or bush offered relief or variety to the eye gazing over this solitude right and left well across to the mountains on the other side so far i could distinguish objects nature seemed to be utterly dead i looked again at the narrow green strip which ran like long snake along the glistening stream and tried to discover the game grazing on it through my glass i noticed several elks well single buffalo and had walked about half an hour along the rocky strata when i reached group of stones which attracted my attention by their remarkable and picturesque arrangement the lower layer consisted of three enormous plates at least ﬁve feet thick on which again smaller ones rested and several stones rose in this way so that the ediﬁce resembled from distance pyramid which could be seen through at several spots i had walked to the base of this mass of stone and was examining its strange form when on looking back to the river i noticed three dark forms which were moving sideways toward up the steep and were scarce half mile from at the ﬁrst glance i recognised in them three grizzly bears rapidly advancing at behind one another i knew the danger of meeting these savage brutes and quickly measured the distance back to camp but i was on foot and felt if i had lead boots on which bound to the spot it was hopeless to think of escaping the animals were following course if they wished to the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https the rocks near which i was standing when they must cross the recent track of myself and trusty which they would indubitably follow at once it was pairing time at which season all beasts of prey are more savage and active and hunt more from the pleasure of killing than to pacify their hunger the grizzly is so fast that it can catch up buffalo or horse going at full speed and its gigantic strength renders it more enduring than any other animal only one chance of escape is left the man it pursues and that is tree this bear can not climb but then there was not tree anywhere around and besides i could not take trusty up one with and he must be saved i had time reﬂection the peril rapidly approached i laid my riﬂe on the ﬁrst layer of rock seized trusty round the body hoisted him on my shoulders and helped him on the rock up which he scrambled with one bound i was by his side then aided him up the second and third layers and laid myself close to him on the uppermost blocks where i placed my weapons and amm unition ready to hand if the bears passed under my fortalice i would let them go in peace in that case it was probable they would not ﬁnd my track but if they passed above it i must throw away opportunity to render them harmless soon possible i peeped over the rock with my riﬂe when the three monsters were scarce ﬁfty yards from proceeding to cross my trail above an old slouched carelessl y along in front close behind her followed gigantic very old and short distance in the rear came rather smaller male the old one drew up to the and laid his right paw on her leg but she was greatly offended by this caress and dealt my lord such blows with her enormous paws that the hair ﬂew out of him he sprang back she sat up showing her frightful teeth and with her side turned to i pressed my barrel ﬁrmly against the rock and pointed it at the heart of the i ﬁred she crossed her paws over her face and sank lifeless in second the old bear ran up to her and laid his paws over her but his rival came up and fearful struggle began between the two monsters in which they rolled over and over and tore out each other greyish brown wool in great masses the old bear had the best of it however and sat up uttering frightful growls at the small er bear by this moment i had reloaded and sent bullet into the brute near the heart with one bound it leapt on its foe which tried to escape it but the old bear held it tight in its and dug its monstrous teeth into the other back the other bear defended itself desperately and soon found that the old brute strength was giving way it sprang on it and buried its tusks in its chest and standing over it tore it up with its two i was certain of the victory and was so careless not to reload my riﬂe but ﬁred my second barrel at the younger bear without concealing myself properly behind the rock i hit it well but it scarce felt my bullet ere it turned its savage head toward and galloped toward the rock with an awful roar in an instant it reached the base of my fortress and sprang with its on the ﬁrst layer while it opened its throat and with smoking breath uttered the most fearful sounds at the moment when it raised itself on the rock i held my revolver near i could and ﬁred between its small glowing eyes it fell back but at once got up again and tried still more furiously to scale the rock by springing with all four feet at once upon the ﬁrst stage and raised its face just under i had pulled out my second revolver and held it cocked in my left hand i pointed both barrels at the monster head and ﬁred them together it turned over and rolled motionless on to the ground i looked at the two others which still lay quiet side by side and could scarce believe my eyes they gazed down on the victory which i had gained over these three terrors of the desert i quickly reloaded and looked around carefully from my fort especially in the direction from whence the brutes had come other male bears might easily follow their track i could see nothing to alarm and now sprang down from the rock with trusty went cautiously up to the bears and found them all lifeless they were three monstrous brutes the old bear must have weighed at least ﬁfteen hundred pounds the one thousand and the smaller bear eight hundred these beasts are often found on the rocky mountains where they are very numerous the hunters not care to pursue them everybody is glad to get out of their way and only uses weapons against them when he is attacked or can ﬁre at them from place of safety such boat on river when the bears are on land or from stout tree the indians also only ﬁght them in and hence their claws are considered the greatest mark of honour with which they can adorn themselves the value of grizzly stands in proportion to the danger the hunter incurs in pursuing it its hide is too heavy and its hair not so ﬁne that of the black bear it never becomes so fat the latter and its ﬂesh is not so delicate hence people are glad to avoid it and the hunter willingly surrenders his booty to it when on following the the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https of head of game he runs risk of being caught up by the grizzly this animal does not know what fear is and once irritated it will ﬁght and hit long it is able i know instances in which grizzly had some thirty bullets in its body ere it was killed but if hit at the right spot it falls easily any other animal the gives birth from november to january to two or four cubs which soon follow it on its forays and are trained to hunt which speedily develops the savage cruel qualities of the young monsters it hunts both in the mountains and on the prairies in the former it lays in wait the game and darts down from the rocks on its unhappy victim while on the latter it will chase its terriﬁed quarry miles and mercilessly rend it when captured instance it seizes buffaloes horses wild cattle at full gallop by the hocks tears out the sinews and in second renders them incapable of ﬂying farther when caught quite young and trained these animals become very tame but they must never be trusted any negligence may cost one life and i knew several instances on the frontier of men being torn by such tamed bears or at least losing an arm or leg i had had enough sport and ﬂed from the i was fearful of the advance of other foes i went straight to camp and was saluted by hurrah my early return indicated successful hunt i had the two mules got ready and invited the indians and john to go with they all wanted to know what i had killed but i merely told them that i had killed heap of game they would soon see we made hurried dinner and then started with the mules we soon reached the slope and rode quickly down to the river during which i constantly saw my rock fort but it was too far to notice my quarry my comrades believed that the game lay on the river and kept their eyes turned towards the latter while i led them little to the west of my rock to keep them from seeing the bears long i could when we were in right line with them i turned aside and we suddenly caught sight of them the amazem ent and surprise of the indians were very great and were expressed by the most extraordinary outbreaks they danced if stung by tarantula swinging their riﬂes over their heads round the dead bears and imitated their roar in remarkable manner at one moment they crept close to the ground up to the animals then ran past them with ﬁerce yells or leapt over them swinging their guns with wild shouts of delight after they had ﬁnished this dance of triumph they sat down on the old bear sharpened their knives on small stones they took out of their and wished to cut off its claws i told them however that i wished to keep this skin with the claws on but the two others were at their disposal with which they were perfectly satisﬁed we skinned the largest bear and cut out the best meat and the fat which we intended to take with us we took the paws and fat of the other two after the indians had appropriated the claws i pulled all the tusks out of the three heads and we now packed the mules to convey our booty to camp we intended to remain few days here i asked the indians if they would dress the large skin to which they readily assented this purpose they split the head with an axe and took out the brains we rejoined our comrades before sunse t who were also very pleased at my success we at once took some of the we had brought and fastened it with strips of hide round the hoofs of our cattle this fat refreshes the horn and deprives it of the brittleness which is the principal cause of its breaking when marching over stony ground my bearskin was staked out on the grass and we all set to work with our knives scraping off the ﬂesh and fat after which the brains were rubbed in and the skin rolled up we then laid heavy stones on it and hurried to supper which we greatly enjoyed after our powerful exercise during the day we repeatedly changed our camping ground partly to get fresh grass our cattle partly to have new stock of dry wood at hand and thus went farther down the stream we stopped here nearly fortnight by which time our horses were quite restored my large skin dressed and we bade to the glen which had given us such kind reception we followed the path again which had brought us here and in few hours reached the arkansas on which we found excellent pasture in the afternoon we crossed it and rode up its northern bank till evening put an end to our march and we camped in wood which was already adorned with young foliage the next morning we discovered close by to our great delight bee tree out of which the warm morning sun had already drawn the busy artisans it was an old plane several feet in diameter we soon attacked it with our axes and ere an hour had passed it crashed to the ground and the hollow burst open ﬁlled with most delicious honey we had glorious feed and man must like us have been awhile put on simple fare in order to appreciate the pleasure which such variation produces unluckily we had vessels in which to carry off much of it still we packed large stock of comb in and carried it with us some days but the comb soon ran and dirtied our baggage so that we were obliged to leave it the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https had ridden up the river two days when we reached an arm of it coming from the north up which we proceeded day and met with special difﬁculties one path ran through pretty glen on the right side of which the mountains gradually rose and stretched out their peaks far in the distance while on our left the was overhung by colossal precipices over which the mountain chain rose steeply with its pinnacles on the fourth morning however our bank became very rocky and we rapidly ascended toward the mountains we spent several nights without ﬁre or water and even during the day the latter well grass was very scarce my large which owl had made very soft was of great service to with its long close hair it was large enough to wrap three of us in the nights were chilly and my comrades complained greatly of cold we here crossed the highest point we had yet reached and the snow peaks did not appear to be very far from us still we found sufﬁcient grass our cattle in the gullies between the mountains we halted day at one of these grassy spots and i went with tiger early from camp to procure meat when ﬂock of mountain sheep drew us farther into the mountains we had ﬁred several bullets at them to effect and followed them in growing excitement from one rock to another until some hours later we reached plateau which was shrouded in fog our sheep ﬂew over this and disappeared in the mist we stood amazed at this phenomenon whose cause we could not explain it was clear bright morning and the hills around shone in the brightest sunshine we went up to the plain and found to our surprise that the mist covering it came from hot springs which rose to the surface in immense numbers the highest with jet of about three feet the plateau which was about mile in diameter was quite covered with these springs which produced great calcareous deposit this lime formed rim round each spring over which the water poured and collected into rivulet which ran down the eastern slope under thick cloud of steam we could drink the hot water though we could not hold our ﬁnger in it minute we walked between these hot springs on which the sun produced the most brilliant rainbows to the eastern side where the water ﬂowed away and reache d it bathed in perspiration the steam was very hot and we were constantly enfolded in it we could watch the course of the stream far through the mountains steam continually rose above it the water had slightly saline taste and was very like weak there is doubt but that these springs are mineral water which probably in hundred years or shorter period will prove most valuable to suffering humanity at the spot to which ﬂock of mountain sheep led and an indian there will then rise palaces and gaily dressed ladies and gentlemen will drive out and the time when only naked savages and few adventurers admired these beauties of nature will be forgotten but whether it will be so beautiful there then is quest ionable it is this very untouched nature which is so charming with its mosses and weeds on the bare rock its bushes growing out of the crevices its clumps of trees and its solitary gigantic pines behind which are the distant blue ranges all these pictures will be altered by human hands but rule not improved before we proceeded after the game i carved my name and the date of the year in large upright rock and we looked back frequently from the mountains at this strange scene we soon found sheep again but they ﬂed on our approach to the most inacce ssible rocks where they leaped with wondrous strength and certainty from one pinnacle to another and sometimes after desperate leap reached peak on which they had scarce room their four feet in such cases they looked round few minutes in their airy position and then ﬂew with equal strength across to the nearest precipice frequently over dizzy abysses whose bottom was concealed by mist after long tiring and unsuccessful stalking we scaled height and saw below us ﬂock of these animals stand ing on slope over which they could not leap we had cut off their retreat and did not consid er it possible that they could ﬁnd their way across the scattered peaks to lateral valley which was about twenty feet broad and about ﬁfty long we would not ﬁre at them where they stood they would have fallen over the precipice and we could not have got at them hence we showed ourselves and shouted on the supposition that they would dash up hill and pass us but they sooner saw us than an old ram leaped with an enormous bound on to projecting stone and thence to second till he reach ed the gorge on our right and darted up it we ran up to the gorge and i toppled the ram over with bullet the other animals followed it leap by leap and all reached the other side of the gorge excepting one ram which jumped short and fell backwards into it we looked after it and i felt certain that it would be killed and become our prey but it fell on the monstrous horns which nature has given these animals protection in such dangers turned over and leaped with the lightest bounds up the gorge where both tiger and i missed it we reached the dead ram by long circuit paunched it loaded ourselves with the best meat and the handsome skin and returned to the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https mile farther on we shot down another large sheep from rock and sent owl out to bring it in the mountain sheep i said bears great likeness to the ibex the ram has enormous curved horns with the points turned slightly outwards thick one arm close to the head and surrounded with rings its hair is more like that of goat than sheep of brownish gray colour and with dense coat of underwool the female has also horns but they are smaller and not turned outwards at the point they bear two lambs which while still very small follow them on their dangerous paths in the mountains at night the mountain sheep descend to the lowlands and are there easily killed by the hunters who lay in wait them while following them day by day in the mountains is most fatiguing dangerous and generally unsuccessful the skins of these animals are greatly sought by the indians to make clothes of they furnish handsome soft leather their meat is fat and agreeable they live in large ﬂocks and may be seen by day in the rocky mountains standing about the highest peaks at spots which it appears impossible quadruped to reach we had lack of game but saw to our great regret our supply of salt running out the greater part of it was lost with unlucky sam our clothes too were beginning to get defective especially our linen we had lost our changes on the same occasion we mended our shirts well we could and cut off from the tails to repair the damage higher up but all that they were speedily wearing out our stock of tobacco was all but expended but this article was the easiest to supply the leaves of the wild sumach represent it very well we were provided with the essentials however especially powder and ball these were distribu ted among the animals and we had enough to last us year great privation was impended over us when our salt was consumed and we so restricted its use that it would last some months in the hopes of obtaining fresh supply at one of the forts of the fur companies which are in the vicinity of the rocky mountains our good spirits did not desert us however but enabled us to endure all the fatigues of this mountain tour we passed two nights on ﬁelds of snow where we could hardly ﬁnd sufﬁcient ﬁring to prepare our supper at length our route descended to lower hills and we reached at their base plain which it seemed was enclosed by even loftier mountains whose saddles still bore the signs of winter while on the streams in this elevated valley which our indians called salade park may was ﬂaunting in her spring garb although the vegetation that surrounded us here could not be called luxuriant it did our cattle deal of good long time past we saw the ﬁrst time herds of wandering buffaloes among which we produced great destruction we had long been yearning their and tongues one morning we approached herd which was grazing among large scattered rocks and we all crept up to them under cover of the latter with the exception of antonio whom we left with the horses we lay in long line in the grass and behind stones and had shot ﬁve of the animals without being noticed when mac ﬁred and got up after doing so he had hit the old bull he ﬁred at badly and the latter slightly wounded charged furiously at him at this moment clifton jumped up not far from mac ﬁred his two bullets at the infuriated animal and then bolted with mac the buffalo dashed furiously after them while the two fugitives running at full speed threw away their riﬂes and lost their hats fright carried them over the grass if they had wings between the numerous rocks and they had contrived by making long detour to get within hail of us again when trusty whom i had laid on caught up the bull and attacked it in the ﬂank kick from its hind leg however threw the dog on his back and without stopping the savage brute dashed after our comrades and was only few yards from them when mac slipped and fell among the rocks just we dischar ged all our riﬂes at his pursuer the buffalo ﬂew over him followed clifton but short distance and then turned with fearful roar on mac who was trying to get up it sprang with lowered head toward the fallen man when second shower of bullets was sent at it but it would certainly have impaled mac had not trusty come up and pinned it by the snout our shouts enco uraged the brave dog the buffalo rose with him on its hind legs and fell backwards on the ground while we ran up and honeycombed it with pistol bullets we now helped mac up who had not we feared been trampled by the buffalo but had sprained his leg and complained of great pain hence we put him on his horse rode with him back to the stream we had crossed shortly before where he bathed his foot while we returned to the dead buffalo and cut out the best meat the marrowbones and tongues the result of this chase afforded us great dainties on which we revelled some days the meat kept good long time in the cold the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https xxiv ascent of the bighorn in week we crossed the valley by short stages and again reached the loftier mountains one afternoon we arrived at stream where we resolved to pass the night we did not know whether we should ﬁnd water farther on tiger at once hastened off to look game and my comrades preferred rest i set out to try my luck too i told antonio to follow on lizzy that i might not have to carry the game myself and had got about mile from camp when i noticed from clump of oaks herd of deer on grassy spot ahead of which looked like the ordinary virginia deer but were darker i took up to draw them toward the spot where i was standing was too barren to be able to stalk them i posted myself near an oak and antonio sat on lizzy behind the herd advanced toward on hearing my call and were near enough when antonio cried to here here i fancied he was alluding to the approaching deer and whispered that i could see them but he repeated his here and presently added look to your right i turned and saw an enormous bear forty yards from i tried to ﬁre but the bear got behind large oak and then behind another and so was good distance off ere i could despatch bullet after it which i heard enter tree it escaped i had left trusty in camp his feet were sore from running over sharp stones lately the bear heard the call and hurried up believing that there was booty it it was only variety of the common black bear i would gladly have secured its beautiful skin it is rarity but it was out of my reach and hence i returned to the deer which after my shot had disappeared in distant wood i went after them and found them grazing again when i emer ged from the bushes i shot large deer and found to my surprise that it belonged to genus i had never seen before it was of very dark almost black colour much larger than virginia deer and more lightly built with longer black scut it had cast its antlers and the new ones had already grown to some size we packed the entire animal on lizzy and carried it to camp where owl called it or deer variety not uncommon in the lower regions of the rocky mountains our road rapidly ascended from here to the higher mountains and became daily steeper and poorer in vegetation still the path we followed was very fair so that we rather rapidly surmounted the heights on whose small plateaus our cattle were able to rest again we left behind us in few days many mountai n chains with their narrow valleys when suddenly the mountains before us became covered with snow and we were soon in the wintry landscape again we suffered terribly from the cold our clothes were not at all suited such temperature and though we wrapped ourselves in our skins we could not keep warm i was the best protected i hung my large bearskin over and sitting upon it wrapped myself up from head to foot but all that i did not get warm during the ride and we were very glad when we reached hollow in the evening where we found but little snow and clump of trees in which we camped and warmed the atmosphere around us with an enormous ﬁre on the following day our road ran principally over rocks but we came now and then to spots where the sun had melted it while all around us rose mountains which even at midsummer not doff their winter garment at last early one morning after spending the night at very poor ﬁre we ascended saddle whence we looked down into plain whose end in the blue misty distance was bordered by high mountains while on the west and east it was begirt by immense ranges whose lower chains ran down sharply on both sides in the most remarkable shapes the steepest rocks here rose precipitously over the valley and the white stone formed long pinnacles round domes globes resting on their pillars in word the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https shapes so that our wondering eyes were tempted to see in them towers castles and monuments while farther on the mountain masses rose above each other with tinge and touched the clouds with few isolated peaks the valley itself if it may be called so at this elevation was well watered and from south to north glistened at the base of the western mountains the surface of large river while on the side signs of water were also visible except the forest of pines on the sides of the mountains vegetation seemed to be restricted to the vicinity of this water where we noticed good deal of bush and some rather lofty trees of the aspen and poplar kind the greater portion of this extensive undulating plain only displayed desolate tracts of stone and rocky knolls our indians call this mountain glen old park and the river before us the sources of the rio colorado which ﬂows through new mexico and california to the distant paciﬁc where it falls into the gulf of california we hastened to the lower regions and on the third day reached the river whose course we followed few days after we were surprised by two men we were letting our horses graze at noon they were beaver trappers who had been hunting some years in these mountains and paid us visit in the hope of procuring provisions from us we showed them however that in this respect we were almost badly off themselves and that with the best will we could not meet their wishes they were both canadians of french origin and had led this life in the desert many years they were men of very slight education with repellant manners and disagreeable very coarse appearance so that we were not sorry when they took their riﬂes and went away with hurried farewell we marched about week near this river till we reached bend when it suddenly trended to the west and thence pursued its uninterrupted course through the enormous plains we crossed here an arm of the river which came from the east and followed another up stream to the we constantly drew nearer to the mountains on the east and ere long the highest peak clad in eternal snow rose distinctly against the blue sky before us the indians called this the bighorn which agreed with the statement of the two trappers of whom we had inquired i had been determined from the commencement of the journey to get high i could up this peak and hence steered toward it on the second evening we reached the outer hills and resolved to take our cattle far was safe regarding food them and then continue our journey afoot it was the second half of june the weather splendid and the heat at times oppressive by day while the nights remained extraordinarily cold the farther we advanced in the mountains the scantier food became our cattle but on that account they were all the safer during our absence from an attack of hostile indians who rarely venture so far into the mountains on the third day after crossing considerable chain of mountains we reached small glen which on the east side was enclosed by precipices and on the offered an open view of the mountains of old park it was covered with good grass amply supplie d with and watered by beautiful stream which forced its way through the ravine by which we had entered this spot exactly satisﬁed our purpose it was remote from regular paths protected against possible storms and could be easily defended hence we formed our camp here conveyed our traps under overarching rocks where they were protected against storm and rain and hunted some days in the neighbourhood in order to provide those who remained behind with food some time i had selected tiger to accompany and wished only to take one other of my comrades with while the other four remained in camp i proposed that john mac and clifton should draw lots to who should accompany but the two latter gave way in favour of john who gratefully accepted on the morning of our departure i rolled up my large bearskin and sewed straps to it in order to be able to carry it on my back john and tiger did the same with buffalo hides and ere long all our preparations start were completed we urged on our comrades the greatest caution and then said in the hope of ﬁnding them all right on our return we walked bravely up the mountains from one chain to the other tiger being ahead and trusty behind sometimes we came to paths along which we went pleasantly at others we crept on hands and feet up the steep granitic strata and with every hour we had more extensive view to the west on the ﬁrst day we covered considerable distance at least miles we saw an incredible number of mountain sheep which at our appearance ﬂew up the precipices and gazed down at us in amaz ement tiger shot large ram and we each took lump of the ﬂesh with us while we left the rest to trusty toward evening we came to stream and though it was still early we halted we found plenty of scrub in the vicinity with which to light ﬁre and roast our meat it was an exquisite spot where we camped beneath our feet the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https quite distinctly the white rock towers which border old park and between which our friends were encamped we gazed at the immense mountain valley below us and the windings of the stream through it we noticed on its western side the mountain chains that ran up to it and saw clearly where the water forced its way through them taking course still these mountains formed the border line of our view we were not yet high enough to be able to see over them the air was pure and clear but it soon became very cold and so soon the sun sank behind the mountains we rolled ourselves up in our hides we had collected large stock of wood in order to be able to make blaze quickly but determined to keep it up all night but we had forgotten our fatigue which soon made us fall asleep and we did not wake till daybreak dawn aroused us and animated the extensive landscape around us whose glens were covered by thick damp fog while fresh breeze blew round the heights we soon ﬁnished breakfast and when the sun shone on the ﬁrst peaks of the western mountains we were again ascending the mountain in the direction of our object after ﬁlling our afresh we went the whole day indefatigably up the steeps through desolate rock strata almost entirely denuded of vegetation between which with the exception of few clumps of ﬁr only grasses reeds and sprang up we very frequently came to water which indubitably had its source in the snow melting on the peak toward evening we reached plateau which seemed to separate the higher regions from the lower and extended up and down the mountains with but slight breaks far we could see it was at least three miles in breadth and offered us free prospect of the mountain saddle and its isolated peaks of which the bighorn rose far above the others all these peaks were covered with bluish coat of ice and shone and glistened so in the sun that it hurt the eyes to look at them any length of time while the hollows displayed the pure white of the snow number of snowy peaks stood in large circle around us among which two enormous domes rose to the sky the northernmost being the highest and bearing the name of the bighorn on its northern side it is perfect precipice while on the south it forms several steep terraces while the lower peak bears to some degree resemblance to truncated cone we soon recognised the impossibility of reaching these icy heights still it appeared to us feasible to scale the back of the mountai n farther to the north we noticed there in deep gap which ran almost to the summit isolated spots free from snow the sun was now approaching the distant mountains in the west the sky gradual ly turned red and at last stretched out over them like stream of ﬁre from which their peaks stood out like gleaming ﬂames the whole boundless landscape around us was suffused with warm red light and the peaks in the east had changed their brilliant white into dark transparent carmine we stood in silent admiration and saw the last beams of the glowin g sun disappear behind the mountains ere long the gloom of nightfall spread over the earth the eastern sky was covered with the nocturnal dark purple blue and the still illumined snow peaks alone looked down on us like the last gleam of departing day an icy cold wind reminded us that it was time to look and without long consideration we went toward the mountains and reached group of scattered rocks between which we found species of moss and dry hard grass which of fered us softer couch than the bare stones we were not quite asleep when the fearfully plaintive tone of some animal which was probably bidding farewell to life in the claws of grizzly bear rang through the mountains still this did not prevent us from falling into the soundest sleep and trusting our safety to the faithful dog the rising sun saw us again en route over very difﬁcult ground the ravines which we always followed in order to skirt the precipices were at times so full of large blocks that we could not jump from one to the other without danger while the rock strata we were compelled to climb were often too high us to lift ourselves upon them hence we were obliged to make numerous circuits and could not advance so rapidly the distance would have allowed about noon we were scaling height when suddenly mighty condor spread out its enormous wings with loud yell and rose from rock with great effort and we saw mountai n sheep hanging in its claws it swung itself on to the nearest peak and sat down there looking over at us with extended wings and croaking hoarsely we raised our riﬂes almost simultaneously and the eagle sank lifeless on its quarry tiger climbed up and threw both down to us the sheep was one year old ewe and welcome to us delicate food while tiger appropriated the eagle feathers and claws we cut the ﬂesh from the sheep and rubbed salt into it after giving it hearty beating thus when our stock of roast meat was expended we should be able to fall back on raw meat we had ﬁre the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https continued our journey and soon reached snow which only remained however on the north side the air became very cold which rendered breathing difﬁcult and we could not walk fast evening surprised us completely surrounded by snow and we had to go long distance ere we found under southern precipices spot where the sun had melted it away here we slept and my comrades woke several times and asked whether i was not could not close an eye while i was tolerably warm they shook again before daybreak and we continued our journey pulling our skins tightly round us the snow was frozen very hard and had generally rough surface so that we passed easily over it our long sticks which we frequently sharpened here served us in good stead at doubtful spots we felt with them whether the snow would bear us and doubt we frequently crossed deep places into which we might easily have sunk at eleven in the forenoon we at last scaled the highest point after excessive toil and stood on wide snow ﬁeld which sloped down on the east to hollow behind which other snow mountains rose and in the extreme distance the sky formed the background to the south rose the white peaks of our saddle above which extended the two mighty crests of the bighorn the bluish cold colour of these enormous snow domes contrasted with the warm reddish tint of the mountains and the sunlit landscape below them and the icy peaks dazzled our eyes when we looked up at them before us in the west stretched out scene which i can not ﬁnd words to describe faithfully to the right and left on the sides of the snowy mountains which formed semicircle we saw sea of hills and rocks in the most eccentric shape above them rose to an immense height the various peaks vividly illumined by the sun and between them lay the dark shadows of the mighty glens which were enclosed by precipices only rarely did the living green of foliage peep out of the desol ate scene which was slightly enlivened by the more frequent clumps of pines and the straying glance gladly rested on the isolated patches of grass whose fresh juicy green imparted warmth to the landscape at our feet we gazed at the depths till our eyes rested on the wondrous outline of the precipices which surrounded old park on this side and we followed the silvery ribbon of water that wound through it old park lay like narrow glen before us lost in the mist and often crossed by ranges that connected the eastern and western ranges far away in the misty distance above the mountain chain that borders old park on the west our eyes rested on the enormous plains which sink from the rocky mountains to the paciﬁc and in the extreme distance their outlines became blended with the sky they seemed to be crossed by but few ranges to the we could distinguish lower chains of hills while in the west and long dark cloud was visible which indicated to us the snowy mountains or maritime alps of california so far we could see this country appeared to us but slightly wooded and not very well watered the course of the rio colorado was alone marked by lower ranges of hills and the hue of the vegetation our eyes were ﬁxed long time on this grand landscape and we found it difﬁcult to bid it last farewell but the cold warned us to start so that night might not surprise us on these inhospitable heights on which we did not see sign of living creature it was one we once more bade adieu to the cold desolate spot which had afforded us this enchanting prospect and then hastened to our last night where we arrived with frozen beards we passed very cold night here the wind had got up and we felt very happy when we left the snow behind us on the following day at noon we rested and paciﬁed our hunger with the remainder of the raw ﬂesh which the condor had provided us then we continued our journey and reached before evening the foot of hill where we found water and sufﬁcient scrub to prepare supper of fat ram which we had killed on the road on the next day we joined our comrade s again all right found them in the best spirits and our cattle rested and strong before the camp they had erected number of small scaffolds of sticks on which meat cut in strips was being smoked over ﬁres and very large and small hung on the rocks proved the nature of the meat which was drying owl had shot close by an old and one of her cubs whose meat our comrades were now drying the purpose of taking with them this was very welcome when little is roasted with dry venison the latter becomes dainty and fat we heartily enjoyed the tender meat of the young bear which weighed some sixty pounds and the ﬁre which we had so missed some nights unfortunately our salt was now out and the same with our tobacco while we could not expect to ﬁnd in these mountains any sumach leaves which we could smoke in word we were out of everything except ammunition our clothes literally consisted only of and we merely carried with us the remains of our linen to use bandages in the case of wound still we were in good spirits and healthy bears and comforted ourselves with the thought that in few months we should obtain supplies at one of the forts to the east of the rocky the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https started on the morning after our return to camp and went back through old park and up an arm of the colorado we followed its windings across the hills to the point where mountain torrent it formed the most exquisite cascades in falling over the rocks we halted long way up it and though we were once compelled to quit it through the impassable nature of its banks we sought to reach it again soon its crystalline waters contained delicious trout some weighing twelve pounds abundance of game grazed on its banks and the latter always afforded us plenty of wood our camp ﬁres moreover it continually formed the prettiest in which we refreshed ourselves morning and evening at last however we were compelled to say to this pleasant friend it broke up into several small streams and we ere long reached the highest point of the which we had scarce crossed however ere we found on its northern side an exactly similar stream which instead of ﬂowing southward to join the paciﬁc runs due north and in great curve round the black mountains on the north platte river and then through missouri and mississipp i to the gulf of mexico we greeted this stream with great joy it afforded us the same comforts the one we had just left and followed its course down to the spurs of the mountain chain which we reached on the second evening and found in its valleys rich vegetation these regions which seemed however to be conﬁned to the vicinity of water the on which we camped was covered with oaks and pines through which our torrent wound down to the valley in front of us which we could survey from our elevated post the hills gradually descended into it and in its centre rose conical lofty rock whose pinnacles had exactly the shape of ruined castle our stream wound round this rock and glistened in the wood that covered its banks we also saw few buffalo scaling the lower rocks to crop the scanty weeds that grew among the crevices it was getting on sunset and still early enough to secure few marrowbones from these emigrants hence tiger john and clifton hurried off antonio following them on jack in quarter of an hour we saw our hunters emer ge from the wood at the base of the rock and approach the buffaloes by stepping behind the stones light clouds of smoke rose above their heads and the crack of their riﬂes reach ed us while we saw one of the animals fall in heap and the others ﬂying up the mountain side next antonio with the mule joined our comrades who had collected round the animal and were busy in breaking it up königstein and i had meanwhile lit roaring ﬁre and mac and owl pulled some trout out of the adjoining stream so that when we were all assembled again in camp we had the prospect of glorious supper the next morning we ﬁnished packing our cattle at an early hour and were about leaving our camp when we saw behind the rock in the valley the smoke of many ﬁres rising which indicated very large indian camp we must employ the precaution of ﬁrst ﬁnding out to what tribe they belonged and in which direction they were going so we rode down into the glen and concealed ourselves in the thick wood tiger and i then went to the rock and climbed to the top of it whence we could survey the valley on the opposite side who can describe our surprise on seeing at our feet large animated camp with all the signs of civilization from the numerous gay tents pennants blew out in the fresh breeze and between men horses and mules were moving in the strangest confusion here and there laggards crept out of the tents and ran off to the stream to remove the last traces of sleep in its clear waters round the ﬁre other men in the strangest costumes were busied in preparing breakfast while others were proceeding to and from the stream with horses and mules our amazement was great and our joy knew bounds i pulled out the last remnant of pocket handkerchief fastened it to the end of my riﬂe and then dischar ged both barrels while swinging my white ﬂag high above my head i saw that the attention of all the occupants of the camp was directed to us and many arms were raised pointing at us salvo of at least ﬁfty shots answered my greeting and handkerchiefs were waved in the air we soon descended from our observatory and hurried back to our comrades to impart the pleasant news to them and we galloped along the stream round the rock and toward the camp where our little party were received with thundering hurrah in an instant we were surrounded by crowd of curious persons who assailed us with thousand questions i gave antonio and königstein the charge of our cattle and traps and then went with my other friends into camp following the eager crowd who led us to large marquee in the centre from which long white pennant ﬂoated man came to meet whose features seemed familiar to at the ﬁrst glance and on whose face i could plainly read that i produced the same impression on him we offered each other hand with an inquiring glance and after the ﬁrst few words of greeting i recognised an old acquaintance lord whom i had last seen ten years before on the east of the continent the pleasure of meeting again was heightened by the most peculiar circumstances under which it took the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https sat down at the ﬁre and i described my journey to this spot and my plans its continuation thousand questions interrupted my story and when we reached the present moment we leapt back to the time of our last meeting and followed the course of my life up to the commencement of the present tour his lordship was already acquainted with some of the details but i had much to tell him of since the day when i bade farewell to civilization i then heard from him in return the story of his life which though moving along smoother surface claimed my entire attention during the period he had been back to europe and made lengthened excursion to asia still his passion this great unadulterated nature had brought him back to the mountains of the new world to bid them last farewell more serious duties recalled him home he had started from independence in missouri with large party of friends europeans and americans and number of voyageurs and engaged the tour in small steamer up the missour i and then proceeded up the yellowstone far the depth of water allowed they landed there numerous saddle and pack animals provisions tents and other traps and had gone overland through the mountains to the banks of the platte which they had followed to this point round the black mountains the whole company consisted of about eighty persons they had about one hundred animals with them most of which they purchased of indians at the fort where they left the steamer and had also taken dozen of the latter into their service this small army offered the most curious sight i ever beheld all sorts of dresses from the savage to the most elegant gentleman were before us many young swells from the eastern luxurious cities of this continent well from those of the old world educated in ballrooms operas and concert rooms had followed their fancy in the selection of their costumes and appeared in mediæval garb with plumed hats jerkins with slit sleeves leathern breeches tall napoleon boots with enormous spurs large gauntlets and had put on the swords of their forefathers others had preferred the old spanish costume and donned loose velvet blue or green paletots while the hat of an italian brigand chief with its feather covered their long perfumed locks and broad white was turned down over their shoulders the open sleeves displayed the ﬁne linen of their shirts wide trousers were forced into long red morocco leather boots on which large wheeled spurs rattled and brace of handsomely inlaid pistols and long dagger ornamented their belt others again had read cooper and chosen his heroes their model they were dressed in leather from head to foot with gray hat long heavy at their side and leaning on an enormous riﬂe they seemed to envy my shabby clothes all stiff with blood while their dress which had only just left the tailor hands had not spot on it others again had remained faithful to the appearance of the gentleman of the broadway new york had put on hat instead of the of civilization and went about the camp in comfortable slippers smoking ﬁne havannah cigars only one fashion had gained the victory over the national and fancy costumes here represented this was the beard which had not been troubled by razor long time we soon formed acquaintances among this medley of characters and led life than which better could not be found at the palais royal the most delicate wines graced our table which was covered by artistic cooks with the daintiest dishes we smoked the best cigars and drank the ﬁnest mocha all these things so precious to us were rendered more agreeable by the cheerful humour that prevailed all through the camp and was displayed in every conversation we spent the time in ﬁring at mark in riding races in various sports in which agility was displayed in and in dicing in hunting which sport however only appeared popular with portion while the rest amused themselv es nearer camp owing to the great number of animals our new acquaintances had with them they had not always found sufﬁcient forage them on the mountains whence they had selected this rich pasturage to give them time to rest and to enjoy little repose themselves i remained with my comrades four days in camp during which time we were favoured with the most splendid weather and on the ﬁfth we got ready after breakfast to continue our journey and bid adieu to our friends who intended to spend some time here my friend had supplied us with all the requisite stores the pleasant continuation of our tour had pressed upon us many luxuries and given us perfectly new outﬁt so that we were now better equipped than when we began our journey owl and tiger were handsomely remembered at which they felt very happy hung themselves and their horses with numerous ornaments and never let their out of their hand and several others would have been glad to buy tiger piebald and offered him about 200 dollars it but he had thought of entering into any bargain of the sort and he always pretended not to hear when the subject was brought up the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https at last led our horses out of camp accompanied us with few of his friends while ﬁnal farewell was given us by salvo of riﬂe shots the gentlemen rode several miles with us and then returned to their friends accompanied by our warmest thanks and heartiest wishes their welfare we were now reduced again to our own small number but were in very different state from that prior to our meeting with our new friends we had all our wants again supplied and they now afforded us double enjoyment after the lengthened privation our pipes again burnt incessantly at times we even had cigar change and at the spring we reached brandy was often mixed with the water we drank we halted at very early hour although we could easily have ridden another hour we were following the river but the supper that awaited us was too inviting us to delay it any longer now once again coffee was drunk our meat peppered and salted and biscuit eaten with it and before going to bed glass of grog swallowed which comforts people can not always value at home but which afford great enjoyment after having been missed so long time we had again reached valley which runs between the rocky mountains and is called new park the mountains on both sides drew very closely together here and at some spots hardly left space the river to pass which was swollen by numerous torrents and already had rather powerful current it was still only torrent however which dashed over large rocks and hurried along foaming and roaring between the hills the mountains on our right hand are called by the indians the medicine mountai ns our road here was often very fatiguing and was rendered smooth and slippery by several violent showers so that we were often obliged to dismount and lead our horses on the descents fear of them falling one evening we reached rather lofty point where we found little grass and few live oaks the river rustled below us scarce mile distant through the rocks and received there spring which ran from small coppice near us we had been awakened on the previous night by sudden shower and our traps had been lying about us uncovered many of them were wet through before we could get them under shelter in the darkness the sky was also overcast this evening we thought it advisable to put up our small tents after supper we gathered our traps together under the tarpaulin on which we laid large stones and then crept into our tents after wishing each other the night was calm and warm so that when königstein lay down by my side and fastened up the opening of our tent which faced to the north i got up and opened it again it was oppressively hot in our conﬁned space our conve rsation was but short our tongues grew heavy the rustling of the neighbouring stream was blended with the sound of our broken sentences and deep sleep carried us into the land of dreams an breeze awoke suddenly and when i started out of my sleep the storm drove the cold rain through the entrance of the tent into my face and violently shook its sides i roused königstein and was about to jump up when violent blast raised the tent above us and carried it off into the darkness while streams of rain lashed us all my companions shared the same fate and ran about in the darkness seeking their blankets hats and articles of clothing at the same time we heard the sound of ﬂying horses probably ours which startled by the ﬂapping of our tents had torn themselves loose we ran to the spot where we had secured them and only found czar and john mare but sign of the others except the broken lassoes in the darkness i had thrown my large bearskin over and concealed my weapons under it so i remained with czar turning my back to the storm and bade him be quiet while i saw the others running back and forwards like shadows the storm grew more furious still and the powerful tornado seemed desirous of carrying away with it everything that did not bend before it i leant my shoulder against young oak in order to keep on my feet but the tree often bent so low to touch the ground with its foliage my comrades had least i could not notice them anywhere the darkness was so dense that i could not see yard before it was impossible to call to each other you could not even hear your own voice at the same time the rain still poured down in almost horizontal direction and formed strea m round my feet there was lightning in the north but neither thunder nor lightning had appro ached us until suddenly the eastern mountains were lit up by brilliant ﬂashes which displayed their white peaks and the ground trembled beneath tremendous clap of thunder more than an hour the lightning did not cease longer than few seconds and the thunder roared uninterruptedly between the hills but at last the storm moved up the valley and left an impen etrable darkness behind we gradually came together again and would assuredly have laughed at each other had this been the time it we were wet to the skin stood in the cold night breeze upon saturated bottomless ground and what the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https of all most of our cattle had bolted it was simply impossible to light ﬁre so we made attempt to so we could not seek dry materials in the darkness nothing was left us but to wait quietly till day arrived which on this occasion seemed to delay terribly at length the new light gleamed over the hills and we could soon distinguish objects around we had melancholy prospect here lay wet buffalo robe blanket or leathern jacket there some hats were half buried in the mud farther on we saw one of our tents hanging on an oak wherever we looked storm and rain had left traces of their destruction joyous surprise was prepared us with the return of light we saw honest jack grazing higher up the valley and königstein following him tiger and owl soon set out to seek the other horses which would be easily found if accident had happened to them and there were thick woods in this valley to hide them from us we fetched up jack and the and while the indians followed the trail of the horses we sought under the stones dry grass and roots with which to light ﬁre which caused us great difﬁculty and only succeeded after several failures then we put up sticks round it in order to dry our traps and ﬁnally looked up those which had been blown away the articles under the tarpaulin had remained quite dry the water ran through the brushwood on which we had laid them while the heavy stones kept the cover down in time we got everything in order again and about noon we saw our indians coming down the valley and driving our animals before them which they had found long way in the mountains in two parties during the whole day we were occupied in repairing damages the tents had to be mended the broken lassoes reknotted the saddles and bridles cleaned from mud and short the whole day was spent in getting ready to start again the next morning however we mounted again and one could notice that our equipment had suf fered severely since our from lord and his friends about ten days had passed during which we never went far from the platte river the impassable precipices of the mountains on both sides ran down almost close to the river at last the latter opened the mountains on our left trended to the west and before us was spread out an extensive and hilly tract which offered rather decent pasturage these rough regions i intended to follow the river generally to the large prairies on the east of the rocky mountains in order to visit fort lamarie and then proceed homewards across the open plains to the south it was warm afternoon when we cut off large bend which the river described and riding over grassy plain got several miles away from it the sun shone hotly on our backs the horses walked with drooping heads through the tall grass and we jolted silently in our saddles every now and then putting straight the embroidered blankets on which we sat folds in them become disagreeable in hot weather i was riding on the left wing of our cavalcade and had turned to trusty who was stalking behind czar with hanging tail when on looking across the prairie i fancied i saw about half mile off two human forms conceal themsel ves in the grass without checking my horse i called tiger up and imparted to him what i fancied i had seen he advised not to look round he was riding on my right hand and without exciting suspicion while talking to could keep in sight the entire plain on our left we had been riding on long time when tiger suddenly pulled round his piebald and galloped across the prairie in the direction where i believed i had seen the men we stopped to look after him and watched him ride through the grass but presently turn his horse toward us he told they were probably blackfoot indians who were following trail in order to steal some horses from his party close to the spot where he had seen one of them was pool and hence it was useless to seek him he would have concealed himself in it however he was of opinion that we must be on our guard here so that they might not get hold of any of our horses these indians had eyes in the darkness and could walk more softly than sleep during the following night we again encamped on the river and fastened our horses near camp where trusty mounted guard over them he appeared extremely restless got up several times went growling round our camp and barked frequently but our rest was not otherwise disturbed early the next morning we were folding up our furs tiger returned to the ﬁre saturated with dew he had gone over the neighbourhood and said there was number of black feet close by the dog had prevented them from approaching our camp at night but they could not be an entire tribe or else they would have ventured an attack by day he had found several tracks going round our camp at some distance tiger told us that the blackfeet live farther north and only come so low down purposes of plunder but here they had to be on their guard against the utahs sioux pawnees sacs and foxes who occupied this country and lived at war with them the blackfeet are pursued by nearly all the other indian tribes when they venture south and in former years when they prowled about the present state of the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https were hunted by the ﬁrst settlers there like wild beasts the power of these indians is very considerable and their number is probably the largest of all the numerous tribes of natives they live between the sources of the missouri and river tolerate other tribe there and are warlike and cruel to their conquered foes the crows their neighbours are much fewer in number but all that oppos them in the ﬁeld and wage the most sanguinary wars with them neither nation however dares to cross the without being pursued by the indians living on the opposite side they only so when they have prospect of committing robbery without any great risk or capturing few scalps from their enemies we followed the river to the spot where the river falls into it and tiger and owl made an excursion along its banks and brought in the news that some forty blackfeet had crossed the river probably expecting that we would follow the platte farther up to the black mountains to watch us and attack us in the narrow passes they told us these enemies would not leave us till we had passed that region and we must constantly keep watchful eye on them we camped on this side of the river and talked over our further tour over the camp ﬁre and owl was of opinion that we should better by following the course of this river and effecting our retreat through lamarie plains between the medicine and black mountains on this route we should be less troubled by indians than on the great eastern prairies and with the exception of buffaloes and wild horses might expect to ﬁnd much more game there we heard tiger who was of the same opinion and soon agreed to follow this road we ﬁshed in the river till it grew quite dark and had just put supper on the ﬁre when tiger and owl took their riﬂes and after telling us to keep bright the blackfeet went up the river and soon disappeared i ordered königstein to mount guard at the end of the small wood in which we had camped at the spot where it joined the platte and promised to relieve him in an hour we thus changed sentries until about eleven when i relieved john it was not very dark although the moon was not shining and sitting on the ground i could not only see across the platte but distinguish objects in the grass some distance trusty lay by my side with his head resting on his crossed paws suddenly however he raised his nose and i heard his low growl which i stopped by wave of my hand he kept his nose turned obstinately up stream in which direction i also kept my eyes ﬁxed on the grass i felt with the hand i had laid on trusty that his attention was growing greater he began trembling all over which he did when he was forced to master his growing excitement still i could not distinguish anything that appeared to strange the grass in front of was not tall and there were but few patches of scrub all at once i fancied that bush about ﬁfty yards from had moved but it might be imagination i had been gazing at it so intently profound silence brooded over the landscape which was only interrupted by the continuous monotonous rustling of the river in our camp voice was audible and the bright ﬁre which had lit up the surrounding trees and bushes had burned down and only indicated its position by glimmering light when i took my post half an hour previously owl and tiger had not returned and since then i had not heard them arrive the air was very damp and cold and the grass around felt quite wet i now fancied i could be certain that the bush had moved i rose little and looked at it more sharply it moved again and dark object in the shape of large stone slowly rose out of the grass now i could entertain doubt it was living creature but what could it be that was matter of indifference to so long it was not either tiger or owl and they would not approach our camp so cautiously and suspiciously it could be none but blackfoot i rose on one knee cautiously lifted my riﬂe and aimed well i could the darkness at the object whose indistinct outline now covered nearly the whole bush bang the ﬂame ﬂashed from the riﬂe and hollow plump into the river followed few seconds later before the smoke had risen on the damp atmosphere i looked at the dark shining surface of the water and noticed that large circles surrounded black spot and were moving with it toward the middle of the stream i ﬁred my second barrel at it i clearly saw through the gloom that the motion of the water became very violent at the moment but then it was all over and the next minute the current ﬂowed on usual and nothing on its surface revealed what was passing in its depths i had scarce ﬁred the second shot when my comrades dashed up under arms i quickly told them what had happened and we remained under arms awaiting the return of our indians of whom we had yet heard nothing about an hour later they returned and tiger at once asked why we had been ﬁring then he told us what had happened to him and that my shots had robbed them of several blackfeet scalps they had crossed the river little higher up at point where it was shallow and lay down on its banks they expected that the savages would return during the night to try and get hold of our horses shortly before i ﬁred tiger the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https and seen the branches of neighbouring bush parted but after that all became quiet again tiger fancied that their number was considerable but we had nothing more to fear from them on this night and could go to sleep in peace however we posted sentries till daybreak when i and tiger examined the spot at which i had ﬁred we found that my bullet had cut away spray in the centre of the bush and noticed the track of an indian which was distinctly marked on the bank and tiger recognised it that of blackfoot owl swam across the river and examined the opposite shore to see whether he had landed there but could not discover any sign and pointing to the river supposed he was sleeping under that we slept quietly till eight then breakfasted and packed our anima ls so to continue our journey on the new plan tiger said that the blackfeet would be cheated out of day they were awaiting us farther down the platte and if they had not their horses with them they could not catch us up before morning if their number was large however he believed they had their horses with them and would be camping in the thickets on the opposite side of river it was nearly noon when we struck camp and marched up the river the grass was not very high and our path slightly covered with loose stones so that we could keep our horses at an amble and when the sun sank behind the distant hills on our right we had covered distance of at least miles after riding past stony knoll round which the river described short curve we reached stream ﬂowing between deep banks which fell into the platte and was densely overgrown with alders the spot pleased us to spend the night at and we were engaged in unpacking our cattle when suddenly fearful yell rang behind us which came toward us accompanied by dense cloud of dust the blackfeet all shouted and seized their weapons tiger however shouted to us to follow him he led his piebald through the alders into the stream and the next minute all the cattle were left in charge of antonio who fastened them to the bushes we had scarce returned to the bank when body of forty indians dashed up to us like tornado lying behind their horses neck s and covering their left side with their large shields they allowed very small portion of their bodies to be seen we permitted them to come within ﬁfty yards before we ﬁred the band hesitated and we saw through the dust several horses lying on the ground and many of the horsemen engaged in taking others up behind them while the greater number galloped back to the hill and uttered frightful yell they had not galloped far however when one of them mounted on powerful black horse darted to their head and casting himself in their way swung his long lance before them his horse reared in front of the ﬂying horde and the thundering voice of the leader distinctly reached us through the yelling at the next instant the band turned back with the warrior on the black horse in front of them we had reloaded and i shouted to my comr ades to expend but one bullet and reser ve the other shorter range the savages had galloped up to within about the same distance before when i shouted fire and aimed myself at the leader of the band the black horse reared and fell over with its rider while another horse fell dead by its side whose rider ran with the speed of an arrow after his comrades who were now ﬂying in the utmost confusion the rider of the black horse however had scarce fallen with it ere he crept from under it and at the same instant we saw tiger leap out of the willow bushes on the river bank and swinging his tomahawk catch up the blackfoot warrior with few leaps the latter fell back pace and threw his iron axe at tiger with such force that missing its mark it ﬂew far out into the river tiger now buried his axe with lightning speed in the chest of his recoiling foe and both fell to the ground like two intertwined snakes it was the work of few minutes and the yell of the ﬂying indians was still ringing in our ears when we dashed up to the combatants in order to help tiger it was longer necessary however he rose from off his lifeless foe and setting his knee on the other back neck he passed his knife round the head and tore off his scalp during this time owl had scalped the other blackfoot and our indians danced frantically round the dead men waving the reeking scalps and knives while the blood poured down tiger back from gaping wound in his left shoulder at length they concluded their dance of victory and then our indians plundered their slain foes and the dead horses the dress of these blackfeet is made of leather with remarkable taste adorned with paintings and long fringes porcupine quills shells locks and coloured pebbles the leather is smoked of very dark hue and gives the savages gloomy and terrifying aspect their weapons are lances bows and arrows tomahawks and knives only few have ﬁrearms i examined tiger wound which had only cut the ﬂesh obliquely and was produced by his enemy knife while the latter had bullet through his left thigh gaping wound in his chest and stab in his heart tiger had run down to the willows on the river without our noticing him after the ﬁrst attack of the blackfeet and had thence ﬁred at the chief whom he the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https with his knife now he said we can sleep the blackfeet have lost their head and will go home and tell how the delawares have some more of their scalps in their tents their squaws will not even take their dead with them and not let them sleep with their fathers we camped close to the stream but posted sentries all through the night i feared lest we might have to oppose nocturnal surprise the night however passed undisturbed but we heard incessantly fearful yelling of wolves which prowled round our camp but owing to the huge ﬁre did not dare approach the corpses which lay not far from us in the grass the next morning we quitted the spot which movement the numerous wolves were watching and they attacked the dead indians and horses almost before we had crossed the the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https xxv on the prairie w hastened up the river ﬁve days during which time we crossed number of small streams which fell into it then we reached the eastern spurs of the medicin mountains in which the river rises and pours over the rocks in the shape of large torrent here we crossed it and following the base of these hills in the plain we reached on the second evening small stream which ﬂows at least hundred miles due east through this broad plain which the indians called lamarie to the black mountains bordering the plain and owl told us winds through the latter till it falls into the northern platte to the east of fort lamarie these mountains which in height and shape exactly resemble the range from which the bighorn rises are to the north of that snow peak we marched along the stream to the eastwa rd to the black mountains and then turned up an arm of it coming from the south until it was lost in the plain we marched from here whole day without water and were obliged to pass the night too without it or ﬁre the desolate plain over which we rode showed us not single tree toward evening the next day we reached lake which was about three miles in circumference but its waters were slightly impregnated with salt following its banks however we arrived on its western side at some clear streams of fresh water here we refreshed ourselves and camped though it was early in the afternoon and amused ourselves with shooting geese and swans on the next evening we came to similar lake with streams on its western side so that we again had splendid camp and took advantage of the opportunity to bathe in the lake during the next day our road again ran over desolate melancholy plain but toward evening we saw low wood in the distance and reached another arm of the river which runs through the black mountains to fort lamarie here we had everything we could desire protected camp in the wood and splendid trout stream in which we refreshed ourselves and our horses we shot several fat buffaloes and few stags the wood above us sufﬁced to put us in good spirits we were very tired of the monotonous desolate plains over which we had been marching long time before sunset our horses neighed and we heard them answered from outside the wood all at once there was thundering burst through the low bushes and the leader of troop of wild horses fell in terror immediately in front of our ﬁre and the animals behind him one over the other after which they got up again in the utmost fear and confusion and dashed out of the wood the stallion was splendid very powerfully built and ﬁnely shaped and we all regretted that we were unable to take him home the next morning we left the river and went south and the whole day without ﬁnding water the sun sank behind the hills and nowhere was there tree or sign of water the grass too was bad but our cattle were very weary and we too longed rest we made poor ﬁre of bois vache and small bushes large enough to cook our supper then we put up our tents and secured our traps under the tarpaulin on bed of stones the sky was overcast and led to expectation of rain at nightfall it began to blow and rain and went on the whole night till daybreak when the clouds gathered together again and hanging on the base of the mountains displayed the snow peaks brilliantly illumined by the sun we quickly started and marched from this disagreeable spot looking pleasanter signs ahead at length toward noon wood rose again from the barren surface we drove our animals into quicker pace and in few hours were resting again on river fringed by trees upon glorious grass which our starving cattle eagerly devoured it was still very early and we all felt inclined to go hunting the rain had refreshed the country and the verdure of the forest and the meadow does the eyesight the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https few preferred ﬁshing in the neighbouring stream several went up the river to hunt while i went down it accompanied by trusty only i had gone about couple of miles along the skirt of the wood when i saw something moving on the prairie behind some very low bushes i crept cautiously up to the last bush and before stood at about the distance of hundred and twenty yards herd of some forty large and old giant stags the beautiful pride of the animal in long line before with their faces turned to and raised their powerful antlers like forest of horns it was sight whose beauty only sportsman can estimate i lay some minutes lost in contemplation but when i raised my knee and riﬂe the whole herd turned and galloped past i had long had my eye on the largest stag its antlers rose far above the others with their broad lines i aimed behind the shoulder and ﬁred heard the bullet distinctly go home and saw that though it was bleeding profusely it kept up with the others the next largest stag being just behind this one i ﬁred the second barrel at it heard the thud of the bullet again and saw that it was mortally wounded but it too remained in line and i watched the stags till they disappeared long way of f in hollow i loaded and on reaching the spot where the stags were hit trusty at once put his nose to the blood trail and stopped looking up at i made him sign that it was all right and when he had gone little distance he went off slightly to the right took up the trail of the second stag and then again pointed with his nose to the ground while looking at inquiringly i again urged him on and he went ﬁrst to one trail then to the other till i was able to look down into the valley where i saw the two stags lying dead hardly ten yards apart i hastened up to them and counted on the antlers of the largest tines and on the smaller one twenty the length of the two antlers was between ﬁve and six feet and their weight between thirty and forty pounds the antlers of this stag only differ from those of our stag through their size and the greater number of tines the great difference between them is in the weight the giant stag is often double the size of ours both animals it seemed had died nearly at the same moment they lay side by side with their heads stretched out they had been running after looking at them awhile in delight i broke them up gave trusty his share cut out couple of grinders recollection and then went back to camp when my comrades were equally pleased at the result of my sport the other hunters had also been fortunate and had killed fat buffalo while the anglers had pulled number of large ﬁsh out of the river owl went with antonio and königstein to my stags in order to fetch their skins and meat and i requested them to bring the antlers of the largest one i wished were it possible to carry them home though we liked the place so much we left it again next morning abundantly supplied with the best game and jack trotted after us with the enormous antlers on the top of his packages the country here became again intersected by low ranges of hills which crossed the plain from east to west their heights were long and barren but the large valleys between them ornamented with small prairies and woods in the latter of which we frequently found springs the variety was relief to our eyes and offered us many ﬁne prospect with the mountains approaching each other isolated masses of rock again rose out of these valleys and before us in the far south were visible loftier ranges some of them branching off from the medicine mountains others from the black mountains the colouring of

heights the antelopes gazed down curiously at us up hill down hill we jolted in the saddles of our ambling steeds when on calm warm evening toward sunset we rode down from grassy knoll to stream which was closely overhung with alder bushes and separated the base of the hill from wide prairie round which it wound with numerous meanderings tiger was riding about forty yards ahead and had just disappeared with his piebald in patch of scrub when he dashed out of the other side of it with loud cry and an enormous grizzly bear after him we galloped through the stream after him while his rapid horse bounded over the grass toward us and gained slight advance on the grizzly all the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https were ﬁred at the monster and turning away from tiger it came toward us with long leaps and pursued john with an awful roar once again our riﬂes cracked behind it but the bullets did not check its clumsy but yet rapid cours john turned his mare again toward us and had hardly joined our ranks when we ﬁred salvo from our revolvers at the maddened bear and galloping after it kept up our ﬁre königstein on the was the nearest to it on the left and gave the bear shot at short range when the latter turned on him and smashed his broad wooden stirrup into thousand chips between its savage teeth königstein however had pulled his foot out and ﬂew with his horse to our side again we sent hailstorm of bullets into the broad back of the infuriated animal upon which it sank on its bullet had smashed its spine its fury and the roars it uttered were fearful and turning in circle on its monstrous forepaws it covered large space around it with its blood which streamed from its shaggy carcass i shouted to my friends not to ﬁre i saw tiger had dismounted and was hastily loading his riﬂe and i wished to grant him the pleasure of killing the bear he ﬁred his bullet into its head and then cut off its claws with great satisfaction we took the paws tongue and liver of the huge animal while tiger rode back to the stream and thence shouted to us to join him we rode up and found in the water old very handsome chestnut horse which the bear had captured on the prairie and the trampled grass showed us had dragged to the stream in order to enjoy its meal without being disturbed i took the tusks of the slain anim al and with the new matter conversation which this ﬁght gave us we shortened the road to our camp which lay in an exquisite hollow on the south side of lofty crags under which clear torrent rolled over loose stones that glistened like gold they contained substance which really resembled this metal so that they shone through the water hurrying over them like lumps of pure gold some stately palms maples and oaks overshadowed our camp and served cool retreat the countless songsters that saluted us with their evening hymn it is incomprehensible why the belief prevails throughout europe that americ an birds are very brilliantly plumaged but can not sing while most certainly there are sweeter songsters and more varieties of them on this continent than in europe single bird is wanting the nightingale but it is compensated thousandfold by the mocking bird all other classes of birds are represented though with different and ﬁner plumage the belief may arise from the fact that emigrants from europe land in the large eastern cities and in their walks in their vicinity see birds from the circumstance that boys there of ten years old run about with guns and kill every bird that shows itself and then again these persons only seek the shade of the trees and bushes during the heat of the day when all birds silently hide themselves from the burning sun if they went out in the morning however when nature is awakening they would hear quite good singers in their old home before us the valley wound between partly wooded low hills behind which the higher base now rose several days we marched along this valley till on one afternoon we looked down from hill on the blue crystalline waters of the southern platte which coming down from the medicine hills rustled through the valley at our feet the river was large even here and shot with the speed that characterizes the streams in this country and with many windings between its banks before us where the river described sharp curve the banks were stony on both sides and seemed from time immemorial to have been used by the inhabitants of these countries ford at this moment when probably the ﬁrst time the eyes of white men rested on this ford countless herd of buffaloes was occupied in crossing they were coming southward from the mountains and pressed shoulder to shoulder in dense masses to water in the river while others came down the hills in black line the roars of these thirsty wanderers ﬁlled the air and rang through the hills in thousand echoes they dashed by hundreds impetuously from the high bank into the deep rapid stream on either side of the ford and drifted with it into the dark overarching wood we stopped long time gazing down at this scene and awaiting the end of the herd whose head had disappeared some time previously in the valley on our left while dense masses still continued to pour down without check from the hills to the water at length at the end of an hour only few laggards came after at least ﬁve thousand buffaloes had crossed the river and yet the number of these animals is said to be quite insigniﬁcant compared with what it was twenty years ago who knows whether ﬁfty years hence they will exist anywhere but in natural history we were obliged to let the wanderers pass we also wanted to cross the river though in the opposite direction and we should have run risk of the whole herd marching over us had we got in their way we now rode down into the river but although so great number of huge animals had passed through it the water was clear and bright if stone had never been stirred on its bottom we watered our cattle and follow ed the path the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https the buffaloes had found their way to this ford on the supposition that they had rendered it quite passable and that they had come from the southern prairies to which we were bound buffaloes crossing river we had scaled the ﬁrst hill when we saw about two miles off few buffaloes trotting towards us which had probably lagged behind and now wanted to catch up the herd we rode about thirty yards off the path to spot where we were covered by rocks and commanded the sloping path down to the water ere long we heard the heavy trot of the approaching animals on the stony ground and presently several cows and behind them fat old bull came past us we all ﬁred together and the old bull rolled over and over down the slope and lay dead at the bottom we took usual its tongue marrowbones and loins and left the rest to those that came after us we could not have found ﬁner road through these hills broad and trodden smooth it wound along the crags so that we were often able to advance at quick amble it frequently ran over dizzy precipices whence we surve yed the pleasant valleys whose dark shadow seemed to invite us while the hot sun and its reﬂection from the bare rocks over which we were marching was hardly rendered endurable by the fresh breeze blowing up here we crossed number of small streams which came down from the western hills and all ﬂowed to the platte until at the end of week we again reached the latter river at the point where large afﬂuent coming from the bighorn joined it we appeared to be here on the last slopes of the enormous mountains over which the snowpeak was visible in all its splendour farewell salutation it rose higher above its smaller comrades and glistened like the purest silver in the blue sky while the edge of the mountains displayed snow and seemed like thin strip of fog above the nearer hills eastward we noticed on the horizon of the extensive plains only low ranges of hills while to the north the black mountains raised their mighty crests and few peaks we crossed this southern arm of the platte and camped on the other side of it in order to grant our cattle few days rest there where the most splendid grass and cool thick wood covered its bank the bright streams offered us the most glorious ﬁsh which can be almost selected in these streams we see them swarm round the bait and the latter can be dropped before the ﬁsh you wish to catch the neighbourhood of our camp was enlivened by game of every description on the slopes of the neighbouring black mountains we found mountain sheep and stags in the forests between them and the platte the majestic giant stag was preparing the rutting season and with swollen neck whetting the numerous tines of its splendid antlers on the trees the prairies near us brought to us the elegant virginian stag and the swift antelope while the buffalo incessantly passed in all directions not the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir

very shy but easy to shoot if you lie down little while in the grass they come out of their holes and give snapping cry which has been falsely called barking by some natural ists they are badgers about ﬁfteen inches in length which only live on vegetables carry large winter stock into their subterranean houses and form very numerous families they frequently quit place without any visible reason and wander long distance over hill and dale in order to seek new home our horses and were recruite d and we too had recovered from the fatigue of our journey over the last mountains hence we set out again and casting many parting glance at the bighorn we followed the platte in an eastern direction till at noon we reached trodden path which runs from fort brain on the southern arm of this river down to the missouri we crossed it and proceeded more to the in order to escape the numerous indian hordes going up and down this path few days after we crossed the hills we had seen from our last camp and the sky now rested before us on the interminable horizon of the prairie nearly week we marched over this green plain with scarce any change in the scene it was however undulating the ﬂora in the grass gay and varied and few trees afforded us shade and ﬁrewood morning and even ing to prepare our meals at length hills rose on the horizon and we soon saw again the darker verdure of forests which received us into their shady gloom towards evening in this tour we were so broiled by the sun that we entered the wood with delight and at once resolved to rest few days here if we anticipated there was water at hand we hurried along buffalo path into the depths of the forest and soon heard to our delight the rustling of neighbouring river whose banks we speedily reached and it proved to be rapidly ﬂowing stream overhung by tall ferns owl told us it was one of the numerous sources of the kansas which runs eastward to the missouri here let us build tabernacles we cried in one voice but followed the path across the stream to the skirt of the wood which was great distance off we unloaded our cattle in small clearing off our path lit ﬁre and really built tabernacles we made roof of bushes between several young oaks which kept off every sunbeam and in whose immediate vicinity were trees enough to tie up our cattle every night after long ride over the open prairies of western america the comfort of spot like this is very great and almost indescribable the eyes are refreshed by the rich green after the continued view of the horizon which is rendered still more painful by the quivering sunshine of these plains the breeze under the trees is most refreshing while on the prairie it is dry and oppressively hot we felt very jolly and comfortable in our hut roamed about the neighbourhood which was very rich in game went along the streams and caught magniﬁcent trout or destroyed colonies of bees and plundered their rich stores of honey to the south small prairies continually alternated with narrow patches of wood through which the streams that spring up in them run under cover to join the kansas after resting our cattle some days i went out one morning after breakfast to hunt and have nearer view of the country round i rode in southern direction followed by trusty and in going off said to my comrades that if i lost my way i would follow the course of one of these streams till it joined the river then i would wait till they came to in which they could not fail we knew that all these small streams joined in few hours i had crossed several of these streams and had ridden out of wood into small prairie glade when suddenly horse indian darted toward with furious yell from thicket of tall oaks and swung his bow over his head while his long lance hung on his right arm it was too late to dismount and make use of my riﬂe i quickly drew my revolver put czar at gallop and ﬂew towards the indian turning my horse to the left he on his right side could make less use of his bow than i could of my revolver however he soon perceived my object guided his chestnut to get on my left hand and we galloped on in the same direction some distance out of shot suddenly however he turned and dashed toward with his bow raised over the head of his rapid steed i too had urged czar to his full speed and when we were about sixty yards apart i ﬁred i had not expected to hit still it was possible and i had ﬁve shots left in my weapon the savage horse leaped on one side stumbled and fell forward on its chest the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https blows of the whip forced it to make last effort but it then sank lifeless under its rider who disappeared like lightning in the not very high grass behind it at the moment when i saw his horse fall i turned mine away and pulled up about one hundred yards distant the horse lay with its back turned to and the indian was concealed behind its belly i took out my telescope to try and get better sight of my enem y but it was of use he had disappeared all at once i saw an arrow shoot up behind the horse and ﬂy toward in large curve but i easily pulled czar out of its way and it sank harmless by my side with its point in the grass while the indian was ﬁring the arrow i distinctly saw his hands holding the bow projecting above the horse belly i leapt from czar back threw the bridle over his shoulder and ﬁred with my riﬂe at the horse back i heard the thud of the bullet but the savage did not show himself i reloaded both riﬂe and revolver and walked at the same distance round the dead horse till i got to the side on which its lay i could now look under its belly and saw the indian creep under the animal chest and roll himself up behind it in ball still the surface by which he was hidden was now too small to cover him entirely and i could distinguish the upper part of his body i ﬁred again and noticed quick convulsive movement on the part of the foe but only at the moment of ﬁring i had recourse to my glass once more and saw that his head was now under the horse chest but his legs lay behind its neck and he was peeping at between its forelegs i reloaded and now having become much calmer i aimed again at my mark i ﬁred and at once saw the savage throw up his legs then try to rise but fall back again i drew closer to him and watched him through the glass he had got little way from the horse he did not stir and lay on his back but he was an indian and such man white man must not trust even in death i ﬁred again and heard my bullet go home but he remained motionless after reloading i walked with cocked riﬂe nearer and found that life had left him and that he had my second bullet in his right hip the third in his head over the right ear and the last in his chest while i found one bullet in the horse chest and another in its back he was man of about thirty years of age tall and powerfully built of very dark colour and with sharply marked features his remarkably long hair hung wildly round his head with two eagle plumes thrust into the topknot while his neck was decorated with necklace of bears claws and his arms with brass rings the lower part of his face and the eyelids ruddled with vermilion and his forehead and cheeks painted black gave him terriﬁc uncomfortable aspect which was heightened by the dazzlingly white teeth visible between his lips i only gazed few minutes at the corpse took his bow and quiver of arrows hung them on my horse and speedily beat retreat the comrades of the dead man were certainly not far off and might very easily be on the road to the spot guided by my shots i rode back on my trail and soon reached camp when i told my friends what had happened tiger was out hunting and not yet return ed i ordered rapid start had the horses packed and everything ready to be off we had scarce completed our preparations when tiger bathed in perspiration came back along my track and said he had heard my shots followed their direction and found the indian and his horse he was pawnee whose tribe was certainly close at hand and when his companions missed him they would seek him and easily ﬁnd us too in which case we should run great danger they were brave men he quickly packed his horse and in few minutes we left camp tiger rode ahead into the stream and we followed him riding singly down the water which offered us obstacles beyond here and there fallen tree it ran over pebbles was nowhere deep and had ﬂat banks evening arrived and the sun was already low on the western horizon we marched almost constantly in the stream till we found on its right bank wide plain covered with pebbles when we turned off to the south at right angle we reached on the other side of the plain similar stream which was also overshadowed by trees entered thicket and dismounted to let our horses graze without unsaddling them and to await nightfall the moon was already up and though her light did not brilliantly illumine the country it was sufﬁciently strong to enable us to distinguish objects at slight distance we then left our marched out of the thicket into the prairie and urged our horses on at quick pace without interruption we hurried on through the silence of the night which was only disturbed by the howling of the countless wolves and the roar of the buffaloes we put up until shortly before daybreak the moon withdrew her light from us and the darkness did not allow us to advance we sat down on the damp grass round our cattle and waited till the ﬁrst new light appeared on the eastern horizon then we remounted and hurried on toward distant strip of wood which rose before us on the prairie the sun was standing high in the heavens when we reached it and led our wearied animals to stream here we unsaddled and let them graze hobbled in small glade while we prepared breakfast at small the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https were very tired and after the meal could hardly keep awake we posted sentries in turn to watch the plain behind us and kept lively by smoking and telling stories our cattle wanted sleep more than grass and we were sorry at being obliged to saddle them after short rest but tiger and owl insisted on our going on we were certainly pursued by the pawnees and could only escape them by keeping the start we had on them it was hardly noon when we started again and spurred our horses on toward the southern prairie they only moved because they felt the sharp steel in their sides and we were obliged to lead the mules by lassos and appoint man to drive them they refused to follow the heat was oppressive there was not breath of air and the plants on the plain we crossed hung their leaves in exhaustion an incessant buzzing of the insects in the grass ﬁlled the motionless air and trembling dazzling light lay on the wide expanse around us the sweat ran in streams from our cattle and was mixed with the blood which the countless musquitos sucked from their coat so that under their belly their colour could not be distinguished but not noticing their sufferings or fatigue we urged them on and looked back at the distant horizon to see whether our pursuers appeared on it till the sun sank and in the distance wood rose which crossed the prairie to the east like mist tiger said that we should be safe there this was the wood running along the arkansas and the horses of the pawnees could not go so far withou t rest the sun mercifully withdrew its beams and the moon cool light showed us our road when we expended the last strength of our cattle and so reached the forest we had ridden over ﬁfty hours since yesterday morning greater part of the distance without any path through rather tall grass and over stony soil on the whole route we had been exposed to the burning sun and only once had been able to cool our fevered lips at stream our cattle it is true we had more frequently found water though only standing rain which collects in large hollows on the prairie but at this season is more mud than water at the same time it is almost boiled by the sun and if it can keep man alive it does not refresh him we well our cattle were utterly exhausted to such degree that we would incur any danger few hours rest we rode into the wood and followed buffalo path but had not ridden far when tiger who was ahead stopped saying he had lost the path and could go farther the foliage over us was so thick that only here and there the moon pale light stole through it and only few leaves and small spots on the branches glistened like silver in the obscurity we turned our horses in all directions seeking the path but after going few yards were continually stopped by the hanging creepers tiger now leapt from his horse and sought in the darkness dry grass which he twisted into torch and came to to light it it soon spread light around and while i held it up tiger collected larger stock of dry grass and made thicker torch which we lit and soon found an issue from this impenetrable thicket we soon reached small arm of the arkansas on whose fresh cool water we and our cattle fell insanely we now lit ﬁre though there was grass the cattle near at hand the small open spot on the bank of the rushing stream was surrounded by dense wall of forest at this moment however rest was more necessary than food and our cattle had scarce been freed from their load when they all sank on the ground and fell into deep sleep we did the same and after drinking several draughts fell back on our saddles and forgot that we still stood risk of being caught up by the pawnees we had collected our ﬁre into small pile so that it only coaled and spread light over the crests of the tall trees which might possibly have been noticed from the prairie we slept without moving limb till the turkeys in our neighbourhood awoke us and though tiger and owl protested most strongly against it we shot four of the birds resolved to defend ourselves to the best of our ability if the shots betrayed us to our pursuers tiger now mounted his piebald rode through the river and soon disappeared in the forest on the other bank where he sought pasture our cattle in half an hour he returned and told us that between this wood and the arkansas there was ﬁne prairie on which we should ﬁnd excellent grass them we followed him across the river and out of the wood to small glade which was overshadowed by trees here we camped and prepared breakfast while our cattle greedily browsed on the fresh dewy grass we rested here till the sun cast the shadow of the forest far across the prairie then we set out again and rode to the arkansas which here rolls its foaming waters between low banks we reached the opposite forest and rode into its cool shade before sunset so that the last beams still lighted us we marched over the next prairie and hurried to low scrub from whose centre several tremendously tall poplars rose and announced water near their the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https sun had just set when we came to stream running toward the arkansas and covered on this side with bushes while on the other the most splendid grass hung over its crystalline waters we watered our cattle and then rode down stream on the other side the pasturage seemed more luxuriant lower down in few minutes we reached small cascade where the stream fell over rocks about ten feet and below this fall formed deep basin whose bottom was also composed of stone slabs and on one side was overhung by rock strata about twenty feet in height which covered considerable space near the basin whose bottom and sides also consisted of bare stone we camped on the top of this overhanging ledge number of medlar grew there to which we could fasten our horses at night round the camp and at the same time the richest grass grew all around we unsaddled hobbled the horses in the grass lit ﬁre and put the supper before it and then went to bathe in the basin under the rock after we had cooled and refreshed ourselves we supped and then prepared our but john took his weapons and skins and said he would sleep on the stream under the crag it was much cooler and pleasanter there and he should not feel the heavy dew so much in the grass we wished him pleasant dreams and shouted to him not to let himself be devoured by bear we had fastened up our horses and had fallen into deep sleep when the sharp crack of riﬂe aroused us and we all leapt up arms in hand at the same moment second shot was ﬁred below us on the water we were only few yards from the edge of the crack and on hurrying there saw an enormous panther slowly walking among the low bushes on the opposite bank and looking over at us we showered bullets upon it and induced it to hasten its pace till it disappeared like shadow in the mist now john ran up to us with his baggage and told us he had accidentally waked up he fancied he heard growling rose on his arm and recognised the moonlit shape of panther walking towards him hesitatingly with lashing tail round the basin he quickly seized his one barrel at it and gave it the second in the water into which it leapt providence had aroused him before we could have hurried to his help from above the brute would probably have killed him and we might very easily have known nothing of it till we found our comrade lacerated body on the next morning however we soon forgot this incident and slept till dawn woke us and showed us the grass around wet if from shower while thick fog brooded over the ﬂat country we led our horses out to graze put our breakfast to cook and then i went with john and tiger accompanied by trusty to the spot on the opposite bank where the panther had been standing when we ﬁred at it we found here quantity of hair and soon after blood which increased with every step and presently came to spot where the jaguar had halted and covered large space with its blood we went about hundred yards farther when trusty stopped looked round at and then into the bushes with his tail erect i called him to and crept cautiously to the spot when i saw the panther lying under the roots of an old poplar with its head turned towards and showing its teeth i shot it through the skull and owl took off its ﬁne coat to prepare it john who wished to preserve it in memory of

thicker and richer than those farther to the north and offered us splendid wild plums refreshment when we rode through we crossed the river and went through the wood on its south side and had just unsaddled our horses and picketed them in the prairie when suddenly several hundred horse indians came round the nearest angle in the wood and halted few yards from us while we gazed at each other in amazement at the head of them rode single indian with smoking piece of wood who at the sight of us gave piercing yell we saw that great excitement was produced in the ranks of the caravan and that the men collected in the fore ground while the squaws and children hurried to the rear and hastily drew back the numerous pack animals we too ran at full speed to our horses and were removing them to the bushes when tiger shouted to that they were comanches the name at once tranquillized and i told him i believed they would nothing hostile to us when they heard my name he went towards the savages and

amicable dispute with pahajuka at the same time she became quite impatient when the interpreter did not express her remarks quickly enough and tried by signs and gestures to make up his omissions or incorrect rendering her language was quick and ﬁery her large eyes in which the ﬂame of our ﬁre was mirrored ﬂashed with the stream of her eloquence and her little hands or ﬁngers sought to render her meaning clearer and in all these movements there was extraordinary power decision and grace so soon however she ceased speaking she sat motionless looking down or attentively listening to the remarks of her foster parents while her dark eyes were ﬁxed on them she sat slightly back from the ﬁre so that the outline of her dark form was blended with the obscure background and the small ﬁre only lit up her eyes and her beautiful teeth when speaking by which her appearance acquired peculiar and mysterious charm it was late and except our little party there was not an open eye in camp i got up offered my hand to my hosts wished them good night and when i put my hand to tahtoweja she sprang up and laughing pointed in the direction of my camp that she would accompany and at the same time gave the old squaw an inquiring glance the latter nodded her assent adding that she would accompany too but her feet were longer so light those of ante lope and so the latter passed her graceful arm through mine and walked with along the forest through the dewy grass the distance was only few hundred yards and when we turned round the angle of the wood our camp was blazing brightly and lit up my still waking comrades who were sitting round it smoking here tahtoweja stopped pressed my hands kindly while wishing good night and ﬂew through the light mist back to her camp the next morning before daybreak pahajuka with his squaw and pretty daughter joined us the latter ran up to with the pleasantest morning greeting took the pipe from my mouth and placing it between her cherry lips sat down among tiger skins by the ﬁre making sign to the same we prepared good breakfast our means allowed in honour of our guests served up the last of our biscuit and handed round afterwards some madeira which i owed to the kindness of lord after our friends had enjoyed themselves thoroughly they returned to their camp to prepare start pahajuka told they wished on this day to reach the northern arm of canadian river between which and the stream on which we now were water was to be found i went across with them to see the large tents loaded while my comrades packed our animals our road ran in the same direction i wished to accom pany our savage friends when we arrived in camp we found perfect quietude there the various families were lying round the ﬁres in front of the tents engaged in breakfasting while the children were amusing themselves in the long tent street with shooting arrows throwing stones wrestling and running races in which they were observed praised or blamed by their parents pahajuka stopped at the ﬁrst tent and shouted few words i did not understand upon hearing which all the squaws hurriedly rose and set to work striking the large tents the latter are about fourteen feet high pointed at the top and some twenty feet in diameter on the ground there are openings above on the sides which can be pulled open in the direction of the wind to let the smoke out when the weather is cold and the ﬁre is lit in the middle of the tent the buffalo hides of which the tents are composed are tanned white and adorned inside and out with paintings they are very thickly sewn so that rain can penetrate and in winter when the ﬁre is burning the interior is very warm and cozy in quarter of an hour all the tents had disappeared and at the spot where they had stood lay bundles bound with straps the squaws came up with the horses and mules hung on each side of them very long tent pole which was allowed to trail behind and few feet from the end fastened cross bars on which they placed the tents buffalo hides cooking utensils and all their traps and then seated either themselves or their children atop while others mounted horses or mules and took two or three or even four children up with them while the girls and squaws were performing this operation the warriors lay smoking round the ﬁre and only rose when their horses and weapons were brought to them in less than half an hour everything was ready start and one of the indians took some ﬁrebrands of musquito wood which keeps the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https very long time and rode ahead of the party southward while i accompanied by pahajuka his squaw and tahtoweja returned to my camp and mounted czar and we then followe d the indians it was glorious day the sharp breeze rendered the heat endurable while clouds every now and then obscured the sun we rode sharply on without check the distance to the appointed was over sixty miles still our horses did not object to it we followed the track of the indians and their numerous cattle formed smooth road and they often made the last ride at the head of the ﬁle so not to fatigue individual horses too much our road ran over an open prairie and the sky line soon formed the horizon the grass around us glittered in the darkest green which in the distance grew lighter and lighter till at the extreme point of sight it melted away into the blue colour of the sky flowers of the most varied hues sprang up out of the rich verdure and long distance dyed various spots on the prairie with their prevailing colour pahajuka and his squaw trotted in front of us on their capital mules while tahtoweja kept her little pony at an amble by my side and took all possible trouble to keep up conversation with by means of signs on her saddle lay several folded hides on which she sat like cushion and her little feet were thrust into wooden stirrups on either side of her horse neck she frequently swung her small graceful leather whip over her horse head and spoke to it in her sweet voice while pulling up its head with the bridle without resting we rode the whole day and had only now and then opportunity to water our horses at standing pools till the sun sank beneath the western prairie and we could scarce recognise to the south the blue outline of the woods on canadian river darkness very rapidly spread over the plain around us while the sky was still red over the departed sun and in the east pale yellow patch on the horizon announced the rising moon our horses had fallen into swinging walk when the new light appeared above the prairie and rose like glowing ball above us while the clouds were gradually lit up by its silvery light ﬁery shower of glistened over the extensive plain and in front of us lightning ﬂashes in the distant southern heavens every now and then displayed to us the dark contour of the forest which we were approaching it was not far from ten when we unloaded our wearied animals on the skirt of the forest near the river and camped close to our savage friends after supper long time was granted to conversation each soon sought his bed to rest after the exertions of the ride the next morning pahajuka his squaw and daughter again shared our breakfast and then prepared to go on while we resolved to rest the day the two old people were very sorry at being obliged to leave us but promised without fail to come to my house after the great council on puerco river and remain some time tahtoweja tried by laughing to hide the tears which glistened in her long lashes i helped her on her pony and bade her she gave small leathern pocket very artistically worked in beads which hung from her belt while she was unable her sobs to utter the words she wished to say she pointed to my eyes then to the parcel in my hand laid her little hand on her heart and ahtoweja once again she offered her hand and then haste ned to join her grandparents who were already leading the ﬁle behind the carrying ﬁre from one camp to the other appears to be custom peculiar to most of the savage tribes in this country they halt on the last elevation whence they can look back at the deserted spot lay still smoking brand on the ground wave farewell across and then try by swinging and blowing the brand to keep it alight long possible on long ride they naturally not bring it burning into the new camp we halted this day on the northern cana dian river in order to rest our cattle which had the most splendid pasture here and the next morning marched south again toward evening we reached spring which ran out of low range of hills here we found pleasant camping spot and followed the course of this stream on the following day to the southern canadian river on whose bank we unsaddled after crossin g it with much difﬁculty from this point we altered our course we went up stream in order to reach its springs the southernmost of which well up in the sacramento mountains at the point where the latter form low pass which separates them from the mountain chain which runs parallel with the puerco river in nearly southern direction to the san saba mountains and form an extensive rich valley between themselves and the former river on the western side of the puerco between it and the rio grande with which it also runs parallel again rise large ranges forming beautiful valleys toward both rivers until the former river falls into the rio grande at the western end of the san saba mountains all these rich regions on both sides of the puerco far the rio grande and the western settlements in texas the comanches and mescaleros regard their property and only the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on

indubitably by far the ﬁnest in the whole of the states regards richness of soil and climate here tropical and northern vegetation are blended the banana the nut the orange the plum the apple and the cherry ﬂourish and vines spread over all the woods the soil in the valleys is extraordinarily rich and productive during the whole year the pasturage is incomparable and can not be equalled in the whole world it is covered with the splendid musquito grass which remains green and juicy in winter in summer and sooner or later these valleys will support many domestic animals instead of the countless herds of wild creatures now living there the clima is magniﬁcent the great summer heat is rendered endurable by the cooling winds from the gulf of mexico while the winter has long lasting rain and very slight frost is only felt rarely just before daybreak there is visible cause diseases there are swamps and the forests well the prairies consist of undulating land from which the water left by heav y showers or inundations of the rivers quickly recedes the region is abundantly traversed by the clearest streams which well up in the neighbouring granite mountains and through their remarkably rapid fall render it an easy task to irrigate the surrounding land should ever drought occur the great variety of plains hills mountains and the most luxuriant vegetation in the virgin forests well on the plains impart to these regions remarkable picturesque attractions which are heightened by the transparency of the atmosphere the dark blue sky and the peculiar light ef fects our road now ran along the south side of the canadian river to the west and in few days the sacramento mountains rose before us we reached an afﬂuent of this river on which some miles farther up the iron stone was said to lie with which tiger told us the god of hunting had killed weico it would not take us very far out of our course if we rode to it i requested tiger to lead us to it before sunset we reached prairie round which the little wooded stream ran in semicircle and saw in the centre of it the stone rising about three feet out of the short grass it was meteorite of enormous size its circumference on the plane measured twelve feet and it did not rest on rock it must have sunk great distance into the ground although the latter is excessively hard on the prairie it had considerable magnetic power was of dark rust colour and so hard that it cost us great difﬁculty to knock off few splinters with the back of our axes it is certainly the largest stone of this sort in least the largest i know are much smaller and it would repay the trouble and expense to fetch it from this desert and convey it to some museum we slept here the night and had to hear several times the story of the weico who was slain with this stone the next morning we left the river marching westward along the mountains and camped again on the banks of canadian river about week we followed this course to the spurs of the sacramento mountains where we left the river and went along the former to the south until in fortnight we reached the sources of the red river which ﬂow from the eastern slopes of these mountains we rode up them to their source among the granite rocks where we found at considerable height splendid camping place on which we found the remains of several indian camps made by foot indians who not carry large tents with them they consisted of long thin sticks four or six of which were crossed and had both ends stuck in the ground over these sticks they hang skins and thus obtain decent shelter against rain and cold path led on the north side of this stream to the camp and from here ran up to the saddle of the hill and thence owl and tiger told us down it to the south over the san saba range to the sources of the rio las mires which stream falls into the gulf of mexico at corpus christi this is one of the oldest connecting paths of the indians between the northern lands of the rocky mountains and the gulf and proves by the depth it is worn in the rock that it has been used since the earliest period by these wanderers well the footed denizens of the desert the springs at which we camped welled up under immense granite crags which rose in terraces and formed in front of them small basin in which they collected and ﬂowed in rivulet through the plain on which our cattle were grazing and thence to the wide prairies which we had recently crossed around us lay large masses of rock which had probably fallen from the heights between which the path wound upwards on the east we gazed at the immense plains through which canadian river marked its course by the rich woods that overshadowed it and at our feet we looked into savage gorges from which here and there small patches of grass and scrub peeped out and few enormous cypresses raised their gigantic branches inviting the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https in these deserts to enjoy fresh draught in their shade these noble trees only ﬂourish in the vicinity of water day had scarce broken on the next morning when we prepared breakfast and the sun had not risen over the eastern horizon and the valleys were still covered with mist when we were already mounted and going up the path to take advantage of the cool of the morning during the day we might calculate on great heat upon these barren rocks the morning was splendid the fresh cool mountain breeze refreshed us and every plant every blade of grass between the rocks seemed to enjoy the treat we had ascended considerable height when the sun spread its beams over the earth our path ascended from hill to hill till at about ten we reached barren which in some parts was broad and others narrow and overshadowed by crags the landscape on either side of us was remarkably ﬁne and frequently the crags in our immediate vicinity offered very pretty pictures when we drew near the western slopes we looked down into luxuriant valleys on both sides of the puerco far the hilly range which divided that river from the rio grande or distance of from 150 to 200 miles farther south in the valley on this side of the river was an isolated mountain whose peak ascended to the clouds and which the indians called the guadaloupe mountain when our road ran nearer the eastern slopes or the plateau along which we were riding became narrower our eyes rested on the rich grasslands to the south of the river in the vicinity of the salt lake we had passed on our journey well on the numerous streams which spring up on the eastern side of our mountains and ﬂow some to the brazos others to the colorado it was now very hot however in spite of the violent breeze but rest without any shade could not refresh us the stony strata along which we rode and which at times were deeply trodden in reﬂected the sunbeams and rendered the heat almost unendurable our animals dripped with perspiration and trotted on with hanging heads if anxious to get away from this glowing surface nowhere however did we see spot to receive us in its shade the sun was vertical and the few lofty rocks we passed cast shadow path ran on either side downwards which might afford us hopes of reaching water and the few cypresses which indicated it to us were too far down in the bottoms us to attempt to get to them our cattle became more and more tired and at last hardly able to move when the sun had sunk long way on the western horizon we halted several times in the shadow of large rocks to let our cattle breathe and gave them the juicy fruit of the cactus which grew here abundantly and they eagerly devoured it my comrades also ate them contrary to my advice and several of them became very unwell in consequence such rest could not us much good and so we continually urged our horses on till after passing about sunset between tremendous crags we found broad path which soon wound down the eastern slope when about mile farther on we saw copse of low cypresses with great delight we accepted their invitation and followed the path which ran into small glen where we found good grass and splendid here too we found the traces of several indian camps some of which seemed to be quite recent the few in the vicinity of this mountain path are well known to the savages who go over these mountains and are used by them like hotels by travellers in the civilized world we kept up large ﬁre during the night we here heard the ﬁrst time the howls of the jaguars rising from the valley to us so soon darkness lay over the earth we allowed our cattle to graze till far into the night when they lay down and we brought them near our ﬁre and slept quietly till dawn the sun had scarce risen when we left this spot and hastened back to the road across the ridge our cattle walked quickly along the path in the cool morning breeze and at about nine guadaloupe hills lay to the while the western mountains on the opposite side of the puerco opened and allowed us view through broad pass of the rio grande and paso del norté this is the only easily accessible pass through the cordilleras through which too ere many years elapse the locomotive will snort from the atlantic to the paciﬁc between this pass and the mountains on which we were standing stretched out the rich green valleys on both sides of the puerco and through it we saw in the extreme distance the blue contour of the mountain ranges beyond the rio grande though it was so grand up here we longed to be down below on the banks of the puerco and resolved to seize the ﬁrst opportunity of descending afforded us by direct path during the whole day however we only found indistinct traces where buffaloes had descended the western slopes till at about four we found very practicable path which crossed ours from east to west and which we went down it was at places so steep that we were obliged to lead our horses and the latter slipped down on their after us then again it wound round crags past precipice s and between isolated peaks up hill and down until about sunset we reached greatly fatigued rivulet the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https our cattle greedily fell the path ran down from the spring and we follo wed it about half an hour till about nightfall we reached small leafy coppice in which we camped tiger and owl were of opinion that the path led down to the valley it ran past the springs and because path corresponding with it had run down the eastern side of the mountains the next morning we ate our last meat at very early breakfast and tiger saddled his horse to make certain whither the path ran and also to try and shoot deer or an antelope of which there were large numbers on these mountains during this time we wished to let our cattle graze and recover they greatly needed rest and in the event of our being obliged to ride back to the ridge we wished to halt here till the next day the sun had just risen when tiger left us we lay in the shade of the elms and poplars and were drinking coffee at noon tiger had not yet returned when we suddenly heard the footsteps of horse beneath us and directly after saw the piebald come round the precipice our surprise was great however on seeing that the horse handsome white seemed dyed quite red on the neck and breast and tiger too when he drew nearer was quite bloody i hurried toward him and saw to my terror that he had serious wounds on his left shoulder and that the blood covered his arm and the whole of his left side i took his riﬂe helped him off his horse and went back with him into the shade of the elms while antonio looked after the piebald tiger now told us he had been riding about three miles down the stream through small coppice when suddenly an immense jaguar leapt at his horse neck but at the same instant he buried his between the beast ribs at this moment he slipped off his terriﬁed rearing jaguar buried its claws in his right shoulder while he dealt it several stabs and it then fell dead the piebald bolted down the stream fast his legs would carry him over the stones and tiger believed that he should never see him again when he noticed him on bleak crag he shouted to him from distance and the faithful creature at once hurried up to him he then washed his own and the horse wounds and returned to us suffering great pain he had four wounds on his shoulder close together if cut with knife and which ran about four inches down his arm the foremost was so deep that i was obliged to sew it up i bandaged him well i could laid all the rags we possessed in moist state on the wound and made him moisten them pretty frequently in the neighbouring stream then i exami ned the poor piebald who had on his back four deep wounds from the jaguar fangs and several injuries on the neck from the claws still none appeared dangerous and though the throat swelled considerably constant washing soon produced an alleviation owl now went up the hills in search of game while i proceeded down the stream with antonio and königstein to fetch the jaguar hide we reached the scene of action where the jaguar lay outstretched on the bank and the ground was trampled by the horse hoofs the animal had ﬁve knife stabs near the heart and the earth and grass around were dyed with its blood while we were able to follow the track of tiger and the piebald down the stream my two comrades at once set to work removing the splendid skin while i followed the path the purpose of procuring meat i had gone some distance without getting within shot though i frequently saw game and the low position of the sun warned to commence my return to camp i was following small afﬂuent of the stream which came down from the hills little more to the south in order not to return by the same road i had come when i suddenly heard about half mile off roar that exactly resembled that of lion i ran in the direction whence the sound came and soon saw on the bank of the stream two giant stags engaged in most furious contest and surrounded by herd of does and further on some large stags on the watch i ran up within forty yards of them unnoticed while with their huge antlers intertwined they butted each other and frequently sank on their knees i shot the largest which fell and its enemy at once buried its tines in the ﬂanks of its overpowered foe not suspecting that the same riﬂe which had slain its opponent still held deadly bullet in readiness i could easily have killed it but preferred fawn which was standing great distance off and killed it i now got up behind the rocks to reload and the startled herd darted off to the mountains i went up to the stag which had tines and was very plump after which i hurried to reach camp before it grew dark and met owl who had shot nothing we had nothing left to eat we at once started with jack to fetch in the game taking some ﬁrebrands of ood torches the night was dark but the torchlight illumined all the objects around the more distinctly in consequence antonio walked in front i followed with trusty and königstein with jack formed the rear we soon reached the stags and loaded jack with large supply of meat with which we arrived in camp about ten our hunger was great we had eaten nothing since morning and we sat till late hour round the ﬁre turning our spits tiger was much better the pain was reduced and the swelling of the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https was slight the next morning however the bandages had not been wetted during his sleep his arm was very stiff while the pain was greater and hence i resolved to stop where we were at least the day it was scarce daylight when i took my weapons and went to pay another visit to the rutting stags john accompanying the morning was cool and the dew lay in heavy pearls on grass and stones the valleys below us were still veiled in mist and large white clouds hung on the we reached the spot where i had shot the stags and heard thence the roars of the animals echoing through the valleys they were standing however rather highe r up the stream they probably remembered my last night visit we pressed through the tall ferns from which the dew dripped upon us like rain and reached plateau that hung over dizzy precipice here stood the game and nearest to us an old stag which had its proud antlers thrown back its thick swollen neck outstretched and was roaring furiously all around the other stags responded from the hills and we listened long time to the concert of these jealous lovers ere we thought of hunting them it was the ﬁrst giant stag john had had chanc of ﬁring at i readily granted him the ﬁrst shot and allowed him to stalk the stag the majestic animal hit by my comrade deadly bullet fell on its knee in the midst of roar raised its head once or twice and then fell lifeless on the scanty grass that covered the rock john could not maste r his delight and ran up to the stag by doing which he put an end to our sport here this morning all the deer ﬂew at the sight of him the stag had tines and pair of colossal antlers whose ends were like shovels we broke it up threw the paunch over the precipice and hoisted john white handkerchief near it in order to keep beasts of prey aloof it was still very early the ﬁrst sunbeams were just illumining the highest points of the steep precipice on the opposite side of the abyss on which we were standing and the cool breeze was too refreshing us to think of hurrying back to camp we followed the plateau therefore from which the opposite one continually retired until the gorge widened into rocky glen from which colossal masses of stone rose in wild confusion far down the valley at the point where it trended to the east round the opposite hill side we distinctly noticed path which ran along the base of the mountains and was probably the continuation of the one on which we were camped we still heard numerous stags roaring we advanced till we were able to look down into the valley on the east and follow our path long distance through it we stoppe d to gaze at the wondrous forms of the mountains i took out my telescope looked at the path and saw long way off dark forms moving among the rocks which i soon discovered to be large party of horse indians doubt but the path they were marching along was ours and they would be in our camp in less than an hour while we had good half hour walk to it we therefore turned and hurried at full speed to join our friends the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https xxvii home again t iger advised us to saddle at once while he and owl carefully removed everything that could betray our recent presence here all the logs were carried into the stream in deer hide the horse excreta and scraps of food hidden in the neighbouring bushes and after giving our camp the appearance if its occupants had left it some days previously we led our horses over the ﬁrm stones down to the stream where i had shot the stag on the previous evening and then along it till we could survey our path from distance of about two miles from camp here we led our cattle into coppice where they were hidden from the indians by the bushes and rocks ere long the latter marched up the path tiger recognised them apaches who were probably on the road to the eastern trading ports of the united states they had their squaws and children and large bales of hides with them we let them pass in peace we then rode down the stream to the path and put our horses at sharp amble in the direction from which the indians had just arrived the path led us round many blocks of granite into the glen down into which we had gazed that morning while stag hunting john looked up at the overhanging crag on which his stag and were but could not see it from here and only regretted that he could not take the antlers with him memento he spoke about it several times and said he would willingly give ten dollars to have them on this owl rode up to him and said he would procure them him by the even ing after which he turned off into the rocks he shouted something to tiger that we did not understand and disappeared while we soon reached the spot where the valley turned to the east on both sides of it rose the barren mountains and only an isolated yucca or mimosa grew out of the crevices the valley itself here about two miles in width was covered with loose stones and only from time to time did we notic on the stream that wound through it small clump of trees or patch of grass in spite of the great heat we hurried on till the sun was rather low and the mountain wall that closed the extremity of the valley cast long shadow into it from here it trended to the the crags that enclosed it sank and we looked down into the valleys of the puerco river between which and us lay smaller hills and mounds frequently covered with forest when the sun sank behind the southern pillar of the mountain gate in front of paso del norté the diablo mountains we unpack ed at the ﬁrst wood we reached after leaving the glen and camped on the bank of the stream which we had followed nearly all through it it was one of the numerous exquisite points we had found during our tour and the wonderful evening light did much to heighten its beauty we had lit our ﬁre under the dark foliage of the oaks and thus illumined the surrounding scenery when trusty rose from my side walked few paces toward the pass and began growling i called him to coaxingly and bad him lie down by my side and at this moment we heard the sound of horse rapidly approaching us from the valley we knew it was owl but all that every one seized his riﬂe and awaited the arrival our friend soon rode up to the ﬁre took the enormous antlers with the entire head of the stag off his horse silently laid them and the handkerchief before john led his horse into the grass and lay down on his buffalo robe near the ﬁre without saying word i asked him whether he had seen anything of indians upon which he stated that he had left his horse in the glen and gone up alone to the stag after cutting off its head and taking the handkerchief he went to our camping place and ascended the nearest hill whence he could have an outlook the whole party of indians were quietly camping on the spot and at least dozen columns of smoke were rising from the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https cut the antlers off the head and put them with the skull bone to dry at the ﬁre and then got supper ready while owl turned the stag tongue on spit in the morning the familiar notes of awakening turkeys aroused us again once more after long time we cheerily seized our riﬂes and hurried down the stream toward them to the spot where large trees enthralled them by the rich crop of nuts we behaved most unmercifully to these dainty birds and when we returned to camp had perfect hill of them lying before us we set to work roasting and frying in which we were greatly aided by the extraordinary quantity of delicate fat which these birds have in autumn the remaining turkeys were cleaned rubbed with salt and wild pepper which is very common in the woods at this season and packed on the mules we then continued our journey down through the hills to the long looked valley of the puerco our road was very fatiguing and we were frequently obliged to dismount and lead our horses down the steep slopes at the same time the path was covered with small sharp stones which rendered going down hill still more wearisome to the cattle and it often ran over loose blocks of stone where they ran great risk of breaking their legs still all went well and toward evening we rode out between the last hills into the fresh verdure of the puerco valley and camped on the stream whose course we had been following some days and which here ran small river to the puerco we preferred riding down the valley along the hills in order to keep out of the way of the wandering indians who generally marched up and down the river and whose number was large especial ly now all the tribes of the comanches and their relatives were en route the great council at the sources of this river then again we could calculate on ﬁnding more game on this side of the extensive valley and had only one disadvantage that we must at times go without water nature everywhere showed us that we were approaching home the prairie was again ornamented with the gorgeous ﬂora which had so often delighted us there the sky above us was darker and in the distance more hazy than in the north and warmer life seemed to be stirring in everything still the vegetation especially that of the woods did not bear the peculiar southern character which is so striking at our home we started very early rode till far into the evening and rested when we could mana ge it at noon in some shadow the heat was most oppressive from eleven till three moreover we were in the moon ﬁrst quarter which lighted us little when the sunshine had departed and enabled us to employ the cool of the evening on these smooth plains in pushing on we marched thus without halting about week along the hills during which the mountain chains on the west of the puerco constantly drew nearer to us and contracted the valley we had followed our course one whole morning without ﬁnding wate r till about two when the heat became unendurable and we looked out ahead some shadow in which we could rest few hours at length we caught sight of clump of trees and to our indescribable joy we saw distinctly that they were poplars which retained their fresh foliage an infallible sign that there was water near such trees often stand in pools and when the water dries up their leaves turn yellow and fall of we urged our cattle on in order to reach the trees speedily possible now that we might expect shadow and probably water we felt the sun heat doubly on these plains objects are seen so clearly and distinctly incredible distances that you often deceive yourself and such was the case with these poplars we constantly believed that we must reach them in quarter of an hour and yet hours passed ere we really arrived we hastened into the thick shade of the old trees and i can scarce describe the cheerful feeling that possessed us all on seeing close to them instead of pool of muddy slime two ponds of the clearest freshest spring water one of which the poplars overshadowed with their long branches the cattle were quickly unloaded and rolling themselves on the grass they dried their wet backs while we reclining on the turf inhaled the cooler air the pools like the near my house had visible connexion with any other water but all that retained their freshness though almost constantly exposed to the burning sun we lay without stirring so to avoid any movement which might have impeded our rapid cooling not breath of air stirred the leaves of the poplars hung motionless from the long stalks while over the water lay that quivering dazzling glow whic h announces the highest degree of heat the insect world alone seemed to revel in this heat and ﬁlled the air with an uninterrupted monotonous buzz like that which patient hears in his fever dreams near there rose from the roots of an old poplar chameleon which proba bly found it too warm this wondrous lizard glistened and sparkled with thousand hues puffed up the large bladder under its chin and displayed every tint if illumined by variegated light in its inside it sat motionless with mouth ﬁxing its large golden eyes on if asking whether i would leave it the cool spot it so enjoyed i lay with my head on the roots of poplar quite still so to be able to gaze at the beautiful creature long time the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https then my eyes turned from it to the ponds whose surface dazzlingly reﬂected the sunlight but quickly returned to the blessed shade which we and our cattle were enjoying i accidentally looked again toward the sparkling water and noticed trunk of tree in the middle of it which i had not seen few moments previously what could have raised it from the bottom of the pond to the surface i sat up little and saw second and third emer ge by its side i did not stir but continued to gaze and in ten minutes the pools were covered with old wood i cried in low voice to tiger to look but he had scarce done so ere he laughed and said they were alligators enjoying the sunshi ne the surface of both pools was literally covered with these monsters mostly of large size i cried to my comrades to take their riﬂes quietly aim at their heads and ﬁre when i gave the signal i did so our guns exploded simultaneously and the water spirted up furiously and bedewed the grass long way round only two of the monsters remained in sight shooting backwards and forwards in the water and beating their tails so furiously that the spray dashed over us at this moment antonio came up with lasso and in an instant threw the noose over one of the furious creatures we all ran with the end of the rope over the grass and dragged the alligator on land when it snapped savagely around with its fearful jaws and lashed its tail we now set to work with pistols and ere long its head had so many holes in it that it could not move its dangerous jaws its comrade was still swimming quietly on the top of the water so we fetched it out too on to the grass when it behaved furiously the ﬁrst but we soon put an end to its fun they were two gigantic animals nearly sixteen feet long and their throats were armed with rows of terrible teeth some of which we all took memento it is riddle to how the creatures got here the nearest stream was many miles away while they never quit the banks of the water in which they live and are awkward tortoises ashore so that land journey was impossible but even assuming that one of the creatures had strayed and reached this spot after long wandering it could not be assumed that hundreds of them had emigrated together to spot so distant from their element another question presented itself which was more easy to answer however and which was settled before our what such large creatures lived here they were supplied by the unfortunate inhabitants of this country who came many miles to this spot in order to quench their burning thirst at these glorious springs and strengthen their wearied limbs during which they were dragged under by the watchful monsters and torn to pieces by thousands of teeth i am convinced that even buffalo in spite of its gigantic strength would be overpowered and killed by these monsters if fatigued by long journey over the prairie it ran into their ponds to cool itself the sun was near the hills we had satisﬁed our hunger with turkey breasts and venison and were ready to leave this pleasant spot when königstein slit up an alligator with his hunting knife and drew out of the belly of one some deer feet and then out of the other the leg of turkey we would gladly have extirpated the whole nest of disgusting monsters but not one of them was now visible and the evening sun played cheerily on the surface of the water if horrors and dangers were concealed beneath it we watered our horses once again and then trotted on in order to cover good bit of ground the nearer we got to our home the greater grew our longing it and all the friends whom we had left there we continued our journey about week and crossed number of small streams which ran into the puerco till one noon we reached another rivulet on whose shady bank we resolved to rest from this point we surveyed in the south large forest which ran across our road from the eastern mountains to the puerco while we saw above it distant ranges of mountains running in the same direction which we saluted the san saba mountains these were the only ranges that separated us from home and full of desire of them old friends we saddled toward evening and at midnight entered the forest which we had seen before us ever since our midday halt the moon had hitherto distinctly shown us the buffalo paths but here her rule was at an end and only now and then did ray fall through the lofty masses of foliage which now roofed us over we stopped on very trampled path which we could not follow however through the forest even if our cattle kept the road the creepers hanging over it rendered our progress difﬁcult our cattle were very thirsty and we had doubt of ﬁnding water in the forest depths we resolved to try and reach it we dismounted gathered dry grass out of which owl and tiger twisted torches one of which we lit and then pressed on leading our horses we had not gone more than one hundred yards into the forest when tiger cried that he was at the river and shortly after we led our thirsty horses down the bank and refreshed them in the cool stream we ﬁlled our gourds and returned by the same road to the prairie where we fastened up our cattle in the grass and lit our ﬁre the horses were very hungry we did not drive them out the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https grass but set sentry over them who was relieved every half hour at daybreak we shot turkeys in the wood breakfast bathed in the adjoining river and then fetched up the sleep we had lost in the night we stopped here till about 3 and then continued our journey southward the banks of the stream were very steep here we were delayed little till we had all our baggage across but then rode two hours without halt through the glorious shade of the forest in whose gloom only now and then bright yello w patch was lit up by the inquisitive sunbeams we felt here much at home on the leone or the mustang and the conversation throughout the whole day turned upon home and our friends there nature all around offered pictures of those regions the trunks of the trees here rose again side by side from their lofty branches llianas covered with gayest hues swung across and under the evergreen bushes the ﬂowers displayed their brightest colours the parrots with their lustrous plumages hung high above us on the branches head downward and innumerable bright red cardinals ﬂew like live coals through the dark foliage here proud stag with mighty antlers peered out from cozy glade and there timid antelope ﬂed with its two fawns behind it through the thicket when we rode through the last clumps and reached the prairie on the other side of the wood the sunbeams were falling on it obliquely and we did not miss the delightful shade so much we should have done had we exposed ourselves to the sun few hours earlier we rode sharply and at about 9 unsaddled at the foot of the san saba mountains and camped on torrent that ran down thence to the puerco the next morning we followed the stream to the river and about noon reached the principal indian path that led from these valleys over the san saba mountains and greatly facilitated our passage over them on the third morning we looked down on the hills near our home on which we camped the same evening the next day we reached turkey creek at sunset and would assuredly not have camped but ridden home without resting had not our cattle been so fatigued it was very late ere we thought of lying down to rest and even then the conversation was carried on long time after the old fashion the turkeys announced to us that day was breaking on this occasion however we did not shoot any but each breakfasted quickly and got ready going home little more attention was paid this day to our costume although we could not make much of it with the greatest skill still we looked altogether tidier when we left camp and each galloped on to be the ﬁrst i was obliged to hint that we still had long way to go and ought not to begin with galloping the journey seemed very long to us although our horses advanced sturdily if they too noticed that we were going home at about ten we made halt and let our cattle rest few hours while we lit ﬁre at the same spot where we had made coffee at the beginning of our journey and drank it again at about two however we saddled and spread over the baggage of the mules the ﬁnest jaguar skins above which the two splendid stags heads were displayed we were still busy with our horses when suddenly jack kicked up behind gave few springs and then trotted along the path that led to the leone he would not be deprived of the pleasure of being ﬁrst so soon we approached him he doubled his pace and even galloped when it appeared necessary all our cattle now plainly showed that they knew they were near home and could not be held in long before sunset we passed throu gh the wood on the leone and entered the prairie below the fort where we ﬁred all our shots we were greeted from the fort in the same way and its inhabitants ran out to meet us and overwhelm us with congratulations everything was before except that another good harvest had been got in that horses cattle pigs and dogs had multiplied and that numerous new settlers had arrived both north and south john was impatient to get home and left time to change my clothes i wished to accompany him i therefore saddled fancy left königstein to look after czar and trusty and rode with my companion toward mustang river from distance we could see that the lasars had built large new house with glass windows and galleries whose whitewashed walls glistened through the gloom we had reloaded and announced our return to our friends some distance off soon after we saw white handkerchiefs waving light dresses hurrying out of the garden gate and old and young black and white hurried to meet us and welcomed us with expressions of joy and congratulations i had to apologize my dress and retire but i was obliged to stay to supper which meal we took under the verandah and after it we sat in the garden before the house where the perfumes of splendid ﬂowers surrounded us which illumined by the moonbeams formed graceful groups around us the bottles went so rapidly the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https that i thought it advisable to seek my homeward road before i had any difﬁculty in ﬁnding it it was about midnight when i reached the fort where i found everybody up and also cheered by wine i had ordered königstein when i rode away to give them treat i however soon sought my with trusty and slept with open doors and windows till the sun stood high in the heavens i hastened down to the river and after bathe the old trunks were opened and the garb of olden times was taken out some weeks passed ere i was quite at home again all the works looked after others to be undertaken arranged and repairs and improvements carried out i frequently came across the lasars visited with the old gentleman the new settlers in the neighbourhood consulted with him about making roads and bridges and was appealed to by him in any importa nt undertakings in his private affairs although we now felt alarm about the indians coming to the numerous new settlements their friendly visits now grew wearisome and disagreeable every moment new tribe arrived of whom we had scarce heard to make friendship with us and receive presents something must be given them else we ran risk that they would take it out on our cattle or ﬁre the prairie when violent wind was blowing or take some other revenge which would more injury than the value of the presents they longer ventured on open hostilities within range of our settlements to such only the more distant squatters were exposed who lived nearer to the desert shortly after our return arrived white from virginia with his wife two sons of twelve and fourteen years of age and two younger daughters he applied to lasar and myself to show him good bit of land on which he could settle the people pleased us they were friendly and honest lived on good terms together we noticed on our frequent visits to their camp on the leone and were the right sort to defy such mode of life lasar and i resolved to take them under our wing and induced them to settle at our old camping place on turkey creek which purpose we set out early one morning with them lasar ordering twenty negroes to come with us and prepare an abode the omers we built them there in few days neat double blockhouse that is to say two houses about twenty yards apart over which and the space between one long roof was thrown then we surrounded the house with palisade in which they could lock their cattle at night and ﬁtted them lot of wood with which they could fence in garden lasar gave them handsome cow and i gave them breeding sow some fowls and maize to eat and to sow the coming spring white was one of those resolute unswerving men who after struggling long time with misfortune in the civilized world turn their attention to the western deserts where they try to extort from fate what has been refused to them elsewhere with his peculiar energy and restless execution of everything he had once undertaken he set to work in his new home in order soon possible to lay the foundation of his own and his family future prosperity but unfortunately he was only able to see the foundation the garden was hardly fenced in and the maize ﬁeld taken in hand ere he fell ill and violent fever carried him off in few days his eldest son charles rode over to to bring the melancholy news and tell that his mother wished to speak to i rode across the next morning with königstein and negro the widow was sitting inconsolably by the side of her dead husband without any plan the future and on my entrance sobs and unable to utter the dead body i at once ordered the negro to dig grave and buried the poor fellow after which i sat down by the widow side and tried to give her some consolation by offering her my assistance i proposed to her to settle near till her sons were old enough to look after their present farm but she was of opinion that they were able to so already although not strong enough to the heavy ﬁeld work such clearing the land from bushes and trees well felling and clearing the wood itself if this could be done her she would not leave the spot her lads could plough and use the pick while both ﬁred riﬂe well any frontierman and she too if it came to the point knew how to use her husband i made every possible objection to her plan of living here alone but promised my help and lasar if she insisted on adhering to it the next morning i said to the woman who was determined to stop here and promised to send her help to prepare her garden and fence and bring her few triﬂes her comfort i got home at an early hour and rode in the evening to lasar to tell him what had happened the old gentleman at once declared that he would send john off the next morning with the requisite number of slaves to arrange everything the widow and all the members of the family vied with each other in displa ying their sympathy by sending articles of clothing and stores of every description in week everything was in order at garden was the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https and ﬁeld of ﬁve acres prepared planting with maize beans gourds and potatoes the best varieties of vegetables were sown in the garden and seeds of all sorts given to the widow the woman had the present only to keep the garden in order while the sons procured game which they could shoot at times from their own door all her other wants were amply supplied thus peace and contentment soon returned to this house and the love of her children restored white the activity and determination which the loss of her husband had palsied dawn found her busy with domestic the rooms dressing her daughters milking the cows preparing breakfast salting and drying game in short with all sorts of occupations after that she was seen sitting in the shadow of the roof between the houses cleansing and spinning cotton to make clothes her children while the two little girls sported around her and the sons were busy in the garden or hunting close at hand she could recall them at any moment by sounding an immense which hung in the passage between the two houses near the door of the shortly after peace had settled down again on this solitary abode the widow was seated usual in the cool passage with her daugh ters while her second son ben had gone to the spring to fetch water and charles had gone into the neighbouring wood with his riﬂe all at once the very sharp dogs which guarded the family made an unusual disturbance and ran barking across the yard that surrounded the house white jumped up and saw several indians standing in front of the nearest wood and then retire into it again directly after she seized the horn sounded it with all her might then ran into the room and took down her deceased husband that was loaded with slugs with resolution and courage such has grown almost entirely strange to the feminine sex in civilization and is only found on rare occasions on its outermost frontier on this continent in few minutes ben ran up and found his mother already behind the palisade with the gun in her hand quick ben your riﬂe she cried to her twelve year old son but forget your bullet boy and then blew the horn again the dogs now came in again and white closed the hole in the fence through which they passed all at once frightful yell was heard from the wood and from its gloom sprang swarm of some thirty ﬁends who dashed over the grass toward the house with an awful ﬁre ben till i have loaded again white cried and then rapidly dischar ged both barrels sending some forty leaden pellet s among the charging horde the effect of the two shots at hardly ﬁfty yards distance was so tremendous that the horde darted in all directions if struck by lightning and eight remained on the grass while the others ran howling to the wood fire ben white cried to her son who had thrust his riﬂe through the palisades while she poured handful of slugs down her gun and placed two cotton wads upon them ben ﬁred into the thickest of the fugitives and one of them fell with his feet in the air while the yells of the others ﬁlled the air i have hit mother the boy said he poured fresh powder down the barrel bravo ben but where is charles he ought to have been here by this time he has not been gone long run into the house and have look at fanny and bessie but come back again directly thus white called to her son while she was hurriedly making cotton wads which she moistened with her lips and threw back her long raven hair which hung over her shoulders mother charles is coming with kitty ben cried he ran out of the house and hurried to the hind part of the fence to open the gate their cow kitty which was trotting over the grass in front of charles the latter had heard the horn and the shots and yells of the indians he hurried home had come across kitty and had driven her home everything was quiet and the indians did not make the slightest sound charles and his mother secured the two fence gates with logs of wood and then the mother went to her young children leaving her sons orders to call her if they saw anything of the indians the day passed without the savages making fresh attack on the settlement but the greater on that account grew the widow alarm lest they should take advantage of the night to satiate their vengeance toward evening she bade her sons lie down and sleep so that they could keep awake during the night while she kept guard in front of the house the sun set and darkness was lying over the country when white and her two sons took their places behind the palisade and carefully surveyed the open prairie it was about nine when they saw the light of ﬁre coming through the wood rapidly grow larger and presently appear on its outermost edge again the fearful yell was raised with which the savages always accompany their attac k and the light moved from the forest over the grass dark object moved across the plain toward the house and the light shone out on both sides of it the object slowly drew nearer and white soon saw that it was framework of bushes behind which the indians were concealed and pushing it before them this leafy wall had advanced within twenty yards when charley and ben ﬁred at it and the groans of the wounded were distinctly heard amid the yells of the assailants all that the wall moved slowly forward and in few minutes leaned against the corner of the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https after which ﬂames suddenly darted up and set the fence on ﬁre the savages had brought heap of dry wood with them behind the screen piled it up against the palisade and kindled it after which they ran back about forty yards and lay down ﬂat in the grass the space behind the fence round the house was now so brilliantly illumined that white feared lest the savages might ﬁre arrows through the palisades at her boys hence she retired with them into the house and went up under the roof whither she took her daughters too while the dogs ran furiously along the palisade then she raised several of the shingles with which the roof was covered and placed others under them so that she could survey the prairie where she saw the indians lying in the short grass at the same instant however sparks fell down from the roof the savages had ﬁred number of burning arrows which set ﬁre to the dry shingle roof of cedar an inhuman yell of joy from the savages greeted the ﬁrst ﬂash of the ﬂames which soon ascended with crackling sound charles the axe white shrieked to her son while she thrust her through the roof and ﬁred at group of savages lying together in the grass who doubtless fancied themselves safe from the besieged the unhurt men leaped up with yell and darted back to the wood while the second barrel was ﬁred after them and again brought down several charles handed his mother the axe with which she soon made hole in the roof and pulled out the blazing shingles so that the ﬁre was extinguished in few moments then she ran with axe and gun down into the yard reloaded and checked the ﬁre at the palisades which there was wind spread very slowly and was speedily put out the corner of the palisade was certainly burnt down and there was large opening in it while outside large heap of burning coals remained from the ﬁre white with her sons help pulled the small cart which had conveyed their little property hither into the opening and then ﬁlled up all the gaps with logs of ﬁrewood the night was passed under arms and when dawn lit up the country the heroic woman looked out of the roof at the in front of her fortress without being able to see trace of indians the savages had carried off the corpses of their comrades in the darkness and had probably departed with them in the night to let them rest with their fathers the indians take the dead bodies of their friends with them and carry them hundreds of miles to the of the tribe late on the following night the barking of my dogs awoke and when i shou ted out of the fort asking who was there charles white announced himself and told what had happened i had his wearied horse looked after gave him bed and early next morning rode with him to lasar to consult with the latter what was to be done this humane man soon formed resolution and told he would let faithful old negro who was not of much use to him live at white he could sow bit of land with cotton the proceeds of which would be his own and the family would have protector in him he was an excellent shot and fearless determined man within an hour we were mounted and rode past my fort in order to fetch owl and tiger we arrived in the evening at white where we saw the damage done by the savages and then heard the story from white own lips on which occasion she praised ben bravery who during the narration stood by his mother side with her arm thrown round him the woman was most grateful our kindness and sympathy and said that with the help of the old negro primus she would withstand whole indian tribe primus remained there and this settlement was really never again disqu ieted by indians it was however less the presence of the negro that made them refrain from hostilities than white heroic defence at later date indians told that the aggressors were mescaleros and white ﬁred so many bullets among them all at once if the had been scattering on the earth since then an indian was hardly ever seen there such atrocities often happened at the outermost settlements while very possibly the same

turkey creek i was sitting one afternoon in the verandah before my house and drinking coffee when i saw long way down the prairie cloud of dust coming down the river curious to who it could be i went into the house and fetched my telescope i saw three indians on horseback man in front and two squaws following him they rode very fast in spite of the great heat and soon came up the hill to the fort i went out to them and all three came through the palisade gate and pulled up in front of my house the warrior leapt from his horse while the two girls remained seated on theirs he told in english that tribe of indians wished to make friendship with and the chief had sent to inquire whether he would be allowed to pay visit with his people i asked him to what nation they belonged which question appeared it seemed to be disagreeabl to him and he passed it over in silence he then said something to the two girls which i did not understand and then told they were mescaleros but not of those who made the attack on white the chief of the latter was good friend of the white men but the father of these two girls was very good friend and hence he wished to come and tell so himself i replied that i should be glad to see him here and invited the girls to drink coffee with which invitation they did not at once accept but with their elbows resting on their horses necks gazed at curiously and then took side glances through the open door of my house at the interior i offered them cigars and took lucifer match out of my box the lighting of which surprised them immensely i lighted my cigar at it ﬁrst and then handed it to them and they loudly expressed their satisfaction at the excellence of the tobacco i then took drink of coffee and handed the cup to one of the girls who ﬁrst examined it curiously all round and then raised it to her lips to taste the contents she had scarce tasted it however when she emptied the cup at draught and gave it back to with an intimation that i should give her sister some i gave her full cup too she emptied it at draught and asked more so that in few minutes my whole supply of coffee was expended i gave them cakes which they ate with equal appetite and then went into the house to fetch bottle of sweet spanish wine i poured out glass tasted and handed it to one of the indian girls but she declin ed it and after saying few words to the man their glances lost the calmness and merriment which they had gradually assumed i emptied the glass and placed it on the table without again offering them wine but handed them light their cigars which had gone out after while the man asked whether it was the bottle contained and when i replied in the negative and assured him it was capital wine he said that one of the girls wished to taste it i ﬁlled the glass put it to my lips and handed it to her on the horse she raised it to her lips rather timidly but drank the wine off at draught so soon she had once tasted it her eyes beamed with joy and she sat up on her horse and passed her hand from her neck over her breast and stomach she said with an expression of delight bueno and handed the glass back with sign to give her some more i ﬁlled it again but gave it to her sister who was looking on silently but eagerly she too liked the wine and emptied the glass which i set on the table at this moment both girls leapt from their horses gave the bridles to the indian with disdainful gesture while one of them told him imperiously to take the horses to graze i at least concluded so from the gestures with which she accompanied her words and from his at once going off with the horses the speaker then turned to with most gracious smile and after throwing contemptuous glance at the man said to mexicano and now it became clear to that he was slave probably stolen by this indian tribe when boy the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https two young savages now ran up to the verandah in front of my house and i saw the ﬁrst time properly what remarkably pretty visitors i had both girls had been so crouching on their horses that but little of their ﬁgure could be seen the one who seemed to the younger was very tall slim and most beautifully formed her shape was elegant but round and full and her bones so delicate that the comparison between horse and deer involuntarily occurred to her hands and feet like those of all indians were very small and so gracefully shaped that the white colour was not missed on proportionately broad shoulders and plump round neck she carried her head freely and her demeanour proved that she was perfectly well satisﬁed with herself her glossy black silky hair hung fastened together on the left side of her head with strip of vermilion leather length of four feet over her shoulders and on the top of the red ﬁllet ﬂoated by the side of her head round bush of countless feathers of the most brilliant colours which heaved up and down at every movement her ﬁne lofty forehead was adorned by glistening eyebrows benea th which black eyes ﬂashed but their wild expression was toned down by the shadow of long eyelashes and only in moments of excitement did the passionate look return to them the small pretty nose turned up slightly at the end and gave saucy look to the face while the laughing fresh mouth with its full cherry lips cut in the shape of cupid bow heighten ed the expression when the laughing lips parted they displayed the most beautiful and regular teeth and in the cheeks were two deep dimples at the same time her mien was elegant her movements were rapid but graceful and her whole appearance was full of young life unchecked and wild but attractive and pleasant her dark colour passed easily from light brown to olive and announced that under it dwelt those warm feelings which are only born under hot sun though the interpreter was absent our conversation now went on better than before the eyes of the indian girl and her gestures rendered dictionary quite unnecessary she quickly disposed of another glass of wine and would certainly have drunk good deal more had i not ﬁlled the glass again and handed it to her sister and then locked the bottle up in cupboard the sister displayed less of the passionate indian blood she was quieter in her movements and though she too frequently opened her mouth to smile she did not burst into loud laugh and while the former looked all around the eyes of the quieter girl were ﬁxed the more ﬁrmly on the object she was surveying she was shorter than her younger sister but much plumper more of titian beauty had also splendid hair arranged in the same fashion ck but smaller ﬂashing eyes graceful aquiline nose and smaller mouth her colour was rather darker than that of her sister and it was doubtful whether dazzling white or this transparent brown was the more beautiful colour the skin the name of the elder sister who was about nineteen years of age was cachak ia sparkling star while the younger was called pahnawhay ﬁre and had not seen more than sixteen summers the costume of these two savage beauties was much alike over their shoulders hung handsomely painted costly dressed in the centre of which was long slit through which they thrust head and neck this mantilla was ornamented all round with ﬁne long leathern fringe to whose ends glistening stones and shells were attached it hung lower down before and behind and left the pretty round arms at liberty round their hips was petticoat also of leather adorned with long fringe and handsomely painted in colours while the leathern trousers were also decorated at the sides with similar fringe their little feet were thrust into shoes also ornamented with stones shells and fringe pahnawhay was the ﬁrst to run up into the gallery at each step she rose on her feet if walking on whalebone while cachakia came on with quieter but scarce audible step both sate down at the table and the younger sister took the and drained it while making signs to give her more wine i made her understand that she had better not drink any more it might send her to sleep but i would give them some more before they rode away pahnawhay had looked long time curiously at my room at last she jumpe d up and ran to the door and leaning against the lintel thrust her head in far she could with loud cry of amazement she sprang back several steps clapped her hands and with beaming face said something to her sister and then ran back to the door i went into the room and made her sign to follow but she only took one step across the threshold looked around her in amazement and then cried to her sister to come who however did not obey her i now went to cachakia took her by the hand and led her into the room where i made her sit down in my large chair the admiration and surprise of the two girls were extraordinary they remained long time motionless and silent looking from one object to the other until pahnawhay ﬁrst found her speech again running to my bed she drew red blanket from under the jaguar skin that served counterpane and hung it proudly over her shoulders she had not yet noticed my the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https i led her in front of it and loud cry of surprise burst from her pretty mouth she turned round before it and at last ran up and from it with the most graceful movements while cachakia looked at her in silence but showed by her ﬂashing eyes that she would like to be in her place i now led her in front of the mirror took bright silk handkerchi ef from chair bound it round her thick hair under the tuft of feathers and made her understand that it was hers i then took another blue and yellow one out of the chest of drawers and fastened it round pahnawhay hair i knew if i did not it would be all over with her good temper everything in the room was now examined and if possible handled and i had to explain its use cachakia too became gradually more animated and took greater share in the conversation always trying to make understand that her sister knew too little and her chatter was not worthy of attention everything pleased her and when she saw anything she wished particularly to have she made understand that we would swap but never said what she intended to give in exchange still i could not help giving both number of triﬂes such knives thimbles needles cotton and and i was very glad when the negroes came and announced that the dinner i had ordered my guests was on the table through which their desires took different direction i conducted them to the and was obliged to dine with them again in order to show them the use of knife and fork which they however soon laid aside and employed their little ﬁngers instead they liked everything but the pudding most and when coffee and cakes were again served it seemed if they intended making separate meal of them after dinner i gave them cigars and intended to keep them in this room till they rode off but they soon got up and after pointing round the room and saying with dissatisﬁed expression bueno they walked off straight to my house whether i would or i was obliged to admit them and cachakia was now the ﬁrst to nestle up to and point with her little hand to the while she looked up at with her sparkling black eyes and laughingly displayed two rows of pearly teeth i could not possibly refuse her and when i had ﬁlled the glass to the brim she raised the golden liquid to her lips and drank it to the last drop pahnawhay also drank glass but then i locked the bottle up again and in spite of cachakia languishing looks and her sister more stormy requests i did not take it out again pahnawhay had again taken the red blanket from my bed and walked round praising it loudly while i was sitting by cachakia but she seemed not to have the courage to ask it i noticed her embarrassment and i had long wished to have dress like these girls were wearing i pointed when she again stood before to the various articles of her costume then to the woollen blanket and made the sign of exchange if the greatest piece of good fortune had happened to her she fell back step and repeated my signs inquiringly if not believing her luck and when i again afﬁrmed it she threw off in few moments all her clothing folded herself in the blanket and stretching out her arm under it carefully laid her leathern dress on my bed i was so surprised at this instantaneous metamorphosis that at the ﬁrst moment i did not think how cachakia would be humiliated by it but pahnawhay pointed to her and said i must give her blanket well in truth the thermometer had already fallen in the eyes of my pretty neighbour so i got up quickly and opened chest in which i had several blankets but not red one however there were ﬁve blue ones among them which pleased cachakia remarkably and in an equally short period her dress was also lying on my bed and she was seated highly delighted in the turkey blue blanket in my rocking chair smoking her cigar the sun had already set and darkness was spreading over the landscape when my princesses trotted out proudly into the prairie wrapped in their blankets with an assurance that they would return early the next morning with the whole tribe at an early hour i had very large kettle of coffee made and extra bread baked before the cattle were driven out to pastu re fat ox was driven into the enclosure the dogs were chained up and i ordered my men to keep the fort closed the indians whom i wished to enter it would be led through my house which stood at the angle and had an entrance through the palisade at the appointed hour we saw the party of indians coming down the river and soon halt in front of my fence i went out received the chief with the usual ceremony and saluted his two daughters who on this day only wore petticoats painted in the brightest colours with very considerable taste they wore necklaces of very handsome beads earrings of the same material hung down on their shoulders and their round arms were ornamented with ﬂashing brass rings while new long tuft of feathers of the most brilliant hues was planted on the left side of the head they left the blankets which had hung loosely on their shoulders while riding on their horses and the latter were led off by the mexican slave after this both girls but cachakia not so quickly her sister hurried to and we exchanged the usual signs of the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https in the customary fashion they pressed my hands wound their pretty arms around and would assuredly have kissed were not this mark of affection quite unknown to the indians and would have seemed to them highly ridiculous after the ﬁrst greetings they pointed to their father and then to my house saying vino and making the sign of drinking the chief was man of about ﬁfty years of age about six feet high with broad shoulders and arched chest regular handsome features straight nose sharp black eyes lofty forehead rarity among the heavy moustache twisted into points he had haughty imposing mien and something very determined in his appearance which was however kindly and hearty so that we fraternized in few moments i proposed to lead him and his daughters to my house but he turned to his tribe and said something i did not understand upon which two men stepped out of the mob and joined us we reached the gallery in front of my house to which i had had all my chairs carried in order if possible to keep the interior clear the curious guests i made them sit down at table and handed the chief the pipe i had myself lighted he passed it to his neighbours and so it went the round while the two girls swung themselves in the rocking chair or the hammock hung up in the gallery and smoked cigars after the calumet of peace had passed round the chief informed of the purpose of his visit to make peace with and introduced the other two indians to the chief of peace and the sage in council in which the mexican acted interpreter dinner was now served the chief employing knife and fork i did while the two others used their ﬁngers pahnawhay had fetched buffalo robe out of the house and laid it on the ground and sat upon it with her sister to have her dinner i handed them the plates of food but they returned the knives and forks saying it was easier work with their ﬁngers they amused themselves famously on their buffalo hide and teazed each other with the heartiest merriment which their father gave them several warnings to which they responded with laugh the chief now explained to that many tribes of his nation entertained hostile feelings against the white men but he hoped they would soon see it was to their advantage to enter into friendly relations with them and that his tribe from henceforth would never commit any act of hostility against us we had ﬁnished dinner and i told the chief that i now wished to give his men their dinner on which he rose and said that he had better be present or else order would be kept we went out in front of the palisade after i had locked my house door unseen by the two girls and had the caldron of coffee sweetened with honey and mixed with milk brought out well the bread which last the chief distributed among the various families telling them to use in drinking their own utensils which consi sted of shells horns and there were above two hundred souls in camp though among them all were only forty warriors i now showed the chief the fat ox which i had shut up in the cow milking enclosure remarking at the same time that i intended to give it to his people and asked whether it should be shot now to which he assented königstein brought riﬂe and i shot the ox through the skull after which some of the indians skinned and carried the joints to camp ere long some thirty ﬁres were lighted round which the indians lay and roasted the meat while constantly running to the cof to ﬁll their vessels i was standing and admiring the appetites of these people when cachakia thrust her arm through mine and affectionately tried to induce to go to my house with her to open the door which she made signs she could not manage i told her i would wait her father so that he might drink coffee with us i walked through the groups of indians to him with my young lady friend hanging tightly on my arm these mescalero indians were certainly the least civilized i had yet seen their dress consisted of leathern fastened round their hips and large dressed in the whole camp however i found nothing emanating from white men on all their faces something shy mistrustful and savage could be noticed which is not generally the case with other tribes the people were on the average not very tall but sturdy and and well fed the women however were nearly all good looking and i not remember having seen so many pretty indian girls together in this camp we walked from ﬁre to ﬁre which appeared to please the savages pahnawhay dashed every now and then like young ﬁlly through the grass to my side it had taken too long to open the house and she now hung on my other arm and pulled my beard punishment having kept her waiting so long i told her i was waiting her father she could go and bring him to my house while i went on in front with cachakia on arriving my companion could not at all understand in what way the door was closed so tightl y and was quite surprised when i opened it with the key she wished to try the experiment herself and said she would keep the key so to let herself in when she pleased and it was not till i made her understand that in that case i could not open the house without her that she returned it to the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https now took my guitar from its case and sitting down on my bed let my ﬁngers stray over the strings cachakia stood with eyes and mouth before and became quite beside herself when i began playing with one leap she sat on the bed behind and peeping over my right shoulder watched my performance she was really delighted at the music attempted to play the guitar herself and became very angry and impatient when she could not manage it at last pahnawhay arrived with her father and the two ministers we again took our seats in the verandah and i ordered the coffee and cake which my guests tremendously enjoyed then i gave them all cigars to smoke after which the chief told that his people were well satisﬁed were very good friends of mine and would remain so i took him to the in my house to let him see my weapons about ﬁfty implements they did not fail to arouse my guest admiration and when we returned to the gallery i took revolver and at about one hundred yards put bullet into young tree not nearly so wide man and then ﬁred the other ﬁve rounds in rapid succession after this i placed in few seconds fresh cylinder in the lieu of the dischar ged one and ﬁred the six rounds with equal rapidity remarking the while that i could go on ﬁring thus uninterruptedly this weapon excited my guest attention in the highest degree and he looked at it long time with the greatest astonishment and declared with the utmost seriousness that it was the grandest medicine he had ever seen i made him present of very pretty whose handle was composed of mounted with silver shoe his joy at it was childish and in his excitement he assured that he would lift the hair of the ﬁrst enemy he conquered with it this knife was also great medicine the girls now left peace i must fetch wine which the three men at ﬁrst looked at very suspiciously but on my assurance that it was not they tasted it and drank with great satisfaction when i carried the bottle back to the cupboard i ﬁlled glass and put it on the table making cachakia sign that it was her but at the same time i laid my ﬁnger on my lip so that she might not let the others know it i did not wish to open fresh bottle and this one was nearly empty she understood perfectly well and proof nodded to when i came out of the house while quiet smile played round her little mouth i returned to my seat and she carelessly rose walked into my room took the glass from the table and gave nod unseen by the others she slowly drank the contents then she walked back into the gallery carelessly and sat down with us like person who is proud at having been preferred but she cast her eyes down their sparkle might betray her evening arrived we supped and when the moon had fully risen went out to the indian camp the chief wished to spend the night with his men because the latter might be alarmed about him if he slept in the fort with we had hardly reached the ﬁrst ﬁre when we heard fearful row at the other end of the camp and the chief ran with his two colleagues in the direction of it i was anxious about what was going on there and hasten ed after them accompanied by the two indian girls two young men had quarrelled and were engaged in violent dispute when we came up while the voices of the chief and his colleagues were raised to loud key suddenly however the two men rushed to different ﬁres seized their bows and arrows ﬂew about hundred yards apart into the prairie and in few minutes disappeared from sight the chief shouted after them but one pursued them the mexican was standing not far from us at the next ﬁre and i called him up to give an explanation of the disturbance pahnawhay however explained to with few very intelligible signs that the two young men loved the same girl and she had given her affection to both upon which they quarrelled and had run off to kill one another the mexican conﬁrmed this statement on which i asked why one tried to prevent it but i received the laughing reply if the thing were evident that this was impossible number of indians had by this time collected round one of the ﬁres and cachakia taking by the arm drew to it when we saw weeping and loudly lamenting girl seated with her head between her knees with dishevelled hair almost concealing the whole of her person this was the sweetheart of the two jealous knights one of whom had probably by this time the deadly arrow in his heart we were standing by the side of the unhappy girl when frightful yell echoed far across the moonlit prairie the of the combatants who had now met in open ﬁght they had not been able probably to discern each other by crawling through the grass the ﬁrst note scarce reached us ere the weeping girl sprang up threw back her hair and hurling back the people standing round her ran off with shrill scream and disappeared deadly silence set in everybody expected to hear at the next moment that the ﬁre was over and all looking in the direction where the girl had disappeared seemed to be anxiously holding their breath at this moment the girl piercing scream rang through the night air the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https after fearful yell that pierced the marrow and was answered by all the occupants of the camp pretty nearly it seemed if the latter had only been waiting this signal now number of men and squaws some of whom held ﬁrebrands ran off and we could see these ﬁres collected into point far away cachakia said to he is dead and pressed her head down with her right hand to the left side and closed her eyes we soon saw the light moving towards us until we could at length distinguish the separate torches and the procession marched into camp four indians bore the bloody corpse of the murdered man to the ﬁrst ﬁre and laid it on the ground i took torch to see whether life still remained but the last spark had disappeared on his left side near the heart gaped three fearful wounds which almost divided the chest in two parts and his hair was bound into mass by the curdled blood while his head was cleft with tomahawk the indians only take scalp when it belongs to an enemy of their tribe he was carried to the middle of the camp and covered with buffalo robe i asked cachakia what would become of the other man and the girl and she told that the warrior must ﬂy within four and twenty hours and keep away till he had made it up with the dead man relations or otherwise they would take his life in return thus time was allowed him to fetch his traps and if he came into camp during the period he would not be molested but after that he would be nowhere safe from them the chief now held council with the relations of the dead man which was just ended when the victor sweetheart appeared silently led his horses to his ﬁre packed all his traps on them and then went out into the night again without word while one in camp appeared to have noticed her although she walked openly towards the blazing ﬁres indians not consider it any harm girl to be coquette but they punish the inﬁdelity of wife and frequently with death but it is more common the husband to cut off her nose which indul gence is chieﬂy occasioned by the squaws being portion of the husband fortune he is oblig ed to buy them employs them servants and labourers and can sell them again ever or time he pleases i missed in this tribe more female noses than in any other i had seen in very short time all became quiet again in camp if nothing extraordinary had happened and after i had sat while with the chief i wished him and was accompanied home by cachakia which attention appears to be one of the forms of politeness on the part of the savages and even thoug h the home of parting guest is long way from their camp they always accompany him to the last highest point whence they can look back on their camp day was hardly dawned when i opened my door and stepped out into the galler y to greet the fresh morning in the indian camp all appeared to be still resting except few forms moving about in it i saw through my glass that they had with them horse and mule and ere long an indian mounted the latter and two others raised something that was wrapped in large buffalo hide up to him then another indian mounted the horse and they went off up the river with the mule in front i conjectured that it was the corpse of the murdered man which the two were carrying to the of the tribe and found my supposition conﬁrmed when i entered the camp i had another caldron of coffee and great quantity of maize bread carried to the camp invited the chief and his two councillors of state and his daughters to breakfast after which he told that our friendship was now eternally concluded and that he would depart with an easy mind i made him number of triﬂing presents such blankets tobacco vermilion gave the daughters several keepsakes well and my guests quitted apparently remarkably well satisﬁed during the two days owl and tiger had not shown themselves the delawares though not open enemies are not on very friendly terms with the mescaleros and so they went off hunting owl had received his wages long before but still remained with us he seemed to enjoy himself in which our cooking played great part but he now came one morning to and said the time had arrived when he promised to join his family and so he must leave us he did not wish to render his friends alarmed about his safety he rode to lasar and took his leave when he received handsome presents i too gave him numerous triﬂes his ﬁdelity and devotedness and he went of f accompanied by tiger promising to pay visit very shortly the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https xxix the sil ver mine it was now the busiest time in the ﬁelds the storms had blown down great number of huge dried trunks standing in the ﬁelds which had to be cut up and rolled away which business was one of our hardest jobs moreover i had the ﬁeld enlar ged fenced in very large extent of land part prairie part forest where i could turn my mares and colts out and on rainy days had wood felled to let it dry and afterwards employ it building purposes axe and plough were equally active on the mustang and on many smaller streams in the vicinity where civilization had set its foot thus whole patches of forest disappeared before man busy hand and the soil was robbed of its natural protection the roots were turned up to be burnt or rot and the earth was thus forced to receive and generate seeds foreign to it the prairies which few years back had only been traversed by the desert animals were now inhabited by herds of tame domestic creatures attached to home and the traveller ear in these regions was longer startled by hearing the unexpected sound of cattle bell but nature will not allow laws to be prescribed to her without taking vengeance or have changes made in her domestic arrange ments forcibly by human hands with the felling of forests and the turning up of the soil she sends diseases which check her insulter in the work he has begun and punish him his audac

way usually increase thirty years and decrease so long period until they entirely cease this is the case with the interior but not in the cities where other relations occur in proportion with their expansion at my settlement there had been many years malady save those caused by external injuries but now one or the other frequently complained of ague bilious fever ﬂux and we often cursed the time when we saw the ﬁrst white face settle amid our solitudes at lasar matters were proportionately worse hund red negroes would be down at the same time my part i had yet been spared while all my companions had been it was very hot day when i rode to the nearest town usual only provided with blanket and during the nights lay by my ﬁre in the open air with it pulled over i remained several days in town and during the period felt never ailing and reduction of my strength my business being ended i rode off about noon to reach the next house whose inhabitants were friends of mine i arrived there about an hour before sundown but found the family in great state of disorder the head of it had just died of violent attack of fever although i felt very unwell i did not like to be troublesome to the family and rode on after short halt my illness increased with every quarter of an hour at one moment i shook with cold at another i felt if i were being burned alive and my head ached if it would burst i rode on although i could hardly sit my horse and at last tottered in the saddle quite incapable of thinking at the same time an indescribable burning thirst tortured and my tongue seemed to cleave to my roof while i had singing in my ears if there were thousands of grasshoppers inside my head it was nearly dark when i reached the middle of very wide plain that was covered with ﬁne very white sand and in which the horse at every step sank above the hocks i could longer remain in the saddle dismounted sat down on the sand fell back and became perfectly unconscious presently i fell into profound sleep from which i did not wake till the next morning i looked around in surprise and it was some time ere i could remember what the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https here i jumped up and trusty the faithful leapt barking around but i did not see czar my feet would hardly carry and my head was heavy if i had lead inside it i looked my horse track dragged myself along it and to my great consolation saw the faithful creature in hollow nibbling some cactuses and saddled and bridled i had left him on the previous evening i got on to his back with difﬁculty and turned him in the direction of home thirst now began to grow unendurable the sun burst forth and poured its burning beams upon with such fury that i fancied i should never be able to reach pool about miles distant which contained the only water in the neighbourhood this pond was at last the only thought of which i was capable at the same time my head threatened to burst and the fever shook mercilessly my horse walked along the familiar path through the heat and bore when the sun was vertical down to the edge of the pond where i sank powerless and crawled to the water in order to moisten my burning lips but it was water but thick dark red mud which was nearly boiling and in which buffaloes had been wallowing very shortly before matter i lay with my mouth over the thick ﬂuid and swallowed much of it i could it was really comfort the dryness of my throat was removed but my helplessness was so great that i could not resolve to leave the spot though i lay exposed to the burning sun on the hot sand and was only short distance from shady trees i lay i was and had but one thought that the sun must kill here but still i could not muster up the courage to go away at length toward evening when the sun was lower the terrible fever gave way little i crept slowly into the shade and soon was aslee p under the tree it was quite dark when i awoke and though very faint my head was clearer i went up to czar who had been grazing by my side all this time got into the saddle and contin ued my journey on which the pleasant light of the new moon lit and the cool evening breeze refreshed i rode till ten when i reached the lynx spring which i had christened after one of those animals that i had found dead here many years ago and whose water was the best miles around i was quickly off czar back among the roots of the magnolia beneath which the spring bubbled up and i drank if i should never be satisﬁed i had biscuit and paper of coarse sugar about this was my supper and i washed it down with the pure ﬂuid i felt much refreshed drew many deep breath in the powerful breeze and gazed at the patches of light around which were thrown by the moon through the dense foliage and through the violent motion of the leaves trembled and continually altered their shape it was very dangerous spot this water was the only spring miles round and wandering indians often select it their destination after travelling day through the desolate waterless but i would not have ridden away even if i had been compelled to defend myself against whole tribe i had few good cigars about and lit one which i smoked leaning against tree and i fancied inhaling fresh strength at every breath it was about midnight when i set out to reach at which i should not be so threatened at the present one and after ﬁlling my gourd with water i rode away faintly lighted by the waning moon i knew the road thoroughly and the outline of the trees was sufﬁcient to enable to keep my cours i could if my horse went at any pace reach within an hour at which i had passed many night and which lay but little way off my route it certainly had water but excellent grass my horse and hence various sorts of game could generally be found there the main point was that it lay some distance from the principal indian path and was tolerably concealed so that ﬁre could be lighted there without any great risk of being seen from distance it soon became very dark after the moon had sunk behind the hills in front of and i was obliged to yield the reins to czar and leave it to him to ﬁnd the road while i sent trusty on little way ahead to make certain there was danger every now and then however i saw by familiar clumps of trees or knolls that i was still on the right track and i approached my destination rather quickly considering the circumstances the country through which i rode consisted more or less of sandy hills covered with isolated black oaks without any scrub under which grew very tall grass disliked by cattle which had now entirely decayed so far i could judge in the darkness i was longer any great distance from my lace i saw in hollow on my left wood running along my route and which i knew to be swampy patch in which all the of the neighbourhood collected on my saddle hung several new tin cups and of the same material which rattled at every movement of my horse and thus produced ringing sound which could be heard some distance i dismounted and twined dry grass between them to keep them quiet i had just remounted my horse and was riding up hill when suddenly bright ﬂames sprang up not far behind the latter and illumined the whole country around in terror i stopped the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https and saw in few minutes that not only on the right of the hill the ﬂames rose to the branches of the surrounding oaks but that the ﬁre was spreading with extraordinary fury on my right and in my rear there was only one opening in this circle of ﬁre on my right near the swamp i turned czar round and galloped through the low oaks and tall grass toward the valley in which i was obliged to trust to the safe foothold of my horse i could not see sign of path the wind luckily was not very violent or else i could not have escaped it was i reached the wood before the ﬁre darted down into the bottom behind i stood here on moist ground between green bushes which the ﬂames could not reach and saw that they had ﬁred the oaks and converted each of them into ﬁery pyramid the whole country ahead of was now mass of ﬁre whose tongues rose over ﬁfty feet in which the ﬂames of the trees could be recognised by their dark red hue while above them the ruddy clouds of smoke rose to the sky ere long however the burning oaks stood alone like pillars of ﬁre on the denuded knolls and the sparks ﬂew out of them with terrible roaring and crackling i stood before this ﬁre till day broke and showed the black skeletons of the still burning trees and the dark rising above them ere long only small ﬂames crept round the bare trunks i mounted my horse to get away from this scene of conﬂagration and rode up the wood being obliged frequently to draw nearer to the burning trees to escape the swampy ground until at last i was compelled to pass through the ﬁre owing to the impassable nature of the ground the smoke the black ash and the heat were almost unendurable and frequently heavy branches fell close to i rode sharply i could and in an hour reached an open burnt clearing where i was once more able to draw fresh breath the ﬁre had undoubtedly been lit simultaneously at different points the purpose of burning by the indians but none of them had ventured on to the prairie leading down to the bottom i could see over it and if ﬁre had been lit there i could have detected the culprits i hurried along in the refreshing morning breeze and arrived about noon at stream on whose bank i turned into the adjoining wood and granted my horse and myse lf rest on the road i had shot turkey which paciﬁed my hunger and trusty and i strengthened myself by sound sleep from which i did not awak till evening during the whole day i had felt tolerably well but looked with terror the next i must expect that my fever would return every second day so i rode till rather late hour in order to reach camp where i was tolerably certain i could pass the day without disturbance before i rode off i dug up some roots of the and chewed them swallowing the juice till i reached camp these roots are one of the best remedies against fever which nature offers in these regions i slept till the sun disturbed and woke with aching head and weary limbs i took czar to graze and then lay down on my blankets after placing my gourd full of fresh water by my side the attack of fever was not very violent about 2 i was able to continue my journey and slept that night on an afﬂuent of the mustang the next morning i mounted at an early hour in order to reach the fort soon possible and made czar step out i felt very the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https trusty and the alligator about ten i rode through prairie which ran down to the mustang which here an insigniﬁcant stream ﬂowed between high banks over loose pebbles and was only deep at isolated spots the prairie was covered with clumps of tall cactus and sunﬂowers and i was riding between some of them when large stag got up before and stopped little way ahead i turned czar half round and shot the stag which fell but got up again and ran off to the mustang i saw that it was very sick i sent trusty after it who soon disappeared with it in thicket and i had scarcely reloaded when i heard his hoarse bark and recognised by its tone that he was occupied with something else than the stag i went up the wood fast czar could carry leapt off and ran through the bushes to the bank where i heard trusty voice mortal terror assailed on seeing trusty in shallow water near deep spot with his left hind leg in the jaw of an alligator whose skull he was smashing with his teeth though this did not make it open its clenched teeth i sprang at one bound into the river in order to prevent the horrible brute from reaching deep water to which it was retreating and was only few feet from it i sprang on the beast back held it between my knees tightly and lifted it into the shallow water while it lashed its tail madly i now pulled out revolver held it against the hinge of the jawbone and ﬁred one bullet after the other till the bones were splintered and the lower jaw fell off liberating trusty from his arrest i examined him and found that his leg bone was not injured though the ﬂesh had suffered severely at the same time he was losing much blood and appeared to be enduring great pain the stag lay close to the scene of contest so i drew it ashore and cut off the haunches then i fetched czar bound one of them on either side of the saddle packed lot of bushes on the lot and spread my blanket over them on which i raised trusty after i had bound up his wounds well i could with wet pocket handkerc hiefs i reached home in the afternoon and at once made decoction of the roots of the tulip and pomegranate and willow bark in order to check the fever which it soon effected combined with strict regimen though these illnesses may usually be checked so easily their frequent return affects the body greatly and makes it more and more susceptible to injurious climates and atmospheric inﬂuences so that the slightest change is often sufﬁcient to bring back the fever still all the diseases produced in these regions by an alteration in the surface of the ground are less dangerous than in any other part of the united states which may be chieﬂy ascribed to the free unimpeded motion of the air and the fact of lar ge swamps or standing waters existing here tiger returned after accompanying his friend to the puerco river whence the latter travelled on alone to santa fé at which place he had promised to meet his friends abou t this time my young indian friend now complained very often that i allowed him to ride out hunting the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https was most disagreeable to him i did not permit him to take trusty who was of such great value in the bear hunts which are principally carried on at this season i had certainly placed leo an excellent dog at his service but he was only half the value of trusty one evening tiger returned from hunting and told that he knew where very large bear was sleeping but it would be difﬁcult to get at it it was living in an old cypress that grew in the middle of the river and was too large to fell he described the spot to and i at once recognised the tree we talked about the matter at supper and resolved to make an attempt to get hold of the sleeper on the next day on the following morning we put our weapons axes and dinner in the canoe and ﬂoated down the river in it it was carried along by the current like dart so that we were obliged to steer very carefully between the numerous rocks in an hour we stopped at the cypress which was nearly six feet in diameter we cut down some saplings on the bank conve yed them to one side of the tree and fastened them together so to form raft on which we could stand we then placed the canoe on the other side of the tree and set to work with our axes felling it in addition to tiger and myself königstein and antonio had come so that one of us was always able to rest about noon we had got some distance through the tree and we had heard nothing of the bear we began greatly to doubt whether it was in it but tiger insisted in spite of our laughter and chaff that it was sleeping there we dined drank the health of the occupant of the tree and then set to work again in few hours the supports of the tree became so weak that it was time to take precautions lest it should fall on us we had hewn it on the side of the raft toward which it naturally hung and we now all proceeded to our canoe and held ourselves in readiness to push off at any moment we gave the tree few more cuts and ere long we heard the ﬁrst sound of cracking in its wood we were certain that it could only fall over the raft and the only danger was that it might slip backwards from the stump in which case we might easily be sunk couple more blows and the lofty crown of the cypress bent more over the raft one more stroke and it groaned and cracked at its base we pushed off and with frightful crash it fell into the river and splashed up the water so high that we were completely wet through while the splinters and broken branches ﬂew in all directions we involuntarily held our heads down into the boat which was raised great height by the waves but after the ﬁrst oscillation we all burst into hearty laugh and mockingly asked tiger where is our bear at the same moment however the bear leapt out of the middle of the splinters covering the surface of the river and while the water poured down and prevented it from seeing it laid its huge on the ﬂoating pieces of wood and sought support by means of which it could lift itself out of the disagreeable element the bear everybody shouted and we seized our riﬂes and ﬁred at it at the moment when it reached the stern of our boat and was trying to get into it by means of its paws königstein ran at the brute with his sharp axe and buried it deep in the skull of the enormous animal and then drove into its carcase the bent iron point of the to prevent it from sinking we pulled quickly ashore where we hauled in our quarry with lassos antonio ran back to the fort and fetched our cart with two mules with which he joined us before sunset with the help of the animals we pulled ﬁrst the bear and then the canoe on land rolled the former into the cart then raise d the canoe on the back of it where we secured it and so drove back to the fort with the stern of our boat trailing along the grass the bear gave us large quantity of splendid fat and its smoked ﬂesh long supplied our table we and our friends on the mustang now rarely visited the districts lying beyond the distance of day journey our domestic dutie s kept us more or less constantly at our settlements but we became all the better acquainted with our immediate neighbourhood and on our hunting excursions learnt every path and localit i had found but few miles from us the traces of an old spanish settlement and the remains of forge whence i concluded that the precious metals had been found here and that they still existed in the vicinity old lasar was man of most enterprising spirit and he had more working power at his command than he could employ proﬁtably on his cultivated ground he always desired some other speculation by which he could derive greater proﬁt from his slaves silver or gold mine was always one of his favourite schemes and he quickly turned the conversation to the subject expressing an opinion that the mountains near us certainly contained the precious metals he came to one day greatly excited and told with great mystery that an indian had been to him and told him under promise of the profoundest secrecy that he knew spot where the old spaniards worked silver mines and offered to show it to him if he would promise to hold his tongue to whom he obtained his information from the indians would certainly kill him if they discovered that he had revealed the spot lasar stated that he had told the indian to return in eight days when he would ride with him and reward him if he really pointed out the silver mine the old the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https begged to join him on this excursion on which he only intended to take his son john i promised to so and when the appointed day arrived i rode over to lasar accompanied by trusty and found the indian there whom i took mescalero though he stated himself to be shawnee we left lasar settlement at noon rode west toward the rio grande and crossed the hills on that river by path which i had not known before we passed the night on the banks of this river and on the next morning proceeded into the hills in direction the path to the great comfort of our horses wound along the without crossing any steep ascents and our indian guide appeared quite at home here he often left the main path and followed scarce visible tracks which always brought us back sooner or later to the main path while we had escaped steep hill or thick cedar coppice we found here too though many miles farther south traces of the forest ﬁre which tiger and i had occasioned against our will and many bare knolls rose between the cedar woods which had been robbed on that occasion of their leafy covering we passed the third night on the western slopes of these hills and on the next day reached their spurs whence we looked down on very extensive plain which appeared to be excellently watered and displayed rich tropical vegetation in its summer garb although these plants which belong to the real tropical region especially the varieties of the palm not attain such luxuriance and such gigantic size they farther south they still grow in these protected valleys very powerfully and surprise the traveller by their foreign but agreeable appearance we marched through the valley and camped the night at the foot of the hills bordering it on the west not far from which spot was said to be the ancient mine to which the indian promised to lead us on the following morning it was one of those mild southern spring nights when man feels beneath the vault of heaven that he is nowhere better in health or stronger than in the open air the odour of the ﬂowers had sunk upon the earth with the motionless air and the glistening insect world sparkled and ﬂashed like streams of diamonds from the dark shade of the evergreen shiny foliage lying round our small ﬁre we were soon lulled to sleep by the feathered songsters of the night among which the appealing to its mate was the most remarkable and we negligently allowed the last ﬂames to die out but at late hour we were startled by the roar of jaguar close to us and on awaking we recognised the sound of ﬂying horses we ran to our cattle and only found czar and john mare snorting and dragging at their bonds while the indian horse and lasar mule had bolted and we heard trusty barking down the glen we quickly blew up our ﬁre and threw fresh wood on it but the damage was done and we might reckon with certainty on the loss of one if not both beasts we spent the rest of the night on the watch and just day dawned and we had breakfasted i rode accompanied by trusty down the glen while john and the indian proceeded to the mountains in search of our fugitives only lasar remained in camp walking through the grass was too fatiguing him i followed the foot of the hills along which ran stream overshadowed by yuccas aloes gigantic cactuses palms and mimosas and had ridden about four miles following the tracking dog when the latter showed on the clayey bank on which grass grew the hoofmarks of our mule and the imprints of jaguar running down to the stream not long after on riding round projecting clump of shrubs i noticed in the grass lasar mule and upon it an enormous jaguar which appeared to be asleep its body lay stretched out and motionless i led czar back into the bushes and then crept down the stream nearer to the beast of prey until i concealed myself within shot in tuft of old mimosa trees from which i could survey it laying my riﬂe on low branch i aimed at the centre of the brute back which was turned toward its head rested on the mule i ﬁred the jaguar sprang up but fell on its side immediately and while uttering an awful roar looked about the valley in search of its assailant it was unable to rise on its and strove to drag itself on its forepaws to the adjacent water i had reloaded in the meantime and stepped out of my on to the grass plot the jaguar now saw its fury increas ed with every step i took and dragging itself toward it made the hills ring with its savage roars i walked pretty nearly up to it and put an end to its life with bullet through the head then i went to lasar mule whose belly was slit up and one of its legs devoured the jaguar must have caught it up while running on its croup i found numerous wounds where the beast had buried its the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https the jaguar disturbed at breakfast after taking the animal skin i rode back to camp and bore lasar the sad news which painfully affected him this mule was favourite of the whole family and its loss the more grieved him because it belonged to his wife and was always ridden by her it was not to be helped however and so when john and the indian returned with the horse we started the silver mine lasar saddled the indian horse and rode it while the latter walked ahead of us in about two hours we really arrived at an old deserted shaft into which we were able to go about ﬁfty paces then however it was blocked up and any farther advance was impossible in it we saw number of scattered pieces of ore and also found several of them under the turf at the entrance of the shaft which proved that long time must have elapsed since any works had gone on here we took good deal of the ore with us and after carefully noticing the bearings of the place we rode back to the valley from time to time making sketch of the localities so that we might ﬁnd them again hereafter on our homeward road the indian guide d us on foot so that we did not progress so rapidly but all that we got back without any misadventure and produced great grief in lasar family by the announcement of the death of the faithful mule the old gentleman was determined to take the requisite steps next year with the mexican government to buy the land on which the silver mine was and then set to work on it few days after my return to the fort i was surprised by an unexpected visit from my old acquaintance warden whom i had not seen long time and who declared that he could longer resist the desire of seeing again he had been living principally on the western side of the cordilleras and during his perilous hunting expeditions on the gela and the rio colorado had got far the gulf of california his powerful horse had been killed there in skirmish with the apaches and he had saved his own life under the greatest dangers after the savages had incessantly pursued him several weeks we again sat till far into the night and listened to the interesting stories of this daring man who had gained nothing by all his privations fatigue and frightful perils except the recollection of them but had thus perfectly carried out his sole object before he remained some weeks with us but then he felt compelled to leave this quiet life which he could not endur he saddled his horse in order to continue his solitary life on parting i made him present of brace of pistols which he was most grateful and he galloped over the prairie and disappeared from my sight on the horizon it was the last time i saw or heard of him i often asked western hunters about him but none could give any news of him and in all probability he at last met the fate which he seemed to desire and seek solitary death in the the project gutenberg ebook of the

xxx the pursuit l asar and i were occupied several weeks on the settlement of clifton and macdonnell and wilson the latter had arrived from geor gia with considerable fortune and numerous negroes and the three young men settled together on turkey creek in the neighbourhood of widow white we helped them by word and deed and in short time very large lot of ground was cleared and sown with maize although it was late in the year it and large garden laid out and the necessar y buildings erected at spot where very recently an axe had never been laid against tree or plough had turned furrow in the earth the three young men set eagerly about the heavy work which such new settlement demands and were busy the whole day in the garden or the ﬁeld or else in felling wood while doing so they often forgot that they and not we were now living on the outermost indian frontier and constantly went from home unarmed they went into the woods with an axe to fell trees or rode without any weapons into the prairie to drive home their milch kine or fetch their draught oxen lasar and i had frequently blamed them this negligence but it was of use and often when we visited them one or the other was away from home unarmed while we during the years that we had neighbours when working in the ﬁeld chained up our dogs round it in order to be informed of the approach of stalking indians and carried our riﬂes either on the plough or on our backs they ploughed and worked days without dog or any other weapon but their hands their dwelling stood on the south bank of the river where it joined the prairie but they had their ﬁeld on the northern side in wood which extended considerable distance at an early hour one morning they all three crossed the river with few negroes in order to thin the growing maize crop which operation is generally performed in the morning you are obliged to stoop constantly which is very fatiguing in the hot sun all three took their weapons into the ﬁeld and rested them against the fence they thought it too much trouble to carry them on their backs they followed the rows of maize one behind the other from one end of the ﬁeld to the other and were again nearing the spot where they had placed their riﬂes when suddenly some ﬁfty indians dashed over the fence with loud war yell and attacked them they could not think of ﬂight the indians surrounded them before they could recover from their ﬁrst terror resistance was equally impo ssible they were quite unarmed and hence the sole chance of escape lay in the mercy of the barbarians to whom they surrendered the two negroes were accidentally at the other end of the ﬁeld and at the ﬁrst glimpse of the indians leapt over the fence into the woods to save themselves by hiding in its recesses on looking round they saw that each of the three young men was surrounded by party of indians busied in tying his arms behind his back they ran through the wood to the river swam across it and on reaching the houses leapt with the other negroes on horses and mules ﬂed with the utmost speed toward the south across the prairie and reached my fort before sunset horriﬁed and half frightened to death the terrible news aroused all my people i at once sent negro to lasar to tell him of what had happened and at the same time beg him to join speedily possible in order to pursue the indians and if possible save the prisoners during which time we made our preparations immediate departure i had provisions got ready and packed on mule which this time was not faithful jack he had been galled by badly fastened saddle after this stock of ammunition was laid in and we sat down to supper which meal we had hardly ﬁnished when our friends from mustang creek eight in number galloped over the prairie led by old lasar himself who was ﬁre and ﬂame and vowed revenge like the youngest of us the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https königstein and one of the colonists of the name of lambert accompanied and we were soon ur ging our horses at full speed through the gloomy forest tiger led our party who trotted on long the moonlight lasted but then fell into walk and towards morning reached the deserted blockhouses of the prisoners we expected that the indians would have burnt them down but found them uninjured which prove d to us in what haste they must have departed with their quarry we rode through the river into the wood and found the spot where the savages had lifted their prisoners over the fence and led them to its northern end here we found the traces of numerous horses galloping in the direction of the northern mountains tiger examined all the signs very carefully and after we had followed the trail about an hour dismounted and sought about in the grass ere long he stretched out his arms and parted ﬁngers to the north and and told that the fellows we were pursuing had divided here and were pursuing different routes which fact i was also able to recognise after slight investigation i asked tiger what we were to but he laughed and joining his hands together and pointing to the north he stated that the indians would come together again on the other side of the mountains in two days we now followed trail which ran along and reached before sunset spot in valley covered with isolated rocks trees and bushes which was bordered on both sides by steep hills here tiger suddenly stopped and leapt from his horse i rode up to him and he showed on the bare rocks that several horses had left the track and turned off to the left down the glen he showed several pebbles which had been turned over by the horses and on the rocks the graze of their hoofs well here and there trampled leaf or broken blade of grass he followed this trail carefully and requested to follow him while making sign to the others to remain on the path few thousand yards farther on the track wound between large masses of stone till we reached clearing on the other side of which we found signs of an extinguished ﬁre near spring tiger picked up blackened bit of wood and showed by rubbing it with his ﬁnger that the wood was still wet and hence it lay in the open sunshine must have gone out shortly before he now begged to call up our comrades so that we might rest ourselves and our tired horses here little while i rode up to them and when we returned to tiger he showed us behind the spring the shambles where one of the unhappy prisoners had ended his life on large ﬂat stone we saw quantity of curdled dry blood and behind it lay the entrails of man round the stone we found marks of heels which had probably belonged to the murdered man and had been put on by one of the savages our fury against them was terrible and we would gladly have pursued them without resting had our horses been able to carry us but they were too tired and greatly required rest we supped and slept till near day and by dawn we were following the trail again along the path which we had quitted on the previous evening without halting longer than was necessary we rode hard all day through the most impassable regions of the san saba mountains and reached in the evening the prairies on their north side we were still on the same trail which had been made by ﬁve or six horses and unsaddled when the sun had long disappeared behind the hill and tiger was unable to follow the trail we had ridden very sharply so that our horses would hardly touch the good fodder here offered them and we had sooner watered them in an adjacent stream than they lay down in the grass with long breath and fell asleep we did not tie them up so that they might graze directly they awoke but kept up good ﬁre the whole night and posted sentinel at daybreak we were en route again and hurrying after tiger who led us along the foot of the mountains about noon we rode through one of the streams that ﬂow into the colorado and found in the wood on its bank deserted camp from which the fugitives could not be gone long the bushes and weeds trampled by the horses were not dry yet we merely watered our horses and then urged them on tiger believed that we must catch up the indians that same evening their horses were tired and did not raise their feet high from the ground evening arrived and in the distance another forest rose out of the prairie which we reached with night but our foe had gone farther on and we were compelled to halt again we could not follow their trail our guide consoled us with the morrow and said their horses could not last out any longer we rode the whole day however without seeing anything of the indians save the track of their horses about sunset we rode into another forest in which we hoped to ﬁnd running water we soon halted on its bank and noticed on the other side the last of the indians several of their ﬁres were still burning and tiger said that they now supposed themselves out of danger and would not ride so fast we crossed the stream in order to occupy the deserted camp but had scarce reached it when tiger called to and pointed to the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https with smooth shining bark the lower part of which was dyed with blood he told that one of the white men had been murdered here the indians had tied him up to the tree and ﬁred arrows at him and the bark displayed numerous marks of their points at the height of man the tree was sprinkled with blood and over it we found deep cut which appeared to have been made by tomahawk the indians seemed to have come together again here number of ﬁres had been lighted and the trampled ground indicated large troop of horses we all insisted on riding on at once but tiger reminded us that it was impossible to follow the trail and by overriding it we might easily lose much time and give the cannibals chance of escape our impatience had attained the highest pitch all were ready to start but it was still too dark we stood by our grazing cattle and counted the minutes till dawn appeared and allowed us to see the track of our enemies once more then we hastened on and joyfully greeted every thicket in front of us we hoped to ﬁnd the cannibals in it and be able to take vengea nce on them our friends our hopes were frequently disappointed and the sun was approaching the western hills when we still urged on our awfully tired horses following the trail of the indian horses which could not possibly be far from us their excreta on the path plainly indicated once again wood rose before us on the prairie but it was still so distant that we could not hope to reach it before dark tiger told that we must either ride very sharply so to reach the wood by daylight or camp on this side and approach the wood at dawn we should get the worst of it if we came upon the savages in the darkness we resolved on the former course and collected the last strength of our animals spurring and ﬂogging we went on at trot or gallop if certain of reaching our destination one of our friends might possibly be saved by few minutes sharp riding and so we paid heed to the fatigue and pace of our horses we rapidly approached the wood but so did the sun the hills which soon spread their lengthened shadow over the plain the country before us became more uneven and covered with large blocks of stones and here and there rose an isolated clump of trees and bushes while the forest appeared to be half an hour ride distant the darker it grew the sharper we rode and we dashed at gallop between the rocks toward patch of young oaks with tiger some distance ahead of us while galloping round some rocks i saw him suddenly turn his piebald towards us and halt in the clump of trees which we reached in few minutes and tiger informed us that the savages were sleeping great distance ahead on the barren bank of river our excitement was frightful trembling with eagerness we fastened our steaming horses to the long branches of the young oaks thrust our holster pistols in our belts and advanced leaving antonio with the horses silently and noiselessly after tiger when it had been arranged that i should give the signal general attack by ﬁring ﬁrst the moon was high but lighted us poorly the daylight however had not quite faded away when we emer ged from the rocks and reached small knoll over which we saw almost invisible columns of smoke rising at various points we spread out here in long line and crept up the hill covered by some isolated rocks when we reached the top we saw the savages about thirty yards from us collected round several ﬁres deadly silence brooded over the slightly illumined landscape which was only broken by the rustling of the rapid stream on whose banks the indians were encamped the glow of the ﬁres cast dark red reﬂection over the brown bodies of the reclining savages sufﬁcient to enable us to see them more distinctly while the light of the moon illumined the sights on our riﬂes all our barrels were pointed at the cannibals and we could hear our hearts beating while they did not suspect the approaching vengeance and were most of them asleep the wide chest of one of the rufﬁans was lit up by the ﬁre right in front of while he was gazing into the ashes with his head resting on his right arm the sight of my riﬂe was pointed at his heart when i pulled trigger at the same moment the riﬂes of all my comrades cracked and directly after we ﬁred our second barrels among the rising indians who moment raised their war yell but then ﬂed in great confusion and dashed into the river beneath the ﬁre of our revolvers and pistols in this faintly lighted scene of fury and terror the long red and white striped silk handkerchief on tiger head waved the broad blade of his heavy knife glistened in his right hand his shrill voice ﬁlled the ears of the cannibals with the war cry of the delawares and immediately after the ﬁrst shot he ﬂew worthy of his name among them and spread death among their ranks trusty too forgot his usual obedience and pinned one of the savages by the throat who had ﬁred an arrow at him he killed the indian in few minutes and then dragged him about in the grass satiating his fury in short time the battle ﬁeld was deserted by the enemy with the exception of wenty killed and wounded they left on it the latter of whom tiger soon sent to join the former with his tomahawk his war axe ﬂew from skull the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https and with every blow drove soul out of its earthly tenement after which he raised the hair of several whom he had killed in action the ﬁght was hardly over when familiar voice called several of our name s especially lasar mine and tiger it came from little way off the camp and reached us but faintly we ran in the direction and to our joyful surprise found macdonnell bound hand and foot lying on the grass behind rock his bonds were quickly cut but he was unable to get up we bore him to the nearest ﬁre blew it into bright ﬂame and now looked at the face of our poor friend who since his captivity had endured death in thousand shapes and envied his two comrades their release from torture he was so fatigued that he was unable to sit up the joy at our appearance and the fear lest we might go away again without ﬁnding him had given him the strength to raise his voice but now greater faintness naturally set in and he could scarce make signs to us to give him water the fresh draught was handed him then we laid him on bed made of buffalo skin and left him to sleep which with the consciousness that he was saved and among friends did him more good than anything else we could have offered him the large ﬁre lit up the plain around us and displayed the victims we had sacriﬁced to the blood of our friends farther on it shone on the great number of utterly exhausted indian horses most of which were lying fastened to lassos among the large stones in the grass although we did not apprehend any attack from the fugitive savages many of whom had doubtless killed themselves by leaping off the high banks into the river which dashed over rocks and who too possessed weapons that could be dangerous to us we still posted sentries on both sides of the camp and lit large ﬁres in order to be able to watch the horses it was very probable that the indians would attempt to recover them toward morning after the moon had gone down our own horses we tied up in the grass close to camp and then lay down by turns to rest far our state of excitement permitted it morning dawned without our having been disturbed and with the growing light we began to survey the ﬁeld of battle and investigate the details of the events of last evening the savages were tribe of mescaleros and we afterwards learned the same who had made the attack on white few months before among the dead was their chief who had been killed by the ﬁrst shot ﬁred which was the principal reason why the assailed did not offer greater resistance they only dischar ged few arrows one of which hit trusty while another passed through königstein thigh the weapons lay scattered about the on the lofty bank were distinct signs where the fugitives had leapt off it but we found below signs of them on the rocks jutting out of the river they had apparently fallen into the deep water between them all that there was doubt but that many had not reached the opposite bank alive the stream was too rapid man to swim across it our friend macdonnell still lay motionless asleep and we did not disturb him it was bright daylight when john lasar summoned us to the ﬁres of the savages where we found the roasted and bones of one of the murdered men while königstein discovered other remains of the dead bodies behind rock at about ten macdonnell woke and felt greatly strengthened we gave him food and cup of wine to drink but he was very weak and terribly excited so that we prohibited him from talking about his own sufferings or those of his own comrades about noon we prepared to start and carry off the horses of which we had captured among them being several animals tiger at once sought out the leader of the troop an old mare whose head and tail were hung with all sorts of ornaments and so soon he led it away all the others would follow it he bound the mare to tree let loose the other horses and wound the lassos round their necks upon which they all collected round the old mare we then saddled our horses selected the best saddle of the savages very handsome mexican one macdonnell put it on one of the captured horses which appeared and safe and covered it with buffalo hide large quantity of which we also found then we lifted our suffering friend on the horse tiger marched ahead of us leading the mare behind us by lasso and followe d by all the indian horses while we rode behind and drove on the laggards thus we rode slowly to the south and camped at sunset in narrow strip of wood on stream where we found good pasture the numerous horses we merely fastened up the leading mare and our own cattle near the ﬁre macdonnell rapidly recovered the ride had done him good and he was now able to walk again we made him soft bed by the side of the ﬁre and he told us the chief events of his captivity sooner had the savages seized the three young men in the ﬁeld than they bound them lifted them over the fence and then carried them to their horses here three indians took them before them and the whole band ﬂew out of the wood into the prairie where the savages the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https and went off in different directions macdonnell was taken off to the right with ten horsemen while lyons followed the path and clifton was carried to the left the savages rode without halting all that day and the next night with macdonnell without giving him water or food until they allowed their horses to graze few hours the next morning when they gave him some roast meat then they hurried on with him again and only stopped to water their horses until the latter toward evening refused to go any farther in spite of the incessant blows they unsaddled in wood by stream and roasted meat at ﬁre after laying him with his feet bound among the bushes his hands had swollen through the bonds and pained him terribly but his complaints and groans were unheed ed by the cannibals and it was only after long entreaty that they gave him drink of water toward morning they rode on and reached in few hours river on whose bank they unsaddled in thick wood and rested with the utmost carelessness while he was placed with his back against tree near the ﬁre soon after another troop of indians came up and macdonnell recognised the man who had given orders at the outset and whom he took the chief he was now wearing portion of lyons clothes and had put on his boots this savage brought his horse to the ﬁre and to his horror macdonnell saw the severed limbs of his unhappy companion hanging from the saddle which the indians now unfastened and threw near the ﬁre the savages then gathered together and the chief placed bits of the ﬂesh of the unfortunate lyons on spits and devoured them when roasted the indians seemed to pay attention to macdonnell but to listen to every sound and several times the chief laid his ear on the ground in order to hear more distinctly ere long other indians arrived and at noon the last of them with clifton he looked at macdonnell inquiringly but neither had the heart to utter word clifton feet were also bound and he was placed against tree while all the savages lay around the ﬁre and talked with much animation pointing ﬁrst to mac and then to clifton at last the chief stretched out his hand toward clifton and said several words in commanding voice upon which several men leaped up carried the prisoner to tree little lower down the wood and fastened him to it in standing position with leathern thongs most of the young indians in the meanwhile assembled with bows and arrows about ﬁfty yards from clifton and awaited the chief signal to commence ﬁring the signal was given and the ﬁrst arrow was buried in the entrails of the unhappy victim whose cries of agony made the forest ring thus one ﬁred after the other till clifton whole body was pierced with arrows and his head hung down upon which the chief leapt up swung his tomahawk over his head and hurled it at the murdered man it ﬂew into the tree close to clifton head and remained imbedded the chief went up to clifton plucked the hatchet out of the tree and buried it deeply in the unhappy man skull after this the cannibals fell upon the corpse which they cut up and each carried piece to the ﬁre macdonnell witnessed the whole fearful scene and now the chief came up to him and said something he did not understand while pointing to the north whence mac assumed that the same fate awaited him farther on in that direction the savages started again ere long and rode by shorter stages to the camp where we surprised them and where they had arrived but few hours before us this description had recalled to mac mind all the scenes of horror and he fell back exhausted on his bed we restored him with little and begged him to hold his tongue and rest while we got supper ready and looked after the horses during the night we posted four sentries and lit up the india n horses with large ﬁres it passed without disturbance and the next morning we continued our progress to the south we now made but short marches our own horses were very tired but the captured ones were so exhausted that we could hardly drive them on with long sticks we on several occasions unsaddled at noon because we found good pasturage on water and rested till the next morning so that we might not have to spend the night at worse the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https the torture one evening we found ourselves in the middle of an open prairie on which only isolated mosquito trees could be seen and camped at spot where there were several ponds and an old fallen lay which judging from the ﬁre marks had offered burning materials to earlier travellers across this plain the nearest woods to the south lay on the remotest horizon on the san saba mountains and we did not calculate on reaching them till the next day we lay in hollow of the prairie between two small elevations and fastened our and the leading mare to lassos driven into the ground while the captured horses grazed on the bottom the evening was splendid and mac was all right again we were in the best spirits after supper the conversation turned on the captured horses and we resolved to throw dice them the mare was allotted to without throwing i gave up my chance of all the rest ere long all the horses had owners antonio and lambert resolved to try theirs the next morning they were not very well mounted and everybody praised the good qualities of his horse and expounded how the animals must be treated and ridden to make of them thus the night arrived during which we again posted sentries on the nearest mounds but it passed without any alarm day dawned we blew up our ﬁre and got breakfast ready while the horses were grazing around us the sun rose while we were lying carelessly on our buffalo robes round the ﬁre and drinking coffee when suddenly fearful yell reached our ears over the next height and band of thirty horse indians thundered down the towards us waving in one hand their over their heads shaking in the other tin pots gourds and ﬁlled with pebbles and uttering the strangest and most awful yells in an instant the the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https us and dashed right through our ﬁre and camp they went over us like tornado and our terriﬁed horses which had torn themselves loose dashed over the prairie in front of them trailing the broken lassos after them before we had seized our riﬂes the indian s were so far off that the bullets we sent after them produced effect and we silently stared after them till they disappeared from sight over the last rising ground on the prairie we asked each other with our eyes what was to be done but one was yet able to speak the fright and the heavy loss had fallen upon us too unexpectedly and it was long ere we could think of the immediate future at length all eyes were turned to if i could help them this conﬁdence restored my power of speech and i told my companions in misfortune that i was able to lead them home without horses and that macdonnell life was worth more than our animals i had hardly spoken to this effect when königstein shouted to and pointed in the direction where the horses had disappeared and though it was so far off i recognised czar and the cream colour ﬂying over the prairie pursued by ﬁve indians i ran towards them fast my legs would carry and ﬁred bullet at the indians long out of range but which they must have heard pinging they gave up their pursuit and merely ﬁred few harmless arrows after the horses which now dashed up to and stopped panting and snorting czar came up to and laid his head on my shoulders while looking round in wild terror after his pursuers i led him into camp where both the horses were greeted with loud shouts of joy we now held grand council and soon agreed to cache our baggage in hollow near at hand cover it with turf and then start home on foot in which of course we could only cover short distances at the same time we arranged that lasar should ride the cream colour and mac czar while we also packed our food on the animals the whole day passed before we had cached our baggage so that we slept another night at this inhospitable spot the next morning we saddled and packed and after carefully taking the direction of the nearest tree with the compass we began our wearisome journey on reaching the tree we blazed it with knife and then started another and so on carefully marking each so that we might be able to ﬁnd our way back to our traps from tree to tree the road to the san saba mountains through the tall prairie grass was one of the unpleasantest i ever followed there however the ground though hilly and stony was still adapted human feet and we soon grew accustomed to walking tiger had not word to say himself he was revolving vengeance on the lepans who had stolen his faithful piebald and swore that the delawares should take many of their scalps in return after several weeks of unspeakable fatigue and privation we at length arrived one evening at widow white who received us with great cordiality and delight we at once sent her son to the fort to fetch riding horses all of us we had had quite enough walking and stopped the while with our kind hostess late the next evening the horses arrived from the leone we let them rest the night and on the next morning said to the widow and started home which we reached at an early hour and found horses there lasar and his companions to carry them at once to mustang river the loss of lasar handsome horse and of john mare again caused fresh sorrow in the family with whom they had been favourites but i willingly put up with the loss of my two horses and mules and considered myself remarkably fortunate in recovering czar and the cream colour the last lesson whic h we gave the mescaleros seemed to have had an intimidating effect on the indians generall y we neither saw nor heard anything of them several months tiger during this period rode splendid black horse of mine which i had been always obliged to leave at home it was too timid and impetuous hunting purpo ses now that it was ridden daily it became horse and tiger often said that it was better than his piebald great was my surprise when tiger knocked up early one morning and on going out of my house i saw the piebald quietly grazing on waking tiger had found it tied up in front of his tent and told that the lepans were frightened because his tribe would come in the autumn and learn their hostile behaviour with sad look he remarked that he would now be obliged to give back the black horse he supposed and was quite beside himself with joy when i told him that i made him present of it in the course of the summer friendly indians visited but never stopped long and gave to understand that i lived too much among the white men it would be much better to move nearer to them and then they would visit more frequently thus arrived one evening just before sunset my old friend pahajuka accompanied by his good old squaw and his granddaughter and few comanches the joy of the old folk was great and they said that had not the white men blocked the road to they would willingly stay some time with but the project gutenberg ebook of the backwoodsman or life on the indian frontier edited by sir lascelles wraxall https was we were daily more separated tahtoweja said nothing but her black eyes plainly expressed that she too felt happy at being with again she could not in her silent admiration gaze sufﬁciently at the decorations of my room and hours she would gaze at the pictures on the walls or turn over the sketches in my portfolio when business prevented from being with her music seemed to be her deligh t and she often came late at night into the gallery and begged to play the guitar when she seemed to fall into happy dreamy state and entirely forget the world she too begged to come away from among the pale faces and settle nearer to them the comanches loved more than they did the people remained some weeks with but one morning they came into my room and the old lady said with tears that this was the last visit they would pay the road to was growing too narrow i was obliged to promise them visit at the parts where the buffalo still grazed and the antelopes and stags had not so many feet here after breakfast i saddled czar and rode with my guests to the mountain springs where we spent the night and the next morning we took leave of one another i promised to join them the next winter on the puerco when great council of the comanches was to take place they often looked with tears in their eyes in the direction of the fort then they offered their hand once again and rode off never again to cross the threshold of my house to whic h they were so attached tiger too seemed dissatisﬁed at the new settlements and could not understand how people could have an objection to his pulling down the fences and riding across the ﬁelds to save distance they had also forbidden him taking dry corn leaves his horse out of the stacks or fastening his piebald to the grand stockade in front of the house while he went in to beg drink of water what i had long foreseen happened he was beginning to feel the trammels of civilization and wrestled against them while its comforts still attracted him shortly after pahajuka departure tiger tribe arrived in the neighbourhood of the fort and the chief paid visit with several of his warriors he told that tiger wished to go home with them in order to see his relations and return to in the following spring though i felt sorry it i saw that he could not remain much longer in our settlement without parting from us on unfriendly terms hence i offered objection and on the day of their departure i accompanied them far widow white i wanted to pay visit to mac on mustang river i took hearty farewell of tiger i was really attached to him and he was obliged to promise visit ere long the next day i rode to macdonnell when i found everything prospering his ﬁeld had produced rich maize crop and was now covered with beans potatoes melons gourds his orchard already contained ﬁne young trees his garden supplied him and his negroes with magniﬁcent vegetables the yard round his house was crowded with poultry of every description and the interior of his blockhouse was very neat and tidy large new patchwork quilt was thrown on his bed over the mantelpiece was handsome and by its side hung the framed portraits of three men which are very frequently found in frontier houses and by which the americans not pay themselves the worst compliment they represent the greatest the best and the most useful men of our ashington alexander von humboldt and liebig the now frequently traversed road from turkey creek to the leone shortened the distance between the two rivers much the greater portion of it could be galloped over i reached the fort again at
