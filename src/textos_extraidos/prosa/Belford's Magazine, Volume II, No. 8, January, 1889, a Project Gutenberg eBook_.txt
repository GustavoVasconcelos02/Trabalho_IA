harmonies in the songs of liberty and when tyranny opposed force to the righteous demands of constitutional government ploughshares rusted in the neglected ﬁelds workshops looked to alien lands toilers while patriots answered the and nation was freed from an eating cancer but what was the return such sacriﬁces surely if ever were soldiers entitled to fair and full reward it was those who responded to the repeated call of lincoln aid in suppressing the most gigantic rebellion of in the form of driblets of charity doled with cunning arts to secure their submission to extortions not offered bribe to unblushing perjury and denied to honest suffering but simple and exact justice involving full performance of national obligation in return the stipulated dischar ge of the duty of citizenship the simple statement of facts of history will serve to expose the methods of those who pose par excellence the soldiers friends and the defenders of national faith the soldiers who enlisted in the war of the rebellion were promised by the government in addition to varying bounties stipulated sum of money per month it requires argument to prove that the faith of the government was much pledged to the citizen who risked his life to him who merely risked portion of his wealth in secured loan to the government but the record shows that the pay of the former was reduced by nearly sixty per cent while the returns of the latter were doubled trebled and quadrupled that in many cases government obligations were closed by the erection of cheap tablet over dead hero while the descendants of bondholders were guarded in an undisturbed enjoyment of the fruits of their ancestors greed after the armies were in the ﬁeld the same legislative enactment that reduced the value of the soldier s pay increased that of the creditor s bond by providing that the money of the soldier should be rapidly depreciated in value while the interest upon bonds should be payable in coin and then after the war was over another and more valuable bond was prepared that should relieve the favored creditor of all fear of losing his hold upon the treasury by the payment of his debt that the purpose of the lawmakers was deliberate was exposed in speech by senator sherman who was chairman of the finance committee of the senate while the soldiers in the trenches were being robbed in the interest of the creditors at home in reviewing the ﬁnancial policy of his party during the war sherman said in speech in the senate july 14th 1868 footnote congressional record page 4044 it was then our policy during the war to depreciate the value of united states notes so that they would come into the treasury more freely our bonds why sir we did very natural thing us to we increased the amount to then to and we took away the important privilege of converting them into bonds on the ground that while this privilege remained the people would not subscribe the bonds and the notes would not be converted that the right man might exercise at any time he would not exercise at page of our national history contains more damning record of injustice than this sherman recognizes and admits that the notes issued and paid to the soldiers and producers of the country were fundable at the holder s option in government bearing bond he confesses to the foreknowledge that in nullifying this right the value of the notes would be decreased and to that extent the soldiers pay be diminis hed organ of public opinion raised the cry of breaking the plighted faith of the nation the soldier had organ then but years after the wrong had been perpetrated there appeared in spaulding s history of the currency the naïve statement it never seemed quite right to take away this important privilege while the notes were outstanding with this endorsement upon by law passed against the protests of the wisest and most patriotic members of the popular branch of congress it had been provided that these government notes so soon to be further depreciated in value should be full legal tender to the nation s defenders but only rags in the hands of the fortunate holder of obligations of the government upon which they were based and into which they were fundable at the option of the holder in one of his reports while secretary of the treasury hon hugh mcculloch showed that fully thirty per cent of belford magazine volume ii 8 january 1889 project gutenberg ebook https of supplies furnished the government was due to the depreciation of the currency the initial step in such depreciation being the placing of the words except duties on imports and interest on the public debt in the law and upon the back of the notes but having provided that one class of the government creditors should be secured against the evil effects of depreciated currency those friends of the soldiers and defenders of the nation s honor proceeded to systematic course of depreciation of the currenc y while the soldiers were too busy ﬁghting and the citizens too earnest in their support of the government to criticize its acts during the war the sentiment was carefully inculcated that opposition to the republican party or its acts was disloyalty to the government copperheadism treason and protests against any of its legislation were answered with an epithet it so happened that very little contemporary criticism was indulged in from wholesome fear of social or business ostracism or the frowning portals of fort lafayette but from the very commencement of the war there had been felt at washington strong controlling inﬂuence emanating from the money centres the issue of the demand notes of the government during the ﬁrst year had furnished portion of the revenues required and had served to recall the teachings of the earlier statesmen and the demonstr ations of paper money bottomed on taxes would prove great blessing to the people and just exercise of governmental functions this was only too evident to those controlling ﬁnancial operations at the great money centres the nation was alive to the necessities of the government the people answered the calls troops with such promptness to block the channels of transportation often drilling in camp without arms awaiting production from the constantly running armories those camps represented the people from them all eyes were bound to the source of supply of the munitions of war in them all hearts burned the time action even though that meant danger and death there were other camps from which greed looked with far different motives the issue of their own promissory notes based upon possibility of substituting conﬁdence coin had proven in the past of vast proﬁt to the of the great money centres the exercise of that power by the government would inevitably destroy one great source of their proﬁts and transfer it to the people sixty millions of the people s own notes circulating among them money withstanding the effect of the suspensio n of specie payments by both the banks and the national treasury was forceful lesson to all classes to the people it brought strong ray of hope to brighten the darkness of the war cloud to some among the metropolitan bankers who in after years prated so loudly of their patriotism and ﬁnancial sagacity it brought to view only the danger of curtailed proﬁts the government treasury was empty troops in the ﬁeld were unpaid and uncomplaining merchants furnishing supplies seriously embarras sed the lack of money in the channels of trade the sixty millions of demand notes were absorbed by the nation s commerce like summer storm on parched soil under such circumstances at the urgent request of the secretary of the treasury the ways and means committee of the house of representatives framed bill authorizing the issue of one hundred and ﬁfty millions of bonds and the same amount of treasury notes the latter to be full legal tender and fundable in an bond at the option of the holder the contest between the popular branch of the government and the senate upon this measure forms one of the most interesting and instructive lessons of the ﬁnancial legislation of the nation in the senate bitter and determined opposition to the clause was develo ped the associated banks of new york had adopted resolution that the treasury notes of the government should only be received by the different banks from their custome rs special deposit to be paid in kind and it was one of the lessons of the war that notices containing the announcement above quoted remained posted in the new york banks until high premium on those very notes over the dishonored greenbacks caused shrewd depositor to demand of the bank his deposits in kind the demand was settled by delivery of greenbacks which were full legal tender the purpose and the notices suddenly disappeared the compromise effected between the two houses result ed in the issue of the emasculated greenback and it also led the way to the establishme nt of belford magazine volume ii 8 january 1889 project gutenberg ebook https banking system and the issue of the promissory notes of the banks to be used money much of the force of all criticism of the system so devised has been weakened by the fact that the attack has been aimed at the banks themselves and not against one special feature of the system in explanation though not in excuse this should be stated the fact that every issue of the annual ﬁnanc report of the government contained the special pleadings of the comptrollers of the currency concealing some facts misstating others and creating thereby the impression that they were endeavoring to win the favor of the banking institutions added to this were the efforts of those controlling the national bank in the great money centres to secure permanency of the feature of their system after very general public sentiment against it had been aroused and even after its evil effects had been felt by small er banks located among and supported more directly by the producing classes but now when the discussion is removed from the arena of politics when the volume of the system is rapidly disappearing and when many of the best and strongest banks are seeking to be relieved from the burden of it is opportune to discuss calmly and without prejudice the wisdom of the original acts and their ef fects upon the country it has been claimed that by the organization of the national banks the government was enabled to dispose of its bonds and aided in carrying on the war the facts warrant the claim all national bank notes have been redeemable solely in treasury notes they not possess the qualiﬁcation equal to the treasury note and can not therefore be considered any better than the currency in which they are alone redeemable and in comparison with which they have less uses these are truths that were just palpable years ago it follows that the issue of the bank notes did not furnish any better form of currency than that which came directly from the government to the people every dollar of such notes issued contributed just much towards an inﬂation of the currency the issue of an equal amount of treasury notes with these facts in mind review of the organization of the banks and their issue of notes will reveal the ef fect of such acts in 1864 the notes of the government had been depreciated to such an extent that coin was quoted at premium ranging from 80 per cent to 150 per cent the record of single bank organized and issuing notes under such circumstances is illustrative of the whole system take bank with one hundred thousand dollars to invest in government bonds basis its issuance of currency the bonds were bought with the depreciated treasury notes deposited with the comptroller of the currency at washington the bank receive d ninety thousand dollars of notes to issue money it also received six thousand dollars in coin one year s advance interest upon its deposited bonds under the law of march 17 this coin not being available use money was sold or conver ted into treasury notes at ratio of from two to two and half one the bank therefore had received working cash capital sum in excess of the money invested in its bonds the transaction stands follows invested in bonds received notes to issue received coin equal to say bank gains by transaction from this it will appear that the bank has the use currency of more than the amount of its bonds while the government is to pay in addition six per cent per annum on the full amount of bonds so long the relations thus created continue surely argument is needed to prove that if the government had issued the in the form of treasury notes and had paid out the interest money its current obligations there would have been greater inﬂation of the currency more uniform currency would have been maintained and saving effected of the entire amount of interest paid belford magazine volume ii 8 january 1889 project gutenberg ebook https held security of national bank notes which at this date would amount to sum nearly representing the total bonded debt of the country but there remains still more serious charge to be made against this system defended war measure by which the banks were to aid the government in conquering the rebellion the fact remains that at the date of lee s surrender only about of bonds had been accepted by the banks even though they received bonus the act but after the war had closed and the government was with one hand contracting the volume of its own circulating notes by funding them into bonds the banks were allowed to inﬂate the currency by the further issue of over of their notes time may produce sophist cunning enough to devise an adequate defence or apology such legislation his work will only be saved from public indigna tion and rebuke when continued series of outrages shall have dulled the national intelligence and destroyed the national honor but there came time when the policy of the government was radically changed the soldiers had conquered peace thought they had they marched in review before their commander had been paid off in crisp notes of the legal tender to the soldier but not to the bondholder the time government to pay the soldiers had ceased the national banks had been allowed to show their patriotism and their willingness to aid the government overthrow rebellion already conquered by the issuance of their notes to add to an inﬂated and depreciated currency the soldiers had returned to the arts of peace and had taken their places producers of the nation s wealth and taxpayers to the national treasury then sherman with his brother patriots and statesmen discovered that the country meaning of course the bondholders was suffering under the evils of depreciated currency their tender consciences had never suffered twinge while the soldiers were receiving from the government currency depreciated in value the result of its own acts but when the soldier became the taxpayer and from his toil was to be obliged to pay the bondholder then the patriotic hearts of sherman and his in the dominant political party trembled at the thought of soldier being allowed to dischar ge his obligations in the same kind of money he had received his services recipient of the government dole paper money purposely depreciated was quite sufﬁcient from the citizen by the product of whose toil bonded debt was to be paid honest money was to be demanded it required argument to conv ince the government creditor that this was step in his interest and public clamor was hushed with the catchwords of honest money and national honor while driblets of pensions were allowed to trickle from rivers of revenue the nero of rome had been excelled by his christian successor and the dumb submission of ancient slaves became manly independence in contrast with modern stupidity by the passage of the act in march 1869 it was provided that all bonds of the government except in cases where the law authorizing the issue of any such obligation has expressly provided that the same may be paid in lawful money or other currency than gold and silver should be payable in coin this act was denounced by both morton and stevens fraud upon the people in that it made new contract the beneﬁt of the bondholder the injustice of the act could have been determined upon the plainest principles of equity if the bonds were payable in coin there was need its passage if they were not so payable there could be excuse it if there existed doubt sufﬁciently strong to require such an act it was clearly an injustice to ignore the rights of the many in the interests of the few but the men who had not scrupled to send to the soldiers in the trenches and coin to the plotters in the rear had consciences to be troubled they had dared to pay to the soldiers the money of the nation and then rob them of of it under color of law and now needed only to search methods not excuses political exigencies must be guarded against the public must be hoodwinked the soldier element placated with pension doles the ﬁrst essential was to stiﬂe public

man than horatio seymour was at the head of the oliver morton the governor of indiana had been equally vigorous in his language and practical politicians foresaw that even pennsylvania and indiana

could discuss this with the calmness with which we should view all great ﬁnancial the hint was taken the contest of 1868 was fought under seeming acquiescence in the views of stevens and morton the dear people were hoodwinked with coined to deceive and new lease of power was secured by false pretence but when the excitement of the election had passed and there was longer any danger of injuring the republican party all discussion was stiﬂed and the ﬁrst act signed by the newly elected president was that which had been laid aside that season of calmness with which we should view all great

the value of the one and to perpetuate the payment of the other to this end silver was demonetized by trick in the revision of the statutes reducing the volume of coin and decreasin g the probability of rapid bond payments then the volume of the paper currency was contracted by systematic course of substituting bonds currency and the ﬁrst chapter of ﬁnancial blunders and crimes of the wall street

amount of the public debt free gift to the creditor might have caused such clamor would have forever driven from power its authors and have silenced the claims of modern republicans that they were the sole friends of the soldier and defenders of national honor but the ﬁnancial legislation of the republican party has done more and worse than this its every act has been in the interest of favored class and direct and ﬂagrant robbery of the producing masses it has won the support of corporate monopoly by blind submission to its demands and with brazen audacity sought and obtained the operation

with the brilliance and beauty of the full bloom this was the this is the present and reaching up the man suddenly snapped off the glowing blossom from the cactus and held it before the girl close to the pale camellia bud he had plucked before she raised her beautiful face crowned with its glory of hair full to him and the expression it took was graver and more womanly than before but still

luckier not replying it may be that the destiny which we are told shapes our ends did not leave his so it might have he himself could scarcely have told what thoughts were framing themselves in his mind what words had almost formed themselves on his tongue there are moments in life when we live at the rate of hours and van morris was certainly going the pace mentally those ten seconds of silence

risen after picking up the dropped fan with not effortless grace and now stood smiling with rather meaningless if measureless good nature upon the invaders and van morris was all pose and savoir faire once more he might have been examining blanche on her progress in algebra all the consciousness in his manner he complimented miss wood on her peculiarly deft management of that dangerous weapon the

windows slanted athwart the frosty darkness punctuated by ﬂaring of street lamps not infrequent groups of mufﬂed jovial with reminiscent scenes of pleasure left behind and some hilarious from what they brought along with him he strode rapidly along the echoing ﬂags too intent on his own thoughts to notice any of them suddenly from beneath one of the gloom punctuators opposite woman s voice cut

of society and whose unsteady hold of their own legs that they had had just little too much of it barred the way of young girl tall slight and with mass of blonde hair escaping from the rough shawl she drew closer about her head she shrank back there was something showing through her womanly terror that spoke convincingly the gentlewoman the trio chuckled inanely making elaborate bows and the girl shivered she shrank further into the shadow and repeated piteously please let pass won t you certainly they will van answered stepping up on the pavement and taking her in at glance am i not right gentlemen he added urbanely to the unsteady trio not by damned sight who the devil are you were the prompt and simultaneous rejoinders that doesn t matter van answered quietly but you are obstructing the public streets and frightening this evident stranger we don t know any stranger at two clock in the morning was the illogical rejoinder of the third youth who clung to the what about it anyway said the stoutest of the three advancing towards morris you know her you evidently not van replied then he turned to the girl with the deference he would scarce have used to the leader of

little hand into his arm the leader of the trio staggered step nearer you re nice masher he said thickly but if it s row you re looking you can ﬁnd one pretty quick morris glanced at the man with genuine pity you look though you might be gentlemen when you are sober he said i am not looking row and if you boys make one you ll only be more ashamed of yourselves on christmas day than you should

other half lives then he turned and strode rapidly homeward pulling hard he thought many strange thoughts on the dead cigar between his lips once in his own parlor van morris walked straight to the mirror over the mantel and looked long and steadily at himself then he tossed allmand s cigar contemptuously into the grate lit one he selected carefully from the carved stand near and threw himself into before the ruddy glow of coals i must be getting old he soliloquized i didn t use to get bored so easily by these things either balls are not what they were or i am not now there s place like

wide blue eyes were glory of purity and trust and they were the eyes of blanche allmand then he rose abruptly walked to the sideboard and ﬁlled glass with water then he placed carefully in it the cactus ﬂower and camelia bud which had never left his hand since he plucked them in the conservatory he did so morris face grew serious and looked down wistfully into the ﬁre when he raised his eyes

next room he was aroused from dreams of blanche allmand music diamond solitaires and blossoms mixed into one sweet confusion stop your row can t you and go to bed you go to bed yo sef responded the illogical andy rising not too steadily on his one boot and throwing wide the who wants to go to bed i sha n you re an idiot muttered mr morris and he turned his face to the wall guess am an idiot

and succeeded in landing plump on the centre of his friend s person confound you gasped the latter breathless y re drunk fool i ain t chuckled andy imperturbably happy then he laughed till the bed

andy s mixed burgundy and champagne punch contradiction but made him insist more strongly that he was engaged to the old campaigner whom morris had so manœuvred to outﬂank finally in miscellaneous outﬁt of evening pants and he succeeded in getting the jubilant groom in futur into bed where he still hummed at the secret of happiness until he collapsed with sudden snore and slept like the swiss then morris walked the ﬂoor rapidly wrapped in thought and cloud of fragrant cigar smoke then he threw himself once more into the and gazed long and earnestly into the coals heavy frown resting on his face suddenly it cleared off the sunshine of broad smile took its place and van tossed the end of his cigar exultingly into the ﬁre then he rose and stretched himself like veritable son of anak when stalwart they court the rapture of the i have it by geor ge he cried i ll get the poor fellow out of this box if the old girl did induce him to pop and accepted him out of hand andy i say andy wake up

himself bah the girl has heart blanche echoed van in dazed sort of way why you don t suppose blanche will know it i never thought of her and he rose feebly and stood shivering in his ghostly attire why of course rose wood couldn t keep such great news why man you re the capital prize in the matrimonial lottery but hang if miss wood shan t draw another blank this time there was compound of deadly nausea and effortful dignity in the elbows andrew browne leaned upon the mantel which hinted volumes what his face might have said had it been visible through the ﬁngers latticed over it i am

you sleep yourself sober morris stood many minutes by the bedside of his friend but when he turned into the parlor again his face was pale and stern the way of the world always he said aloud one inanely eager another stupidly backward fools rush in where angels fear to tread poor boy he d give much morrow to unsay his words i would to have spoken those i nearly said last night the chill gray dawn outside was wrestling at the windows entrance with the sickly glaring within morris drew aside the heavy curtains and pressed his forehead against the pane long he looked out into the gray haze with eyes that saw nothing beyond his own thoughts then he turned to the ﬁre again the gray ash was hiding the glow of the spent coals then he took up the glass once more and looked earnestly at the contrasted ﬂowers it held he replaced it almost tenderly and walked slowly to his own room yes i know myself he said i think i know her i ll hesitate longer some fool may rush shall settle it the

keen to let him leave their rooms he had even resisted the temptations of gossip at the club and was smoking his ﬁfth smile wreathing his the chime of six startled him suddenly to his feet how time

greatly and the deep strong light came back into his eyes how ceaselessly that old verse comes back to and now to put it to the test he turned to his escritoire and took small russia case from the

that might have worn them haunted the place set of armor that stood in one corner clanked though the spirit of some dead paladin had entered it and was striving to stalk forth and battle with the demons of the storm while the gust that had occasioned all this commotion in the little shop went careering through the rooms at the rear causing papers to ﬂy doors to slam and sweet voice to exclaim why father what is the matter nothing my dear it is only the wind answered the old man he advanced to receive his visitors the one with whom he was acquainted nodded familiarly to the pawnbroker while he of the rueful countenance pulled of f his ulster and threw it on the counter saying how much will you give on that rumble who was large man rather ﬂeshy and slow of movement started toward the back of the shop with lazy roll like ship under half sail he made tack around the end of the counter and hove to behind it opposite the men who had just come in he pulled his spectacles down from the top of his bald head where they had been resting drew the coat toward him looked at it an instant then raised his eyes till they met those of his customer how much you think it is worth he said uttering the words slowly and casting commiserating glance at the form of the man before him i paid twenty dollars it said the young man it is worth ten dollars isn t it oh yes returned the pawnbroker shall i loan you ten dollars on it if you please answered his customer whose face brightened when he heard the pawnbroker s words he had thought he might get ﬁve dollars on the ulster the prospect of getting ten made him feel like man of afﬂuence the pawnbroker opened book and began to ﬁll the blanks in one of the many printed slips it contained one of the blanks he ﬁlled with his customer s name james teague that was his real name not the one by which he was known to the stage and to fame that was far more aristocratical rumble handed teague the ticket and the ten dollars he took stealthy survey of his slender and form then glanced toward the window on which great ﬂakes of snow were constantly beating driven against it by the wind that howled ﬁendishly it went through the street playing havoc with shutters and making the swingi ng boards creak uncannily mr dixon said the pawnbroker turning to teague s companion will not you and your friend wait awhile until the storm slackens it is pleasanter here by the ﬁre than it is his visitors agreed with him and accepted his invitation they seated themselves beside the stove which stood in the center of the room and from which through little plates of isinglass shone cheerful light from bed of ﬁery coals both leaned back in their chairs belford magazine volume ii 8 january 1889 project gutenberg ebook https turned the palms of their hands toward the stove to receive the grateful heat and when the old pawnbroker joined them smiling genially he sank into his great chair which seemed to have been made expressly his capacious form the same thought came to both of his guests to this thought dixon gave expression mr rumble he asked how happened it that you became pawnbroker well i might say that it was by chance replied rumble i was not bred to the i thought not answered dixon he and his friend exchanged knowing glances i was weaver by trade continued rumble and until two years ago worked at that calling in england where i was born but i made little money at it and when an aunt at her death left ﬁve hundred pounds i decided to come to this country and go into new but what put it into your head to choose that of pawnbroker asked dixon because everybody told that larger proﬁts were made in it than in any other you see i am getting on in years and i have daughter whom i must provide when i die i want to leave her enough to make her the street door was opened and moment the room was made decidedly uncomfortable by cold blast accompan ied by driving snow again the windows rattled the armor clanked and the hanging suits swung and shook their armless sleeves in the air tall slight young man clad in black clothes stood by the door although his beardless pale face was the face of youth it was not free from the marks of care and in his large lustrous dark eyes there was yearning look that spoke plainly words of desires unfulﬁlled dixon and teague exchanged glances which much said here s another customer the pawnbroker is miss rumble in said the newcomer in hesitating manner he turned toward the old pawnbroker you wouldn t have her out on such night would you maxwell said rumble laughing she is in the he added pointing to the rear go right but maxwell did not go right in he knocked lightly at the door which in moment was opened by young woman whose girlish face and willowy ﬁgure presented vision of loveliness to those in the outer room maxwell disappeared in the sitting dixon and his friend again exchanged glances which showed that they had changed their opinion in regard to the newcomer s relations with the pawnbroker well asked teague have the proﬁts in this business met your expectations i have not been in it long enough to tell i have not had an auction replied rumble in one respect however i have been disappointed very few articles on which i have loaned money have been redeemed i don t understand perhaps you are too liberal with your customers said dixon you would not have be mean with them would you answered rumble why you know they must be in very strait ened circumstances to come to if i took advantage of people s poverty i would expect that after their death all the old women who have pawned their shawls with would send their ghosts back to haunt well i never thought of that murmured dixon if their ghosts come back what very lively times some pawnbrokers must have but if your customers not redeem their goods how you expect to get your money back asked belford magazine volume ii 8 january 1889 project gutenberg ebook https from auctions replied the pawnbroker oh was teague s response you should have good auctioneer said dixon the goods will bring fair return replied rumble quietly although it was apparent that the pawnbroker had begun to mistrust his methods of doing business it was also evident that he had great faith in auctions he had attended auctions in his time and had bid on articles only to see them go beyond the length of his modest purse now he said to himself the auctioneer would be on his side the bidding would go up and up and up and every bid would bring just so much more money into his pocket altogether he was well satisﬁed the faces of his guests showed that they at once admired and pitied the old man they admired his generosity and his faith in human nature and wished that other pawnbrokers with whom they had dealt had been like him they pitied him they knew that he would have rude awakening from his dream when the hammer of the auctioneer knocked down his goods and his hopes of getting back the money he had loaned on them it is time we were going said dixon at last his eyes fell on tall hall clock that stood in corner quietly marking the ﬂight of time well then let us go answered teague he cast dismal look at the windows against which the snow was still driven in volleys by the wind that howled loudly ever it was the pawnbroker s turn to pity his visitors i am afraid you will take cold going from this warm room out into the storm he said to teague let lend you an overcoa you see i have more here than i have any use he added jocosely oh i could not think of letting you lend one exclaimed teague blushing probably the ﬁrst time in his life dixon laughed quietly he enjoyed his friend s confusion while the pawnbroker looked among his stock coat that would ﬁt teague presently he advanced with one which he held out with both hands he said let help you put it teague protested why you can bring it back when you come this way added rumble but how you know i will bring it back said teague i am stranger to oh your friend is good surety you replied the pawnbroker he is one of my few customers who have redeemed their thundering blast struck the house the wind beat at the windows though it meant to smash them the sound of the tempest persuaded teague to accept the pawnbroker s offer without another word he caught the edge of either sleeve with his ﬁngers and put his arms out behind while rumble put the overcoat on him his arms however never found the ends of its capacious sleeves it was almost large enough man of twice teague s size dixon had ﬁt of laughter at his friend s expense and even the pawnbroker could not forbear smile it is rather large you isn t it said rumble let us try another and then he added why your own ﬁts you best of then seizing teague s ulster which still lay on his counter he threw it over its owner s shoulders and bade the two men hearty they went forth into the belford magazine volume ii 8 january 1889 project gutenberg ebook https he had succeeded in closing the door in the face of the tempest he turned the key in the lock and then with shiver returned to the ﬁre he stood before the stove he smiled and seemed to be chuckling over the thought that he had made teague wear his own coat his face wore happy look he had clear conscience he knew that he was philanthropist in small way and had helped many poor soul when the light of hope was burning dimly but he took credit to himself this the opportunity of doing little good had come in his way and he had not let it pass that was all beside s he often said he expected to make money in his business he simply conducted it on more liberal principles than most pawnbrokers when he went into it he was told that large proportion of pawnbrokers customers never redeemed their pledges and that by advancing on goods pawned only small percentage of their value great deal of money was made in the sale of unredee med articles he thought therefore that it was only just to loan on whatever was broug ht to him nearly much money he deemed it would bring at auction to anything less would in his opinion have been to cheat his customers besides if he loaned more money on goods in proportion to their value than other pawnbrokers his return in interest was also greater when the goods were redeemed this was the peculiar princip le on which he did business and it is needless to say that he did very large business much to the disgust of all other pawnbrokers having shops in his neighborhood it was not strange therefore that he stood before the ﬁre on that new year s eve the face of old john rumble wore conten ted smile the knowledge of having done good brings content if it brings nothing else and the pawnbroker knew that he had done well by his customers and he thought also that his customers had done well by him he surveyed his full shelves while he stood there musing the door of the was opened and his daughter appeared come father said the girl if you don t hurry you will not have the punch ready by the old man s face assumed an anxious expression and he started with roll the not to have the punch ready to drink in the new year at the stroke of midnight would indeed be calamity he had never failed to welcome the new year with brimming cup his father had done so before him his daughter had done so with him and he hoped his grandchildren would so after him bring the fanny he said he went to cupboard and took out big black bottle his daughter brought him an blue china bowl and hot water and while he made the punch maxwell told him of his plans the coming year about which he had been talking with fanny arthur maxwell who was had been followed by some time indeed he made rumble s acquaintance in purely business way but he called it good fortune that had led him to the pawnbroker s door otherwise he would not have known fanny and now fortune seemed really to smile on him he had secured position with railroad company and was going to colorado an assistant of its chief engineer who had char ge of the construction of railway there and then hesitating he told the old man that fanny had promised to be his wife soon he could provide home her the pleasure which rumble had expressed maxwell told of his good fortune was little dashed by this last bit of informati on of course he had expected that his daughter would leave him sometime and he had not been blind to the fact that maxw ell had gained place in her affections nevertheless he was not quite prepared this news and it left shadow on his kindly belford magazine volume ii 8 january 1889 project gutenberg ebook https but father said fanny advancing quickly and placing her arm about his neck and her head on his shoulder arthur and i hope that we shall all be together he may return to new york but if we have home in the west you might live with us it was loving tender look which rumble gave his daughter she uttered these words at that moment the clock began to strike horns were heard in the street bells were rung and in lull in the storm the musical notes of chime fell on their ears rumble ﬁlled the cups and then raising his he said here s to the new year and here s to your success arthur and to fanny s and while the clock was still striking the three drank in the new year ii that year however was not fortunate one rumble his little fund had dwindled he had he thought barely enough to conduct his business to the time when he could legally have an auction but how was he to this and pay his rent that problem troubled him it was ﬁnally solved by the consent of his landlord in consideration of high rate of interest to wait his rent until rumble had his auction when this arrangement was made the pawnbroker who had been gloomy some time again wore cheerful look his daughter had advised him to pay his rent and curtail his business the time being but that he said would never and when he had tided over the crisis in his affairs he went on distributing his money among the people who brought him their old clothes and their all but worthless jewellery from time to time pawnbrokers called on him and tried to persuade him that his method of doing business was mistake that it was not only hurting their business but was ruining himself rumble was not convinced if his way of doing business took from the proﬁts of other pawnbrokers they were only meeting with justice he said they had made money enough out of the poor he meant to treat his customers better he admitted that he might not get his money back from some of his investments but then the auction would make it all right what he lost in one way he would get back in another he looked to the auction to sort of day of judgment when there would be grand evening of accounts at last the great day day of the auction rumble was full of the importance of the event and had donned his best clothes in honor of the occasion he had advertised the auction in several newspapers and he expected large attendance he was somewhat disappointed when little while before the time set the sale it began to rain but he hoped the best when the auctioneer rapped on his desk and announced that he was about to open the sale there were not more than dozen people in the room among them rumble recognized several pawnbrokers and the others looked though they might belong to the same guild he wondered why they were there had they come to bid at his auction on goods on which he had loaned more money than they would have loaned he did not understand it when the sale began rumble took seat near the auctioneer and watched the proceedings he soon understood why the pawnbrokers were there the prices obtained were absurdly small there was very little competition and the sale had not gone far before it dawned on rumble s mind that the pawnbrokers had tacit understanding that they would not bid against one another but would divide the stock among them the poor old man s heart sank and great beads of perspiration appeared on his brow lot after lot went almost nothing all his worldly possessions were melting away before his eyes and he had not the power to put out his hand and save them was he dreaming he could hear the auctioneer s voice loud and clear belford magazine volume ii 8 january 1889 project gutenberg ebook https he turned his head and saw his daugh ter standing in the near the open doorway with her eyes ﬁxed upon him her face was white white the kerchief about her neck she understood it all yes it was all too real again those terrible words rang like knell in his ears and every time he heard them he knew that he was poorer man he knew that more of his little stock had gone at sacriﬁce at last he scarcely heeded the words of the auctioneer but sat staring before him like one the buzz of conversation about him seemed like sound coming from afar like the roll of waves on the seashore and through it all at intervals like the faint note of bell warning seamen of danger came those words telling of his own wreck when the auction was over fanny went to her father s side he was apparentl y dazed she helped him to rise he leaned heavily upon her she led him into the where he sank back into chair and did not utter word long time at last when he found voice he said it s all gone fanny all gone we are ruined the sale on which rumble had built so many hopes realized but little more than enough to pay the rent he owed he did not have money enough to continue his business and few days after the auction his pawnshop was closed in the meantime to add to their distress fanny had received letter from arthur maxwell informing her that the railroad company with which he had found employment had failed owing him several hundred his savings he wrote that there was prospect that labor invention of his would be put in use in one of the mines this was the only gleam of hope in the letter fanny answered it giving arthur an account of the misfortune which had befallen her father although she gave him the number of the new lodging into which they moved when her father s shop was closed she received reply she had hoped soon to have some cheering word from him but none came she could not understand his silence this in addition to her other troubles seemed more than she could bear since the auction rumble had not been well man his nerves at that time had received shock from which he had not recovered between nursing her father and earning what little she could by sewing fanny had hard time the pittance she got her work did not go far toward meeting their expenses rumble had given up his shop in the early autumn and the little money he had saved from the wreck had disappeared when winter set in at last it became necessary to pawn some of their household goods fanny would not let her fathe r go the pawnbroker s but went herself when she returned and showed him the little money she had obtained on the articles she had pledged he said why i would have given twice yes father answered fanny but all pawnbrokers are not like muttered the old man if they were they would be poor like although rumble was not able to work he was always talking of what he would when he felt little stronger he worried continually because he was dependent upon his daughter and every time she went to the pawnbroker s he had ﬁt of melancholy at last just before christmas he became seriously the doctor whom fanny called in said he had brain fever and gave her little hope of his recovery his mind wandered and seemed to go back to the auction of which he spoke almost constantly many times he repeated the words of the auctioneer that had made such deep impression on him belford magazine volume ii 8 january 1889 project gutenberg ebook https was gloomy christmas fanny and when new year s eve came she was still watching by the bedside of her father whose fever had reached its crisis her thoughts went back to another new year s eve when arthur maxwell had told her of his plans the future and it had been so long since she had heard from him she had to get some medicine which the doctor had ordered and while her father slept asking an acquaintance who lodged on the same ﬂoor to watch over him she went out taking with her gold locket which she meant to pawn although she knew that pawnbroker had opened shop where her father had kept his she had never gone to it but something seemed to lead her there that evening when she reached the place her heart almost failed her but summoning courage she entered the shop and presented the locket to the pawnbroker while he was examining it two men entered the pawnbroker s clerk waited on them she seemed to feel their eyes on her when she gave the pawnbroker her name he said rumble frances rumble why young man was here inquiring rumble and some time ago the carrier brought two letters here you i could not tell him where you lived and he took them away fanny s heart beat wildly she was sure that the letters were from arthur and that it was he who had inquired her father is this miss rumble said one of the men who had followed her into the shop she turned and recognized dixon the person with him was teague dixon had just pawned watch and had remarked that he wished rumble still kept the shop when fanny told them of her father s illness and of his misfortune dixon and teague insisted on going home with her meaning to lend assistance in some way when they reached fanny s humble lodging and followed her into her father s room they found maxwell at rumble s bedside cry of joy escaped fanny her lover folded her in his arms she soon learned from him that he had never received the letter in which she wrote him about her father s trouble and their removal from the old shop it had missed him while he was moving about in the west and then he told her of the success of his invention rumble whose mind was lucid the moment said you will be happy at last fanny arthur has come and you too will be happy with us father replied fanny taking his hands in hers the old man smiled faintly and rolled his head to and fro on his pillow if he thought differently the clock began to strike it was midnig ht and the new year was at hand the sound of bells came to their ears and distant chime was heard rumble s mind once more began to wander again he talked about the auction again he muttered the words that had troubled him so much they were his last words the old man s life went out with the old year alber t r oland h aven the root of the spoils belford magazine volume ii 8 january 1889 project gutenberg ebook https is known the spoils system of politics in measure common to all times and all forms of government seems to have reached its highest development in our republic this fact justiﬁes the suspicion that something in our form of administration is favorable to such development and whether we regard the spoils system praisew orthy or reprehensible it will be instructive to inquire why it has prevailed in this country among other free people most persons who deplore the spoils system urge one of its greatest evils that it substitutes the discussion of principles mere scramble ofﬁce that it teaches men to value the material prizes incident to government above political truth such reasoners have strangely mistaken cause effect the rarity of ideas in our political discussions is not an effect but the immediate cause of the spoils system and behind both the direct cause of the latter and the remote cause of the former lies the difﬁculty of expressing the popular will in legislative enactment in other words we have substituted the pursuit of place the discussion of principles because the relations of the people to the body are not sufﬁciently close reader of this periodical needs to be reminded that when our present constitu tion was written the mass of freemen had not now come to believe that constitutional government should include legislature promptly obedient to the popular will ministry dependent upon the support of majority in the popular branch of the making body and an executive powerless to interfere in legislation it was natural then that our forefathers imperfectly acquainted with this modern device of free peoples should have believed that they had secured the prompt and certain efﬁcacy of the popular will in government by placing restriction to national elections upon the wide suffrage already prevailing in most of the states and providing that the chief magistrate and both branches of the national legislature should be elective and chosen short terms they could not foresee that in course of time constitutional monarch would come to have less power than the executive head of the republic that an hereditary house of lords less often than an elective senate would dare to cross the will of the popular legislative body that the popular branch of the legislature in constitutional monarchy would in effect change at will the administrative head of the government while in the new republic premiers would retain power despite the adverse verdict of the people expressed in legislative majorities and ﬁnally that the enfranchised portion of people dwelling under constitutional monarchy would determine at the every great question arising in their politics and drive from power all men who should dissent from the popular decision while the whole people of the republic might be balked not only of their will in matters upon which they had distinctly made up their minds but even of bringing questions thus potentially decided to the practical test of the and of introducing other important issues into the realm of popular discussion the difﬁculty of procuring from the people of the united states an unequivocal decision upon any political question and of expressing that decision in legislative enact ment is familiar to every student of our history the questions that occupy congress now are in large part the same that were debated there forty years ago save that the issue of slavery and the extreme states rights theory have disappeared but even in these cases the exceptions prove the rule it is grimly signiﬁcant of our legislative immobility that the two great questions of century should ﬁnally have been settled by the sword if the people declared anything at the general election of 1884 they may be supposed to have declared revision of the tariff since the platform of principles adopted by each great party at its national convention afﬁrmed the necessity of such revision yet congress not only failed to legislate that object but actually at one time refused to discuss measure designed to meet the issue in question and at another stopped in the midst of such legislation to test the popular will upon the very same matter furthermore while it will be assumed by most persons that whatever the signiﬁcance of the election four years ago the contest just ended sets the seal of disapproval upon the recent effort of the house of representatives to revise the tariff yet we hear already that the li congress can hardly escape some such legislation has just been belford magazine volume ii 8 january 1889 project gutenberg ebook https truth is that the election of 1884 all our elections was in the main struggle spoils the question at issue was not tariff revision or any other great economic idea but which party should administer during the next four years the great patronage of the federal government in the contest of november last the people the ﬁrst time in twenty years had living issue presented but so unused were they to the discussion of economic principles that it may be questioned whether the verdict just delivered with so much apparent emphasis was really the expression of public opinion it is worthy of note too that believe rs in the spoils system of politics are already taunting the vanquished with the folly of presenting political idea to the american people and prophesying more rigid exclusion of principles from politics in all time to come such difﬁculties have beset us througho ut all our history let men wince they would under galling injustice and false economics they could not work their will upon the body whose duty it is to express in legislation the political desires of the people mocking fate seemed to balk the accomplishment of our most earnest purposes and men whose interests were adverse to the public good constantly took it upon themselves to declare that the people had not spoken upon whatever vital question was uppermost or that their words had meant something other than they seemed to mean the result of all this was what we see people must have some sort of political activity and since it was early discovered that the discussion of principles was little better than vain occupation the pursuit of place soon became almost the sole object of political organization if it was almost impossible to carry question from the stage of popular discussion to that of legislative enactment it was very simple matter to elect presidents and congressmen who should see to proper distribution of places since men could not accomplish the rational object of political endeavor they strove what was easily attainable if they could not make the laws they could at least ﬁll the ofﬁces then came the easy descent to avernus politics having become mere struggle place public affairs were left more and more in the hands of men who found such work congenial and the mass of the people to whom the hope of ofﬁce is but shadowy illusion became less and less interested in struggle that held most voters neither the promise of gain nor the incentive of high purpose the spoils system having thus been established the causes that bred it were in their turn intensiﬁed by its reaction and the evil round was complete to make matters worse the struggle wealth stimulated by the marvellous richness of part of the country claimed the attention of thousands to the exclusion of politics and those who would naturally have led in affairs of state adopted the evil philosophy that it is cheaper to be robbed by professional politicians than to neglect private business the sake of public duty having sought thus to trace the steps by which our form of administration has begotten the spoils system let us endeavor to prove the conclusion by another process of reasoning were our government parliamentary system such exists among the free peoples of the old world we should have legislature promptly responsive to movements of the popular will ministry sitting in one or the other house of congress and dependent continuance in power upon the support of majority in the lower house and an executive disarmed in whole or in part of the power to negative legislative enactments the result would be to concentrate interest not now upon the election of president whose chief function is to distribute places and whose part in legislation is almost purely negative but upon the choice of the legislative body whose majority should determine the political complexion of the president s advisers and the general policy of the administration at each general election members of the lower house the issue would be some question then under hot discussion and in most instances congress would have been dissolved the express purpose of taking the sense of the people upon the matter at issue public interest in political discussion would return because great principles such have an important bearing upon the lives of all men would be under debate and the mass of voters would have such an incentive to activity the shadowy hope of place could never furnish the knowledge that the popular will would ﬁnd prompt expression through the power would belford magazine volume ii 8 january 1889 project gutenberg ebook https impossible the people to be turned from their purpose by the jugglery of hunters with whole people interested in political discussion conceivable abuse of patronage could balk them of their will and the spoils system would disappear because the factitious importance of and favore d by the defects of our present form of administration could longer obscure the vastly greater question of the public weal this change in the popular attitude toward politics would be sufﬁcient of itself to seal the doom of the spoils system but if other inﬂuences were needed they would be found in the new relations of the ministry to the legislature and the people since cabinet bound to take the initiative in great lines of policy and required to give an account of itself to hostile minori ty in congress would have little time and less stomach the nice apportionment of political rewards to partizan deserts finally should we adopt the principle of ministry dependent upon the support of majority in the lower house the possibility of two changes of administration within single year would make the spoils system we now have it unendurable and unworkable indeed it may be questioned whether rigid application of the spoils system by the administration coming into ofﬁce in march 1889 would not place the evils of that system in peculiarly glaring light when it is remembered that very large number of those who would be asked to make places party workers unversed in the routine of public ofﬁce have exercised their ofﬁcial functions barely four years and but recently acquired the skill so necessary to the efﬁcient transaction of business the attentive reader will have noted that it has been argued ﬁrst that the spoils system is the natural and inevitable outcome of the rigidity that seems unseparable from our form of administration and second that such system in its grossest development is almost impossible under parliamentary government the latter line of argument has been taken less its own sake than the purpose of strengthening the conclusions reached by the former and the writer would not be understood insisting that to eliminate the spoils system we must adopt exactly such parliamentary form now exists among the free peoples of europe any system that should make it easy to ascertain the popular will and should insure the prompt and certain expression of that will in legislation would accomplish the object of substituting principles spoils in our politics to suggest plausible plan grafting upon our system this far more democratic scheme of administration would be stupendous work calling the highest exercise of trained political sagacity but it is not difﬁcult to indicate some of the things that need not be done it is not necessary that the presid ent should be reduced to any such mere head is the monarch in the parliamentary governments of europe perhaps the principle of ministry sitting in the houses of congress might be omitted and it is not clear that the president s veto would have to be altogether sacriﬁced it is not positive indeed that formal amendm ent of the constitution would be necessary to obtain the essentials of the reform under consideration we have amended the spirit of the constitution in one highly importa nt feature without changing the letter of that instrument perhaps the nearest way to the object in view lies through more intimate relation between the cabinet and the committees of the lower house finally the consideration presents itself that if the conclusions reached here are correct those persons who have sought by statutory restriction and appeals to public conscience to abolish the spoils system have not employed the wholesome policy of attacking the evil at its source they seem to be mowing rather than uprooting the weeds doubtless our political garden has been tidied but the roots of the evil growth and the aptitudes of the soil remain the reform system applied to the great body of minor clerical ofﬁces will probably prevail from now on but we can scarcely hope that the broad spirit of civil service reform can reign in this land until the people shall have made themselves immediate masters of the legislative power edward v allandigham belford magazine volume ii 8 january 1889

hatred and contention the spirit of peace and exorcise ye from the hearth of christmas memories i was going to tell you how uncle scipio undertook to save us from despair in that terrible time we the much abused community of infants had submitted with tolerable fortitude to taking our rye substitute coffee sweetened with sorghum and similar hardships but now the holidays approached and we saw signs of festivity we began to feel great apprehensions we resolved to conﬁde our fears to scipio you think i asked him one evening we sat in our usual evening attitudes before the ﬁre that old santy

courage alive until the great day it drew near and nearer and still we saw unusual stir in the house and our hearts began to sink little at last it wanted but one day and i shall never get that christmas eve uncle scipio was very much preoccupie d and could not be disturbed by any means that day so we betook ourselves to the society of our elders but there matters were worse there was little of privation and bad news that we had not become pretty familiar with by this time and war i remember seemed to the normal condition of things but it soon became clear to that something little worse than usual was apprehended that day there were whispered conversations going on above our heads but we caught enough of it to know that piece of terrible news had arrived party of refugees had passed through our town in the early morning they were company of fragile wom en and children with few faithful negroes ﬂeeing from their homes from pestilence they told us that large company of yankees had made their appearance few miles above us and if they followed the most direct route to the railroad woul d in all probability reach us that night or the following day our little town being on the line of the railroad rarely escaped the military visitations besides it was at this time the depository of great deal of cotton which it was feared might be the occasion of its being burned i have heard mother say that this day before christmas there were just three men in the hospital doctor the miller and the conscript ofﬁcer not very formidable defence against hostile invasion but i suppose those two lonely women my mother and grandmother must have looked help in this extremity towards the everlasting hills where the twelve legions of angels lay encamped they bore their anxiety like spartans the day dragged through however and the last sun rays showed us blue coats on the western road towards which aching eyes had turned through the heavy hours things began to look little more hopeful we began to feel that reaction from anxiety which is almost sure to come when the candles are lighted we sat close together in the and took our very frugal supper there in quite hysterical sort of cheerfulness the day had passed without disaster and we had been told that in case the yankees should make their appearance during the night and our garrison of three be obliged to evacuate the town the village would be rung to apprize the citizens of the situation we felt sure the enemy could not come on christmas eve we even ventured to hang up our stockings in the accustomed place we knelt my brother and i by dear old grandmother s knee and said our prayers to him who she told us knew what it was to spend his ﬁrst christmas days here under the shadow of the sword and would not that one of his little ones should peris then tossed by hope and fear we slept it was notable fact but one which escaped comment in the general anxiety of that night that uncle scipio had not appeared usual after his tasks were ﬁnished it had gone pretty hard with us all not to be able to conﬁde everything to this faithful old friend but the strictest injunctions had been laid upon us to keep the whole matter secret from the negroes many reasons so he knew nothing and went about his tasks all day singing his most tunes which meant some pleasant preoccupation of mind we had learned that we knew soon after what it was that occupied his heart and head that day i not know how long we had slept in our trundle bed but i know i had travelled in my dreams over many leagues of fairy land walking under endless avenues of lighted christmas trees when suddenly i thought from some unseen source the deep tones of belford magazine volume ii 8 january 1889 project gutenberg ebook https struck discord on the radiant air it seemed so out of place in that enchanted region and at the sound all the lights on the trees ﬂickered and went out and we were lost in the dark louder and nearer the bell still sounded and then we awoke and our hearts stood still with terror we knew it was the village proclaiming its story to the sleeping town the enemy were upon us and our christmas ﬁres would be the light of blazing homes oh such awakening after such dreams so eloquent was every face of horrible certainty that scarcely word was spoken it was only about midnight but i was dressed by trembling had not been undressed at all and then we what we could not have told precisely but after little the bell ceased to ring and then we listened the tramp of horses and the quick northern voices speaking words of command to the men we had heard it before and knew the sound well once before i had awakened from sleep and seen the distorted shadows of horsemen chase one another across the strip of moonlight just over my bed and looked from my window to see the moonlight glittering on the sabres and gun barrels of an armed host surrounding our house that is not sight to be forgotten let tell you children who are born and reared in the lap of peace and plenty quite seemed ages to sat in silence looking at one another but though the lights twinkled in all the neighboring windows telling of other anxious watchers unusual sound disturbed the air what could it mean surprise began to succeed to alarm it occurred to some one to call up uncle scipio and get him to investi gate but it was wonder on top of was not to be found neither had his bed been disturbed during the night had he deserted us and gone over to the enemy then we could not really doubt him even yet but his absence was too signiﬁcant there must be some plot hatching somewhere in the dark there was nothing us to but wait but we had not to wait much longer presently in walked the absentee clothed in his most majestic air but little plussed to see us all up and dressed oh scipio where have you been we exclaimed indignantly how could you leave us at such time and the town full of soldiers which way are they coming what shall we well i clar he answered in bewildered sort of way dis yere proceedin clean tops my cotton is you all clar outen yer minds or what s matter wid yer i aint seed nary yankee dis night and i jes bin way up to mef dis chache ringing christmas chimes fur to cheer you up little did n ole scip tell you honeys dat dis was gwine to be boss christmas and he done kep his word i met ole santy out yonder sittin on pump and he sez he s comin here soon s iver he kin so you better git to bed mejitly ef not sooner ef you don t he ll be here and ketch you christmas gif fust sho he and so this was the end of it all the dear old soul had taken it into his funny old head to give us surprise and ring the christmas chimes in the old times well we tried to soften the blow when we told him what blunder he had made but we knew it would be long time ere he would recover from his chagrin he had long been terror to the idle young darkies about town and they were only too glad to get something to use against him of course there was general indignation among the citizens when they learned that they had suffered false alarm but when they considered the beautiful motive that prompted the action the tide of reproach was turned aside and it all ended in general laugh at uncle scipio s expense it still wanted several hours till day when our fears were relieved by his appearance and we went to bed again with the ﬁrst streak of light however we were up with bare feet and frowzy heads to ﬁnd uncle scipio s promise had not failed us the christmas saint had been upon belford magazine volume ii 8 january 1889 project gutenberg ebook https hearthstone and left his footprints there the stockings were fantastically distended ever in the palmiest times i suppose the children of the present day would not covet the wonderful objects that we hauled forth from heel and toe yet i have spent many christmas holidays amid the gayeties of the metropolis since then and its richest gifts wax poor when i remember that morning what did it matter to us that both toys and confections bore the stamp of home wooden dolls like chinese deities carved out of wood by uncle scipio s jack people baked in sweet bread with coffee grains eyes what did it matter that the war cloud hovered around us that might renew the scenes of yesterday we were happy in our treasures we know now what the charm was that made them precious we know that the painted vellum hallows not the prayer nor ivory and gold the ah that will ever be the day of days to and with it are enshrined in fadeless green the names of many whose eyes have long been closed upon the wars and joys of this earth not the least dear among these will ever be old scipio who loved us better than his own freedom who stood by us in the day of trial and was faithful till death to the charge of master who could never return to take account of his stewardship he was grandiloquent insisted on spectacles though he generally read the hymns upside down wore collar on sundays that would put our modern dudes to naught but he was prophet all that and saw farther than most men into the future we trust he has honor now in his own country while in our hearts his memory will yearly ring the chimes of christmas bells celine m c c ay the result november 6th 1888 we have longer uncle sam nor yet our the ﬁrst is but an uncle sham the last is james m c c arroll silk culture there are so many persons thirsting information i says to wrigglesnif f let s tell them all about it was always my way to stir in something useful with what was agreeable and here was an opportunity while pursuing an avocation that was at once pleasant and lucrative to bring forward at the same time an illustration of those great economic and philosophic principles that lie at the foundation of all government and are the of the social fabric the tariff although an intricate subject i felt belford magazine volume ii 8 january 1889 project gutenberg ebook https that could be elucidated by simple exempliﬁcation in practical life and so i opened up to her one day by remarking upon the great importance of fostering our infant that most efﬁcient mother was nursing the baby at the time the baby was four weeks old weighed sixteen pounds and could partake of more nourishment at nature s fountain than any two ordinary pair of twins infant industry here s one now observed gazing with maternal fondness upon the lusty native american in her lap who was tugging away with zeal quite amazing you should ﬁrst understand however that is superior woman has got intellect into her her uncle john fetherly brown was wont to say her father s second cousin was to noah webster and she has therefore inherited some of the qualities of that distinguished philosopher i proposed the subject to her one day in genial sort of way and she said says she you re fool silk indeed she always calls the whole of it makes it too long and being practical woman she is aware that life is short i could not help admiring the promptn ess with which arrived at her conclusions and she is most excellent judge of human nature i changed the subject not wishing to exasperate her the way it came about was this i had read all about it in the papers and books and things and was thinking over it one day and all of sudden i spoke up and says i mrs let s have she looked at just that way minute i thought there was going to be funeral so i said says i we can get the eggs from washington nothing then we can have the stands in the attic and there s the hedge that does nothing in the world but keep the boys from stealing apples and we have apples to steal the children can feed them so that the total cost will be nothing we can sell the cocoons at pound and suppose we raise ﬁve hundred pounds only the ﬁrst season there s 750 which is absolutely clear proﬁt the whole of it we can then buy carriage and we will give ball and ye shall walk in silk turned up her nose in using that expression i not mean that she actually inverted that feature of her countenanc but the expression of her face indicated the idea which usually ﬁnds utterance in the word at this point i took occasion to explain to the relations of this most beautiful and fascinating industry to the principles of political economy my amiable lady had frequently said it was all bosh that to try to raise silk in this country was mere gammon i explained to her that her position philosophical proposition would be true were it not the fostering care of paternal government which had inaugurated the american system of protection that this great principle of protection was the source of our national wealth that the tariff on silk was sixty per cent tariff inquired what is tarif f tariff my dear said i i am surprised i had supposed that such an intellect yours would have familiarized itself with the great economic questions of the but i did not wish to be too severe with her i remembered that the sphere of woman did not bring her into contact with these rugged issues that are the theme of philosophers and statesmen so i explained brieﬂy but still kindly my dear tarif f is tax paid by the importer to this she made the very singular reply but how is taxing people going to make them rich and be the source of national wealth i know when tax day comes around you are always groaning and saying that it keeps your nose ﬂat on the grindstone to raise money enough to pay your i told her she still failed to see the point she was referring to mere state taxes while i upon higher plane was viewing the comprehensive bearings of national institutions she said you don t know any more about it than horace greeley such reference to the great apostle of american protection i confess shocked but belford magazine volume ii 8 january 1889 project gutenberg ebook https my feelings in consideration of her sex i have said that is woman of intellect but she has enthusiasm with it is different i am all enthusiasm and was about to say intellect but i mean such intellect has so she says that s the way you re always doing going into something you don t know anything about throwing away your money and that s about all you re ﬁt but my love i exclaimed there s chance to lose money in silk worms you get them nothing feed them nothing and how is it possible to lose money on them with the tarif f at sixty per cent ad valorem she interrupted when you talk latin to please explain some people have thought that there was an asperity in s nature that occasionally found expression in words but it is not so she is of most amiable disposition and i never knew her i may coin asperse i therefore said that in the tariff laws duties were levied upon the value of articles stated in the importer s invoice but said she won t the importers value too low oh my dear i said that would be dishonest and importers are never dishonest indeed it is upon the virtue and integrity of the people that the welfare of our institutions i was about to expand upon this theme my wife checked with the remark that we would take the american eagle and the rest of it at another time but just now we would hear about the silk worms i told her i had made all necessary arrangements and would that day write to the department at washington and secure the necessary supply of eggs to commence ﬂourishing business i did so and in due time i received from the capital of the nation nice little wooden box and inside of that another little tin box and inside of that were the eggs they were about big pin s heads and it looked though there were millions but i don t suppose there were that many i exhibited them with pride to the partner of my bosom exclaiming such is the fostering care of paternal government it raises these eggs at vast expense and bestows them liberally upon those who i then explained to how it was that our glorious republic nursed those infant industries that were so delicate they could not stand alone supporting them with great assiduity inasmuch they could not support themselves i showed her how employment was thus furnished to thousands of persons who would otherwise be idle or engaged in some other occupation that was able to take care of itself of course therefore making wages lower i contrasted the condition of the american laborer with that of the european serf trodden under the iron heel of despotism at ten cents day and satisﬁed her that the laboring man in the united states was the best paid and therefore the happiest and most contented being on earth owing to the fact of protective tarif f ever since 1789 exclaimed that angelic creature why is it then that the workingmen are always striking and marching around town with brass bands first shoemakers then carpenters and railroad men and and and wanting higher wages where does the happiness and content come in i heard you say yourself the other day that the disor ganized system of labor was such in this country that it was degenerating into socialism and anarchy and was ruining every branch of i hated to it but i crushed her with the reply ah my dear that is begging the but that sweet creature unrufﬂed summer sea preserved an equanimity that astounded she said why is it that whenever woman corners man in argument he simply ends the discussio n by telling her she is begging the question seeing that she did not exactly catch the drift of my logic i adroitly turned the subject to again and how we should proceed in our belford magazine volume ii 8 january 1889 project gutenberg ebook https now said i to i will procure the necessary lumber at usual market rates and make stand on which to lay the she observed you know you never made anything in your life and can t it go up to the carpenter and he will what you want ﬁfty cents and you can t buy the lumber mrs i replied i scorn your words i propose that this undertaking shall be absolutely inexpensive except perhaps the outlay the raw very well she observed try my what head that woman has i took book that had picture of the stand i wanted and took the dimensions carefully down went to the lumber yard selected the pieces and they cost only went home measured planned and ﬁgured and found that i had ordered the upright cut the length of the cross pieces and so that the whole was useless my disposition however is to take cheerful views of things and i explained to that i could still use the stuff pickets on the front fence some of which were missing quietly observed how are you going to use four pickets on fence when i purchased the second lot i was very careful to proceed deliberately i am good deal of carpenter if things would only come out square when ﬁnished but they never will when i saw board somehow the saw runs off to one side and when i try to nail it to the other board the two won t ﬁt and by the time i get around to the fourth side one end of the concern is up in the air and i have to sit on it to keep it down i have often gazed with admiration on real carpenter to see him run his saw along straight string and true die and then put the pieces all together and have them ﬁt nice cotton hat this is true genius sensible of the danger and liability to mistake in putting the pieces together i told who was superintending the operation that we would not use nails but screws so that in case of all human judgment is could take the screws out and take the pieces apart which could not be done with nails conc eded the suggestion to be valuable one so we went to work she kindly lending her assistance i measured all the pieces got them the exact length and the greater certain ty stood them up on the ﬂoor to see if they would all ﬁt they certainly seemed to so far mortal vision could determine all this required great deal of deliberation great deal of measuring great deal of sawin g some chiselling the hour of sunset was approaching when i had put in the last screw and triumphantly called from her afternoon nap to witness the success of my mechanical endeavors i stood the blamed thing up on its four legs and three of were on the ﬂoor and the fourth wasn it was impossible to discover the defect in my workmanship i could make any three of the legs stand on the ﬂoor but the fourth could not be prevailed upon any consideration the which should have been horizontal and which to that end had been measured with mathemati cal precision slanted up on one side and slanted down on the other i was in despair until brought her intellect to bear upon my difﬁculties when it appeared that three of the uprights were four feet six inches high and the fourth was four feet seven inches how it happened one could explain now says send the carpenter i did so he rough totally uncultured man he could barely write his name and his clothes were principally suspenders but that uneducated man just took these pieces of wood and knocked them here and knocked them there and by aid of some disreputable shingle nails in twenty minutes had neat looking stand made ever you saw come out of cabinet maker s shop i was abashed and paid him cents said nothing but smiled we had some frames about two feet square covered with brown paper these we placed on the stand and spread out the eggs i was little uneasy about what kind of hen to get to hatch them i could ﬁnd nothing in the books on the subject but called my usual pet name and said that the ﬁrst warm day was all the hen needed wonderful woman that just she predicted in few days the brown paper belford magazine volume ii 8 january 1889 project gutenberg ebook https with little dark specks in state of agitation spoke of them contemptuously nasty black they grew at prodigious rate i explained to the children that all they had to was to go down to the hedge cut off the twigs and branches and feed them to the worms that in few weeks the product would be ready market and if the mills bill didn t interfere with protection to ame rican industry the proﬁts would be large and should be equally divided between themselves and their mother the children were highly elated and were soon discussing what should be the color of the carriage horses one wanted black the other blue and the excitement ran so high that parental intervention became necessary and some spanking ensued the next morning our early dreams were disturbed by fearful outcries from the direction of the front fence the smallest of the children had tumbled head ﬁrst into the hedge and could not get out anyone who knows the infernal brutal intensity with which the thorns of the sting can understand the predicament of that child we extracted her in fearfully lacerated condition she was punctured all over having read in book entitled three thousand valuable receipts cents that ammonia was good stings i applied ammonia liberally to that bleeding child until she became absolutely frantic her screams attracted to the scene and she exclaimed have you more sense than to put ammonia on raw ﬂesh like that i pointe d to the three thousand valuable receipts cents which she immediately picked up and threw out of the window the child ultimately recovered but from that day abhorred silk culture in all its branches still the industry went on the children were so stung by the thorns that the work devolved on and it was task most fearful there is poison in the thorn of the that not only makes the pain exquisite but swells one up though he had been stung all over by bees or had chronic dropsy my hands and arms were puffed up and my face looked though i had been in i observed to however these were minor difﬁculties and we could put up with them in consideration of the large proﬁts which would ensue one day one of the are always going around and turning things up side left one of the frames on the ﬂoor and all the worms to the number of several hundred scattered themselves profusely about the house and without any reference to the comfort or convenience of the family if you opened the ﬂour barrel there was silk worm they pervaded the sugar and crawled into the cream you found them in bed and the mash was awful how many were trodden into the parlor carpet can never be known this too was but an episode and the worms grew in size and began to spin their cocoons the process was quite interesting and even overcame her repugnance to the crawling little wretches i was startled one day i was feeding my who were consuming the orange leaves at the rate of bushel day making two bushels of litter to hear abruptly ask what is consumer the unexpectedness of the interrogation found at fault moment but reﬂecting little while and looking at the i concluded the best way to put it was consumer my dear consumer in this country is one who thinking that exception could be taken to such deﬁnition i was triumphant said that pertinacious person you don t hang together well if any you said the other day that this tarif f thing was the beneﬁt of the producer my dear i replied i seize the occasion my foot is on my native heath and my name is mcgregor when our industries were in their infancy it was found impossible to compete with foreign productions labor was so cheap abroad that they could undersell us in our own markets we had laid the foundation of broad comprehensive manufacturing interest we had taken men from agricultural and other pursuits where they earned livelihood and put them in new and strange employments about which they knew nothing where they expecte d to earn more than livelihood but this could not be done on account of prices so government imposed high duties and the belford magazine volume ii 8 january 1889 project gutenberg ebook https his articles higher price in this way he was beneﬁted and enabled to make money the tariff added just so much to the price of the article sold and the producer was happy but who paid this extra price queried well i replied it is principle of political economy i believe that all taxes are paid ultimately by the consumer so that in case of this the consumer is the american people interrupted my dear i cried once more i am compelled to observe you are begging the mendicant again was her arch reply and cry from the nursery ended the discussion in about six weeks we had the cocoon of course during that time the house was littered with dirt dried leaves and all sorts of unclean things and if you ran about the premises in the dark barefooted you were sure to step on an twig and i am satisﬁed from the amount of squalling done that if the season had lasted six months most of the children would have been exterminated i corresponded with some concern in one of the eastern cities stating that i had large amount of ﬁne cocoons and wanting to know what they would pay i observed to that i was conﬁdent of receiving reply to the effect that i should ship the cocoons draw at sight ﬁve hundred dollars leaving the balance to be paid per account sales the reply was to send on sample and they would see if they could take them when we came to weigh out both and i were appalled it took about two if not quite half of the entire crop however they were sent and snickered she did up the package in the course of several weeks i received specimen say about skein of the most beautiful silk i had ever beheld with an order to forward the balance of the cocoons per adams express which i did at the expense of one dollar waited several months acknowledgement of receipt wrote various letters the postage on which was two cents each considerable time elapsed while we were waiting the returns and i was determined that should understand this great subject of the tariff i knew she could if she gave her mind to it i proceeded to eviscerate the whole matter said i when tariff is laid upon manufact ured article it enables the manufacturer in this country to pay his workmen higher and does he always it said always i replied statistics show that when the tariff on iron was increased twenty per cent the manufacturers of iron immediately raised the wages of all their employés twenty per i see said that clear woman what excellent persons these iron men are they not hire their men little they can but pay them more than they exactly so i replied the general rule i admit to be that man pays little he can labor but under the protective system the tariff increases the price of the manufactured article so that the manufa cturer is enabled to sell his goods that higher price and the workman thus gets the beneﬁt of this argument seemed to have great weight with her it gave her new light on things she said it was contrary to experience but i explained to her that unless some ﬂaw could be found in the syllogism the conclusion was irresistible all experience to the contrary notwithstanding i then showed her how entirely disinterested the manufacturers were that all their efforts were solely the beneﬁt of the workmen that personally the tariff made difference to them that they never besought congress to lay high tariffs that one ever knew of the iron men or the sugar men or the copper men besieging the legislato rs at washington to impose duties upon articles they made that it was the workmen who always did belford magazine volume ii 8 january 1889 project gutenberg ebook https i not know exactly how long it was that we waited to receive our fortune from those cocoons but one day postal card came to hand from the parties to whom i had sent my wealth stating that they had received so many cocoons they could not tell which mine were inasmuch mine were the only ones that had ever been shipped from the town wherein i reside it occurred to that this remark might be considered in the nature of joke then there followed another voluminous correspon dence i appealed to adams express company who said they would send out tracer i did not like to betray my ignorance by showing that i did not know what tracer was but frankly i should not have known one had i met it on the street but with the inﬁnite knowledge of affairs that has that remarkable woman signiﬁed to that tracer was something that goes up and down and to and fro upon the face of the earth like roaring lion seeking something and not generally ﬁnding it it is an immense consolation however to railroad men and others it appears that after tracer has been sent out nothing more can by any possibility be done by anybody whether or not the tracer had anything to with the ﬁnal result i never knew but about six months after i had transmitted my cocoons to that large silk manufacturing house that paid such large wages to american workmen the purpose of fostering american industry i received note sending and enclosing check cents when i received this portentous paper i observed to my dear how much you suppose we got our cocoons about cents was the reply the mind that woman has detail is simply wonderful

capital the president in his late and last message to congress calls attention in his incisive and felicitous style to condition of our people that must strike all intelligent minds with alarm the corner in the foundation of communism is that agency of the government which makes of the sovere ign power that legal process which controls all private affairs the good of the people in popular phrase it upholds the pater nal form which enters every man s house and regulates by law all his transactions this is the foundation while the holding of property in common is rather consequenc than cause if there are rights pertaining to the citizen but those derived from government to give practical effect to the scheme all property owned by the government must be held in its care in common by its dependents heretofore this theory has been advoc ated by the poor and oppressed and stoutly resisted by the rich we are treated to reversal of position in the parties and the rich are practically pressing the scheme upon the poor jefferson the father of modern democracy taught that the government mere form of expression in the way of rule by the people who held the sovereignty was only trust of power instituted the sole purpose of keeping the peace between the citizens to use popular phrase it was nothing but the intervention of the constable our central government not being built altogether upon this broad yet simple proposition opened in its mixed nature the door to communism found in the paternal form indeed it would have been entirely divested of the jeffersonian theory had it not been the necessity under which the framers found themselves of conciliating the states that then jealously fought every proposition looking to deprivation of their sovereign rights all that we so happily gained then came from regard to the several states and not to any thought of popular rights this fact gave us constitution under which we have managed to live comparatively prosperous century had it been otherwise our constitution would have gone to pieces in the ﬁrst years of its existence constitution is legal recognition of certain general rules of conduct that are ever the same under all circumstances legislation is the adaptation of those rules to individual cases and these vary and change with continuously new conditions ﬁxed application in constit ution is impossible this restriction far it goes we have to thank the states and not the sagacity of the fathers the constitution was scarcely enacted before the communism of paternal form began to manifest itself the federal party was of this sort it sneered at and fought the sovereignty of the people and found its governing element in class that was supposed to hold in itself the intelligence and virtue of the people it has departed and been done to death not by the people who failed to comprehend or feel the situation but by the same cause that created the constitution that was the jealous opposition of the states to centralization of power at washington after the death of the federal party the whig organization was formed on the same line and the same purpose those of its federal predecessor henry clay its author an eloquent but ignorant man formulated his american system that was small affair in the beginning but had deadly seeds of evil in its composition clay saw the necessity manufactures in the united states and capital necessary to their existence in private hands could not be obtained he proposed that the government should intervene through misuse of the taxing power and supply the want it was belford magazine volume ii 8 january 1889 project gutenberg ebook https want at ﬁrst let us aid these infant industries he said until they are strong enough to stand alone and then the government may withdraw and leave competition to regulate it was plausible but insidious proposition this was fought bitterly by the south not altogether from high ground of principle although the argument was made that the government at washington had such power under the constitution but the main motive was the south was an agricultural region and found in cotton rice sugar and tobacco staples that had their better indeed their only market in europe and saw sense in trammelling it with laws to beneﬁt eastern capital the american system was having rough time and bidding fair to die out when the sectional issue between the north and south culminated in war and driving not only the south but the democracy from the government left the paternal party in power this organization was made up mainly of whigs the abrupt dissolution of that party threw in the newly formed republican organization the majority that from the ﬁrst until now has governed its movements how patriotic party founded on property is we learn from its ﬁrst act after securing control of congress in the terrible war that followed secession the greatest of dangers that threatened success was in european interference common sense to say nothing of patriotism dictated that congres s should at least abstain from measures likely to offend the governments abroad if it did not all in its power to conciliate greed recognized such duty almost the ﬁrst measure of any importance introduced and passed to law was the morrill tariff that slapped the greatest war powers of europe in the face under pretence of raising war reven ue they made deadly attack on resource from that source they well knew that they increased the duties they lessened the income the panic and distress that followed this measure in all the markets of the world can well account the deadly hostility to our government felt abroad small wonder that while arms were furnished the south in the greatest abundance cruisers were ﬁtted out in english ports to prey upon our helpless commerce the greater danger of ofﬁcial recognition was only averted by the stubborn stand taken by great britain and it was we now know that had the south been able to continue the war ninety days longer that intervention would have come frenc h army sent there that purpose would have invaded our lands from mexico while the ﬂeets of allied france and england would have dissipated our blockade lifted the confederacy s ﬁnancial credit to par and we would have been called on to make terms of peace at philadelphia all this gathered evil was shattered at nashville by the gallant thomas and his noble army of the cumberland when he not only defeated the ﬁfty thousand veterans under hood but annihilated an army this was the birth of the communism of wealth that is to govern our country the next four years of course it is absurd to charge nearly half of our people with corrupt motives and unpatriotic conduct we have such intent we are only striving to show that the success of the republican policy is fatal to the republic this party we have said is in sense political organization it is great combination of private interests that seek to use the government to further their own selﬁsh ends governments through all the ages have been the deadly enemies of the people they governed ours controlled by the republican party makes exception to the rule the gigantic trusts or combinations are eating the substance out of honest toil and back of them stands the awful shadow of powerful organization making those trusts possible and doing to the

states that the ballot has come to be commercial affair and instead of serving its original purpose of process through which to express the popular will represents only the money expended in its use long time it was abused through stufﬁng false counts repeating and switching tickets in the late presidential election we seemed to have passed from that stage to open and shameless bribery this is simply appalling to those who love their country and believe in our great republic the old system of roguery that attacked the integrity of the ballot was that of few low villains who could be met by an improved box and other stringent legalized guards that would make the vile practices difﬁcult and punishment easily secured but this open purchase of votes indicates poison in the spring head

purchasable under this system the voter entering stall by himself ﬁnds an ofﬁcial to give him such ticket he may demand what will be the good of this when that agent can be purcha sed we really simply

manufacturers ought to be squeezed and why should they be squeezed he said they are the sole beneﬁciaries of the one measure at issue in the canvass this was followed by senator ingalls famous advice to the delegate at the chicago convention which said nominate some such fellow phelps who can tap wall this was followed by the dudley circular directing the purchase of ﬂoaters in blocks of ﬁve or more and assuring those dishonest agents that the funds would not be wanting to close the purchase under this exhibit of evidence the fact can not be denied but to make it conclu sive the new york world has gathered from all parts of the country clear unmistakable proof of clearly planned and openly executed purchase of voters the chair of the chief executive has followed the seats of senators to the market and that highest gift of the citizen has been sold to the highest bidder the great political fabric of the fathers built from woful expenditure of patriotic effort and blood is honeycombed with rot and remains mere sham to shame us before the world of course we are not so silly to attach blame only to one party the difference between the two lies in the fact that the one had more money than the other and stronger motive its use the republicans being combine of property interests depending upon the government to make those interests proﬁtable were impelled to exertion far beyond the democrats who were struggling the power only that possession of the government brings but we are forced to remember that the votes purchased came from the democratic party said prominent democrat of indiana to the writer of this we had enough money to purchase the state had we known the nature of the market and possessed agents upon whom we could rely the agents of our opponents were preachers deacons elders and teachers in schools and could be relied on to use their swag directed our fellows put our money in their pockets and left the voting to care itself and then again while we were on the lookout repeaters and stuffers they were in open market purchasing votes we learned the nature of the business when too late to meet it had we even had the means to make our knowledge doubt this gentleman told the truth the sums subscribed that counted in the millions came from men not only of means but of high social positions who not being altogether idiots well knew the purpose which their ample means were assessed that able and honorable gentleman judge gresham whose courage belford magazine volume ii 8 january 1889 project gutenberg ebook https rendered him unavailable candidate the presidency at chicago points openly to these respectable corruptionists the real wrong doers it is more than probable that such may escape the penitentiary and it is poor comfort to know that when such die lamented their souls in the great hereafter will have to be searched with microscope the pretence offered such assessments is too thin to cover the corrupt design says prominent

had made all they possessed through fraud and why should he with the best intentions not accumulate modest competence through the same means he heard nothing to the contrary from the pulpit the eloquent divine told in winning words of the righteousness of right and the sinfulness of sin but the illustrations were all or nearly all two thousand years old and the words were the words of isaiah and the prophets to denounce the sins of in the vulgar tongue would be to offend the millionaires of the congregation and lessen the salary of the worthy divine the late chief justice chase once

consolation to the sorrowful or curing to the sick and yet from marble pulpits to pews the work goes on we beg pardon it does not go on the divines complain of attendance they are startled by the fact that not of our population of sixty millions are really attending what can be done to popularize the pulpit there is but one way and that is to make the people desire to attend time was when the great truths of christianity were new to the human race the multitud es were eager to hear of the revelation and the church sent out its missionaries to preach and teach mankind so far knowledge of these truths is concerned the civilized people have been taught there is not criminal in jail but knows more theology than paul the people are weary of this everlasting thrash of theological chaff the civilized world is fairly saturated with preaching which has come to be stale ﬂat and in every sense unproﬁtable instead of asking the people to come to the church let the church go to the people this is the secret of the sneers attending the catholic faith there is with it very little preaching but great deal of practice its orphan asylums its homes the aged poor its hospitals to say nothing of its great body of devoted priests and holy sisters of charity tell why it is that its templ es are thronged and its conversions almost miraculous it is grave error to suppose that true religion is to be advanced through the intellect it makes its appeal to the heart if it is not refuge to the woful wayfarers of earth it is nothing if the sorrowful may not ﬁnd comfort they who are in pain patience and hope if the poor may not get sympathy and aid and the dying consolation it is of doubtful good the preaching all that we can say is that when one produces evidence and proceeds to argue he admits

excellent comic opera it steadily holds its own in spite of the critics and after run continues popular ever aronson says it may remain at the casino until the end of april gilbert and sullivan s produc tions are always new always attractive each has character of its own yet one could fail to detect the humor of gilbert and the merry melodies of sullivan in them all if one may venture to

and is disguised one of the yeomen of the guard with whom in spite of her vows the young girl falls in love pardon fairfax arrives his identity is established the singer learns that the man she loves is already her husband and all ends happily in this transmutation of character from the imprisoned sorcerer to one of the we recognize the topsyturvydom of gilbert which is the distinguishing mark of his genius from the bab ballads all through his later productions in catchwords the present opera is lacking and in the puns which never failed to draw out the ohs of the audience but there is the same genial undercurrent of innocent humor which years has amused the whole public and which gilbert deserves the lasting gratitude of world too much given to and mental worry if merry heart doeth good like medicine it is safe to say that the prescriptions of this most ingenious dramatic author have effected more widespread good than those of the most celebrated followers of æsculapius it is especially to its music that the operetta owes its success in this production sullivan has excelled his former efforts the ﬁrst chorus is very ﬁne and in orchestra tion sir arthur shows himself to be without rival its pure melodies form valuable addition to english music and mark the growth of new school of which he is the leader the inﬂuence of wagner is clearly seen in some of its majestic marches but the belford magazine volume ii 8 january 1889 project gutenberg ebook https escapes the metaphysical and unintelligible harmonies of the german school sir arthur has evidently aimed at producing more classical composition than any of his previous works and he has done this perhaps at some slight sacriﬁce of immediate popularity the jingle of pinafore and the pirates is replaced by more sober style which is likely to produce lasting impression on english music mary anderson captured the town usual on her return from england early in november palmer s theatre was so crow ded that it was difﬁcult to get seat even four weeks in advance and the audiences were so enthusiastic that their enthusiasm constituted quite an interruption to the play she chose the winter s tale her opening piece taking the parts both of hermione the queen and of her daughter perdita miss anderson is the ﬁrst actress who has ever dared to so interpret the play she tried it at the london lyceum to the horror of the critics but it proved great success the resemblance between hermione and her daughter which shakespeare insists on so strongly gave miss anderson the idea of trying both parts this plan had the additional advantage that the leading lady is not suppressed by being cut out of the act in which hermione does not appear her studies abroad have undoubtedly improved our mary the coldness and statuesqueness with which she has been reproached could not now be discovered by the most adverse critic she is more womanly softer less angular and more graceful the programme at palm er s should have been varied so to give the public opportunity to see her in the old rôles that used to charm all beholders one must not forget the exquisite scenery with which this piece has been set it was used at the lyceum and although it has been considerably cut down to ﬁt the smaller stage of palmer s theatre it is one of the best settings ever seen in this country edwin booth and lawrence

is wide and varied ﬁeld and the author makes it intensely interesting we have called attention however to the fact that he is not altogether correct the english motive of turning the interest upon social caste is not true when applied to our mixed condition we have aristocratic class recognized in england and the assumption of such in real life is too ludicrous and unreal the purpose of the novelist mere wealth without culture and culture without wealth contend in mixed condition with each other without supplying the interest to be found in earnest endeavor to overcome unjust distinctions and power when fawcett does deal with class he is not always just in his miriam balestier published in the november number of belford s by far the most artistically beautiful work from the pen of our author he by implication attacks an entire profession that has held through generations not only the admiration but love of the public there is absolutely nothing in the vocation of an actor that either degrades or demoralizes on the contrary there is much to elevate and work sustained by art found in painting and music the thought and feelings of the poets and while this is meant to amuse the stage has been the most potent factor in not only furthering civilization and culture in the masses but awaking in the hearts of the many the loftiest patriotism known to humanity it has awakened deeper feeling the home ﬁrmer trust in the law of right and stronger faith in virtue than aught else of human origin that taints stains and abuses have attached is fault of the drama one could well attack the bar or the pulpit because few unwor thy members have disgraced themselves to hold the stage responsible the recognized evils that have fastened themselves to part that we have senseless burlesques and lascivious exhibits of nakedness at majority of our theatres is the fault of the patrons not the stage the manager like any other dealer in commercial wares caters to the taste of his customers and the stage is more responsible their productions than the street is the wretched so long citizens take their wives and children to witness the shameless productions so long will the managers produce them and when remonstrated with shrug their shoulders and ask well what would you the pulpit denounces the drama but leaves untouched their congregations in their patronage of its abuse the great city of new york example lately entertained convocation of protestant clergymen met to consider the sad fact that they were preaching to empty churches and to devise means through which to awaken the religious conscience of the multitude they went to their meetings along streets where every other house was saloon where the beastly american practice of treating makes each door to ruin and they passed corners where the walls were aﬂame with pictured advertisements of naked legs bare bosoms and faces fairly enamelled with sin one reads their debates with amazemen their clerical minds were troubled with what the doings of papists catholics were designated our pen has carried us from our author of course fawcett will say with his strictures were aimed at the abuse and not the legitimate use of the drama but his fault was that he does not make this clear and by intimation he leaves himself open to the char ge aside from this his work is work of genius and his story of the little girl who struggled with such vain endeavor against her environment will live among the noblest productions of ﬁction given us the professor s sister by julian hawthorne belford clarke is the most successful work of successful novelist and holds the reader entranced from the ﬁrst page till nearly the last we say reader but not all readers hawthorne is peculiar in his work his eminent father was with more select audience he is at home in the wild weird production of humanity touched and marked by spiritualism that is far above and beyond the average readers of romance if it calls much culture in its way to enjoy work of art its creation called in the artist hawthorne belford magazine volume ii 8 january 1889 project gutenberg ebook https demand the same tastes and thought the author indulges in the little girl who craves or the traveller upon the cars who picks up book to lose in its pages the wearisome sense of travel will scarcely select the professor s sister and if he or she does will wonder what in the name of heaven it is all about there is another class however that will read with avidity and interest every page of this book and this class grows wider in our midst every day one meets at every turn man or woman who will tell in matter way generally that is positively comical of some experience he or she has had with spooks this not the experience with ghosts all that has long since been relegated to the gotten limbo of superstitious things one hears of communions with the dead told off one would tell of any ordinary occurrence common to our daily life this is the natural reaction of the human mind against the scientiﬁc materialism of the day that seeks to poison and destroy all religious faith religion is necessary to health of mind pure air is to that of body and when deprived of either we struggle of light and breath with instinctive desperation shut out the light of heaven from the soul be it in library or laboratory and one sickens and resists hawthorne wisely lays the scene of his story in germany the rareﬁed condition of the german mind is recognized the world over and through the everlasting smoke of philosophers and students pipes one is prepared all sorts of fantastic shapes moving through the mist the author opens with talk on occult subjects that sounds like voices heard in with the reader thus prepared he plunges him into drama where substantial men and women mingle with spirits and the strange story does overcome us like summer s cloud without our special wonder we have said the story holds one spell bound till near the end the dénoûment is not good calling spirits from the vasty deep is much easier than disposing of them after they come to give satisfactory explanation of the mystery and to exorcise the spirit back to rest make easy task and hawthorne is not to blame ﬁnding it difﬁcult we can not drop the book without calling attention to the author s happy use of english in depicting character here is specimen madame hertrugge was white red and black her skin was white her cheeks and lips red her hair eyes and eyebrows black her mouth was beautifully formed and ﬁrm with ﬁrm chin her eyes were rather full imperious and ardent she was overﬂowing with vitality the hand which she extended to one in greeting was soft but strong with long ﬁngers she was dressed in black became her recent widowhood but she had not the air of mourning much she was sensuous voluptuous but there was strength behind the voluptuousness you received from her powerful impression of sex every line of her every movement every look was woman and she made you feel that she valued you just so far you were man you might be nearly caliban man can be but if you were man she would consider you you might court her successfully with horsewhip but if she felt the master in you and were convinced that you were captivated by her she would accept you it was ludicrous to think of the senile old merchant having married such creature in fact marriage viewed in connect ion with this woman seemed an absurdity there was nothing holy about her nothing reserved nothing sacred i don t mean that she was not ladylike the phrase is she knew the society catechism and practised it to nicety but like clever actress rather than by instinct or sympathy it was obvious that she didn t value respectability and propriety the snap of her white ﬁngers save means to an end and if she were in the company of one whom she trusted intimately she would laugh those popular virtues to scorn with her warm insolent breath it was all the forms and ceremonies in the world could not disguise her her very dress suggested rather than concealed what was beneath it she was naked pagan there was help it

signs of satiety she had nothing of the blasé air she was thirsty life and she would appreciate every draught of it she was impatient to begin and contemplating her abounding triumphant delicious it seemed if she might maintain the of enjoyment until she was hundred it really inclined one to paganism to look at her what dreams may come by frank lin belford clarke is cleverly constructed story of english life by an american pen and the average reader is kept in doubt to the sex of the author there is clear incisive style of the masculine sort on one page that indicates the man there is treatment of female wearing apparel on another that gives proof of the feminine with us there is one feature that solves the doubt the pages abound in convictions now the female mind general thing is not given to doubt when woman believes anything she believes it and her faith is ﬁrm the solid rock she stands on hardpan to use phrase common to the paciﬁc slope although the book is built on dreams the theory of heredity it is written to promulgate is dream in the mind of this fair author we have called attention to the fact that the use of the novel to illustrate some doctri ne philosophical or religious is really an abuse one takes up such form of ﬁction to be amused and one feels put upon and abused to ﬁnd it an essay more or less learned on life and things if little information can be injected in the story unbeknownst like the parson s liquor told of by president lincoln well and good but it is rarely done successfully if philosophy is indulged in one quickly detects the bald head and wrinkled brow if it is religion the cloven hoof or wicked tail of satan betrays the author when it was once proposed by staff ofﬁcer to drive an obnoxious guest from headquarters by liberal use of burnt brimstone general sherman said that is high strategy in its way but it is not when one goes one does not care to be killed by bears said an old hunter and when seeker after amusement to be found in opens what purports to be novel it is shocking to ﬁnd it learned treatise on some abstruse subject the book before us is another illustration of this defect it opens with an exquisite picture of constantinople hundred years since in this prologue some wicked conduct is rather hinted at than told after this the story opens and moves on pleasantly enough until the fact is developed that the hero and heroine are reproductions of the sinful grandfather and grandmother long since lost to the of the british empire what was evil in the ancestors is an innocent love in the descendants and the fair author exhibits considerable power by preserving the sanity of her characters to say nothing of that of the reader in the complications and situations that follow the book is of interest to us not so much what it accomplishes the promise of better things it exhibits all the qualities necessary to successful writer of ﬁction there is keen appreciation of character love of nature and clear incisive style that make combination which if properly directed insures success the passing of the belford magazine volume ii 8 january 1889 project gutenberg ebook https like some triumphal orient

handsome more than merely graceful more than man among s in but here he is almost in speaking distance and every step bringing him nearer isn t he going to be surprised isn t he going to be delighted isn t he going to shake her hand and smile that impenetrable smile how is this jerome has come and gone he did not look at did not once raise his eyes in passing just ahead of this poky little vehicle where mell awaited the return of miss josey stood lordly equipage all silver plate and shine with groom standing in front of the champing restive mettlesome animal eager to be off and gone somewhere the most restless of human hearts in human bosom into this nobby turnout jerome assisted miss rutland and then springing in himself grasped the reins from the groom s hands one awful moment to mell the horse stood straight upon his hind legs and then obeying jerome s voice who said in the quietest of tones go on rhesus gave one wild plunge and dashed ahead leaving mell with stiﬂed feeling if she was buried alive under twenty feet of volcanic ashes but what did it passing her without sign of recognition jerome might be of truant disposition of unstable fancy and superior in his own strength to most ordinary rules but he couldn t help knowing her face to face there was bare possibility that he had not really seen her his sight come to think of it was none of the best or at least he habitually wore an interesting little dangling from his and sometimes though not often stuck it across the bridge of his shaped nose with telling ef fect with such arguments and much wanting to be convinced mell recovered her equipoise to some extent managing to hear about half miss josey was saying and to answer only once or twice very wildly at random arrived at their destination she assisted her patroness in receiving and arranging the baskets this important contingent of the day s proceedings being satisfactorily dispose d of they followed the example of the crowd at large and strolled

under favoring conditions mell loved nature but not she loved jerome her brains were crammed with wild speculations in regard to him which accounts the fact that she had mind on that eventful day to invest in all those wonderful manifestations of nature s power and nature s mystery during their circuitous meanderings two young men joined miss josey and were duly presented to her protégé they were ﬁne young fellows and very pleasant too but mell continued so preoccupied in the vain racking of her brain trying to imagine what had become of jerome and clara rutland that she did not catch their names and replied to their efforts at conversation with monosyllabic remarks one of them tempered straightforward stalwart young chap armed with rod and bait asked her with ﬂattering degree of warmth if she wouldn t go with them but reﬂecting if she did so she would in all likelihood be out of the way of seeing jerome hours to come mell declined without circumlocution glad to get rid of him on the pretext of having promised to assist miss josey in her onerous duties commissary of subsistence discouraged the young ﬁsherman bowed and left such pretty girl he remarked to his companion it s pity she doesn t know what to say think of mell creecy not knowing what to say the girl who was always saying things nobody else had ever thought of saying such is the pretty pass to which an unhappy love may bring the brightest girl and after all she saw absolutely nothing of jerome until all those wagon upon wagon loads of baskets had been ransacked and their tempting contents emptied out upon the festive board giving forth grateful suggestions of the coming meal while squeezing lemons ﬂushed and more than ever anxious deft of hand but uneasy in mind the buggy containing jerome and miss rutland dashed into the grove we ve been all the way to pudney called out the young lady holding up to view some boxes and here are the all right responded miss josey but let us have the ice the prizes are of consequence to famishing people but the dinner is and we are about ready she s powerfully interested in the prizes commented girl at mell s elbow but she has good right to why inquired mell because she is going to be crowned queen of love and beauty how you know i ve put things together and that s the way they sum up to that young man with her can beat all of our boys and he s going to crown her is he ejaculated mell let him dare to it before jerome devonhough should place victor s crown on clara rutland s head she what would she anything muttered mell between her teeth poor mell she had been to such an expensive school and learned so many things and not one of them was of the slightest use to her in this sore strait could there not be established new school girls differing materially from the old founded upon more adaptable basis taught after hitherto unknown method and belford magazine volume ii 8 january 1889 project gutenberg ebook https in its curriculum of studie s that branch of

get her money s worth in german gutturals and french verbs she would at least have indulged in less reckless expenditure of time in obtaining useless knowledge but let us not blame the schools over much and without just discrimination not all the fault lies at their door something there is amiss among the girls themselves it may be that they love and hate and talk too much even in one language in girl of mell s temperament love would not have been love lacking jealousy and its revenge more s the pity mell that picnic dinner was splendid ever ybody enjoyed it but mell and it was not the young ﬁsherman s fault that she did not although he was in attendance upon another young lady who seemed to know what to say and said it incessantly he kept an eye on mell and proffered her every tempting dish he could lay his hands upon to purpose mell could not eat she tried and the very ﬁrst mouthful paralyzed her ability to swallow it was altogether much she could to keep from sobbing aloud in the faces of all these omnivorous happy people what made it all the worse at breakfast time she had been happier than happy in fact to eat and now here at dinner she was too miserable and there sat the author of all her misery not twelve feet distant perfectly oblivious to her proximity nay her very existence not by any chance did he ever look toward her or show any consciousness of her presence so devoted and so marked were his attentions to that uninteresting and anything but attractive clara rutland that mell heard it commented upon on all sides these two so sufﬁcient unto themselves were among the ﬁrst to leave the festal board and wander off in sylvan haunts anon all appetites were satisﬁed and amid the buzzing of tongues and boisterous ﬂashes of merriment the multitude again dispersed unobserved and in very unenviable frame of mind the unhappy mell stole away to herself the paramount desire of her wounded spirit was to get beyond the ken of human eye in hidden recess screened by an overhanging rock she sat down the prey of such discordant and chaotic thoughts wear away in time the bulwarks of reason it was yesterday the day before longer that he had called upon god to witness that she alone was dear to him she only precious in his sight and now how stands the case ah dear god you heard him say it oh eye you have looked upon him this day and will not lightni ng blast from an indignant heaven palsy the false tongue whose words have more meaning than loose rubble into the heaviness of these thoughts growing heavier with access of bitterness the moments sped there came the ringing tones of voice well known to mell shaking off her lethar gy and looking out from her hiding place she beheld the object of all these harrowing reﬂections grasping miss rutland s two hands in his own they together and laughingly descended precipitous declivity once down they proceeded with access of laughter to push their way through tangle of brushwood to get out of this into the beaten path they must necessarily advance in the direction of her place of concealment and devoured with jealousy inﬂamed with distrust tortured with the cruel madness of love mell determined to satisfy herself on the spot to whether jerome s avoidance was premeditated or unintentional just the couple emer ged from their nether difﬁculties and stood on clear ground and ﬁrm footing mell suddenly stepped forth upon the same path confronting them face to face miss rutland did not speak mell knew she would not although they had attended the same boarding school years lived in the same house and graduated in the same class where miss rutland unlike herself achieved distinction of being content to be accounted distinguished through the sepulchre of dead father mell did not expect recognition from her in such place at such time the neighboring rocks were alive with the best families in the county and clara was one of those feeble brained persons who have minds suited to all purposes save use belford magazine volume ii 8 january 1889 project gutenberg ebook https of that kind which may be put on and off movable garment such creatures tossed about helplessly on the billows of circumstance keep one ﬁnge r on the public pulse and know you or know you not according to its beat all this mell cared nothing in that supreme moment one swift glance at clara and after that every faculty of her mind and body was centered on jerome he was evidently surprised at being nearly run over by this blustering and blowsy young lady but beyond nothing he looked her full in the face the unknowing look of total stranger the result of this look was to mell calamitous waving blankness came before her sight her knees trembled her strength seemed poured out like water and staggering to tree she caught hold of it support dead this after all that had passed between them was simply brutal but the despised and slighted country girl was only momentarily stunned not crushed

this thing is going to be the making of you mell rather say the undoing miss josey so don t be so frightened but hold your head high and bear your honors bravely and remember all eyes are upon you the

ﬂutter of delight now proceeded to put on her sash to replace the knot of ribbons at her throat to pass her hands assuagingly across mell s wilderness of frolicsome hair and to put an extra touch or two to her simple toilette generally whispering words of stimulation and encouragement all the while thoroughly put to rights miss josey placed the girl s hand into that of very grand president of the

about second prize just like all things having failed in securing the ﬁrst were i in your place i would not try the and she left him much angered whew softly whistled jerome it strikes that what pleases one woman doesn t please another why is that it also strikes that it s use trying to pleas any of man can t not unless he conver ts himself into sort of synchronous multiplex machine and tries

all sides an object of curiosity to all classes and conditions all eager sight of her some eager to be made known to her others wanting to catch look word smile mell heard some one at her elbow say softly turning she confronted jerome in ﬂash her whole appearance changed the moment before she had been gracious sovereign accepting with queenly grace the homage of her loyal subjects now she was an outraged monarch jealous of her rank standing on her dignity how dare you sir asked mell eyeing him haughtily and drawing herself up to her fullest height how dare you to speak to how dare you touch i have not the honor of your acquaintance sir jerome was undeniably astonished but this was not the time not the place to indulge in feeling of astonishment or to make an exhibition of himself or her your majesty said jerome with his characteristic coolness will graciously pardon the crowd is great it pressed heav ily upon all sides and i have not been able to resist he fell back at once and mell bowed just if nothing had happened to the gentleman whom the master of ceremonies was in the act of introducing to her in the crush jerome encountered rube he had been called off on some matter under discussion among those running the s way of putting was now endeavoring to push his way back to mell old fellow said jerome by way of congratulation said rube by way of thanks and seizing his friend s hand he wrung it if his intention was to wring it clean of y re trump don t mention it begged jerome he began to laugh again some reason the whole thing was excessively amusing to jerome but i will mention it persisted rube i ll thank you it to my dying day it was so on your part considering oh was it exclaimed his companion choking down his risibles don t exactly feel it that way mere not to

soothingly you think so it s rankling casus belli at present i can tell you but how about your rustic beauty eh rube is she pleased does she like it pleased like it you bet she does she s delighted one has introduced yet jerome next remarked quite incidentally and i am sure if her gracious majesty smiles upon any of her loyal subjects it ought to be that s so so come right along now they reached her side mell here s the very best fellow in the world said rube out of the fullness of his heart getting the prescribed forms of etiquette in the absorption of warm feeling mell had noted their approach she was not taken unawares she bent her head slightly to the newcomer she looked him over whole minute it seemed before she opened her lips and said how you mr orld those near enough to hear roared with laughter the young queen s manner made the whole thing so absurdly funny and perhaps there is nothing crowd so much enjoys the taking down of person whom they regard in the light of one much needi ng to be taken down his name is devonhough rube hastened to explain not relishing the laugh against his friend at this particular time by his particular fault mr devonhough miss creecy he is my very best friend mell shake hands with mell did so but without the faintest glimmering of smile and with such glacia l dignity fairly charged the atmosphere with iciness not content with this she met all his subsequent ef forts to cultivate her acquaintance with the briefest and chilliest repulses rube was much concerned he saw dimly that his best friend had not somehow made favorable impression upon his future wife but he could not tell the why or wherefore while he wondered within him what he could to put things on pleasanter footing between them someone else demanded his attention see here said jerome soon rube s back was turned i hope you now consider sufﬁciently punished i hope you feel even i hope you won t treat to any more state airs i am tired of them your majesty let tell you something mark well my words it is to not rube you owe your present to you the unsmiling countenance now broke into ripple of scorn what ridiculous thing you to say the whole thing has been ridiculous said jerome i never in my whole life ever enjoyed anything so much tis the one grain of truth which gives point to the ridiculous think of rube dear fellow so anxious to crown you knowing nothing suspecting nothing begging not to run fast and i so ten thousand times more anxious than he could possibly be to have you you yes don t you know in your heart mellville that i wanted you crowned i know nothing of the kind when man wants thing done he does it with his own hand when he does not want it done or cares not much about it he does it with another man s hand had you been anxious you would not have left it to but with that wreath in my own hand mell i was morally bound to put it upon another belford magazine volume ii 8 january 1889 project gutenberg ebook

words morally bound eh yes mellville you get i am guest in her mother s i not forget it i remember it every hour in the whole but does that make it incumbent upon you to ignore jerome look in the face what is clara rutland to you nothing exclaimed he savagely between compressed lips less than nothing hundred times i have wished her at the bottom there use to send her there now it s too late the knowledge of what she had done the wretchedness she saw it was destined to entail upon her all this while couchant like wild beast within her now uprose into her expressive features jerome was struck with it what you mean he asked you will know soon enough she responded he stooped to pick up the handkerchief she had dropped and in restoring it his hand so cool and steady came in contact with hers so hot and tremulous it touched and lingered lingered long and clung in tender pressure while voice so low and ﬁrm voice oh so faint and sweet stole its way into her ear murmuring but one word one little fond word which moved her in the strangest way which thrilled yet soothed her cooler than snow it fell upon her burning cheeks warmer than sunbeam into her freezing heart that little game with rube passed out of her memory but looking up all too soon she saw him he smiled upon her he was glad to see that she and devonhough were getting along quite pleasantly i wish you would go away she suddenly exclaimed turning upon her companion rudely go back to clara rutland you have business here i not believe word you have said to i yet fail to comprehend why man may not be the master of his own sighed jerome just so it is in life just man begins to think he has put everything in order and settled the question here comes chaos again you not understand that mell well i will tell you every man has on my side i am surprised that you with all your quickness of apprehension have not been able to see clearer and deeper into this subject you ought to have known you must have felt that i had some good reason acting towards you i have have you been true to your promise to trust trust blindly i fear not you have been cruelly angry with ever since this morning when i dared not and why was it that you dared not speak demanded mell her lip curling contemptuously but with tremolo movement in her voice does it then require some courage man in your position to speak to poor girl like rube does not think with rube it is dif it is very dif ferent there is false pride about and i hope there is none about but mell you not in the least understand my i know much about it i care to know henceforth devonhough let us be we can never be strangers said jerome he was growing earnest he spoke very low and with that rapidity of utterance which accompanies excited feelings this time nor place mell such an explanation but here and now i will make it i belford magazine volume ii 8 january 1889 project gutenberg ebook https exist under the ban of your displ easure know then dear that i would not speak to you this morning your own sweet mine i was driven to it to protect your good name and keep you out of the mouths of those creatures who have nothing else to talk about but other people s failings had clara rutland once seen speak to she one mom ent suspected the least acquaintance between us that monster curiosity would have lifted its unpitying voice in hundred awkward questions how did you come to know mell creecy where did you meet her who introduced you to her and so on to the end of long chapter i did not wish to say your sake that i had never met you anywhere but in cornﬁeld i did not wish to say your sake that we had became acquainted in very delightful but by means conventional manner i have thought it best all along to keep the fact of our acquaintance in the background until we were brought together in some way perfectly legitimate and customary always your sake dear not mine now you know in part i will make clean breast of all my difﬁculties so disperse these clouds and give one sweet look ere i instead of that mell swallowed lump in her throat which felt big her head she studiously avoided the rest of the day any further speech with jerome his explanation was plausible enough on its face but mell was in condition of mind to draw conclusions which might stand the test of reason or be satisfactorily demonstrated on geometrical principles and nothing that jerome could say was now calculated to act sedative on mell s nerves she kept whispering to herself he feels it yes he feels it and thus nourished the ﬁrmness and the bravado necessary to her in the further requirements of her high position she needed it all and more when it came to bestowing upon jerome handsome pair of spurs the second prize of the day certainly he cared her or why this glow on his clear face or why this light in his speaking eyes now bent upon her mell turned her head quickly i can t understand why you don t like devonhough rube remarked noticing the movement i think it odd

to get out of it well i don t laughed rube much appreciating the sly humor of the question by seven clock the day s festivities were concluded and then ensued melting of all hostile elements into homogeneous mass all ravenous after and made cake and heterogeneous devouring of the same after which the crowd well pleased but pretty well fagged out turned their faces homeward under sun still

rank unknown in society seated beside miss josey in the little pony phaeton full of fair hopes and inspirations in the evening the afﬁanced wife of the and most eligible young man in the county returning to the old in grand style leaning back on soft cushions beside her future lord in ﬂashy open carriage drawn by ravishing pair of high mettled roans ambitious indeed must be that girl not satisﬁed with this wonderful result of one single operation in matrimonial stocks and yet mell is not happy she forgets to give heed to what rube is saying she forgets almost to answer him back so full of regret is she her own lost self she had had thousand longings to get out of her old self and out of her old life and now on the threshold of new existence mell ﬁnds herself with only one to get back where she came from if only she if only she could most gladly would this lately crowned queen have relinquished the glories of empire the spoils of captive hearts the trophies of social triumphs the high emprise of brilliant future only to be simple mell once more ah poor mell not sale now sold belford magazine volume ii 8 january 1889 project gutenberg ebook https pla yer s on stage

again in the meadow nor anywhere saddest of all she had herself laid the axe to the root of her own happiness she had baited her own hook and caught big ﬁsh she had provoked her own doom and herself sealed it rube was not to blame and had made out good case had he loved her less he would perhaps have acted dif ferently she had digged pitfall her own occupation and of all comfortless and stony places such pitfalls this make the hardest lying out in the narrow hall on its own particular peg hung mell s white she took it down and put it on her head and walked slowly to the top of the hill with intention of going to the meadow herself her feelings demanded that she should ﬁnd out if jerome was there he was strolling moodily to and fro in deep thought he knows now rube has told him he despises her and yesterday he had loved her look at him down there in the meadow beam from the sun breath from the hills part of the morning the most glorious expression of nature in all nature s glory observe how he walks note how he stands still most men know how to walk and most men know how to stand still after fashion but not after jerome s fashion in motion jerome is poem set standing still he is grace doing nothing he can lift one hand and in that ordinary act sow the seed of dozen beautiful fancies he can wield such mastery over the physical forces of expression has wondrous potency to sway the emotions of others so she thought so she stood hidden herself from sight but with the meadow in full view and while so thinking and so standing drinking him in with every breath feeding upon him with her eyes devouring him with her soul she the afﬁanced wife of another oh wicked mell jerome grows impatient he looks at his watch and turns inquiringly towards the hill and mell ﬂies back to the house if pursued by ﬁery dragons if he but caught sight of her if he but crooked his ﬁnger at her she would go down there and then mell was not blind to her own weakness the afternoon brought rube overwhelmingly happy overwhelmingly devoted she must take an airing with him in his brand new buggy and while they scoured the country round about rube was making diligent inquiry to how soon they might get married mell caught her breath and in the same breath at possible reprieve won t you give little time to think she pleaded it has come so sudden hasn t it though cried happy rube you half realize the romance of the thing mellville tis like page out of knigh the days of lances and standards and adventures when warrio rs in steel swore by the and won fair women s smiles by deeds

man her sweet sake i will win it this was the time mell to speak she wanted to speak did not there were just exactly six reasons why she did not here they are all in row reason number was not quite sure of sure perhaps in regard to his affections but not his intentions love is much but not everything and lover surrounded by difﬁculties is not to be depended upon matrimonially number was resolutely bent upon getting out of this mean sordid life ever and what way was there but this way number was rich and rube s wife would be rich too her part she was sick and tired of poverty poverty in world governed by wealth is the most unpardonable sin in that world s decalogue number was in society and what ambitious woman ever yet saved her soul outside the magic circle of society number was an aristocrat and rube s wife would be ex necessitate rei an aristocrat also her creator she believed had intended her an aristocrat otherwise why had he endowed her with intellect beauty and the power to sway men s passions number fact that she did not love rube had in reality nothing to with rube s eligibility husband he would make very good one an inﬁnitely better one than none at all of course she would be paying tremendous price all these worldly advantages mell was aware of that all the while but after deducting from the gross weight of their true value the real or approximate weight of their possible evils and disadvantages she would undoubtedly still be getting the best of good bar gain what is life but an enigmatical offset of losses and much gain on the one hand so much loss on the other and what was this transaction between herself and rube but repetition under somewhat different formula of those mathematical problems worked out on her slate at school it was all very simple young woman if you were in mell s place if you had six good reasons not telling the man you are about to marry that you did not care straw about him wouldn t you hold your peace then cast stones at mell mell was deeply moved by rube s words but not deep enough to damage her future prospects and since woman has very poor prospects outside of matrimony ought we not to excuse her attending closely to business at all events although mell s thoughts were heavy and her soul stirred within her and her thick breathing almost stiﬂed in painful sense of guilt she did not say word feeling that rube s eyes were ﬁxed upon her she raised to him her own suffused in tears an answer which fully satisﬁed her companion from which it will appear that woman may weep the man she takes and yet keep on taking him in and what can man how could rube tell that it was the hidden pathos of his own groundless faith and not feeling of sympathetic affection which brought such softness of expression into that girl s luminous orbs if the actual is the only true thing and amounts to everything it really does in the school of realism there is still one difﬁculty to be get hold of the

once doubted mell creecy s love the purest myth among them all he came after this every day to the little house upon the hill and had it out comferterble in the parler old man creecy had advised jerome to he courted with the enthusiasm of an incorrigible faddist over new fad and lover of those olden days of which he had spoken when goodly knights tilted in the jousts of arms and won fair lady

consternation when its young master announced his intention of taking to wife old jacob creecy s daughter consternation but hardly surprise rube had ever been one of those lawless members of households privileged to say and outrageous things and expected to turn out of the beaten track on the slightest provocation miss rutland was most concerned said she to her brother rube why not marry female ojibbwa and be done with it that would be an improvement on mell creecy mésalliance my god rube you can t bring girl here into this house your wife whose father talks like nigger who says dis and dat and udder or you expect to hold your position in society your place among honorable men simply by the grace of heaven this was severe but it was not half in fact that rube had to hear before he got rid of clara but it was not the ﬁrst time he had brought hornet s nest about his ears nor swam against the stream nor borne the brunt of clara s tongue through much practice rube had pretty well mastered the art of holding out which does not consist so much in talking back in saying nothing moreover his cause was good and half man can hold out with good cause to hold on one hard speech rube did make to clara he told her in effect that whateve r might be the grammatical shortcomings of old jacob creecy himself his daughter knew more in one single minute than clara would ever learn in lifetime rutland was not less unwilling but more reasonable you are my only son she said to him my i expected you to add lustre to the family and make great the family is illustrious enough replied he

certain day rube came usual to the but not usual alone his mother came with looking about her with prying eyes and nose bent on thorough investigation and mind ready to ferret out every idea in mell s brain mind ready to probe every weak place in mell s character mind ready to catechize every integument in mell s body the look of things about the premises prepossessed her at once in the girl s favor the house was neither large handsome nor fresh but it was venerable an attribute greatly esteemed by people of rank much of its unpainted ugliness was concealed in trailing vines and creeping ivy much of its dilapidation shrouded in luxuriant shrubbery an adaptation of the simplest elements of relief technique the little front garden in its walks and beds brilliant in blossoms was just like spruce in her best bib and tucker the little parlor daintily furnished and tastefully arranged where the visitor trod not on bare boards but neat carpet commingling turkish forms and yankee

tale mell had learned something useful after all at that famous to the strumming of this guitar she could sing you with inimitable taste and in voice an english madrigal or french chansonnette or one of those plaintive love ditties which ﬁnds its way into the listener s heart through any language now mother said rube looking about him with pardonable pride isn t this pleasant have we amid all our grandeur any such snug den this well rube it is charming multum in parvo one may say but whom have we here it was mell halting one instant in the doorway attired in fresh muslin dress with ribbons to

very happy and mell looked ﬂatteringly conscious of the great lady s condescension and blushingly avowed her unalterable determination to try this interesting little ceremony seemed to dissipate all the underlying displeasure at rube s choice in his mother s mind she watched the girl closely during the interview which followed many girls are pretty and not many are to be found well educated mell creecy or thoroughly equipped by both nature and education to entertain to amuse to fascinate this was that part of mell which tuck arter her ole daddy old jacob was wont to say even clara rutland s manners were not more easy and irreproachable and clara had never been half so ready in speech and apt in reply it was matter of agreeable wonder to rutland how uneducated farmer could have such daughter and she wondered also if this phenomenal social prodigy could be found so strongly marked in any other land under the sun obeying an instinct of curiosity the visitor inquired your father and mother melville are they here will they see us not if i can help it inwardly outwardly very dif ferent so sorry mother is not well she is rarely well and rarely sees anyone father is usual busy upon

ground more of god s secrets than the rest of us ﬁnd among the that is pretty idea mellville said rutland bless you exclaimed rube that s nothing she s full of full of them yes and feeding his honest soul upon them in place of the real bread of affection the visit was long and pleasant and at its close mell accompanied her guests to the very door of their carriage there rutland again touched the

with very little of rube s society unless we ﬁrst secure yours will you come then and make us little visit you are kind answered she coloring beautifully with intensity of gratiﬁcation most kind i will come with exceeding these were perhaps the ﬁrst unstudi ed words she had uttered in rutland s presence there was doubt about her wanting to go to the bigge house she had been wanting to go there

to herself and man s difﬁculties must be allowed to interfere with my future and rube is so eligible good fellow too most excellent fellow there s something however what is it we will tell you is not

unnatural how strange he should ﬁnd her there and with so good right to be there surely years have intervened since those lovely mornings in the meadow when sukey cropped the grass and she sat on the old and jerome lay at her feet surely long long years so long that jerome has forgotten all about her she is now to him only miss creecy the prospective wife of his nearest friend the prospective mistress of the bigge house and not attractive it would appear in these new surroundings others very likely did not notice how he never spoke to her if he could help it how he never looked at her if

spoken it is the honorable archibald pender gast who is and somewhat portly who has big round shoulders and jolly way of looking at things who bellows out his words with broad accent and says aw aw with tremendous effect who wears his whiskers la manièr anglaise beﬁts man proud of his british ancestry and his english ways this great man s marvellous wealth and honors and incalculable inﬂuence in national councils and stupendous grandeur of future prospects carry everything before the bigge house and everywhere else adapting herself with versatile cleverness to these prevailing conditions in her unaccustomed environment mell s conception of modes and manners expanded day by day and she began to see plainly good many objects only dimly discerned before i don t think remarked she quite innocently to rube the day after the great man s advent that mr devonhough admires the senator much the rest of i shouldn t wonder rube looked knowing and laughed if he was badly stuck on you he appears to be on clara i wouldn t admire him either but said mell is jerome yes certainly didn t you know that i thought you did they are in the same interesting predicament ourselves only clara won t announce because she wants to keep up to the last minute her good times with other men i don t see how devonhough stands it and i m awfully glad you re not that sort of girl how long asked rl trying to steady her voice trying to maintain her rôle of disinterested inquirer how long have they been engaged repeated rube let months at six months you seem surprised he turned his glance full upon her not at all said she pulling herself to rights i was only thinking that you ought to be willing to wait long so i would many years that matter if there was any good reason why i should but there is not not one and so six months ejaculated mell in the privacy of her own room so all the while he lay at my feet he was engaged to clara rutland mell began to understand jerome s difﬁculties later on she saw clearly some other things clara is fond of jerome and would gladly that reason marry him but she is likewise attracted by the mighty senator s wealth and national importance and english ancestry and future expectations and such reasons leans matrimonially towards the honorable archibald who is thirty years older than jerome but thirty years richer and thirty years greater between two ﬁres clara meanwhile keeps to the letter of the law with jerome and holds out in ambuscade le pot au lait to the honorable archibald closer acquaintance with the interior circuit of these unwanted

sense of wondering comprehension the arab proverb all sunshine makes the another thing these women at ease with nothing in the world to mell was thunderstruck to discover were the hardest worked people she had ever known striving each on daily of dawdling dressing and pleasure seeking after some personal end some empty honor or some favorite phantom just out of reach what bickering and strife what small conspiracies what canker at the roots and stunting in the fruit what guelph and ghibbeline factions in the midst of all this music and dancing and laughter the same amoun t of time spent in good cause mell s long head could not but realize would ease the rack plant many blade of corn staunch many bleeding wound wipe the death drops from many ghastly brow lift up heaps of fallen heroes prone on stony plains and plant the standard of the cross on many benighted shore outside mell had yearned towards this stronghold of the rich place where there was plenty of room growth and happiness inside she discovered with astonishment and groan that there was plenty of room there dullness and unhappiness well idleness without repose leisure and ease tears and time to shed every side and unexpected in the substance of things she had pictured to her own fancy fair and only fair then interrogated mell of her conscious ego if not here where dwelleth content mayhap mell upon the rock where the hawks nest or in that haven where the roving wind hideth its tired self rest somewhere but never among the haunts of men the deep hath its treasures and there are treasures of the mine the mind hath its treasures and there are treasures of store but content is the golden treasure hardest of all to ﬁnd and when found hardest to keep one night there was ball and the social lights of pudney and cragmore and the capital of the state itself turned out in full force the bigge house was crammed to its utmost capacity dressing early mell left her room to other guests in various stages of evening toilet and descending to the ﬁrst ﬂoor looked about her some quiet spot where time she could hide herself and her tumultuous thoughts the large reception room was dimly lighted yet and empty apparently glad to ﬁnd it so she walked in and standing between the long taperi ng column draped in tulle clouds took length back and front inspection of her own person now this dainty rustic maiden we have seen looked at when framed in necked simple made sweet picture any eye but it was in some respects tame presentation compared to this gorgeously arrayed being bedecked in ﬂowers and low corsage with marble shoulders shapely throat alabaster neck and rounded arms bewilderingly displayed cunningly concealed this being can not be bona ﬁde woman she is more likely study from reynolds or gainsborough who has stepped out of canvas and gilt frame on the wall there merely to delight the living eye and inﬂame the fumes of vital fancy not long however whether sprite or woman did she pose there in admiration of her own face and ﬁgure truth to tell they have both become hateful in the girl s own sight her fair face looks to herself longer blossom sparkling with dew the ethereal

attack but every little loophole needing to be defended at every point mask very troublesome to wear but not upon any account to be discarded since it concealed the discordance of secret love and the clanking of chain but now in this empty room in this deep silence and blessed solitude where there is eye to see ear to hear she will throw off one thankful moment the ugly hateful thing she will

knowledge her pulses strangely became aware that she was not in reality alone how in the absence of visual impression we can only say by an instinct unaccountable the phenomenon of sound waves which excite wire vibrations she was mysteriously imbued with another presence if such thing is possible and in all the world there was but one who could so clothe the circumambient air in his own personality that one was jerome devonhough perceiving she now knew he was there he got up and came towards her mell did not look at him she looked upon the ﬂoor he looked straight at her and looked so long and hard and with gaze so ﬁxed and steady that he seemed to be slowly absorbing her very being into his own entity when this became intolerable the apparition in tulle wrestling with the situation on war footing with her own feelings lifted from glowing face those lapis lazuli eyes of stones liquiﬁed by soul his face and dropped them in one swift turn of those eyes she had taken in much of that stern cold accusing face she could well bear but there was nothing on it she had not expected to see she knew the unrelenting disdain of that proud nature what is stained unworthy unwomanly well she knew its strength to esteem its gift to exalt its power to bless and to look into once loving face now grown cold and to ﬁnd there longer an indulgent smile nor approving aspect is

sardonic laugh rests on slim foundation mine is of different stamp it leads to envy the very worms they crawl under my feet even worm is free to go where his wishes lead worm is free to ﬁnd an easy death and quick when life becomes mell pressed her hand upon her heart beating so heart in troubled breast which rose and fell vessel amid tempestuous seas you can not blame it said she wildly you slighted you triﬂed with you goaded to it i would it again if need be once has been enough jerome told her in sadness speech was an effort to him when man regards some treasure once his own now lost

ashamed after he has hurt woman she may have deserved it and yet he feels ashamed one would think that now after this ungentlemanly conduct on jerome s part mell the high spirited will not only be full of tremendous indignation but be willing and more than willing to give him up good and all how little you know woman you who think that harmless man never does anywhere so little harm in woman s

good material in her his own moulding we must never approach the contemplation of any man s requirements in wife with our minds full of loose generalities there is so much of the fool in every man the wisest man who falls in love he falls in love not so much with what is ideally lovable in woman but what is practically complemental to his own nature jerome being strong loved mell who was weak and

would be he was only telling her he knew not how hard he pressed upon those tender hands he only knew he might never clasp them in his own again it was terrible not alone mell one would have thought

the whiteness of her face the appeal mercy in those eyes seeking his own had soothing effect upon jerome he would now put forth all his strength and quietly say softly he pressed to his lips one of those imprisoned hands softly in rapture of despairing renunciation he was about to the same with the other when the glint of rube s solitaire the pledge of her hated bondage to another the glaring witness of her treachery towards himself ﬂashed into his eyes and overcame all his good resolutions with look of unutterable reproach with gesture of undying contempt he tossed the offending hand back
