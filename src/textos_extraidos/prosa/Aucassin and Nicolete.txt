email ccx074 coventry aucassin and nicolete dedicated to the hon james russell lowell introduction there is nothing in artistic poetry quite akin to aucassin and by rare piece of good fortune the one manuscript of the has escaped those waves of time which have wrecked the bark of menander and left of sappho but few ﬂoating fragments the very form of the tale is peculiar we have nothing else from the twelfth or thirteenth century in the alternate prose and verse of the 1 we have fabliaux in verse and prose arthurian romances we have chansons geste heroic poems like roland unrhymed assonant laisses but we have not the alternations of prose with laisses in lines it can not be certainly known whether the form of aucassin and nicolete was familiar by many jogleors or wandering minstrels and such nicolete in the tale feigned herself to be whether this is solitary experiment by the old captive its author contemporary gaston paris thinks him of louis vii 1 130 he was original enough to have invented or adopted from popular tradition form himself his originality aucassin and nicolete https everywhere in his one surviving masterpiece true he uses certain traditional formulae that have survived in his time they survived in homer s from the manner of purely popular poetry of volkslieder thus he repeats snatches of conversation always in the same or very nearly the same words he has stereotyped form like homer saying that one person addressed another ains traist au visconte la vile si l apela τον δαπαyειβομενος προσεφε like homer and like popular song he deals in recurrent epithets and changeless courtesies to aucassin the hideous is biax frère fair brother just the treacherous aegisthus is αμυμων in homer these are complimentary terms with moral sense in particular the jogleor is not more curious than homer or than the poets of the old ballads about giving novel descriptions of his characters homer s ladies are fair so nicolete and aucassin have each of them close yellow curls eyes of vair whatever that may mean and red lips war can not be mentioned except war where knights smite and are smitten and so forth the author is absolutely conventional in such matters according to the convention of his age and profession nor is his matter more original he tells story of thwarted and ﬁnally fortunate love and his hero is christened knight tamlane heroine paynim lady to be sure nicolete was baptized before the tale begins and it is she who is captive among christians not her lover usual who is captive among saracens the author has reversed the common arrangement and he appears to have cared little more than his reckless hero about creeds and dif ferences of faith he is not much interested in the recognition of nicolete by her great paynim kindred nor indeed in any of the business of the narrative the ﬁghting the storms and tempests and the burlesque of the kingdom of torelore what the nameless author does care is his telling of the the passion of aucassin and nicolete his originality lies in his charming medley of sentiment and humour of smiling compassion and sympathy with touch of mocking mirth the love of aucassin and des grans paines qu il soufri that is the one thing serious to him in the whole matter and that is not so very serious 2 the is mimnermus love and youth are the best things he knew deport du viel caitif now he has come to forty years and now they are with him longer but he does not lament like mimnermus like alcman like llwyarch hen what is life what is delight without golden aphrodite may i die says mimnermus when i am more conversant with these with secret love and gracious gifts and the bed of and alcman when his limbs waver beneath him is only saddened by the faces and voices of girls and would change his lot the 3 maidens with voices like honey sweetness that breathe desire would that i were with limbs that never could tire over the ﬂying with halcyons ever on wing keeping careless heart bird of the but our old captive having said farewell to love has yet kindly smiling interest in its fever and folly nothing better has he met even now that he knows lad is an he tells love story story of love overmastering without conscience or care of aught but the beloved and the viel caitif tells it with sympathy and with smile oh folly of fondness he seems to cry oh merry days of desolation when i was young you are young when lutes were touched and songs were sung and love lamps in the windows it is the very tone of thackeray when thackeray is tender and the world heard it ﬁrst from this elderly nameless minstrel strolling with his viol and his singing boys aucassin and nicolete https blameless d assoucy from castle to castle in the happy poplar one seems to see him and hear him in the twilight in the court of some château of picardy while the ladies on silken cushions sit around him listening and their lovers fettered with silver chains lie at their feet they listen and look and not think of the minstrel with his grey head and his green heart but we think of him it is an old man s work and weary man s work you can easily tell the places where he has lingered and been pleased he wrote they are marked like the bower nicolete built with ﬂowers and broken branches wet with dew such passage is the description of nicolete at her window in the strangely painted chamber ki faite est par grant devisse panturee thence she saw the roses blow heard the birds sing loud and low again the minstrel speaks out what many must have thought in those incredulous ages of faith about heaven and hell hell where the gallant company makes up everything when he comes to he makes aucassin mightily and knightly hurl through the press like one of malory s men his hero must be man of his hands mere sighing youth incapable of arms but the minstrels heart is in other things example in the verses where aucassin transfers to beauty the wonder powers of holiness and makes the sight of his lady heal the palmer the shadow of the apostle falling on the sick people healed them by the gate beautiful the flight of nicolete is familiar and beautiful picture the daisy ﬂowers look black in the ivory moonlight against her feet fair bombyca s feet of carven ivory in the sicilian idyll long ago 4 it is characteristic of the poet that the two lovers begin to wrangle about which loves best in the very mouth of danger while aucassin is yet in prison and the patrol go down the moonlit street with swords in their hands sworn to slay nicolete that is the place and time chosen this ancient controversy aucassin s threat that if he loses nicolete he will not wait sword or knife but will dash his head against wall is in the very temper of the prisoned warrior who actually chose this way of death then the night scene with its fantasy and shadow and moonlight on ﬂowers and street yields to picture of the day with the birds singing and the shepherds laughing in the green links between wood and water there the shepherds take nicolete fairy so bright beauty shines about her their mockery their independence may make us consider again our ideas of early feudalism probably they were in the service of townsmen whose good town treated the count more than an equal of its corporate dignity the bower of branches built by nicolete is certainly one of the places where the minstrel himself has rested and been pleased with his work one can feel it still the cool of that clear summer night the sweet smell of broken boughs and trodden grass and deep dew and the shining of the star that aucassin deemed was the translated spirit of his lady romance has touched the book here with her magic she has touched the lines where we read how consuelo came by moonlight to the canon s garden and the white ﬂowers the pleasure here is the keener contrast with the luckless hind whom aucassin encountered in the forest the man who had lost his master s ox the ungainly man who wept because his mother s bed had been taken from under her to pay his debt this man was in that estate which achilles in hades preferred above the kingship of the dead outworn he was hind and hireling to villein ανδρι παρ ακληρω it is an unexpected touch of pity the people and other than in poem intended the great and courtly people of chivalry at last the lovers meet in the lodge of ﬂowers beneath the stars here the story should end though one could ill spare the pretty lecture the girl reads her lover they ride aucassin and nicolete https and the picture of nicolete with her brown stain and jogleor s attire and her viol playing before aucassin in his own castle of biaucaire the burlesque interlude of the country of torelore is like page out of rabelais stitched into the by mistake at such lands torelore pantagruel and panur ge touched many time in their vague voyaging nobody perhaps can care very much about nicolete s adventures in carthage and her recognition by her paynim kindred if the old captive had been prisoner among the saracens he was too indolent or incurious to make use of his knowledge he hurries on to his journey s end journeys end in lovers so he ﬁnishes the tale what lives in it what makes it live is the touch of poetry of tender heart of humorous resignation the old captive says the story will gladden sad men nus hom n est si esbahis tant dolans ni entrepris grant mal amaladis il l oit ne soit garis et joie resbaudis tant par est this service it did bida the painter he tells us when he translated aucassin in in dark and darkening days patriai tempor iniquo we too have turned to aucassin et nicolete 5 ballade of aucassin where smooth the southern waters run through rustling leagues of poplars gray beneath veiled soft southern sun we wandered out of yesterday went maying in that ancient may whose fallen ﬂowers are fragrant yet and lingered by the fountain spray with aucassin and nicolete the grassgrown paths are trod of none where through the woods they went astray the spider s traceries are spun across the darkling forest way there come knights that ride to slay pilgrims through the grasses wet shepherd lads that sang their say with aucassin and nicolete twas here by nicolete begun her lodge of boughs and blossoms gay scaped from the cell of marble dun twas here the lover found the fay lovers fond foolish play how hard we ﬁnd it to get who fain would dwell with them they with aucassin and aucassin and nicolete https prince tis melancholy lay youth life we both regret how fair they seem how far away with aucassin and nicolete ballade of nicolete all bathed in pearl and amber light she rose to ﬂing the lattice wide and leaned into the fragrant night where brown birds sang of summertide twas love s own voice that called and cried ah sweet she said i ll seek thee yet though thorniest pathways should betide the fair white feet of they slept who would have stayed her ﬂight full fain were they the maid had died she dropped adown her prison s height on strands of linen featly tied and so she passed the with roses sweetly set and dainty daisies dark beside the fair white feet of nicolete her lover lay in evil plight so many lovers yet abide i would my tongue could praise aright her name that should be gloriﬁed those lovers now whom foes divide little weep soon get how far from these faint lovers glide the fair white feet of nicolete envoy my princess dof f thy frozen pride nor scorn to pay love s golden debt through his dim woodland take guide the fair white feet of nicolete graham tomson the or y of aucassin and nicolete tis of aucassin and aucassin and nicolete https would list to the good lay gladness of the captive grey tis how two young lovers met aucassin and nicolete of the pains the lover bore and the sorrows he outwore the goodness and the grace of his love so fair of face sweet the song the story sweet there is man hearkens it man living neath the sun so outwearied so foredone sick and woful worn and sad but is healèd but is glad tis so sweet so say they speak they tell they the tale how the count bougars valence made war on count garin biaucaire war so great and so marvellous and so mortal that never day dawned but alway he was there by the gates and walls and barriers of the town with hundred knights and ten thousand men at arms horsemen and footmen so burned he the count s land and spoiled his country and slew his men now the count garin biaucaire was old and frail and his good days were gone over heir had he neither son nor daughter save one young man only such an one i shall tell you aucassin was the name of the damoiseau fair was he goodly and great and featly fashioned of his body and limbs his hair was yellow in little curls his eyes blue and laughing his face beautiful and shapely his nose high and well set and so richly seen was he in all things good that in him was none evil at all but so suddenly overtaken was he of love who is great master that he would not of his will be dubbed knight nor take arms nor follow tourneys nor whatsoever him beseemed therefore his father and mother said to him son go take thine arms mount thy horse and hold thy land and help thy men if they see thee among them more stoutly will they keep in battle their lives and lands and thine and father said aucassin i marvel that you will be speaking never may god give aught of my desire if i be made knight or mount my horse or face stour and battle wherein knights smite and are smitten again unless thou give nicolete my true love that i love so son said the father this may not be let nicolete go slave girl she is out of strange land and the captain of this town bought her of the saracens and carried her hither and hath reared her and let christen the maid and took her his daughter in god and one day will ﬁnd young man her to win her bread honourably herein hast thou naught to make or mend but if wife thou wilt have i will give thee the daughter of king or count there is man so rich in france but if thou desire his daughter thou shalt have her faith my father said aucassin tell where is the place so high in all the world that nicolete my sweet lady and love would not grace it well if she were empress of constantinople or of germany or queen of france or england it were little enough her so gentle is she and courteous and debonaire and compact of all good here singeth one aucassin was of biaucaire of goodly castle there but from nicolete the aucassin and nicolete https might win his heart away though his father many day and his mother said him nay ha fond child what wouldest thou nicolete is glad enow was from carthage cast away paynims sold her on day wouldst thou win lady fair choose maid of high degree such an one is meet nay of these i have care nicolete is debonaire her body sweet and the face of her take my heart in snare loyal love is but her share that is so then speak they say they tell they the tale when the count garin biaucaire knew that he would avail not to withdraw aucassin his son from the love of nicolete he went to the captain of the city who was his man and spake to him saying sir count away with nicolete thy daughter in god cursed be the land whence she was brought into this country by reason of her i lose aucassin that will neither be dubbed knight nor aught of the things that fall to him to be done and wit ye well he said that if i might have her at my will i would burn her in ﬁre and yourself might well be sore sir said the captain this is grievous to that he comes and goes and hath speech with her i had bought the maiden at mine own char ges and nourished her and baptized and made her my daughter in god yea i would have given her to young man that should win her bread honourably with this had aucassin thy son naught to make or mend but sith it is thy will and thy pleasure i will send her into that land and that country where never will he see her with his have heed to thyself said the count garin thence might great evil come on so parted they each from other now the captain was right rich man so had he rich palace with garden in face of it in an upper chamber thereof he let place nicolete with one old woman to keep her company and in that chamber put bread and meat and wine and such things were needful then he let seal the door that none might come in or go forth save that there was one window over against the garden and strait enough where through came to them little air here singeth one nicolete ye heard tell prisoned is within cell that is painted wondrously with colours of far countrie and the window of marble wrought there the maiden stood in thought with straight brows and yellow hair never saw ye fairer fair on the wood she gazed below and she saw the roses blow heard the birds sing loud and low therefore spoke she wofully ah wherefore i aucassin and nicolete https in prison wrongfully aucassin my love my knight am i not thy heart s delight thou that lovest aright tis thee that i must dwell in the vaulted chamber cell hard beset and all alone by our lady mary s son here longer will i wonn if i may ﬂee then speak they say they tell they the tale nicolete was in prison ye have heard soothly in the chamber and the noise and bruit of it went through all the country and all the land how that nicolete was lost some said she had ﬂed the country and some that the count garin biaucaire had let slay her whosoever had joy thereof aucassin had none so he went to the captain of the town and spoke to him saying sir captain what hast thou made of nicolete my sweet lady and love the thing that best i love in all the world hast thou carried her of f or ravished her away from know well that if i die of it the price shall be demanded of thee and that will be well done it shall be even if thou hadst slain with thy two hands thou hast taken from the thing that in this world i loved the fair sir said the captain let these things be nicolete is captive that i did bring from strange country yea i bought her at my own char ges of the saracens and i bred her up and baptized her and made her my daughter in god and i have cherished her and one of these days i would have given her young man to win her bread honourably with this hast thou naught to make but thou take the daughter of king or count nay more what wouldst thou deem thee to have gained hadst thou made her thy leman and taken her to thy bed plentiful lack of comfort hadst thou got thereby in hell would thy soul have lain while the world endures and into paradise wouldst thou have entered never in paradise what have i to win therein i seek not to enter but only to have nicolete my sweet lady that i love so well into paradise go none but such folk i shall tell thee now thither go these same old priests and halt old men and maimed who all day and night cower continually before the altars and in the crypts and such folk wear old amices and old clouted frocks and naked folk and shoeless and covered with sores perishing of hunger and thirst and of cold and of little ease these be they that go into paradise with them have i naught to make but into hell would i fain go into hell fare the goodly clerks and goodly knights that fall in tourneys and great wars and stout men at arms and all men noble with these would i lieﬂy go and thither pass the sweet ladies and courteous that have two lovers or three and their lords also thereto thither goes the gold and the silver and cloth of vair and cloth of gris and harpers and makers and the prince of this world with these i would gladly go let but have with nicolete my sweetest lady certes quoth the captain in vain wilt thou speak thereof never shalt thou see her and if thou hadst word with her and thy father knew it he would let burn in ﬁre both her and and thyself might well be sore that is even what irketh quoth aucassin so he went from the captain sorrowing here singeth one aucassin did so depart much in dole and heavy at heart his love so bright and dear aucassin and nicolete https might bring him any cheer none might give good words to hear to the palace doth he fare climbeth up the passeth to chamber there thus great sorrow doth he bear his lady and love so fair nicolete how fair art thou sweet thy sweet thine eyes sweet the mirth of thy replies sweet thy laughter sweet thy face sweet thy lips and sweet thy brow and the touch of thine embrace all thee i sorrow now captive in an evil place whence i ne er may go my ways sister sweet friend so say they speak they tell they the tale while aucassin was in the chamber sorrowing nicolete his love even then the count bougars valence that had his war to wage gat it whit but had called up his horsemen and his footmen so made he the castle to storm it and the cry of battle arose and the din and knights and men at arms busked them and ran to walls and gates to hold the keep and the mounted to the battlements and cast down bolts and pikes then while the assault was great and even at its height the count garin biaucaire came into the chamber where aucassin was making lament sorrowing nicolete his sweet lady that he loved so well ha son quoth he how caitif f art thou and cowardly that canst see men assail thy goodliest castle and strongest know thou that if thou lose it thou losest all son go to take arms and mount thy horse and defend thy land and help thy men and fare into the stour thou needst not smite nor be smitten if they but see thee among them better will they guard their substance and their lives and thy land and mine and thou art so great and hardy of thy hands that well mightst thou this thing and to it is thy devoir father said aucassin what is this thou sayest now god grant never aught of my desire if i be dubbed knight or mount steed or go into the stour where knights smite and are smitten if thou givest not nicolete my sweet lady whom i love so son quoth his father this may never be rather would i be quite disinherited and lose all that is mine than that thou shouldst have her to thy wife or to love par amours so he turned him about but when aucassin saw him going he called to him again saying father go to now i will make with thee fair what covenant fair son i will take up arms and go into the stour on this covenant that if god bring back sound and safe thou wilt let see nicolete my sweet lady even so long that i may have of her two words or three and one that will i grant said his father at this was aucassin glad here one aucassin and nicolete https the kiss heard aucassin that returning he shall win none so glad would he have been of myriad marks of gold of hundred thousand told called raiment brave of steel then they clad him head to heel twyfold hauberk doth he don firmly braced the helmet on girt the sword with hilt of gold horse doth mount and lance doth wield looks to stirrups and to shield wondrous brave he rode to ﬁeld dreaming of his lady dear setteth spurs to the destrere rideth forward without fear through the gate and forth away to the fray so speak they say they tell they the tale aucassin was armed and mounted ye have heard tell god how goodly sat the shield on his shoulder the helm on his head and the baldric on his left haunch and the damoiseau was tall fair featly fashioned and hardy of his hands and the horse whereon he rode swift and keen and straight had he spurred him forth of the gate now believe ye not that his mind was on kine nor cattle of the booty nor thought he how he might strike knight nor be stricken again nor such thing nay memory had aucassin of aught of these rather he so dreamed of nicolete his sweet lady that he dropped his reins forgetting all there was to and his horse that had felt the spur bore him into the press and hurled among the foe and they laid hands on him all about and took him captive and seized away his spear and shield and straightway they led him of f prisoner and were even now discoursing of what death he should die and when aucassin heard them ha god said he sweet saviour be these my deadly enemies that have taken and will soon cut of f my head and once my head is of f more shall i speak with nicolete my sweet lady that i love so well natheless have i here good sword and sit good horse unwearied if now i keep not my head her sake god help her never if she love more the damoiseau was tall and strong and the horse whereon he sat was right eager and he laid hand to sword and fell to right and left and smote through helm and nasal and arm and clenched hand making murder about him like wild boar when hounds fall on him in the forest even till he struck down ten knights and seven be hurt and straightway he hurled out of the press and rode back again at full speed sword in hand the count bougars valence heard say they were about hanging aucassin his enemy so he came into that place and aucassin was ware of him and gat his sword into his hand and lashed at his helm with such stroke that he drave it down on his head and he being stunned fell grovelling and aucassin laid hands on him and caught him by the nasal of his helmet and gave him to his father father quoth aucassin lo here is your mortal foe who hath so warred on you with all malengin full twenty years did this war endure and might not be ended by fair son said his father thy feats of youth shouldst thou and not seek after folly father saith aucassin sermon sermons but fulﬁl my ha what covenant fair son aucassin and nicolete https what father hast thou gotten it by mine own head whosoever gets will i not forget it so much it hath at heart didst thou not covenant with when i took up arms and went into the stour that if god brought back safe and sound thou wouldst let see nicolete my sweet lady even so long that i may have of her two words or three and one kiss so didst thou covenant and my mind is that thou keep thy i quoth the father god forsake when i keep this covenant nay if she were here i would let burn her in the ﬁre and thyself shouldst be sore is this thy last word quoth aucassin so help god quoth his father yea certes quoth aucassin this is sorry thing meseems when man of thine age lies count of valence quoth aucassin i took thee in sooth sir didst thou saith the count give thy hand saith aucassin sir with good so he set his hand in the other s now givest thou thy word saith aucassin that never whiles thou art living man wilt thou avail to my father dishonour or harm him in body or in goods but it thou wilt sir in god s name saith he mock not but put to my ransom ye can not ask of gold nor silver horses nor palfreys vair nor gris hawks nor hounds but i will give you what quoth aucassin ha knowest thou not it was i that took thee yea sir quoth the count bougars god help never but i will make thy head ﬂy from thy shoulders if thou makest not troth said aucassin in god s name said he i make what promise thou so they did the oath and aucassin let mount him on horse and took another and so led him back till he was all in safety here one singeth when the count garin doth know that his child would ne er forego love of her that loved him so nicolete the bright of brow in dungeon deep below childe aucassin did he throw even there the childe must dwell in marble cell there he waileth in his woe crying thus ye shall know nicolete thou lily white my sweet lady bright of brow sweeter than the grape art thou sweeter than sack posset good in cup of maple wood was it not but aucassin and nicolete https palmer came this way out of limousin came he and at ease he might not be passion him possessed that upon his bed he lay lay and tossed and knew not rest in his pain discomforted but thou camest by the bed where he tossed amid his pain holding high thy sweeping train and thy kirtle of ermine and thy smock of linen ﬁne then these fair white limbs of thine did he look on and it fell that the palmer straight was well straight was comforted and he rose up from his bed and went back to his own place sound and strong and full of face my sweet lady lily white sweet thy footfall sweet thine eyes and the mirth of thy replies sweet thy laughter sweet thy face sweet thy lips and sweet thy brow and the touch of thine embrace who but doth in thee delight i love of thee am bound in this dungeon under ground all loving thee must lie here where loud on thee i cry here loving thee must die thee my then say they speak they tell they the tale aucassin was cast into prison ye have heard tell and nicolete of her part was in the chamber now it was summer time the month of may when days are warm and long and clear and the night still and serene nicolete lay one night on her bed and saw the moon shine clear through window yea and heard the nightingale sing in the garden so she minded her of aucassin her lover whom she loved so well then fell she to thoughts of count garin biaucaire that hated her to the death therefore deemed she that there she would longer abide that if she were told of and the count knew whereas she lay an ill death would he make her die now she knew that the old woman slept who held her company then she arose and clad her in mantle of silk she had by her very goodly and took napkins and sheets of the bed and knotted one to the other and made therewith cord long she might so knitted it to pillar in the window and let herself slip down into the garden then caught up her raiment in both hands behind and before and kilted up her kirtle because of the dew that she saw lying deep on the grass and so went her way down through the garden her locks were yellow and curled her eyes blue and smiling her face featly fashioned the nose high and fairly set the lips more red than cherry or rose in time of summer her teeth white and small her breasts so ﬁrm that they bore up the folds of her bodice they had been two apples so slim she was in the waist that your two hands might have clipped her and the daisy ﬂowers that brake beneath her she went and that bent above her instep seemed black against her feet so white was the maiden she came to the postern gate and unbarred it and went out through the streets of biaucaire keeping always on the shadowy side the moon was shining right clear and so wandered she till she came to the tower where her lover lay the tower was ﬂanked with aucassin and nicolete https she cowered under one of them wrapped in her mantle then thrust she her head through crevice of the tower that was old and worn and so heard she aucassin wailing within and making dole and lament the sweet lady he loved so well and when she had listened to him she began to say here one singeth nicolete the bright of brow on pillar leanest thou all aucassin s wail dost hear his love that is so dear then thou spakest shrill and clear gentle knight withouten fear little good befalleth thee little help of sigh or tear ne er shalt thou have joy of never shalt thou win still am i held in evil will of thy father and thy kin therefore must i cross the sea and another land must then she cut her curls of gold cast them in the dungeon hold aucassin doth clasp them there kissed the curls that were so fair them doth in his bosom bear then he wept even of old all his love then say they speak they tell they the tale when aucassin heard nicolete say that she would pass into far country he was all in wrath fair sweet friend quoth he thou shalt not go then wouldst thou be my death and the ﬁrst man that saw thee and had the might withal would take thee straightway into his bed to be his leman and once thou camest into man s bed and that bed not mine wit ye well that i would not tarry till i had found knife to pierce my heart and slay myself nay verily wait so long i would not but would hurl myself on it so soon i could ﬁnd wall or black stone thereon would i dash my head so mightily that the eyes would start and my brain burst rather would i die even such death than know thou hadst lain in man s bed and that bed not aucassin she said i trow thou lovest not much thou sayest but i love thee more than thou lovest ah fair sweet friend said aucassin it may not be that thou shouldst love even i love thee woman may not love man man loves woman woman s love lies in the glance of her eye and the bud of her breast and her foot s but the love of man is in his heart planted whence it can never issue forth and pass away now while aucassin and nicolete held this parley together the town s guards came down street with swords drawn beneath their cloaks the count garin had char ged them that if they could take her they should slay her but the sentinel that was on the tower saw them coming and heard them speaking of nicolete they went and threatening to slay her god quoth he this were great pity to slay so fair maid right great charity it were if i could say aught to her and they perceive it not and she should be on her aucassin and nicolete https them if they slay her then were aucassin my damoiseau dead and that were great pity here one singeth valiant was the sentinel courteous kind and practised well so song did sing and tell of the peril that befell maiden fair that lingerest here gentle maid of merry cheer hair of gold and eyes clear the water in mere thou meseems hast spoken word to thy lover and thy lord that would die thee his dear now beware the ill accord of the cloaked men of the sword these have sworn and keep their word they will put thee to the sword save thou take heed then speak they say they tell they the tale ha quoth nicolete be the soul of thy father and the soul of thy mother in the rest of paradise so fairly and so courteously hast thou spoken please god i will be right ware of them god keep out of their so she shrank under her mantle into the shadow of the pillar till they had passed by and then took she farewell of aucassin and so fared till she came unto the castle wall now that wall was wasted and broken and some deal mended so she clomb thereon till she came between wall and and so looked down and saw that the was deep and steep whereat she was sore adread ah god saith she sweet saviour if i let myself fall hence i shall break my neck and if here i abide they will take and burn in ﬁre yet liefer would i perish here than that the folk should stare on then she crossed herself and so let herself slip into the and when she had come to the bottom her fair feet and fair hands that had not custom thereof were bruised and frayed and the blood springing from dozen places yet felt she pain nor hurt by reason of the great dread wherein she went but if she were in cumber to win there in worse was she to win out but she deemed that there to abide was of none avail and she found pike sharpened that they of the city had thrown out to keep the hold therewith made she one stepping place after another till with much travail she climbed the wall now the forest lay within two crossbow shots and the forest was of thirty leagues this way and that therein also were wild beasts and beasts serpentine and she feared that if she entered there they would slay her but anon she deemed that if men found her there they would hale her back into the town to burn her here one singeth nicolete the fair of face climbed upon the coping stone there made she lament and moan calling on our lord alone his mercy and his grace father king of majesty listen i nothing aucassin and nicolete https to ﬂee or whither go if within the wood i fare lo the wolves will slay there boars and lions terrible many in the wild wood dwell but if i abide the day surely worse will come of it surely will the ﬁre be lit that shall burn my body away jesus lord of majesty better seemeth it to that within the wood i fare though the wolves devour there than within the town to go ne er be it so then speak they say they tell they the tale nicolete made great moan ye have heard then commended she herself to god and anon fared till she came unto the forest but to go deep in it she dared not by reason of the wild beasts and beasts serpentine anon crept she into little thicket where sleep came upon her and she slept till prime next day when the shepherds issued forth from the town and drove their bestial between wood and water anon came they all into one place by fair fountain which was on the fringe of the forest thereby spread they mantle and thereon set bread so while they were eating

was he let saddle and bridle him and mounted and rode forth from the castle and wandered till he came to the forest so rode till he came to the fountain and found the shepherds at point of noon and they had mantle stretched on the grass and were eating bread and making great joy here one singeth there were gathered shepherds all martin esmeric and hal aubrey robin great and small saith the one

her anon she gave us of that she had whereby we made covenant with her that if ye came hither we would bid you hunt in this forest wherein is such beast that an ye might take him ye would not give one limb of him ﬁve hundred marks of silver nor ransom this beast is so mighty of medicine that an ye could take him ye should be healed of your torment and within three days must ye take him and if ye take him not then never will ye look on him so chase ye the beast an ye will or an ye will let be my promise have i kept with her fair boys quoth aucassin ye have said enough god grant to ﬁnd this quarry here one singeth aucassin when he had heard sore within his heart was stirred left the shepherds on that word far into the forest spurred rode into the wood and ﬂeet fled his horse through paths of aucassin and nicolete https words spake he of his sweet nicolete the fair the dear tis thee i follow here track of boar nor slot of deer but thy sweet body and eyes so clear all thy mirth and merry cheer that my very heart have slain so please god to maintain i shall see my love again sweet sister friend then speak they say they tell they the tale aucassin fared through the forest from path to path after nicolete and his horse bare him furiously think ye not that the thorns him spared nor the briars nay not so but tare his raiment that scarce knot might be tied with the soundest part thereof and the blood sprang from his arms and ﬂanks and legs in forty places or thirty so that behind the childe men might follow on the track of his blood in the grass but so much he went in thoughts of nicolete his lady sweet that he felt pain nor torment and all the day hurled through the forest in this fashion nor heard word of her and when he saw vespers draw nigh he began to weep that he found her not all down an old road and grassgrown he fared when anon looking along the way before him he saw such an one i shall tell you tall was he and great of growth laidly and marvellous to look upon his head huge and black charcoal and more than the breadth of hand between his two eyes and great cheeks and big nose and broad big nostrils and ugly and thick lips redder than collop and great teeth yellow and ugly and he was shod with hosen and shoon of bull s hide bound with cords of bark over the knee and all about him great cloak and he leaned on grievous cudgel and aucassin came unto him and was afraid when he beheld him fair brother god aid god bless you quoth he god he helpeth thee what makest thou here what is that to thee nay naught naught saith aucassin i ask but out of courtesy but whom weepest thou quoth he and makest such heavy lament certes were i rich man thou the whole world should not make ha know ye saith aucassin yea i know well that ye be aucassin the son of the count and if ye tell why ye weep then will i tell you what i make certes quoth aucassin i will tell you right gladly hither came i this morning to hunt in this forest and with white hound the fairest in the world him have i lost and him i by the heart our lord bare in his breast quoth he are ye weeping stinking hound foul fall him that holds thee high henceforth there is such rich man in

blessed be thou and of what price was thine ox sir they ask twenty sols him whereof i can not abate one nay then quoth aucassin take these twenty sols i have in my purse and pay thine sir saith he gramercy and god give thee to ﬁnd that thou so they parted each from other and aucassin rode on the night was fair and still and so long he went that he came to the lodge of boughs that nicolete had builded and woven within and without over and under with ﬂowers and it was the fairest lodge that might be seen when aucassin was ware of it he stopped suddenly and the light of the moon fell therein god quoth aucassin here was nicolete my sweet lady and this lodge builded she with her fair hands the sweetness of it and love of her will i alight and rest here this night he drew forth his foot from the stirrup to alight and the steed was great and tall he dreamed so much on nicolete his right sweet lady that he slipped on stone and drave his shoulder out of his place then knew he that he was hurt sore natheless he bore him with what force he might and fastened with the other hand the mare s son to thorn then turned he on his side and crept backwise into the lodge of boughs and he looked through gap in the lodge and saw the stars in heaven and one that was brighter than the rest so began he to say here one singeth star that i from far behold star the moon calls to her fold nicolete with thee doth dwell my sweet love with locks of gold god would have her dwell afar dwell with him evening star would to god whate er befell would that with her i might dwell i would clip her close and strait nay were i of much estate some king s son desirable worthy she to be my mate to kiss and clip well sister sweet friend so speak they say they tell they the tale when nicolete heard aucassin right so came she unto him she was not far away she passed within the lodge and threw her arms about his neck and clipped and kissed him fair sweet friend welcome be and thou fair sweet love be thou aucassin and nicolete https either kissed and clipped the other and fair joy was them between ha sweet love quoth aucassin but now was i sore hurt and my shoulder wried but i take force of it nor have hurt therefrom since i have right so felt she his shoulder and found it was wried from its place and she so handled it with her white hands and so wrought in her sur gery that by god s will who loveth lovers it went back into its place then took she ﬂowers and fresh grass and leaves green and bound these herbs on the hurt with strip of her smock and he was all healed aucassin saith she fair sweet love take counsel what thou wilt if thy father let search this forest and men ﬁnd here they will slay come to thee what certes fair sweet love therefore should i sorrow heavily but an if i may never shall they take anon gat he on his horse and his lady before him kissing and clipping her and so rode they at adventure here one singeth aucassin the frank the fair aucassin of the yellow hair gentle knight and true lover from the forest doth he fare holds his love before him there kissing cheek and chin and eyes but she spake in sober wise aucassin true love and fair to what land we repair sweet my love i take care thou art with everywhere so they pass the woods and downs pass the villages and towns hills and dales and open land came at dawn to the sea sand lighted down upon the strand beside the sea then say they speak they tell they the tale aucassin lighted down and his love ye have heard sing he held his horse by the bridle and his lady by the hands so went they along the sea shore and on the sea they saw ship and he called unto the sailors and they came to him then held he such speech with them that he and his lady were brought aboard that ship and when they were on the high sea behold mighty wind and tyrannous arose marvellous and great and drave them from land to land till they came unto strange country and won the haven of the castle of torelore then asked they what this land might be and men told them that it was the country of the king of torelore then he asked what manner of man was he and was there war afoot and men said yea and mighty therewith took he farewell of the merchants and they commended him to god anon aucassin mounted his horse with his sword girt and his lady before him and rode at adventure till he was come to the castle then asked he where the king was and they said that he was in childbed then where is his wife aucassin and nicolete https they told him she was with the host and had led with her all the force of that country now when aucassin heard that saying he made great marvel and came into the castle and lighted down he and his lady and his lady held his horse right so went he up into the castle with his sword girt and fared hither and thither till he came to the chamber where the king was lying here one singeth aucassin the courteous knight to the chamber went forthright to the bed with linen dight even where the king was laid there he stood by him and said fool what mak st thou here abed quoth the king i am brought to bed of fair son and anon when my month is over and gone and my healing fairly done to the minster will i fare and will my churching there my father did repair then will sally forth to war then will drive my foes afar from my countrie then speak they say they tell they the tale when aucassin heard the king speak on this wise he took all the sheets that covered him and threw them all abroad about the chamber then saw he behind him cudgel and caught it into his hand and turned and took the king and beat him till he was nigh dead ha fair sir quoth the king what would you with art thou beside thyself that beatest in mine own house by god s heart quoth aucassin thou ill son of an ill wench i will slay thee if thou swear not that never shall any man in all thy land lie in of child henceforth ever so he did that oath and when he had done it sir said aucassin bring now where thy wife is with the sir with good will quoth the king he mounted his horse and aucassin gat on his own and nicolete abode in the queen s chamber anon rode aucassin and the king even till they came to that place where the queen was and lo men were warring with baked apples and with eggs and with fresh cheeses and aucassin began to look on them and made great marvel here one singeth aucassin his horse doth stay from the saddle watched the fray all the stour and ﬁerce array right fresh cheeses carried they apples baked and mushrooms grey whoso splasheth most the ford he is master called and lord aucassin doth gaze aucassin and nicolete https began to laugh and smile and made game then speak they say they tell they the tale when aucassin beheld these marvels he came to the king and said sir be these thine enemies yea sir quoth the king and will ye that i should avenge you of them yea quoth he with all my then aucassin put hand to sword and hurled among them and began to smite to the right hand and the left and slew many of them and when the king saw that he slew them he caught at his bridle and said ha fair sir slay them not in such how quoth aucassin will ye not that i should avenge you of them sir quoth the king overmuch already hast thou avenged it is nowise our custom to slay each other anon turned they and ﬂed then the king and aucassin betook them again to the castle of torelore and the folk of that land counselled the king to put aucassin forth and keep nicolete his son s wife that she seemed lady high of lineage and nicolete heard them and had joy of it so began to say here singeth one thus she spake the bright of brow lord of torelore and king thy folk deem light thing when my love doth embrace fair he ﬁnds in good case then am i in such derray neither harp nor lyre nor lay dance nor game nor rebeck play were so then speak they say they tell they the tale aucassin dwelt in the castle of torelore in great ease and great delight that he had with him nicolete his sweet love whom he loved so well now while he was in such pleasure and such delight came troop of saracens by sea and laid siege to the castle and took it by main strength anon took they the substance that was therein and carried off the men and maidens captives they seized nicolete and aucassin and bound aucassin hand and foot and cast him into one ship and nicolete into another then rose there mighty wind over sea and scattered the ships now that ship wherein was aucassin went wandering on the sea till it came to the castle of biaucaire and the folk of the country ran together to wreck her and there found they aucassin and they knew him again so when they of biaucaire saw their damoiseau they made great joy of him aucassin had dwelt full three years in the castle of torelore and his father and mother were dead so the people took him to the castle of biaucaire and there were they all his men and he held the land in peace here singeth one lo ye aucassin hath gone to biaucaire that is his aucassin and nicolete https there in joy and ease and the kingdom is at peace swears he by the majesty of our lord that is most high rather would he they should die all his kin and parentry so that nicolete were nigh ah sweet love and fair of brow i know not where to seek thee now god made never that countrie not by land and not by sea where i would not search thee if that might be then speak they say they tell they the tale now leave we aucassin and speak we of nicolete the ship wherein she was cast pertained to the king of carthage and he was her father and she had twelve brothers all princes or kings when they beheld nicolete how fair she was they did her great worship and made much joy of her and many times asked her who she was surely seemed she lady of noble line and high parentry but she might not tell them of her lineage she was but child when men stole her away so sailed they till they won the city of carthage and when nicolete saw the walls of the castle and the she knew that there had she been nourished and thence stolen away being but child yet was she not so young child but that well she knew she had been daughter of the king of carthage and of her nurture in that city here singeth one nicolete the good and true to the land hath come anew sees the palaces and walls and the houses and the halls then she spake and said alas that of birth so great i was cousin of the amiral and the very child of him carthage counts king of paynim wild folk hold here withal nay aucassin love of thee gentle knight and true and free burns and wastes the heart of ah god grant it of his grace that thou hold and embrace that thou kiss on the face love and lord then speak they say they tell they the tale when the king of carthage heard nicolete speak in this wise he cast his arms about her neck fair sweet love saith he tell who thou art and be not adread of sir said she i am daughter to the king of carthage and was taken being then little child it is now ﬁfteen years when all they of the court heard her speak thus they knew well that she spake sooth so made they great joy of her and led her to the castle in great honour the king s daughter and they would have given her to her lord king of paynim but she had aucassin and nicolete https to marry there dwelt she three days or four and she considered by what means she might seek aucassin then she got her viol and learned to play on it till they would have married her on day to great king of paynim and she stole forth by night and came to the and dwelt with poor woman thereby then took she certain herb and therewith smeared her head and her face till she was all brown and stained and she let make coat and mantle and smock and hose and attired herself if she had been harper so took she the viol and went to mariner and so wrought on him that he took her aboard his vessel then hoisted they sail and fared on the high seas even till they came to the land of provence and nicolete went forth and took the viol and went playing through all that country even till she came to the castle of biaucaire where aucassin lay here singeth one at biaucaire below the tower sat aucassin on an hour heard the bird and watched the ﬂower with his barons him beside then came on him in that tide the sweet inﬂuence of love and the memory thereof thought of nicolete the fair and the dainty face of her he had loved so many years then was he in dule and tears even then came nicolete on the stair foot she set and she drew the viol bow through the strings and chanted so listen lords and knights to lords of high or low degree to my story list will ye all of aucassin and her that was nicolete the fair and their love was long to tell deep woods through he sought her well paynims took them on day in torelore and bound they lay of aucassin nought know we but fair nicolete the free now in carthage doth she dwell there her father loves her well who is king of that countrie her husband hath he found paynim lord that serves mahound ne er with him the maid will go she loves damoiseau aucassin that ye may know swears to god that never mo with lover will she go save with him she loveth so in long so speak they say they tell they the tale when aucassin heard nicolete speak in this wise he was right joyful and drew her on one side and spoke saying sweet fair friend know ye nothing of this nicolete of whom ye have thus sung aucassin and nicolete https yea sir i know her the noblest creature and the most gentle and the best that ever was born on ground she is daughter to the king of carthage that took her there where aucassin was taken and brought her into the city of carthage till he knew that verily she was his own daughter whereon he made right great mirth anon wished he to give her her lord one of the greatest kings of all spain but she would rather let herself be hanged or burned than take any lord how great soever ha fair sweet friend quoth the count aucassin if thou wilt go into that land again and bid her come and speak to i will give thee of my substance more than thou wouldst dare to ask or take and know ye that the sake of her i have will to take wife howsoever high her lineage so wait i her and never will i have wife but her only and if i knew where to ﬁnd her need would i have to seek her sir quoth she if ye promise that i will go in quest of her your sake and hers that i love so he sware to her and anon let give her twenty livres and she departed from him and he wept the sweetness of nicolete and when she saw him weeping she said sir trouble not thyself so much withal in little while shall i have brought her into this city and ye shall see her when aucassin heard that he was right glad thereof and she departed from him and went into the city to the house of the captain s wife the captain her father in god was dead so she dwelt there and told all her tale and the captain s wife knew her and knew well that she was nicolete that she herself had nourished then she let wash and bathe her and there rested she eight full days then took she an herb that was named eyebright and anointed herself therewith and was fair ever she had been all the days of her life then she clothed herself in rich robes of silk whereof the lady had great store and then sat herself in the chamber on silken coverlet and called the lady and bade her go and bring aucassin her love and she did even so and when she came to the palace she found aucassin weeping and making lament nicolete his love that she delayed so long and the lady spake unto him and said aucassin sorrow more but come thou on with and i will shew thee the thing in the world that thou lovest best even nicolete thy dear love who from far lands hath come to seek of and aucassin was right glad here singeth one when aucassin heareth now that his lady bright of brow dwelleth in his own countrie never man was glad he to her castle doth he hie with the lady speedily passeth to the chamber high findeth nicolete thereby of her true love found again never maid was half so fain straight she leaped upon her feet when his love he saw at last arms about her did he cast kissed her often kissed her sweet kissed her lips and brows and eyes thus all night they devise even till the morning white then aucassin wedded her made her lady of biaucaire many years abode they aucassin and nicolete https years in shade or sun in great gladness and delight ne er hath aucassin regret nor his lady nicolete now my story all is done said and sung notes the blending alternate prose and is not unknown in various thus in dr steere s swahili t ales london 1870 vii we read it is constant characteristic of popular native tales to have sort of burden which all join in singing frequently the skeleton of the story seems to be contained in these snatches of singing which the connects by an extemporized account of the intervening history almost all these stories had sung parts and of some of these even those who sung them could scarcely explain the meaning i have heard stories partly told in which the verse parts were in the yao and nyamwezi the examples given sultan majnun are only verses supposed to be chanted by the characters in the tale it is improbable that the yaos and nyamwezis borrowed the custom of inserting verse into prose tales from arab literature where the intercalated verse is usually of moral and reﬂective character jamieson in illustrations of northern antiquities 379 preserved called rosmer halfman or the merman rosmer mr motherwell remarks minstr elsy glasgow 1827 xv thus i have heard the ancient ballad of young beichan and susy pye dilated by into tale of remarkable paragraph of prose and then screed of rhyme alternately the example published by mr motherwell gives us the very form of aucassin and nicolete surviving in scotch folk lore well ye must know that in the moor s castle there was mafsymore which is dark deep dungeon keeping prisoners it was twenty feet below the ground and into this hole they closed poor beichan there he stood night and day up to his waist in water but night or day it was all one to him ae styme of light ever got in so he lay there lang and weary while and thinking on his heavy weird he made murnfu sang to pass the this was the sang that he made and grat when he sang it he never thought of escaping from the mafsymore or of seeing his ain countrie

was walking ae day she heard the sough beichan s sang coming it were from below the all this is clearly analogous in form less than in matter to our mr motherwell speaks of fabliaux intended partly recitation and partly being sung but does not refer by name to aucassin and nicolete if we may judge by analogy aucassin and nicolete https form of the is probably an early artistic adaptation of
