inclined to defer to the wisdom of former ages should throw glance at the stern realities of the past connected with the history of his country will be little disposed to yield an implicit assent to the opinions or assertions of those who maintain the superiority of the past to the disparagement and depreciation of the present times maxims and sayings of this tendency have undoubtedly prevailed from periods of remote antiquity the wise monarch of the jewish nation even forbade his people to ask the cause that the former days were better than these he adds thou dost not enquire wisely concerning this far different would be the modern precept of british monarch rather let the english subject enquire diligently concerning this he can not fail to enquire wisely let him enquire and he will ﬁnd that the former days of england were days of discord tyranny and oppression days when an empson and dudley could harass the honest and through the medium of the process of the odious when the crown was possessed of almost arbitrary power and when the liberty and personal independence of individuals were in way considered or regarded days when the severity of our criminal laws drew down from french philosopher the sneer that history of england was history of the executioner when the doomed were sent out of the world in bands of twenty and even thirty at time at tyburn or at execution dock and when in the then unhealthy tone of public morals criminals famous their deeds of violence and rapine were regarded rather the heroes of romance than the pests and scour ges of society let him enquire and he will ﬁnd that all these things have now long since passed away that the rigours of the criminal law have been entirely mitigated and that the great chart ers of our liberties the fruits of accumulated wisdom and experience have now been long conﬁrmed these facts if universally known and duly pondered over would go far to banish discontent and disaf fection and would tend to produce conﬁdence in the inherent power of adaptation to the necessities of the people possessed by the constitution of our country thus the social wants of the outer man having been in great measure supplied the philanthropy of modern times has been chieﬂy employed on the mental and moral improvement of the species the wants of the inner man are now the objects of universal attention and education has become the great necessity of the age hitherto the municipal laws and institutions of this country have been defective inasmuch they have made little or provision the adequate instruction of the people much doubt has been already done and education even now diffuses her benignant light over large portion of the population among whom the children of the ignorant are able to instruct their parents and impart to those who gave them being share in the blessing of modern times much however remains still to be pg 1 pg 2 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https and the splendid examples of princely muniﬁcence which great minister of the crown has recently shown the wealthier classes of this wealthy nation may in the absence of state provision have the effect of stimulating private exertion and generosity in spite however of the moral and intellectual advancement of the present age the passions and evil designs of the vicious and discontented are still able to inﬂuence vast masses of the people the experience of the last few years unfortunately teaches us that increased knowledge has not yet banished disaf fection and that though during the last quarter of century the general standard of the nation morality may have been elevated above its former restin that education in its present state of advancement has not yet effectually disarmed discontent or disaf fection by showing the greater evil which ever attends the endeavour to effect the lesser good by violent factious or seditious means within the last thirteen years the government has been compelled on several occasions to curb the violence and to repress the outbreaks of men who had yet to learn the folly of such attempts and the powers of the executive have been frequently evoked by those who of late years have wielded the destinies of this country several state prosecutions have taken place during this period they never occur without exciting lively interest the public eye is critically intent upon the minutest detail of these proceedings and the public attention is concentrated upon those to whom is conﬁded the vindication of the public rights and the redressing of the public wrongs it has been often asked by some of these critical observers how is it that when great crimes or misdemeanours are to be punished when the bold and daring offender is to be brought to justice when the body politic is the offended party when the minister honours supposed offender with his notice in the shape of criminal proceedings and the government condescends to is it it has been asked on such occasions when the ﬁrst talent science and practical skill are all arranged against the unfortunate object of nation vengeance that the course of justice should be ever broken or impeded is the machinery then set in motion in truth there some inherent vice in the construction of the state engine is the law weak when it shou ld be strong is its boasted majesty after all nothing but the creation of fond imagination or delusion of the past are the wheels of the longer bright polished and ﬁt use they once were or are they choked and clogged with the rust and dust of accumulated ages or if not in the machine does the fault ask others of these bold critics rest with the workmen who guide and superintend its action are the principles of its construction now longer known or understood are they like those of the engines of the syracusan philosopher lost in the lapse of time is the crown less efﬁcien tly served than private individuals and can it be possible it has even been demanded that those who are actively employed on these occasions have been so long removed on the practice of what is often deemed the simpler portion of the law and so long employed in the higher and more abstruse branches of the science that they have forgotten the practice of their youth and have lost the knowledge acquired in the commencement of their professional career lesser criminals it is said are every day convicted with ease and is it therefore that the cobweb of the law holds fast the small ephemeræ which chance to stray across its ﬁlmy mesh but that the gaudy insect of larger form and greater strength so often breaks through his ﬂight perhaps arrested moment he feels the insidious toil fold close about him it is however only moment one mighty effort breaks his is and ﬂies off in triumph and derision trumpeting forth his victory and proclaiming his escape from the snare in which it was hoped to encompass him the astute and practised gentlemen thus suspected strong in the consciousn ess of deep legal knowledge and ready practical skill and science may justly despise the petty attacks of those who affect to doubt their professional ability and attainments some in high places have not hesitated to hint on one occasion at collusion and to assert that certain prosecution failed because there was real desire to punish such is the substance of the various questions and speculations to which the legal events of the last thirteen years have given rise we have now collected and enumerated them in condensed form the purpose of tracing their rise and progress and in order that we pg 3 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https demonstrate that though there may possibly exist some reasons these opinions founded often on misapprehension of the real circumstances of the cases quoted in their support that they have in fact little or substantial foundation with this view therefore we shall brieﬂy notice those trials within the period of which we speak which form the groundwork of these charges against the executive before we proceed to state the real obstacles which in fact occasionally oppose the smooth and rapid progress of state prosecution the ﬁrst of these proceedings which occurred during the period of the last thirteen years was the trial of messrs lawless steel and others this case perhaps originated the opinions which have partially prevailed and was in truth not unlikely to make permanent impression on the public mind in the month of january 1831 true bills were found against these parties by the grand jury of dublin assembling and meeting together purposes prohibited by proclamation of the lord lieutenant and conspiring to an act forbidden by the law by every possible device by demurrers and inconsistent pleas delays were interposed and though mr withdrew former plea of not guilty and pleaded guilty to the counts to which he had at ﬁrst mr stanley in the house of commons in reply to question put by the marquis of chandos emphatically declared that it was impossible the irish government consistently with their dignity government to enter into any negotiation implying the remotest compromise with the that it was the unalterable determination of the of ireland to let the law take its course against mr that let him act he pleased judgment would be passed against still in spite of this determination of the government so emphatically announced by the irish secretary the statute on which the proceedings were founded was actually suffered to expire without any previous steps having been taken against the state delinquents there has ever been that degree of mystery about this event which invariably rouses attention and excites curiosity the escape of those parties was great triumph over the powers or the expressed inclinations of the government which was well calculated to set the public mind at work to discover the latent causes which produced such strange and unexpected results after an interval of seven years another case occurred whic h was not calculated materially to lessen the impression already made upon the public although in the following instance the prosecution was conducted to successful termination yet questions of such grave importance were raised and fought with such ability vigour and determination that the accomplishment of the ends of justice if not prevented was certainly long delayed on the 17th december 1838 twelve prisoners were brought to liverpool charged in execution of sentence of transportation to van diemen land having been concerned in the canadian revolt here the offenders had been tried convicted sentenced and actually transported the prosecutors therefore might naturally be supposed to have got fairly into port when they saw the objects of their tender solicitude fairly out of port on their way to the distant land to which the offended laws of their country had consigned them if justice might not account her work done at time when her victims had already traversed thousand leagues of the wide atlantic when could it be expected that the law might take its course without further let or hindrance on the 17th of december has been observed the prisoners arrived at liverpool and were straightway consigned to the care and custody of mr batcheldor the governor of the borough jail of liverpool by whom they were duly immured in the stronghold of the borough and safely placed under lock and key things however did not long continue in this state in few days twelve writs of habeas corpus made their sudden and unexpected appearance by which mr batcheldor was commanded forthwith to bring the bodies of his charges together with the causes of detention before the lord chief justice of england mr batcheldor obeyed the command in both particulars the judges of the court of queen bench met counsel argued and the matter before them but in prisoners were left in the governor care in which they remaine d if effort had been made to remove then pg 4 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https his custody all however was not yet over though labouring under strange delusion four of the prisoners actually made oath that they had never been arraigned tried convicted or sentenced at all either in canada or elsewhere upon this four more writs of habeas corpus issued commanding the unhappy mr batcheldor to bring the four deluded convicts before the barons of the exchequer this was done arguments both old and new were heard with exemplary patience and attention the play was played over again but the barons were equally inexorable with the court of queen bench and the four prisoners after much consideration were again remanded to the custody of the governor of the jail and together with their eight were in course of time duly conveyed to the place of their original destination the next of these cases in chronological order is that of the monmouthshire riots in this case also might tend to corroborate the opinion that the service of the state in legal matters is attended with much difﬁculty and embarrassment it will however be seen upon examination of the facts of the case that the difﬁculty which then arose proceeded solely from the lenity and indulgence shown to the prisoners by the crown on ear day 1840 john frost and others were brought to trial on charge of high treason before special commission at monmouth the proceedings were interrupted by an objection taken by the prisoners counsel that the terms of statute which requires that list of witnesses should be delivered to the prisoners at the same time with copy of the indictment had not been complied with the indictment had in fact been delivered ﬁve days before the list of witnesses this had been done in merciful consideration to the prisoners in order that they might be put in possession of the charge to be brought against them early it was in the power of the crown to give them the information and probably before it was possible that the list of witnesses could have been made out the trial however proceeded subject to the decision of the ﬁfteen judges upon the question thus raised upon the supposed informality which nothin g but the anxious mercy of the crown had introduced into the proceedings and the parties were found guilty of the offence laid to their charge in the ensuing term all other business was time suspended and the ﬁfteen judges of the land with all the stately majesty of the judicial ofﬁce were gathered together in solemn conclave in westminster hall goodly array tier above tier they heavy artillery of vast legal battery about to open the ﬁre of their learning with that imposing dignity which becomes the avengers of the country and the sovereign wrongs day after day they met heard and deliberated upon arguments which were conspicuous from their consummate learning and ability at length these learned persons delivered their judgments and amid much diversity of opinion the majority thought upon the whole that the conviction was right and that the terms of the statute had been virtually complied with the criminals however probably in consequence of the doubts and difﬁculty of the case were absolved on the most highly penal consequences of their crime and were by sort of compromise transported life to one of the penal settlements the doubt which some have entertained of the real insanity of oxford and others who have recently attempted the same crime which he so nearly committed has caused these cases also to be brought forward in conﬁrmation of the opinions which we contend rest upon real foundation the insanity of prisoner is however fact upon which it is the province of the jury to decide under the direction of the presiding judge in each case the law was luminously laid down by the judge the guidance of the jury who were fully instructed to what the law required to establish the insanity of its prisoner and to prove that lesion of the will which would render human being irresponsible his acts these verdicts undoubtedly gave rise to grave discussion whether the law it now stands was sufﬁciently stringent to have reached these cases and though this question was decided in the afﬁrmative the mere entertaining of the doubt afforded another specious conﬁrmation of the impression that singular fatality was attendant upon state prosecution this idea received another support from the case of lord cardigan who about this period was unexpectedly acquitted on technical grounds from grave and serious charge this however was state prosecution and we but notice it en passant in corroboration of our general ar gument pg 5 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https now come to the case of the chartists in some time previous to the summer of 1842 great distress it will be remembered prevailed among the manufacturing population of the northern and midland counties the misery of the preceding winter had been dreadful in the extreme emaciated haggard beings might be daily seen wandering about the country half naked in the coldest weather sufferings almost without parallel were borne with patience and resignation despair there might be in the hearts of thousands but those thousands were mute and passive in their misery all was dark all was hopeless the wintry wind of penury blew untempered keen upon them but still they cried not hunger preyed upon their very vitals but they uttered complaint let us not even now refuse passing tribute of honour and respect to the passive heroism which in many an instance marked the endurance of the hopeless misery of those dreadful times at length however evil and designing men came among the es the pressing evil and means of escape from the wretchedness of their condition were darkly hinted at redress was whispered to be near and they the hungry fathers of famished children lent greedy ear to the fair promises of men whom they deemed wiser than themselves the tempter seedtime had arrived the ground was ready and the seed was sown day by day nay hour by hour was the bud of disaf fection fostered with the greatest care and day by day its stren gth and vitality increased when at length the people were deemed ripe action the mask was thrown off treasonable schemes and projects were openly proclaimed by the leaders of the coming movement and echoed from hundred hills by vast multitudes of their deluded followers large meetings were daily held on the neighbouring moors where bodies of men were openly trained and armed active and offensive operations at length the insurrection such in truth it was broke forth then living torrents of excited and exasperated men poured down those hillsides the peaceful and fected were compelled to join the insur gent ranks busy in the work of destruction and intimidation when each evening brought the work of havoc to temporary close they laid them down to rest where the darkness overtook them the roads were thus continually blockaded and those who under cover of the night sought to obtain aid and assistance from less disturbed districts were often interrupted and turned back by bodies of these men authority was at an end and large extensive district was completely at the mercy of reckless multitudes burning to avenge the sufferings of the past and bent on preventing they thought recurrence of them in future the very towns were in their hands in an evil hour vast body of insur gents was admitted into one of the largest mercantile towns of the kingdom where they pillaged and laid waste in every direction in another town of the district fearful riot was put down by force some of the leaders of the mob being shot dead while heading charge upon the military the ascendancy of the law was at length asserted many arrests took place the jails were crowded with prisoners and the multitudes without deserted by those to whom they had looked up advice their friends in prison with the unknown terrors of the law suspended over them probably then felt that miserable and lost they had been before they had now fallen even lower in the scale of human misery criminal proceedings were quickly instituted several commissions were sent down to the districts in which these disturbances had take place in order that the offenders might meet with speedy punishment the law ofﬁcers of the crown with many and able assistants in person conducted the proceedings temperate mild digniﬁed and forbearing was their demeanour in case was the individual the object of prosecution it was the crime through the person of the criminal against which the government proceeded feelings of personal nature were there exhibited and mild but ﬁrm it were parental correction of erring and misguided children seemed to be the sole object of those who then represented the government conviction was heaped upon followed miserable tool was distinguished from the man who made him what he active emissary the secret conspirator also received each their proportionate amount of punishment true few of the more cautious and crafty all included in one indictment eventually escaped the penalty due to their crimes but among the multitude of cases which were then tried this was we believe the only instance even of partial failure in spite of this single miscarriage of the govern ment the great object of these proceedings was completely answered the end of all punishment was attained the vengeance which the law then took had all the effect which the most pg 6 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https punishment of these few men could have accomplished the constitutional maxim of poena ad paucos metus ad omnes has been amply illustrated by these proceedings chartism has been suppressed by the temperate application of the constitutional means which were then resorted to the correction of its violence and the prevention of its seditious schemes we must not omit to mention the instances of signal and complete success which have been from time to time exhibited in other prosecutions against feargus and different members of the chartist body within the period of which we speak on none of these occasions has the course of justice been hindered or even turned aside but the defendants have we believe without exception paid the penalty of their crimes by enduring the punishments awarded by the court the recent trials of the rebecca rioters were also signally successful and effective and the prejudices of welsh jury which some feared would prove fatal stumblingblock were overcome by the dispassionate appeal to their better judgment then made by the ofﬁcers of the crown from review of the cases it therefore appears that the failures of state prosecution have been comparatively few and that the crown has met with even more than the average success which the glorious uncertainty of the law in general permits to those who tempt its waywardness and risk the perils of defeat the welfare and interest of the nation however lie in the general results of these proceedings rather than the particular event of an individual trial therefore though we should assume that part only of what was intended has been accomplished still if that portion produces the same general results were hoped from the succe ssful accomplishment of the whole the object of the government has been attained now it may be observed that with perhaps the single exception of the case of mr in 1831 the end and object of all state prosecution has been uniformly and completely accomplished by the suppression of the evil which the crown in each instance was anxious to put down when this has taken place there can have been failure beyond what is necessary the welfare of the state and the general safety and security of the persons and property of individuals the crown has interest in inﬂicting punishment it never asks more than is required to effect these objects and it can scarcely be content with less there are however difﬁculties almost peculiar to the more serious offences against the state but which are entirely different in their nature from those imaginary difﬁculties which have formed the subject of so much declamation passing glance at the proceedings now pending in ireland will give the most casual observer some idea of what is sometimes to be encountered by those to whom is entrusted the arduous duty of conducting state prosecution look back on the tempest of provocation which recently assailed the irish on the vexatious delays and frivolous objections which sprang up at every move of the crown lawyers called forth by one who though not valiant was well known to the government to be most cunning offence ere they challenged him but who despite his cunning fence and active practice may perhaps ﬁnd that this time the law has clutched him with grasp of iron in ordinary cases criminals may doubt be easily convicted and in the great majority of the more common crimes and misdemeanours the utmost legal ingenuity and acumen might be unable to detect single error in the proceedings from ﬁrst to last still it must be remembered that even among the more common of ordinary cases in which the forms are simple the practice certain and in which the law may be supposed to be already deﬁned beyond the possibility of doub t error or in such cases questions occasionally arise which scarcely admit of any satisfactory in which the ﬁfteen judges to whom they may be referred often ﬁnd it impossible to agree and which may therefore be reasonably supposed to be sufﬁciently perplexing to the rest of the world state offences such treason and sedition which are of comparatively rare occurrence present many questions of greater intricacy than any other class of crimes in treason especially jealousy of the power and pg 7 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https of the crown has intrench ed the subject behind line of outposts in the shape of forms and preliminary proceedings the accused his greater securi ty against power which if unwatched might become arbitrary and oppressive has been invested with rights which must be respected and complied with and by the neglect of which the whole proceedings are rendered null and void at this moment in all treasons except attempts upon the person of the sovereign the prisoner in the language of lord erskine is covered all over with the armour of the law and there must be twice the amount of evidence which would be legally competent to establish his guilt in criminal prosecution any other offence even by the meanest and most helpless of mankind sedition is head of crime of somewhat vague and indeterminate character and in many cases it may he extremely difﬁcult even an acute and practised lawyer to decide whether the circumstances amount to sedition mr east in his pleas of the crown says that sedition is understood in more general sense than treason and extends to other offences not capital of like tendency but without any actual design against the king in contemplation such contempts of the king and his governmen t riotous assemblings political purposes and the like and in general all contemptuous indecent or malicious observations upon his person and government whether by writing or speaking or by tokens calculated to lessen him in the esteem of his subjects or weaken his government or raise jealousies of him amongst the people will fall under the notion of seditious acts an offence which admits of so little precision in the terms in which it is deﬁned depending often upon the meaning to be attached to words the real import of which is varied by the tone or gesture of the speaker by the words which precede and by those which follow depending also upon the different ideas which men attach to the same words evidently rests on very different grounds from those cases where actual crimes have been perpetra ted and deeds committed which leave numerous traces behind and which may be proved by the permanent results of which they have been the cause technical difﬁculties without number also exist the most literal accuracy which is artful inuendoes the artistical averments which are necessary correctly to shape the charge ere it is submitted to the grand jury may be well conceived to involve many niceties and reﬁnements on which the case may easily be wrecked it must also be remembered that the utmost legal ingenuity is called into action and the highest professional talent is engaged in the defence of the accused the enormous pressure upon the accused himself who probably from the higher or middle classes with ample means at his command an ignominious death perhaps impending or at the least imprisonment probably years in threatening prospect close before him his friends active moving heaven and earth in his behalf scheme left untried plan or suggestion rejected by which it may even in the remotest degree be possible to avert the impending doom the additional rancour which politics sometimes infuse into the proceedings the partisanship which has occasioned scenes such should never be exhibited in the sacred arena of the halls of justice animosities which give the defence the character of party conﬂict and which cause conviction to be looked upon political defeat and an acquittal to be regarded party these circumstances in their combined and concentrated force must also be take into consideration in such case every step is fought with stern and dogged resolution even mere delay is valuable when all other hope is gone the chapter of accid ents may befriend the accused it is one chance more and even one chance however slight is not to be thrown away such is faint picture of the defensive operations on such occasions how is this untiring bitter ener gy met by those who represent the crown look on this picture and on that here all is calm digniﬁed generous and forbearing every consideration is show n every indulgence is granted to the unfortunate being who is in jeopardy the crown has interest to serve beyond that which the state possesses in the vindication of the law and in that cool deliberate and impartia l administration of justice which has so long distinguished this country nothing is unduly pressed against the prisoner but every extenuating fact is fairly laid before the jury by the crown it is in short generosity candor and forbearance on the one side matched against craft cunning and the pg 8 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https by any means to win upon the other such are the real difﬁculties which may be often felt by those who conduct state prosecution surely it is better far that these difﬁculties should in some instances be even wholly insuperable and that the prosecution should be defeated than that any change should come over the spirit in which these trials are now conducted or that the crown should ever even attempt to make the criminal process of the law an instrument of tyranny and oppression it was in the days of scroggs and jefferies and when juries through intimidation returned such verdicts the crown desired our very tenacity of our liberties may tend to render these proceedings occasionally abortive and the twelve men composing jury of the country though possibly all their sympathies would be at once enlisted in behalf of wronged and injured subject may unconsciously to themselves demand more stringent proof in cases where the sovereign power appears before then the party and more especially when the offence is of an impersonal nature and where the theory of the constituti on rather than the person or property of individuals is the object of aggression in the olden time such was the power of the crown that whenever the arm of the state was uplifted the blow fell with unerring accuracy and precision but now when each object of state prosecution is sort of modern briareus the blow must be dealt with consummate skill or it will fail to strike where it was meant to fall on this account perhaps in addition to then own intrinsic paramount importance the proceedings now pending in ireland have become the object of universal and absorbing interest throughout the whole of the united kingdom under these circumstances it has occurred to us that popular and accurate review of the several stages of crimina l prosecution by which the general reader will be able in some degree to understand the several steps of that proceeding which is now pending might not be unacceptable or uninstructive at the present moment it must however be observed that it is scarcely possible to divest subject so technical in it very nature from those terms of art which however familiar they may be to many of our readers can not be understood by all without some explanation which we shall endeavour to supply we proceed the general importance of information of this nature has been well summed up by great master of criminal law the learning touching these subjects says sir micha el foster is matter of great and universal concernment rank elevation in life and let add conduct how circumspec t soever ought to tempt reasonable man to conclude that these enquiries not nor possibly can concern him moment cool reﬂection on the utter instability of human affairs and the numberless unforeseen events which day may bring forth will be sufﬁcient to guard any man conscious of his own inﬁrmities against delusion of this kind let us suppose the minister of the day having before been made aware that in portion of the kingdom state of things existed that demanded his utmost vigilance and attention to have ascertained the realit y of the apparent danger and to have procured accurate information to the real character of the proceedings and to ﬁnd that acts apparently treasonable or seditious the case may be had been committed suppose him charged with the safety of the state and responsible the peace order and being of the community to set the const itutional process of the law in motion against the offending individuals his ﬁrst step under such circumstances must be to procure full and satisfactory evidence of the facts they really exist this purpose agents must he employed necessarily in secret or the very end and object of their mission would be frustrated to collect and gather informa tion from every authentic source and to watch with their own eyes the proceedings which have attracted attention this is work of time perhaps but suppose that it is complete and that the minister having before him in evidence true and unmistakable complete case of crime to lay before jury what under these circumstances is the ﬁrst step to be taken by the crown eithe r of two distinct modes of procedure may be chosen the one mode is by an ex ofﬁcio information the other is by indictment an indictment is the mode by which all treasons and felonies must be proceeded against and by which ordinary misdemeanours are usually brought to punishment an ex ofﬁcio information is an information at the suit of the sovereign ﬁled by the by virtue of his ofﬁce without applying to the court where pg 9 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https leave and without giving the defendant any opportunity of showing cause why it should not be ﬁled the principal difference between this form of procedure and that by indictment consists in the manner in which the proceedings are commenced in the latter case the law requires that the accusation should be warranted by the oath of twelve men before he be put to answer in other words that the grand jury must give that information to the court which in the former case is furnished by the law ofﬁcer of the crown the cases which are prosecute d by ex ofﬁcio information are properly such enormous misdemeanours peculiarly tend to disturb and endanger the gover nment or to molest or affront the sovereign in the dischar ge of the functions of the royal ofﬁce the necessity the existence of power of this nature in the state is thus set forth by that learned and illustrious judge sir william blackstone offences so highly dangerous in the punishment or prevention of which moment delay would be fatal the law has given to the crown the power of an immediate prosecution without waiting any previous application to any other tribunal which power thus necessary not only to the ease and safety but even to the very existence of the executive magistrate was originally reserved in the great plan of the englis h constitution wherein provision is wisely made the preservation of all its parts the crown therefore in case such we have imagined must ﬁrst make choice between these two modes of procedure the leniency of modern governments has of late usually resorted to the process by indictment and the crown waiving all the privileges which appertain to the kingly ofﬁce appears before the constituted tribunals of the land the redresser of the public wrongs invested with powers and clothed with authority beyond the simple rights possessed by the meanest of its subjects we shall this reason take further notice of the ex ofﬁcio information and treasons form class of offences governed by laws and rules peculiar to itself we shall also exclude this head of crime from our consideration and conﬁne ourselves solely to the ordinary criminal process by which of fenders are brought to justice in general the ﬁrst step in crimin al prosecution is to obtain warrant the apprehension of the accused party in ordinary cases warrant is granted by any justice of the peace upon information on the oath of some credible witness of facts from which it appears that crime has been committed and that the person against whom the warrant is sought to be obtained is probably the guilty party and is document under the hand and seal of the justice directed generally to the constable or other requiring him to bring the accused either generally before any justice of the county or only before the justice who granted it this is the practice in ordinary cases but in extraordinary cases the warrant may issue from the lord chief justice or the privy council the secretaries of state or from any justice of the court of queen bench these latter warrants are we believe all tested or dated england and extend over the whole kingdom so far the proceedings have been all ex parte one side only has been heard one party only has appeared and all that has been done is to procure or compel the appearance of the other the warrant is delivered to the ofﬁcer who is bound to obey the command which it contains it would seem however that was done in recent case in ireland it is sufﬁcient if the appearance of the accused be virtually secured even without the intervention of an actual arrest when the delinquent appears in consequence of this process before the author ities they are bound immediately to examine into the circumstances of the alleged crime and they are to take down in writing the examinations of the witnesses offered in supp ort of the charge if the evidence is defective and grave suspicion should attach to the prisoner he may be remanded in order that fresh evidence may be procured or the magistrate if the case be surrounded with doubt and difﬁculty may adjourn it reasonable time in order to consider his ﬁnal decision the accused must also be examined but not upon oath and his examination also must be taken down in writing and may be given in evidence against him at the trial although the maxim of the common law is nemo tenebitur prodere seipsum the legislature long ago the year 1555 directed that in cases of felony the examination of the prisoner should be taken which provision has pg 10 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https been extended to misdemeanours also care must be taken that his examination should not even appear to have been taken on oath in very recent case in which all the examinations were contained upon one sheet of paper and under one general heading which they all purported to have been taken upon oath the prisoner admission of his guilt contained in that examination was excluded on the trial and the rest of the evidence being slight he was accordingly acquitted now if upon the enquiry thus instituted and thus conducted it appea rs either that such crime was committed or that the suspicion entertained against the accused is wholly groundless or that however positively accused if the balance of testimony be strongly in favour of his innocence it is the duty of the magistrate to dischar ge him but if on the other hand the case seems to have been entirely made out or even if it should appear probable that the alleg ed crime has in fact been perpetrated by the defendant he must either be committed to prison there to he kept in safe custody until the sitting of the court before which the trial is to be heard or he may be allowed to give is to put in securities his appearance to answer the charge against him in either of these alternatives whether the accused be committed or held to bail it is the duty of the magistrate to subscribe the examinations and cause them to be delivered to the proper ofﬁcer at or before the opening of the court bail may be taken by two justices in cases of felony and by one in cases of misdemeanour in this stage of the proceedings the commitment is only safe custody whenever bail will answe r the same intention it ought to be taken in inferior crimes and misdemeanours but in offences of capital nature such the heinous crimes of treason murder and the like bail can be security equivalent to the actual custody of the person the nature of bail has been explained by mr justice blackstone to be delivery or bailment of person to his sureties upon their giving together with himself sufﬁcient security his appearance he being supposed to continue in their friendly custody instead of going to gaol to refuse or even to delay bail to any person bailable is an offence against the liberty of the subject in any magistrate by the common law and the court of queen bench will grant criminal information against the magistrate who improperly refuses bail in case in which it ought to have been received it is obviously of great importance in order to ensure the appearance of the accused at the time and place of trial that the sureties should be men of substance reasonable notice of bail in general or hours may be ordered to be given to the prosecutor in order that he may have time to examine into their sufﬁciency and responsibility when the bail appear evidence may be heard on oath and they may themselves be examined on oath upon this point if they not appear to possess property to the amount require d by the magistrates they may be rejected and others must be procured or the defender must go to prison excessive bail must not be required and on the other hand the magistrate if he take insufﬁcient bail is liable to be ﬁned if the criminal not appear to take his trial when the securities are found the bail enter into recognizance together with the accused by which they acknowledge themselves bound to the queen in the required sums if the accused does not appear to take his trial at the appointed time and place this recognizance must be subscribed by the magistrates and delivered with the examinations to the ofﬁcer of the court in which the trial is to take place with this the preliminary proceedings close the accused has had one opportunity of refuting the charge or of clearing himself from the suspicion which has gathered round him but yet there is written accusation written statement of the offence which it is alleged he has committed true he has heard evidence has heard charge made orally against the law requires greater particularity than this before man shall be put in peril upon criminal accusation the facts disclosed in the evidence before the magistrates must be put in legal form the offence must be clearly and accurately deﬁned in writin g by which the accused may be informed what speciﬁc charge he is to answer and from which he may be able to learn what liability he incurs whether his life is put in peril or whether he is in danger of transporta tion or of imprisonment or merely of pecuniary ﬁne this is done by means of the indictment the indictment is written accusation of one or more several persons preferred to and presented upon oath by grand jury this written accusation before being presented to the grand jury is properly termed bill and in ordinary cases it is generally prepared by the clerk of the arraigns at the assizes and by the clerk of the peace at the quarter pg 11 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https but in cases of difﬁculty it is drawn by counsel it consists of formal technical statement of the offence which is engrossed upon parchment upon the back of which the names of the witnesses the prosecution are indorsed in england it is delivered to the crier of the court by whom the witnesses are sworn to the truth of the evidence they are about to give before the grand jury in the trial now pending in the court of queen bench in ireland great question was raised to whether recent statute which on the ground of convenience enabled grand juries in ireland themselves to swear the witnesses extended to trials before the queen bench this question was decided in the afﬁrmative therefore in that country the oath in every case must be administered by the grand jury themse lves whereas in this country the witnesses are sworn in court and by the crier we have already mentioned the grand jury ever since the days of king ethelred must consist of twelve at least and not more than in the superior courts they are generally drawn from the magistracy or superior classes of the community being mr justice blackstone expresses it usually gentlemen of the best ﬁgure in the county they are duly sworn and instruct ed in the articles of their enquiry by the judge who presides upon the bench they then withdraw to sit and receive all bills which may be presented to them when bill is thus presented the witnesses are generally called in the order in which their names appear upon the back of the bill the grand jury is at most to hear evidence only on behalf of the prosecution says the learned commentator already quoted the ﬁnding of an indictment is only in the nature of an enquiry or accusation which is afterwards to be tried and determined and the grand jury are only to enquire upon their oaths whether there be sufﬁcient cause to call upon party to answer it they ought however to be fully persuaded of the truth of an indictment far the evidence goes and not to rest satisﬁed with remote probabilities the form of the indictment is that they upon their oath present the party to have committed the crime this form mr justice coleridge observes is perhaps stronger than may be wished and we believe that the criminal law commissioners are now seriously considering the propriety of abolishing it after hearing the evidence the grand jury endorse upon the bill their judgment of the truth or falsehood of the charge if they think the accusation groundless they write upon it not found or not true bill in which case the bill is said to be ignored but on the other hand if twelve at least are satisﬁed of the truth of the accusation the words true bill are placed upon it the bill is then said to be found it then becomes an indictment and is brought into court by the grand jury and publicly delivered by the foreman to the clerk of arraigns or clerk of the peace the case may be who states to the court the substance of the indictment and of the indorsement upon it if the bill is ignored and other bill is preferred against the party he is dischar ged without further answer when the grand jury have ﬁnished their labours and have been themselves dischar ged to ﬁnd bill twelve at least of the jury must agree man under this form of proceeding at least can be convicted even of misdemeanour unless by the unanimous voice of of his equals that is by twelve at least of the grand jury assenting to the accusation and afterwards by the whole petit jury of twelve more ﬁnding him guilty upon the trial this proceeding is wholly ex parte the informal statement of the crime brought the supposed criminal to answer before the inferior tribunal so does the formal accusation call upon him to answer before the superior court the preliminary proceedings being now complete and every step having been taken which is necessary to put the accused upon his trial the ex parte character of the proceedings is at an end the time approaches when the accused must again be brought face to face with his accusers and when if he has been admitted to bail his sureties must deliver him up to the proper authorities or their bond is forfeited in which case bench warrant the apprehension of the delinquent may issue and if he can not still be found he may be pursued to outlawry it may be here mentioned that the proceedings may be at any period removed from any inferior court into the queen bench by what is called writ of certiorari when the offender appears voluntarily to an indic tment or was before in custody or is brought in upon criminal process to answer it in the proper court he is to be immediately arraigned pg 12 pg 13 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https arraignment is simply the calling upon the accused at the bar of the court to answer the matter charged upon him in the indictment the substantial parts at least of which are then read over to him this is indispen sable in order that he may fully under stand the charge so voluminous are the counts of the indictment recently found against mr and others that the reading of the charges they contained was the work of many hours the accused is not always compelled immediately to answer the indictment if he appear in to an indictment misdemeanour in the queen bench it is sufﬁcient if he plead or demur within four days the court has discretionary power to enlar ge the time but if he neither pleads nor demurs within the time prescribed judgment may be entered against him want of plea it he appear to such an indictment having been committed or held to bail within twenty days before the assizes or sessions at which he is called upon to answer he has the option of traversing it is termed or of postponing his trial to the next assizes or sessions he is also always entitled before the trial on payment of triﬂing charge to have copies of the examinations of the witnesses on whose evidence he was committed or held to bail and at the trial he has right to inspect the originals gratuitously in prosecutions misdemeanours at the suit of the copy of indictment must be delivered free of expense if demand ed by the accused these seem to be all the privileges except that of challenge which we shall explain hereafter which the accused possesses or to which the law gives him an absolute indefeasible claim matter of right the practice of different courts may possibly vary in some degree on points such those which have been recently mooted in ireland instance to whether the names of the witnesses should be furnished to the accused and whether their address and description should also be supplied in such matters the practice might vary in considerable degree in the superior courts of england and ireland and yet each course would be strictly legal in the respective courts in which it was adopted it was clearly put by one of the irish judges on recent occasion the practice of the court is the law of the court and the law of the court is the law of the land when the time has arrived at which the accused must put in his answer to the indictment if he not confess the charge or stand mute of malice he may either plead 1st to the jurisdiction which is good plea when the court before whom the indictment is taken has cognizance of the offence when case of treason is prosecuted at the quarter sessions or 2dly he may demur by which he says that assuming that he has done every thing which the indictment lays to his charge he has nevertheless been guilty of crime and is in nowise liable to punishment the act there charged demurrer has been termed an issue in question to be determined being what construction the law puts upon admitted facts if the question of law be adjudged in favour of the accused it is attended with the same results an acquittal in fact except that he may be indicted afresh the same offence but if the question be determined against the prisoner the law in its tenderness will not allow him at least in cases of felony to be punished his misapprehension of the law or his mistake in the conduct of his pleadings but will in such case permit him to plead over to the is to plead not guilty the consequences of which plea we will consider hereafter third alternative is plea of abatement which is plea praying that the indictment may be quashed some defect which the plea points out this plea though it was recently made use of by the defendants in the case now pending in ireland is of very rare occurrence in ordinary recent statute having entirely superseded every advantage formerly to be derived from this plea in cases of misnomer or wrong name and of false addition or wrong description of the defendant rank and condition which were the principal occasions on which it was resorted to the next alternative which the prisoners may adopt is special plea in bar these pleas are of four kinds former acquittal former conviction former attainder former pardon the same offence the ﬁrst two of these pleas are founded on the maxim of the law of england that man is to be twice put in jeopardy the same offence man is attainted of felony only by judgment of death or by outlawry by pg 14 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https judgment the prisoner being already dead in law and having forfeited all his property there remains further punishment to be awarded and therefore any further proceeding would be superﬂuous this plea has however been practically put an end to by recent statute plea of pardon is the converse of plea of attainder pardon at once destroys the end and purpose of the indictment by remitting that punishment which the prosecution was calculated to inﬂict all these pleas may be answered by the crown in two may be joined on the facts they respectively set forth or they may be demurred to by which step the facts alleged in the plea are denied to constitute good and valid defence in law in felony if any of these pleas are either in fact or in law determined against the prisoner he can not be convicted or concluded by the adverse judgment and this reason formerly all felonies were punishable with death and in the words of mr justice blackstone the law allows many pleas by which prisoner may escape death but only one plea in consequence whereof it can be inﬂic ted the general issue after an impartial examination and decision of the facts by the unanimous verdict of jury the prisoner therefore although few felonies remain still capital is nevertheless still allowed to plead over before in misdemeanours however which are never capital and in which therefore such principle could ever have applied the judgment on these pleas appears to follow the analogy of civil action thus if upon issue joined plea of abatement be found against the accused the judgment on that indictment is ﬁnal though second indictment may be preferred against him but if upon demurrer the question of law is held to be against him the judgment is that he answer the indictment if plea in bar either on issue joined or on demurrer be determined against the defendant the judgment is in such case ﬁnal and he stands convicted of the misdemeanour the general issue or the plea of not guilty is the last and most usual of those answers to the indictment which we have enumerated the others being all of extremely rare occurrence in the modern practice of the criminal law by this plea the accused puts himself upon his county which county the jury are the sherif f of the county must then return panel of jurors in england the jurors are taken from the jurors book of the current year it must be observed that new jurors book comes into operation on the ﬁrst of january in each year having previously been copied from the lists of those liable to serve on juries made out in the ﬁrst instance between the months of july and october both inclusive by the churchwardens and overseers of each parish then reviewed and conﬁrmed by the justices of the peace in petty sessions and through the high constable of the district delivered to the next quarter sessions if the proceedings are before the queen bench an interval is allowed by the court in ﬁxing the time of trial the impanneling of the jury upon writ issued to the sherif f that purpose the trial in case of misdemeanour in the queen bench is had at nisi prius unless it be of such consequence to merit trial at bar which is invariably had when the prisoner is tried any capital offence in that court but before the ordinary courts of assize the sherif f by virtue of general precept directed to him beforehand returns to the court panel of not less than nor more than persons unless the judges of assize direct greater or smaller number to be summoned when the time the trial has arrived and the case is called on jurors to the number of twelve are swor n unless challenged they appear their names being generally taken promiscuously one by one out of box containing number of tickets on each of which juror name is inserted challenges may be made either on the part of the crown or on that of the accused and either to the whole array or to the separate polls the challenge to the array which must be made in writing is an exception to the whole panel on account of some partiality or default in the sherif f or his ofﬁcer who arrayed the panel the ground of which is examined into before the court challenges to the in capita exceptions to particular persons and must be made in each instance the person comes to the box to be sworn and before he is sworn when the oath is once taken the challenge is too late pg 15 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https edward coke reduces the heads of challenge to four 1st propter honoris respectum if lord of parliament be impannelled 2d propter defectum if juryman be an alien born or be in other respects generally objectionable 3d propter affectum suspicion of bias or partiality and 4th propter delictum or some crime that affects the juror credit and renders him infamous in treason and felony the prisoner is allowed the privilege of limited number of peremptory challenges after which in misdemeanours there is limit to the number of challenges if the party shows some cause each challenge to the court this cause is tried by persons appointed that purpose by the court when jurymen have been sworn but when two jurym en have been sworn they are the parties who must adjudicate upon the qualiﬁcations of those who are afterwards challenged who except when the challenge is propter delictum may be themselves examined upon oath the crown also we have seen can exercise this privilege but with this difference that cause challenge need be shown by the crown either in felonies or misdemeanours till the panel is exhausted and unless there can not be full jury without the persons so challenged when twelve men have been found they are sworn to give true verdict according to the evidence and the jury are then ready to hear the merits of the case to ﬁx their attention the closer to the facts which they are impannelled and sworn to try the indictment in cases of importance is usually opened by the junior counsel the crown proceeding by which they are brieﬂy informed of the charge which is brought against the accused the leading couns el the crown then lays the facts of the case before the jury in plain unvarnished statement appeal is made to the passions or prejudices of the twelve men who are to pronounce upon the guilt or innocence of the accused but every topic every observation which might warp their judgment or direct their attention from the simple facts which are about to be proved before them is anxiously deprecated and avoided by the counsel the prosecution the witnesses the crown are called one by one sworn examined and by the accused or his counsel when the case the crown has been brought to close the defence commences and the counsel the defendant addresses the jury it is the duty of the advocate on such an occasion to put forth all his powers in behalf of his client to obtain acquittal is his object he must sift the hostile evidence he must apply every possible test to the accuracy of the testimony and to the credibility of the witnesses he may address himself to the reason to the prejudices to the sympathies nay even to the wors t passions of the twelve men whose opinions he seeks to inﬂuence in favour of his client he may proceed to call witnesses to disprove the facts adduced on the other side or to show that the character of the accused stands too high even suspicion of the alleged clime he has the utmost liberty of speech and action he may indeﬁnitely protract the proceedings and there seems to be scarcely any limit in point of law beyond which the ultimate event of the trial may not be by these means deferred whenever the defence closes in those cases in which the government is the real prosecutor the representative of the crown has the general reply at the close of which the presiding judge sums up the evidence to the jury and informs them of the legal bearing of the facts on the effect and existence of which the jury has to decide this having been accomplished it becomes the duty of the jury to deliberate decide and pronounc their verdict if the verdict be not guilty the accused is ever quit and dischar ged of the accusation but if the jury prono unce him guilty he stands convicted of the crime which has been thus charged and proved against him and awaits the judgment of the court in felonies and ordinary misdemeanours judgment is generally pronounced immediately upon or soon after the delivery of the verdict in other cases when the trial has been had before the queen bench the judgment may in england be pronounced either immediately or during the ensuing term but whenever this event occurs the prisoner has still one chance more escape he can move an arrest of judgment on the grounds either that the indictment is substantially defective or that he has already been pardoned or punished the same offense these objections if successful will even at this late stage of the proceedings save the defendant from the consequences of his crime but if these last resources fail the court must give the judgment or pronounce the measure of that punishment which the law annexes to the crime of which the prisoner has been convicted pg 16 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https the law of this country the species of punishment every offence is always ascertained but between certain deﬁned limits the measure and degree of that punishment is with very few exceptions left to the discretion of the presiding judge treasons and some felonies are indeed capital but in the mercy of modern times the great majority of felonies and all misdemeanours are visited some with various terms of transportation or imprisonment which in most cases may be with or without hard labour at the discretion of the court in these cases the punishment is prescribed by the statute law but there are some misdemeanours the punishment of which has not been interfered with by any statute and to which therefore the common law punishments are still attached the case of mr which is now in abeyance seems to range itself under this head of misdemeanours such cases are punishable by ﬁne or imprisonment or by both but the amount of the one or the duration of the other is each left at large to be estimated by the court according to the more or less aggravated nature of the offence and it is said also according to the quality and condition of the parties that ﬁne should in all cases be reasonable has been declared by magna charta and the bill of rights has also provided that excessive ﬁne or cruel and unusual punishmen ts should not be inﬂicted but what may or may not be unreasonable or excessive cruel or unusual is left entirely to the judgment of the executive crimes of dark political hue which by their tendency to subvert the government or destroy the institutions of the country necessarily assume character highly dangerous to the safety and of the state it might be difﬁcult to say what degree of punishment would be excessive or unusu al it seems probable that in cases of this nature which include crimes so varied in their circumstances that there appears limit to the degree of guilt the nature and character of which could not possibly be foreseen or provided in all their inﬁnite multiplicity of detail it seems probable that in such cases large discretion may have been purposely left by the frame rs of our constitution in order that the degree of guilt on each occasion should be measured by an expansive scale of punishment applied indeed and administered by the judges of the land but regulated and adjusted in each succeeding age by the inﬂuence of public opinion and by the spirit and temper of the times even at this latest stage of criminal prosecution in the interval which must necessarily elapse between the pronouncing and the inﬂiction of the sentence the convicted delinquent is not without remedy any wrong he may sustain in the act which terminates the proceedings if any judgement not warranted by law be given by the court it may be reversed upon writ of error which lies from all inferior criminal jurisdictions to the queen bench and from the queen bench to the house of peers these writs however in cases of misdemeanour are not allowed of course but on probable cause shown to the attorney general and then they are understood to be grantable of common right and ex debito justitiæ the crown if every other resource has failed the prisoner has always the power of exercising the most amiable of its prerogatives though the sovereign herself condemns man the great operation of her sceptre is mercy and the chief magistrate in the words of sir william blackstone holding court of equity in his own breast to soften the rigour of the general law in such criminal cases merit an exemption from punishment is ever at liberty to grant free unconditional and gracious pardon to the injured or repentant convict we have now rapidly traced the progress of criminal prosecution from its commencement to its close and we have given summary of the ordinary proceedings on such occasions although it may be possible that the practice of the courts in ireland on minor points should occasionally differ in some degree from the practice of the english courts we may nevertheless have rendered the proceedings now pending in the sister isle more intelligible to the general reader who may now perhaps be enabled to see the bearing and understand the importance of many struggles whic h to the unlearned might probably appear to be wholly beside the real question now at issue between the crown and mr whatever be the result of that prosecution whether those indicted be found guilty or acquitted of the misdemeanours laid to their pg 17 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https we feel assured on the one hand however long and grievous may have been the provocation that while there will be nothing extenuate neither will there be set down aught in malice but that the measure of the retribution now demanded by the state will be so temperately and equitably adjusted that while the very semblance of oppression is carefully avoided the majesty of the law and the powers of the executive will be amply and entirely vindicated on the other hand if mr and his companions in guilt or misfortune should break through the cobwebs of the law and hurl retrospective deﬁance at the government we feel the utmost conﬁdence that the learning foresight and ability of the eminent lawyers who represent the crown together with the ﬁrmness and integrity of the irish bench sans peur et sans reproche will demonstrate to the millions who look on that the constitutional powers of the state still remain uninjured and unimpaired in all their pristine and legitimate energy and vigour and that neither in the machinery now set in motion nor with those who conduct or superintend its action but with others on whom in the course of these proceedings will be thrown the execution of grave and duty must rest the real blame if blame there be of the failure of this state prosecution adventures in texas iii the struggle i had been but three or four months in texas when in consequence of the oppressive conduct of the mexican military authori ties symptoms of discontent showed themselves and several skirmishes occurred between the american settlers and the soldiery the two small forts of velasco and nacogdoches were taken by the former and their garrisons and couple of made prisone rs soon after which however the quarrel was made up by the intervention of colonel austin on the part of texas and colonel mejia on the part of the mexican authorities but in the year occurred santa anna defection from the liberal party and the imprisonment of stephen austin the texian representative in the mexican congress by the gomez farias this was followed by texas adopting the constitution of 1824 and declaring itself an independent state of the mexican republic finally towards the close of 1835 texas threw off the mexican yoke altogether voted itself free and sovereign republic and prepared to defend by arms its newly asserted liberty the ﬁrst step to be taken was to secure our communications with the united states by getting possession of the general cos had occupied galveston harbour and built and garrisoned nominally the purpose of enforcing the customs laws but in reality with view to cut off our communications with new orleans and the states this fort it was necessary to get possession of and my friend fanning and myself were appointed to that duty by the alcal who had taken prominent part in all that had occurred our whole force and equipment wherew ith to accomplish this enterprise consisted in sealed despatch to be opened at the town of columbia and named agostino who acted our guide on reaching columbia we called together the principal inhabitants of the place and of the neighbouring towns of bolivar and marion unsealed the letter in their presence and six hours afterwards the forces therein speciﬁed were assembled and we were on our march towards galveston the next day the fort was taken and the garrison made prisoners without our losing single man pg 18 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https sent off our guide to the governmen t at san felipe with news of our success in nine days he returned bringing us the thanks of congress and fresh orders we were to leave garrison in the fort and then ascend trinity river and march towards san antonio bexar this route was all the more agreeable to fanning and myself it would bring us into the immediate vicinity of the haciendas or estates of which we had some time previously obtained grant from the texian government and we did not doubt that we were indebted to our friend the alcalde the orders which thus conciliated our private convenience with our public duty we marched along we found the whole country in commotion the settlers all arming and hastening to the distant place of rendezvous we arrived at trinity river one afternoon and immediately sent messengers forty miles in all directions to summon the inhabitants at the period in question the plantations in that part of the country were very few and far between but nevertheless by the afternoon of the next day we had got together men mounted on mustangs each equipped with riﬂe and knife powder and and furnished with provisions several days with these we started san antonio bexar march of two hundred and ﬁfty miles through trackless prairies intersected with rivers and streams which although not quite so big the mississippi or potomac were yet deep and wide enough to have offered serious impediment to regular armies but to texian farmers and backwoodsmen they were triﬂing obstacles those we could not wade through we swam over and in due time and without any incident worthy of note reached the appointed place of rendezvous which was on the river salado about ﬁfteen miles from san antonio the principal city of the province this latter place it was intended to enterprise of some boldness and risk considering that the town was protected by strong fort amply provided with heavy artillery and had garrison of nearly three thousand men commanded by ofﬁcers who had the most part distinguished themselves in the revolutionary wars against the spaniards our whole army which we found encamped on the salado under the command of general austin did not exceed eight hundred men the day after that on which fanning and myself with our four and thirty recruits reached headquarters council of war was held and it was resolved to advance far the mission of santa espada the advanced guard was to push forward immediately the main body would follow the next day fanning and myself were appointe d to the command of the vanguard in conjuncti on with mr wharton wealthy planter who had brought strong party of volunteers with him and whose mature age and cool judgment it was thought would counterbalance any excess of youthful heat and impetuos ity on our part selecting men out of the eight hundred who to man volun teered to accompany us we set out the mission these missions are sort of or outposts of the catholic church and are found in great numbers in all the frontier provinces of spanish america especially in texas santa fe and cohahuila they are usually of sufﬁcient strength to afford their inmates security against any predatory party of indians or other marauders and are occupied by priests who while using their endeavours to spread the doctrines of the church of rome act also spies and agents of the mexican government on reaching san espada we held discussion to the propriety of remaining there until the general came up or of advancing at once towards the river wharton inclined to the former plan and it was certainly the most prudent the mission was strong building surrounded by high wall and might have been held against very superior numbers fanning and i however did not like the idea of being cooped up in house and at last wharton yielded we left our horses and mustangs in charge of eight men and with the remainder set out in the direction of the salado which ﬂows from north to south third of mile to the westward of the mission about between the latter and the river was small group or island of muskee t trees the only object that broke the uniformity of the prairie the bank of the river on our side was tolerably steep about eight or ten feet high hollowed out here and there and covered with thick network of wild vines pg 19 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https salado at this spot describes sort of curve with ford at eithe r end by which alone the river can be passed although not very broad it is rapid and deep we resolved to take up position within this bow calculating that we might manage to defend the two fords which were not above quarter of mile apart at the same time we did not lose sight of the dangers of such position and of the almost certainty that if the enemy managed to cross the river we should be surrounded and cut off but our success on the few occasions on which we had hitherto come to blows with the mexicans at velasco nacogdoches and galveston had inspire d us with so much conﬁdence that we considered ourselves match thousands of such foes and actually began to wish the enemy would attack us before our main body came up we reconnoitred the ground stationed picket of twelve men at each ford and an equal number in the island of muskeet trees and established ourselves with the remainder amongst the vines and in the hollows on the river bank the commissariat department of the texian army was may be supposed not yet placed upon any very regular footing in fact every man was the present his own finding our stock of provisions to be very small we sent out party of foragers who soon returned with three sheep which they had taken from rancho within mile of san antonio an old priest whom they found there had threate ned them with the anger of heaven and of general cos but they paid little attention to his denunciations and throwing down three dollars walked off with the sheep the priest became furious got upon his mule and trotted away in the direction of the city to complain to general cos of the misconduct of the heretics after this we made doubt that we should soon have visit from the worthy dons nevertheless the evening and the night passed away without incident day signs of the mexicans this treacherous sort of calm we thought might forbode storm and we did not allow it to lull us into security we let the men get their breakfast which they had hardly ﬁnished when the picket from the upper ford came in with news that strong body of cavalry was approaching the river and that their vanguard was already in the hollow way leading to the ford we had scarcely received this intelligence when we heard the blare of the trumpets and the next moment we saw the ofﬁcers push their horses up the declivitous bank closely followed by their men whom they formed up in the prairie we counted six small squadrons about three hundred men in all they were the durango troops enough to all appearance capitally mounted and equipped and armed with carbines and sabres although the enemy had doubtless reconnoitred us from the opposite shore and ascertained our position he could not form any accurate idea of our numbers with view to deceive him we kept the men in constant motion sometimes showing part of them on the prairie then causing them to disappear again behind the vines and bushes this was all very knowing young soldiers such we were but on the other hand we had committed grievous error and sinned against all established military rules by not placing picket on the further side of the river to warn us of the approach of the enemy and the direction in which he was coming there can be little doubt that if we had earlier notice of their approach thirty or forty good all our people were might not only have delayed the advance of the mexicans but perhaps even totally disgusted them of their attempt to cross the salado the hollow way on the other side of the river leading to the ford was narrow and tolerably steep and the bank was at least six times high on our side nothing would have been easier than to have stationed party so to pick off the cavalry they wound through this kind of pass and emer ged two by two upon the shore our error however did not strike us till it was too late to repair it so we were fain to console ourselves with the reﬂection that the mexicans would be much more likely to attribute our negligence to an excess of conﬁdence in our resources than to the inexperience in military matters which was its real cause we resolved to our best to merit the good opinion which we thus supposed them to entertain of us pg 20 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https the whole of the dragoons had crossed the water they marched on short distance in an easterly direction then wheeling to the right proceeded southw ard until within some ﬁve hundred paces of us where they halted in this position the line of cavalry formed the chord of the arc described by the river and occupied by us soon they halted they opened their ﬁre although the could not see one of us we were completely sheltered by the bank our mexican heroes however appa rently did not think it necessary to be within sight or range of their opponents before ﬁring they gave us rattling volley at distance which carbine would carry this done others galloped on about hundred yards halted again loaded ﬁred another volley and then giving another gallop ﬁred again they continued this sort of manège till they found themselves within two hundred and ﬁfty paces of us and then appeared inclined to take little time reﬂection we kept ourselves perfectly still the dragoons evidently did not like the aspect of matters our remaining concealed and not replying to their ﬁre seemed to bother them we saw the ofﬁcers taking deal of pains to encourage their men and at last two squadrons advanced the others following more slowly short distance in rear this was the moment we had waited soon er had the dragoons got into canter than six of our men who had received orders to that effect sprang up the bank took steady aim at the ofﬁcers ﬁred and then jumped down again we had expected the small numbers that had shown themselves encouraged the mexicans to advance they seemed at ﬁrst taken rather aback by the fall of four of their ofﬁcers but nevertheless after moment hesitation they came thundering along full speed they were within sixty or seventy yards of us when fanning and thirty of our riﬂemen ascended the bank and with coolness and precision that would have done credit to the most veteran troops poured steady ﬁre into the ranks of the dragoons it requires some nerve and courage men who have never gone through any regular military training to stand their ground singly and unprotected within ﬁfty yards of an advancing line of cavalry our fellows did it however and ﬁred not all at once or in hurry but slowly and deliberately running ﬁre every shot of which told saddle after saddle was emptied the men they had been ordered always picking out the foremost horsemen and soon they had ﬁred jumping down the bank to reload when the whole of the thirty men had dischar ged their riﬂes wharton and myself with the reserve of six and thirty more took their places but the dragoons had almost had enoug h already and we had scarcely ﬁred ten shots when they executed turn with an uniformity and rapidity which did inﬁnite credit to their drill and went off at pace that soon carried them out of reach of our bullets they had probably not expected so warm reception we saw their ofﬁcers doing every thing they could to check their ﬂight imploring threatening even cutting at them with their sabres but it was use if they were to be killed it must be in their own way and they preferred being cut down by their ofﬁcers to encountering the deadly precision of riﬂes in the hands of men who being sure of hitting squirrel at hundred yards were not likely to miss durango dragoon at any point within range our object in ordering the men to ﬁre slowly was always to have thirty or forty riﬂes loaded wherewith to receive the enem y should he attempt charge en masse but our ﬁrst greeting had been sickener and it appeared almost doubtful whether he would venture to attack us again although the ofﬁcers did every thing in their power to induce their men to advance long time neither threats entreaties nor reproaches produced any effect we saw the ofﬁcers gesticulating furiously pointing to us with their sabres and impatiently spurring their horses till the ﬁery animals plunged and reared and sprang with all four feet from the ground it is only just to say that the ofﬁcers exhibited degree of courage far beyond any thing we had expected from them of the two squadrons that charged us of the ofﬁcers had fallen but those who remained pg 21 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https of appearing intimidated by their comrades fate redoubled their efforts to bring their men forward at last there appeared some probability of their accomplishing this after most curious and truly mexican fashion posting themselves in front of their squadrons they rode on alone hundred yards or so halted looked round much to y see there is danger far this and then galloping back led their men on each time that they executed this manoeuvre the dragoons would advance slowly some thirty or forty paces and then halt simultaneously if the word of command had been given off went the ofﬁcers again some distance to the front and then back again to their men and got them on little further in this manner these heroes were inveigled once more to within hundred and ﬁfty yards of our position of course at each of the numerous halts which they made during their advance they favoured us with general but most innocuous dischar ge of their carbines and at last gaining conﬁdence i suppose from our passiveness and from the noise and smoke they themselves had been making three squadrons which had not yet been under ﬁre formed open column and advanced at trot without giving them time to halt or reﬂect forward char ge shouted the ofﬁcers urging their own horses to their utmost speed and following the impulse thus given the three squadrons came char ging furiously along up sprang thirty of our men to receive them their orders were to ﬁre slowly and not throw away shot but the gleaming sabres and rapid approach of the dragoon s ﬂurried some of them and ﬁring hasty volley they jumped down the bank again this precipitation had nearly been fatal to us several of the dragoons fell and there was some confusion and momentary faltering amongst the others but they still came on at this critical moment wharton and myself with the reserves showed ourselves on the bank slow and your men shouted we both wharton on the right and i on the left the command was obeyed riﬂe after riﬂe cracked off always aimed at the foremost of the dragoons and at every report saddle was emptied before we had all ﬁred fanning and dozen of his sharpest men had again loaded and were by our side nearly minute the mexicans remained if stupeﬁed by our murderous ﬁre and uncertain whether to advance or retire but those who attempted the former were invariably shot down they at last began retreat which was soon converted into rout we gave them farewell volley which eased few more horses of their riders and then got under cover again to await what might next occur but the mexican caballeros had notion of coming up to the scratch third time they kept patrolling about some three or four hundred yards off and ﬁring volleys at us which they were able to with perfect impunity at that distance we did not think proper to return shot the skirmish had lasted nearly three quarters of an hour strange to say we had not had single man wounded although at times the bullets had fallen about us thick hail we could not account this many of us had been hit by the balls but bruise or graze of the skin was the worst consequence that had ensued we were in fair way to deem ourselves invulnerable we were beginning to think that the ﬁght was over the day when our videttes at the lower ford brought us the somewhat unpleasant intelligence that large masses of infantry were approaching the river and would soon be in sight the words were hardly uttered when the roll of the drums and shrill squeak of the ﬁfes became audible and in few minutes the head of the column of infantry having crossed the ford ascended the sloping bank and deﬁled in the prairie opposite the island of muskeet trees company after company appeared we were able to form pretty exact estimate of their numbers there were two battalions together about thousand men and they brought with them pg 22 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https were certainly rather long odds to be opposed to men and three ofﬁcers it must be remembered that we had left twenty of our people at the mission and in the island of trees two battalions of infantry and six squadrons of latter to be sure disheartened and diminished by the loss of some ﬁfty men but nevertheless formidable opponents now they were supported by the foot soldiers about twenty mexicans to each of us it was getting past joke we were all capital shots and most of us besides our riﬂes had brace of pistols in our belts but what were ﬁve riﬂes and ﬁve or six score of pistols against thousand muskets and bayo nets two hundred and ﬁfty dragoons and loaded with canister if the mexicans had spark of courage or soldiership about them our fate was sealed but it was exactly this courage and soldiership which we made sure would be wanting nevertheless we the ofﬁcers could not repress feeling of anxiety and when we reﬂected that we had brought our comrades into such hazardous predicament but on looking around us our apprehensions vanished nothing could exceed the perfect coolness and conﬁdence with which the men were cleaning and preparing their riﬂes the approaching conﬂict boasting talking or laughing but calm decision of manner which at once told us that if it were possible to overcome such odds were brought against us those were the men to it our arrangements the approaching struggle were soon completed fanning and wharton were to make head against the infantry and cavalry i was to capture the this gun was placed by the mexicans upon their extreme left close to the river the shores of which it commanded considerable distance the bank on which we were posted was before mentioned indented by caves and hollows and covered with thick tapestry of vines and other plants which was now very useful in concealing us from the artillerymen the latter made pretty good guess at our position however and at the ﬁrst dischar ge the canister whizzed past us at very short distance there was not moment to lose one shot might exterminate half of us followed by dozen men i worked my way well i could through the labyrinth of vines and bushes and was not more than ﬁfty yards from the gun when it was again ﬁred one was hurt although the shot was evidently intended my party the enemy could not see us but the notion of the vines we passed through them had betrayed our whereabout so perceiving that we were discovered i sprang up the bank into the prairie followed by my men to whom i shouted above all to aim at the artillerymen i had raised my own riﬂe to my shoulder when i let it fall again in astonishment at an apparition that presented itself to my view this was tall lean wild ﬁgure with face overgrown by long beard that hung down upon his breast and dressed in leather cap jacket and mocassins where this man had sprung from was perfect riddle he was unknown to any of us although i had some vague recollection of having seen him before but where or when i could not call to mind he had long riﬂe in his hands which he must have ﬁred once already one of the artillerymen lay dead by the gun at the moment i ﬁrst caught sight of him he shot down another and then began reloa ding with rapid dexterity that proved him to be well used to the thing my men were much astonished i was by this strange appa rition which appeared to have started out of the earth and few seconds they forgot to ﬁre and stood gazing at the stranger the latter did not seem to approve of their inaction yer eyes ye starin fools shouted he in rough hoarse voice ye see them why ye knock on the head it certainly was not the moment to remain idle we ﬁred but our astonish ment had thrown us off our balance and we nearly all missed we sprang down the bank again to load just the men serving the gun were slewing it around so to bring it to bear upon us before this was accomplished we were under cover and the stranger had the beneﬁt pg 23 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https the dischar ge of which he took more notice than if he had borne charmed life again we heard the crack of his riﬂe and when having reloaded we once more ascended the bank he was taking aim at the last artilleryman who fell his companions had done ye laggin fellers growled the stranger why ye take that big gun our small numbers the bad direction of our ﬁrst volley but above all the precipitation with which we had jumped down the bank after ﬁring it had so encouraged the enemy that company of infantry drawn up some distance in rear of the ﬁred volley and advanced at time part of them making small détour with the intention of cutting us off from our friends at this moment we saw fanning and thirty men coming along the river bank to our assistance so without minding the mexicans who were getting behind us we rushed forward to within twenty paces of those in our front and taking steady aim brought down every man his bird the sort of desperate coolness with which this was done produced the greater effect on our opponents being something quite out of their way they would perhaps have stood ﬁrm against volley from ﬁve times our number at rather greater distance but they did not like having their mustaches singed by our powder and after moment wave ring and hesitation they shouted out diabolos diabolos and throwing away their muskets broke into precipitate ﬂight fanning and wharton now came up with all the men under cover of the infantry advance the gun had been but luckily us only by infantry soldiers had there been artillerymen to seize the moment when we were all standing exposed on the prairie they might have diminished our numbers not little the fuse was already burning and we had just time to get under the bank when the gun went off up we jumped again and looked about us to see what was next to be done although hitherto all the advantages had been on our side our situation was still very perilous one the company we had put to ﬂight had rejoined its battalion which was now beginning to advance by échelon of companies the second battalion which was rather further from us was moving forward in like manner and in parallel direc tion we should probably therefore have to resist the attack of dozen companies one after the other and it was to be feared that the mexicans would ﬁnish by getting over their panic terror of our riﬂes and exchange their distant and ineffectual charge with the bayonet in which their superior numbers would tell we observed also that the cavalry which had been keeping itself at safe distance was now put in motion and formed up close to the island of muskeet trees to which the right ﬂank of the infantry was also extending itself thence they had clear ground char ge down upon us meanwhile what had become of the twelve men whom we had left in the island were they still there or had they fallen back upon the mission in dismay at the overwhelming force of the mexicans if the latter it was bad business us they were all capital shots and well armed with riﬂes and pistols we heartily wished we had brought them with us well the eight men at the mission cut off from us they were what could they against the whole of the cavalry and two companies of infantry which were now approaching the island to add to our difﬁculties our ammunition was beginning to run short many of us had only had enough powder and ball ﬁfteen or sixteen charges which were now reduced to six or seven it was use desponding however and after hurried consultation it was agreed that fanning and wharton should open ﬁre upon the enemy centre while i made dash at the before any more infantry had time to come up its protection the who had the gun were by this time shot down and none had come to replace them it was served by an ofﬁcer alone just i gave the order to advance to the twenty men who were to follow this ofﬁcer fell simultaneously with pg 24 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https fall i heard sort of yell behind and turning round saw that it proceeded from the wild stranger whom i had lost sight of during the last few minutes ball had struck him and he fell heavily to the ground his riﬂe which had just been dischar ged and was still smoking from muzzle and touchhole clutched convulsively in both hands his features distorted his eyes rolling frightfully there was someth ing in the expression of his face at that moment which brought back to in vivid colou ring one of the earliest and most striking incidents of my residence in texas had i not myself seen him hung i could have sworn that bob rock the mur derer now lay before second look at the man gave additional force to this idea bob i exclaimed bob repeated the wounded man in broken voice and with look of astonishment almost of dismay who calls bob wild gleam shot from his eyes which the next instant closed he had become insensible it was neither the time nor the place to indulge in speculations on this singular resurrection of man whose execution i had myself witnessed with twelve hundred foes around us we had plenty to occupy all our thoughts and attention my people were already masters of the gun and some of them drew it forwards and pointed it against the enemy while the others spread out right and left to protect it with their riﬂes i was busy loading the piece when an exclamation of surprise from one of the men made look up there seemed to be something extraord inary happening amongst the mexicans to judge from the degree of confusion which suddenly showed itself in their ranks and which beginning with the cavalry and right ﬂank of the infantry soon became general throughout their whole force it was sort of wavering and unsteadiness which to us was quite unaccountable fanning and wharton had not yet ﬁred twenty shots and indeed had only just come within range of the enemy not knowing what it could portend i called in my men and stationed them round the gun which i had shotted and stood ready to ﬁre the confusion in the mexican ranks increased about minute they waved and reeled to and fro if uncertain which way to go and at last the cavalry and right of the line fairly broke and ran it this example was followed by the centre and presently the whole of the two battalions and three hundred cavalry were scattered over the prairie in the wildest and most disorderly ﬂight i gave them parting salute from the pounder which would doubtless have accelerated their movements had it been possible to run faster than they were already doing we stood staring after the fugitives in perfect bewilderment totally unable to explain their apparently causeless panic at last the report of several riﬂes from the island of trees gave us clue to the mystery the infantry whose left ﬂank extended to the salado had pushed their right into the prairie far the island of muskeet trees in order to connect their line with the dragoons and then by making general advance to attack us on all sides at once and get the full advantage of their superior numbers the plan was not bad one infantry and cavalry approached the island quite unsuspicious of its being occupied the twelve riﬂemen whom we had stationed there remained perfectly quiet concealed behind the trees allowed squadrons and companies to come within twenty paces of them and then opened their ﬁre ﬁrst from their pistols then from their riﬂes some six and thirty shots every one of which told ﬁred suddenly from cover close to their rear were enough to startle even the best troops much more so our mexican dons who already sufﬁciently inclined to panic now believed themselves fallen into an pg 25 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https and surrounded on all sides by the incarnate diabolos they called us the cavalry who had not yet recovered the thrashing we had given them were ready enough run and the infantry were not slow to follow them our ﬁrst impulse was naturally to pursue the ﬂying enemy but discovery made by some of the men induced us to abandon that idea they had opened the pouches of the dead mexicans in order to supply themselves with ammunition ours being nearly expended but the powder of the cartridges turned out so bad to be useless it was little better than coal dust and would not carry ball ﬁfty paces to kill or wound this accounted our apparent invulnerability to the ﬁre of the mexicans the muskets also were of very inferior description both they and the cartridges were of english make the former being stamped birmingham and the latter having the name of an english powder manufactory with the signiﬁcant addition exportation under these circumstances we had nothing to but let the mexicans run we sent detachment to the muskeet island to unite itself with the twelve men who had done such good service there and thence advance towards the ford we ourselves proceeded slowly in the latter direction this demonstratio n brought the fugitives back again they had most of them in the wild precipitation of their ﬂight passed the only place where they could cross the river they began crowding over in the greatest confusion foot and horse all mixed up together and by the time we got within hundred paces of the ford the prairie was nearly clear of them there were still couple of hundred men on our side of the water completely at our mercy and wharton who was little in front with thirty men gave the word to ﬁre upon them one obeyed he repeated the command not riﬂe was raised he stared at his men astonished and impatient at this strange disobedience an old weather stepped forward squirting out his tobacco juice with all imaginable deliberation i tell ye what capting said he passin g his quid over from his right cheek to his left i calkilate capting he continued we better leave the poor devils of dons alone the poor devils of dons alone repeated wharton in rage are you mad man fanning and i had just come up with our detachment and were not less surprised and angry than wharton was at this breach of discipline the man however did not allow himself to be disconcerted there proverb gentlemen said he turning to us which says that one should build golden bridge beaten enemy and good proverb it is i considerable good one what you mean man with your golden bridge cried fanning this is time proverbs you know that you are liable to be punished insubordination said i it your duty to ﬁre and the enemy all the harm you can not to be quoting proverbs calkilate it is replied the man very coolly calkilate i could shoot without either danger or trouble but i reckon that would be like spaniards or mexicans not like prudent not like americans would you let the enemy escape then when we have him in our power calkilate i would calkilate we should ourselves more harm than him by shooting down his people that was considerable sensible commandment of yourn always to shoot the foremost of the mexicans when they attacked it discouraged the bold ones and was sort of premium on cowardice them lagged behind escaped them came bravely on were shot it was good calkilation if we had shot without pg 26 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https the cowards would have got bold seein that they were safer in rear than in front the cowards are our best friends now them runaways continued he pointing to the mexicans who were crowding over the river are jest the most cowardly of all in their fright they quite forgot the ford and it because they ran so far beyond it that they are last to cross the water and if you ﬁre at now they ﬁnd that they get nothin by bein cowards and next time i reckon they sell their hides dear they can untimely this palaver to use popular word undoubtedly was we could scarcely forbear smiling at the simple naïve manner in which the old yankee spoke his mind calkilate captings he concluded you better let the poor devils run we shall get more proﬁt by it than if we shot ﬁve hundred of next time they run away directly to show their gratitude our ginerosity the man stepped back into the ranks and his comrades nodded approvingly and calculated and reckoned that zebediah had spoke true word and meanwhile the enemy had crossed the river and was out of our reach we were forced to content ourselves with sending party across the water to follow up the mexicans and observe the direction they took we then returned to our old position my ﬁrst thought on arriving there was to search the body of bob he it undoubtedly was who had so mysterio usly appeared amongst us i repaired to the spot where i had seen him fall but could discover signs of him either dead or alive i went over the whole scene of the ﬁght searched amongst the vines and along the bank of the river there were plenty of dead infantry and artillery but bob was to be found nor could any one inform what had become of him although several had seen him fall i was continuing my search when i met wharton who asked what i was seeking and on learning shook his head gravely he had seen the wild prairieman he said but whence he came or whither he was gone was more than he could tell it was long time since any thing had startled and astonished him so much this man appearance and proceedings he wharton had been stationed with his party amongst the vines about ﬁfty paces in rear of fanning people when just the mexican infantry had crossed the ford and were forming up he saw man approaching at brisk trot from the north side of the prairie he halted about couple of hundred yards from wharton tied his mustang to bush and with his riﬂe on his arm strode along the edge of the prairie in the direction of the mexicans when he passed near wharton the latter called out to him to halt and say who he was whence he came and whither going who i am is business of yourn replied the man nor where i come from neither you soon see where i goin i goin agin the enemy then you must come and join us cried wharton this the stranger testily refused to he ﬁght on his own hook he said wharton told him he must not that he should like to see who hinder him he said and walked on the next moment he shot the ﬁrst artilleryman after that they let him take his own way neither wharton nor any of his men knew what had become of him but at last i met with bear who gave the following information calkilatin said he that the wild prairieman riﬂe was capital good one good one ever killed bear he it pity that it should fall into bad hands so went to secure it himself although the frontisp iece of its dead owner war very invitin but pg 27 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https he stooped to take the gun he got such shove knocked him backwards and on getting up he saw the prairieman openin his jacket and examinin wound on his breast which was neither deep nor dangerous although it had taken away the man senses while the ball had struck the breast bone and was quite near the skin so that the wounded man pushed it out with his ﬁngers and then supporting himself on his riﬂe got up from the ground and without either thankye or walked to where his mustang was tied up got on its back and rode slowly away in northerly direction this was all the information i could obtain on the subject and shortly afterwards the main body of our army came up and i had other matters to occupy my attention general austin expressed his gratitude and approbation to our brave fellows after truly republican and democratic fashion he shook hands with all the rough bear and buffalo hunters and drank with them fanning and myself he promoted on the spot to the rank of colonel we were giving the general detailed account of the morning events when mexican priest appeared with ﬂag of truce and several waggons and craved permission to take away the dead this was of course granted and we had some talk with the padré who however was too wily customer to allow himself to be pumped what little we did get out of him determined us to advance the same afternoon against san antonio we thought there was some chance that in the present state of the mexicans we might obtain possession of the place by bold and sudden assault in this however we were mistaken we found the gates closed and the enemy on his guard but too dispirited to oppose our taking up position at about from the great redoubt we had soon invested all the outlets from the city san antonio bexar lies in fertile and valley stretching westward from the river salado in the centre of the town rises the fort of the alamo which at that time was armed with pieces of artillery of various calibre the garrison of the town and fortress was nearly three thousand strong our artillery consisted of two batteries of four six and ﬁve our army of eleven hundred men with which we had not only to carry on the siege but also to make head against the forces that would be sent against us from cohahuila on the frontier of which province general cos was stationed with strong body of troops we were not discouraged however and opened our ﬁre upon the city during the ﬁrst week not day passed without smart skirmishes general cos dragoons were swarming about us like so many bedouins but although and capital horsem en they were match our backwoodsmen those from the western states especially accustomed to indian warfare and cunning laid traps and ambuscades the mexicans and were constantly destroying their detachments the besieged if one of them showed his head ten seconds above the city wall he was sure of getting riﬂe bullet through it i can not say that our besieging army was perfect model of military discipline but any deﬁciencies in that respect were made good by the intelligence of the men and the zeal and unanimity with which they pursued the accomplishment of one great capture of the liberty and independence of texas the badness of the gunpowder used by the mexicans was again of great service to us many of their cannon balls that fell far short of us were collected and returned to them with powerful effect we kept sharp convoys and captured less than of horses another of provisions and twenty thousand dollars in money after an eight weeks siege breach having been made the city surrendered and month later the fort followed the example with powerful park of artillery we then advanced upon goliad the strongest fortress in texas which likewise capit ulated in about four weeks time we were now masters of the whole country and the war was apparently at an end pg 28 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https the mexicans were not the people to give up their best province so easily they have too much of the old spanish character about determined obstina cy which sustained the spaniards during their protracted struggle against the moors the honour of their republic was compromised and that must be redeemed thundering proclamations were issued denouncing the texians rebels who should be swept off the face of the earth and threatening the united states having aided us with money and volunteers ten thousand of the best troops in mexi co entered texas and were shortly to be followed by ten thousand more the president general santa anna himself came to take the command attended by numerous and brilliant staf the texians laughed at the fanfarrona des of the dons and did not attach sufﬁcient importance to these formidable preparations their good opinion of themselves and contempt of their foes had been increased to an unreasonable degree by their recent and rapid successes they forgot that the troops to which they had hitherto been opposed were the most part militia and that those now advancing against them were of far better description and had probably better powder the call to arms made by our president burnet was disregarded by many and we could only get together about two thousand men of whom nearly rds had to be left to garrison the forts of goliad and alamo in the ﬁrst named place we left seven hundred and sixty men under the command of fanning in the latter something more than ﬁve hundred with the remaining seven or eight hundred we took the ﬁeld the mexicans advanced so rapidly that they were upon us before we were aware of it and we were compelled to retreat leaving the garrisons of the two forts to their fate and right melancholy one it proved to be one morning news was brought to goliad that number of country people principally women and children were on their way to the fort closely pursued by the mexicans fanning losing sight of prudence in his compassion these poor people immediately ordered battalion of ﬁve hundred men under the command of major ward to go and meet the fugitives and escort them in the major and several ofﬁcers of the garrison doubted to the propriety of this measure but fanning full of sympathy his unprotected insisted and the battalion moved out they soon came in sight of the fugitives they thought but on drawing nearer the latter turned out to be mexican dragoons who sprang upon their horses which were concealed in the neighbouring islands of trees and desperate ﬁght began the mexicans far superior in numbers received every moment accessions to their strength the and santa fé cavalry fellows who seem born on horseback were there our unfortunate countrymen were hemmed in on all sides the ﬁght lasted two days and only two men out of the ﬁve hundred escaped with their lives before the news of this misfortune reached us orders had been sent to fanning to evacuate the fort and join us with six pieces of artillery he received the order and proceeded to execute it but what might have been very practicable eight hundred and sixty men was impossible three hundred and sixty nevertheless fanning began his march through the prairie his little band was almost immediately surrounded by the enemy after gallant defence which lasted twelve hours they succeeded in reaching an island but scarcely had they establishe d themselves there when they found that their ammunition was expended there was nothing left them but to accept the terms offered by the mexicans who pledged themselves that if they laid down their arms they should be permitted to return to their homes but the riﬂes were sooner piled than the texians found themselves charged by their treacherous foes who butchered them without mercy only an advanced post of three men succeeded in escaping the ﬁve hundred men whom we had left in san antonio bexar fared better not being sufﬁciently numerous to hold out the town well the alamo they retreated into the latter the mexican artillery soon laid part of the fort in ruins still its defenders held out after eight days ﬁghting during which the loss of the besiegers was tremendously severe the alamo was taken and not single texian left alive pg 29 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https thus by these two cruel blows lost of our army and little more than seven hundred men remained to resist the numerous legions of our victorious foe the prospect before us was one well calculated to daunt the stoutest heart the mexican general santa anna moved his army forward in two divisions one stretching along the coast towards velasco the other advancing towards san felipe austin he himself with small force marched in the centre at fort bend twenty miles below san felipe he crossed the brazos and shortly afterwards established himself with about ﬁfteen hundred men in an entrenched camp our army under the command of general houston was in front of harrisbur g to which place the congress had retreated it was on the night of the twentieth of april and our whole disposable force some seven hundred men was bivouacking in and about an island of sycamores it was cloudy stormy evening high wind was blowing and the branches of the trees groaned and creaked above our heads the weather harmonized well enough with our feelings which were sad and desponding when we thought of the desperate state of our cause we the ofﬁcers were sitting in circle round the general and alcalde both of whom appeared uneasy and anxious more than once they got up and walked backwards and forwards seemingly impatient and if they were waiting or expecting something there was deep silence throughout the whole bivouac some were sleeping and those who watched were in humour idle chat who goes there suddenly shouted one of the sentries the answer we did not hear but it was apparently satisfactory there was further challenge and few seconds afterwards an orderly came up and whispered something in the ear of the alcalde the latter hurried away and presently returning spoke few words in low tone to the general and then to us ofﬁcers in an instant we were all upon our feet in less than ten minutes the bivouac was broken up and our little army on the march all our people were well mounted and armed with riﬂes pistols and we had six but we only took four harnessed wit twice the usual number of horses we marched at rapid trot the whole night led by tall gaunt ﬁgure of man who acted our guide and kept some distance in front i more than once asked the alcalde who this was y will know by and by was his answer before daybreak we had ridden ﬁve and twenty miles but had been compelled to abandon two more guns yet one knew the object of this forced march the general commanded halt and ordered the men to refresh and strengthen themselves by food and drink while they were doing this he assembled the ofﬁcers around him and the meaning of our night march was explained to us the camp in which the mexican president and had entrenched himself was within mile of us general parza with two thousand men was twenty miles further to the rear general filasola with one thousand eighteen miles lower down on the brazos viesca with ﬁfteen hundred miles higher up one bold and decided blow and texas might yet be free there was not moment to lose nor was one lost the general addressed the men friends brothers citizens general santa anna is within mile of us with ﬁfteen hundred men the hour that is to decid the question of texian liberty is now arrived what say you we attack we exclaimed the men with one voice cheerfully and decidedly in the most perfect stillness we arrived within two hundred paces of the enemy camp the reveillée of the sleeping mexicans was the dischar ge of our two loaded with canister rushing on to within paces of the entrenchment we gave them deadly volley from our riﬂes and then throwing away the latter bounded up the works pistol in each hand the mexicans scared and stupeﬁed by this sudd en attack were running about in the wildest confusion seeking their arms and not knowing which way to turn after ﬁring our pistols we threw them away we had done our riﬂes and pg 30 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https our fell with shout upon the masses of the terriﬁed foe it was more like the boarding of ship than any land ﬁght i had ever seen or imagined my station was on the right of the line where the breastwork ending in redoubt was steep and high i made two attempts to climb up but both times slipped back on the third trial i nearly gained the summit but was again slipping down when hand seized by the collar and pulled up on the bank in the darkness and confusion i did not distinguish the face of the man who rendered this assistance i only saw the glitter of bayonet which mexican thrust into his shoulder at the very moment he was helping up he neither ﬂinched nor let go his hold of till i was fairly on my feet then turning slowly round he levelled pistol at the soldier who at that very moment was struck down by the alcalde thanks to ye squire exclaimed the man in voice which made start even at that moment of excitement and bustle i looked at the speaker but could only see his back he had already plunged into the thick of the ﬁght and was engaged with party of mexicans who defended themselves desperately he fought like man more anxious to be killed than to kill striking furio usly right and left but never guarding blow though the alcalde who was by his side warded of f several which were aimed at him by this time my men had scrambled up after i looked round to see where our help was most wanted and was about to lead them forward when i heard the voice of the alcalde are you badly hurt bob said he in an anxious tone i glanced at the spot whence the voice came there lay bob rock covered with blood and apparently insensible the alcalde was supporting his head on his arm before i had time to give second look i was hurried forward with the rest towards the centre of the camp where the ﬁght was at the hottest about ﬁve hundred men the pick of the mexican army had collected round knot of and were making most gallant defence general houston had attacked them with three hundred of our people but had not been able to break their ranks his charge however had shaken them little and before they had time to recover from it i came up giving wild hurrah my men ﬁred their pistols hurled them at their enemies heads and then springing over the carcasses of the fallen dashed like thunde rbolt into the broken ranks of the mexicans frightful butchery ensued our men who were the most part and at most times peaceable and humane in disposition seemed converted into perfect ﬁends whole ranks of the enemy fell under their knives some idea may be formed of the horrible slaughter from the fact that the ﬁght from beginning to end did not last above ten minut es and in that time nearly eight hundred mexicans were shot or cut down quarter was the cry of the infuriated assailants rem ember alamo remember goliad think of fanning ward the mexicans threw themselves on their knees implorin g mercy misericor dia cuartel el amor dios shrieked they in tones but their supplications were not listened to and every man of them would inevitably have been butchered had not general houston and the ofﬁcers dashed in between the victors and the vanquished and with the greatest difﬁculty and by threats of cutting down our own men if they did not desist put an end to this scene of bloodshed and saved the texian character from the stain of unmanly cruelty when all was over i hurried back to the place where i had left the alcalde with latter lay bleeding from six wounds only few paces from the spot where he had helped up the breastwork the bodies of two dead mexicans served him pillow the alcalde was kneeling by his side gazing sadly and earnestly into the face of the dying man pg 31 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https bob was dying but it was longer the death of the despairing murderer the expression of his features was calm and composed and his eyes were raised to heaven with look of hope and supplication i stooped down and asked him how he felt himself but he made answer and evidently did not recollect after minute or two how goes it with the ﬁght he asked in broken voice we have conquered bob the enemy killed or taken not man escaped he paused little and then spoke again have i done my duty may i hope to be given the alcalde answered him in an agitated voice he who forgave the sinner on the cross will doubtless be merciful to you bob his holy book says there is more joy over one sinner that repenteth than over ninety and nine just men be of good hope bob the almighty will surely be merciful to you thank ye squire gasped bob you true friend friend in life and in death well it come at last said he while resigned and happy smile stole over his features i prayed it long enough thank god it come at last he gazed up at the alcalde with kindly expression of countenance there was slight shuddering movement of his whole was dead the alcalde remained kneeling short time by the side of the corpse his lips moving in prayer at last he rose to his feet god desireth not the death of sinner but rather that he may turn from his wickedness and live said he in low and solemn tone i had those words in my thoughts four years ago when i cut him down from the branch of the patriarch four years ago cried i then you cut him down and were in time to save him was it he who yesterday brought us the news of the vicinity of the foe it was and much more than that has he done replied the alcalde longer striving to conceal the tears that fell from his eyes four years has he dragged on his wretched existence weary of the world and despised of all men four years has he served us lived fought and spied us without honour reward hope or single hour of tranquillity or wish aught except death all this to serve texas and his countrymen who shall say this man was not true patriot god will surely be merciful to his soul said the alcalde after pause i trust he will answered i deeply af fected we were interrupted at this moment by message from general houston to whom we immediately hastened all was uproar and confusion santa anna could not be found amongst the prisoners this was terrible disappointment the capture of the mexican president had been our principal object and the victory we had gained was comparatively unimportant if he escaped indeed the hope of putting an end to the war by his capture had more than any thing encouraged and stimulated us to the unequal conﬂict the moment was very critical one amongst our men were some thirty or forty most desperate characters who began handling their knives and casting looks upon the prisoners the meaning of which it was impossible to mistake selecting some of our pg 32 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https men we stationed them guard over the captives and having thus assured the safety of the latter began questioning them to what had become of their general they had none of them seen santa anna since the commencement of the ﬁght and it was clear that he must have made his escape while we were getting over the breastworks he could not be very far off and we at once took measures to ﬁnd him hundred men were sent off with the prisoners to harrisbur g and hundred others capitally mounted on horses found in the mexican camp started to scour the country in search of the fugitive chief i accompanied the latter detachment we had been twelve hours in the saddle and had ridden over nearly hundred miles of ground we began to despair of ﬁnding the game we were in quest of and were thinking of abandoning the chase when at distance of about seven miles from the camp one of our most experienced hunters discovered the print of small and delicate boot upon some soft ground leading to marsh following this trail it at last led us to man sunk up to his waist in the swamp and so covered with mud and ﬁlth to be quite unrecognizable we drew him from his half dead with cold and terror and having washed the dirt from his face we found him to be man of about forty years of age with blue eyes of mild but crafty expression narrow high forehead long thin nose rather ﬂeshy at the tip projecting upper lip and long chin these features tallied too exactly with the description we had had of the mexican president us to doubt that our prisoner was santa anna himself the only thing that at all tended to shake this conviction was the extraordinary poltroonery of our new captive he threw himself on his knees begging us in the name of god and all the saints to spare his life our reiterated assurances and promises were insufﬁcient to convince him of his being in perfect safety or to induce him to adopt demeanour more consistent with his dignity and high station the events which succeeded this fortun ate capture are too well known to require more than very brief recapitulation the same evening truce was agreed upon between houston and santa anna the latter sending orders to his different generals to retire upon san antonio bexar and other places in the direction of the mexican frontier these orders valueless emanating from prisoner most of the generals were weak or cowardly enough to obey an obedience which they were afterwards brought to trial by the mexican congress in few days of texas were in our possession the news of these successes brought crowds of volunteers to our standard in three weeks we had an army of several thousand men with which we advanced against the mexicans there was more ﬁghting however our antagonists had had enough and allowed themselves to be driven from one position to another till in month time there was not one of them left in the country the struggle was over and texas was free clit ophon and leucippe when enumerating in our number july last year the principal greek romances which succeeded the ethiopics of heliodorus we placed next to the celebrated production of the bishop of trica in point of merit it is generally held to have been also in order of time the adventures of clitophon and leucippe by achilles tatius though far inferior both in the delineation of the characters and the contrivance of the story to the ethiopics from which indeed many of the incidents are obviously borrowed and not altogether free from passages offensive to delicacy clitophon and leucippe is well entitled to separate notice not only from the grace of its style and diction and the curious matter with which the narrative is interspersed but from its presenting one of the few pictures which have come down to these times of the social pg 33 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https domestic life of the greeks in the ethiopics which may be considered an heroic romance the scene lies throughout in palaces camps and temples kings and satraps ﬁgure in every page the hero himself is prince of his own people and the heroine who at ﬁrst appears of lower rank than of delphi proves in the sequel the heiress of mighty kingdom in the work of achilles tatius on the contrary the plot of which is laid at later period of time than that of its predecessor the characters are taken without exception from the class of grecian citizens who are represented in the ordinary routine of polished social existence amidst their gardens of villas and occupied by their banquets and processions and the business of their courts of law there are unexpected revelations talismanic rings mysterious secret affecting the fortunes of any of the personages who are all presented to us at the commencement in their proper names and characters the interest of the story in the ethiopics turns chieﬂy on an elopement and the consequent misadventures of the hero and heroine among various sets of robbers and treacherous friends but the lovers after being thus duly punished their undutiful escapade are restored at the ﬁnale to their original position and settle quietly in their native home under their own vines and trees of the author himself little appears to be certainly known fabricius and other writers have placed him in the third or fourth century of our but this date will by means agree with his constant imitations of heliodorus who is known to have lived at the end of the fourth and beginning of the ﬁfth century and tatius if not his contemporary probably lived not long after him suidas who calls him statius informs us that he was native of alexandria and attributes to his pen several other works on various subjects besides the romance now in question fragment only of treatise on the sphere been preserved he adds that he was pagan when he wrote clitophon and leucippe but late in life embraced christianity and even became bishop this latter statement however is unsupported by any other authority and would seem to be opposed by the negative testimony of the patriarch photius who in his famous bibliotheca 118 130 passes severe censure on the immorality of certain passages in the works of tatius and would scarcely have omitted to inveigh against the further scandal of their having proceeded from the pen of an ecclesiastic in style and composition this work is of high excellence the periods are generally well rounded and perspicuous and gratify the ear by their harmony but except in the names of the personages and the unpardonable breaches of decorum of which he is guilty the author appears to have closely copied heliodorus both in the plan and execution of his narrative in another passage when treating of the babylonica1 of iamblichus he repeats this condemnation of these three principal writers of amorous tales heliodorus has treated the subject with due gravity and decorum iamblichus is not so unexceptionable on these points and achilles tatius is still worse in his eight books of clitophon and leucippe the very diction of which is soft and effeminate if intended to relax the vigour of the reader mind this last denunciation of the patriarch however is somewhat too sweeping and indiscriminate since though some passages are certainly indefensible they appear rather interpolations and are in manner connected with the main thread of the story the general tendency of which is throughout innocent and moral and whatever may be said of these blemishes it must be allowed that the pages of achilles tatius are purity itself when compared with the depravity of longus and some of his followers and imitators among the greek romancists 1 this work is now lost and we know it only by the abstract given by photius in the passage quoted the period of time at which the advent ures of clitophon and leucippe are supposed to take place appears to be in the later ages of grecian independence when the successors of alexander reigned in syria and egypt and the colonized cities in thrace and asia minor still preserved their municipal liberties the story is related in the ﬁrst person by the hero himself mode of narration which though the best adapted affording scope to the expression of the feelings of the principal personages is in this insta nce very awkwardly introduced stranger while contemplating famous picture of the rape of pg 34 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https in the temple of astarte at sidon is accosted by young man who after few incidental remarks proceeds without further preface to recount his adventures at length to this casual acquaintance this comm unicative gentleman is of course clito phon but before we proceed to the narrative of his loves and woes we shall give specimen of the author powers in the line which appears to be his forte by quoting his description of the painting above referred to on entering the temple my attention was attracted by picture representing the story of europa in which sea and land were phoenician sea and the coasts of sidon on the land was seen band of maidens in meadow while in the sea bull was swimming who bore on his shoulders beautiful virgin and was making his way in the direction of crete the meadow was decked with profusion of bright ﬂowers to which grateful shelter was afforded by the dense overhanging foliage of the shrubs and clumps of trees which were interspersed at intervals throughout its extent while so skilfully had the artist represented the appearance of light and shade that the rays of the sun were seen to pass here and there through the interstices of the leaves and cast softe ned radiance on the ground underneath spring was seen bubbling up in the midst and refreshing the ﬂowers and plants with its cool waters while labourer with spade was at work opening fresh channel the stream at the extremity of the meadow where it bordered on the sea the maidens stood grouped together in attitudes expressive of mingled joy and terror their brows were bound with chaplets and their hair ﬂoated in loose locks over their shoulders but their features were pale and their cheeks contracted and they gazed with lips apart and opened eyes on the sea if on the point of uttering cry by fear they were standing on tiptoe on the very verge of the shore with their tunics girt up to the knee and extending their arms towards the bull if medita ting to rush into the sea in pursuit of him and yet shrinking from the contact of the waves the sea was represented of reddish tint inshore but further out the colour changed to deep azure while in another part the waves were seen running in with swell upon the rocks and breaking against them into clouds of foam and white spray in the midst of the sea the bull was depicted breasting the lofty billows which surged against his sides with the damsel seated on his back not astride but with both her feet disposed on his right side while with her left hand she grasped his horn by which she guided his motions charioteer guides horse by the rein she was arrayed in white tunic which did not extend much below her waist and an under garment of purple reaching to her feet but the outline of her form and the swell of her bosom were distinctly deﬁned through her garments her right hand rested on the back of the bull with the left she retained her hold of his horn while with both she grasped her veil which was blown out by the wind and expanded in an arch over her head and shoulders so that the bull might be compared to ship of which the damsel veil was the sail around them dolphins were sporting in the water and winged loves ﬂuttering in the air so admirably depicted that the spectator might fancy he saw them in motion one cupid guided the bull while others hovered round bearing bows and quivers and brandishing nuptial torches regarding jupiter with arch and sidelong glances if conscious that it was by their inﬂuence that the god had assumed the form of an animal to return to clitophon and his tale he begins by informing his hearer that he is the son of hippias noble and wealthy denizen of tyre and that he had been betrothed from his childhood was not unusual in those to his own calligone leucippe the daughter of sostratus brother of hippias resident at byzantium having arrived with her mother panthia to claim the hospitality of their tyrian relatives during war impending between their native city and the thracian tribes clitophon at once becomes enamoured of his cousin whose charms are described in terms of glowing panegyric she seemed to like the representation of europa which i see in the picture before eye beaming with joy and locks and ﬂowing in natural ringlets but her eyebrows and eyelashes jetty complexion fair but with blush in her cheeks like that faint crimson with which the lydian women stain ivory and her lips like the hue of rose love is not however in this case in that of theagenes and chariclea instantaneous on both sides and the expedient adopted by clitophon with the aid of his servant satyrus valet of the scapin pg 35 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https to win the good graces of the lady are detailed at length evinci ng much knowledge of the human heart in the author and affording considerable insight into the domestic arrangements of grecian family an understanding is at last effected between them and clitophon is in sad perplexity how to defer or evade his approaching nuptials with his sister when calligone is most opportunely carried off by band of pirates employed by callisthenes young byzantine who having fallen in love with leucippe from the mere report of her beauty and having been refused her hand by her father has followed her to tyre and seeing calligone in public procession chaperoned by panthia has mistaken her leucippe the lovers are thus left in the unrestrained enjoyment of each other society but clitophon is erelong detected by panthia in an attempt to penetrate by night into her daughter chamber and though the darkness prevents the person of the intruder from being recognised the confusion which this untoward occurrence occasions in the family is such that clitophon and leucippe feeling their secret longer safe determine on an elopement accompanied by the faithful satyrus and by clinias kinsman and conﬁdent of clitophon who generously volunteers to share their adventures they accordingly set sail egypt and the two gentlemen having struck up an acquaintance with fellow passenger young alexandrian named menelaus beguile the voyage by discussing with their new friend the subject of love the remarks on which at last take so antiplatonic tone that we can only hope leucippe was out of hearing these disquisitions are interrupted on the third day of the voyage by violent tempest and the sailors ﬁnding the ship on the point of coming to pieces betake themselves to the boat leaving the passengers to their fate but clitophon and leucippe clinging to the forecastle are comfortably wafted by the winds and waves to the coast of egypt and landed near pelusium where they hire vessel to carry them to alexandria but their voyage through the tortuous branches of the nile is intercepted by marauders of the same class bucoli or buccaniers those who ﬁgure so conspicuously in the adventures of chariclea and theagenes the robbers are at this juncture in expectation of an attack from the royal troops and having been ordered by their priests to propitiate the gods by the sacriﬁce of virgin are greatly at loss victim when chance throws leucippe in their way she is forthwith torn from her lover and sent off to the headquarters of the banditti and clitophon is on his way to another of their retreats when his captors are attacked and cut to pieces by detachment of troops whose commander charmides commiserates the misfortunes of our hero and hospitably entertains him in his tent 2 the laws of athens permitted the marriage of brother with his sister by the father side cimon married his half sister elpinice and several marriages of the same nature occur in the history of the egyptian ptolemies 3 fair hair probably from its rarity in southern climates seems to have been at all times much prized by the ancients witness the greek xanthos menelaos of homer and the cui ﬂavam religas comam of horace the style of leucippe beauty seems to have resembled that of her hair i said was auburn but her eyes were black night their lashes the same hue 4 one incident where clitophon pretends to have been stung on the lip by bee and to be cured by kiss from leucippe has been borrowed by tasso in the aminta act scene 2 che ﬁngendo ape avesse morso il mio labbro di sotto whence the idea has been again copie d by host of later poetasters this is not tasso only obligation to the greek romances we have already seen that he was indebted to heliodorus the hint of his story of clorinda general attack on the buccanier force is projected the next day but the advance of the troops is found to be barred by trench so wide and deep to be impassable and while preparations are made ﬁlling it up leucippe is brought to the opposite brink by two ofﬁciating priests sheathed in armor and there to the horror of clitophon apparently ripped up alive before the altar after completing the sacriﬁce and depositing the body in sarcophagus the robbers disperse the passage of the trench is at length effected and clitophon is preparing to fall on his sword at the tomb of his murdered love when his hand is stayed by the appearance of his faithful friends menelaus and satyrus whom he had supposed lost in the ship the mystery is now explained they had reached pg 36 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https shore like clitophon on pieces of the wreck and having also fallen into the power of the robbers appears to have been the inevitable fate of every one landing in egypt at the time of this narrative were surprised by ﬁnding leucippe among their fellow captives and learning from her the dreadful fate which awaited her menelaus however having recognized some former acquaintances among the buccaniers was relea sed from his bonds and having gained their conﬁdence by proposing to enrol himself in their band offered his services sacriﬁcer which were accepted he now contrived to equip leucippe with an artfully constructed false stomach and being further assisted in his humane stratagem by the discovery of knife with sliding blade among some theatrical properties which the robbers had acquired in the course of casual plunder succeeded in appearing to perform the sacriﬁce without any real injury to the victim who at his call rises from the sarcophagus and throws herself into her lover arms it might be supposed that after so portentously marvellous an escape the one just related the unlucky couple might be allowed short respite at least from the persecutions of adverse fortune but perils in love succeed without an interval to perils in war it is the invariable rule of all greek romances we have remarked in previous number that the attractions both of the hero and heroine should be perfectly irresistible by those of the other sex and accordingly the egyptian ofﬁcer charmides sooner beholds leucippe than he falls in love with her and endeavours to gain over menelaus to further his views menelaus feigns compliance but privately gives information of the designs of charmides to clitophon who is thrown into dreadful state of consternation by his apprehensions of this powerful rival at this juncture however leucippe is suddenly seized with ﬁt of extravagant frenzy which deﬁes all the skill of the egyptian camp and under the inﬂuence of which she violently assaults her friends and is guilty of sundry vagaries not altogether seemly in young lady both her admirers charmides and clitophon are in despair and equally in ignorance of the cause of her malady but before any symptoms of amendment are perceptible charmides receives orders5 to march with his whole force against the buccaniers by whom he is inveigled into an ambuscade and with most of his men either slain or drowned by the breaking of the dykes of the nile the madness of leucippe is still incurable till stranger named choereas makes his appearance and introducing himself to clitophon informs him that he has discovered from the confession of domestic that gorgias an ofﬁcer who fell in the late action with the bucoli captivated like every one else by the resistless charms of the heroine had administered to her philtre the undue strength of which had excited frenzy instead of love by the administration of proper remedies the fair patient is now restored to her senses and the total destruction of the robber by stronger force sent against them having rendered the navigation of the nile again secure the lovers once more embark alexandria accompanied by menelaus and choereas and at length arrive in safety at the city which they ﬁnd illuminated the great feast of serapis the ﬁrst sight of the glories of alexandria at the supposed period of the narrative the largest and most magniﬁcent city in the world and many ages subsequently second only to imperial rome herself excites the astonishment and admiration of the newcomers the author takes the opportunity to dilate with pardonable complacency on the magnitude and grandeur of the place of his birth when i entered the city says clitophon by the gates called those of the sun its wonderful beauty ﬂashed at once upon my sight almost dazzling my eyes with the excess of gratiﬁcation lofty colonnade of pillars on each side of the runs right from the gates of the sun on one side to those of the moon these are its guardian deities on the other and the distance is such that walk through the city is in itself journey when we had proceeded several stadia we arrived at the square named after alexander whence other colonnades like those i saw extending in right line before branched off right and left at right angles and my eyes never weary of wandering from one street to another were unable to contemplate separately the various objects of attraction which presented themselves some i had before my eyes some i was hastening to gaze upon when i found myself unable to pass by others while fresh series of marvels still awaited so that my powers of vision were at last fairly exhausted and obliged to confess themselves pg 37 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https the vast extent of the city and the innumerable multitude of the population produced on the mind the effect of double paradox regarding the one the stranger wondered where such city which seemed large continent could ﬁnd inhabitants but when his attention was drawn to the other he was again perplexed how so many people more numerous than nation could ﬁnd room in any single city thus the two conﬂicting feelings of amazement remained in equilibrio 5 these orders are said to have come from the satrap the persian title having been retained under the ptolemies the governors of the nomes or provinces the description of the stronghold of the buccaniers in the deep recesses of marsh and approachable only by single hidden path like the stockades of the american indians in the swamps described by cotton math er if not copied like most of the other egyptian scenes from the ethiopics presents curious picture of class of men of whom few details are in authentic history 6 the main street according to diodorus was forty stadia in length and plethrum 100 feet in breadth adorned through its whole extent by succession of palaces and temples of the most costly magniﬁcence alexander also erected royal palace which was an ediﬁce wonderful both its magnitude and the solidity of its architecture and all the kings who have succeeded him even up to our times have spent great sums in further adorning and making additions to it on the whole the city may be fairly reckoned the ﬁrst in the world whether magnitude and beauty trafﬁc or the greatness of its revenues it comprehended says gibbon speaking of it under the roman emperors circumfer ence of ﬁfteen miles and was peopled by free inhabitants besides at least an equal number of slaves choereas himself native of the city who had been called upon to take service in the late expedition against the buccaniers does the honours of the locale to his new friends he is not proof against the fatal charms of leucippe and resorts to the old expedient of procuring her abduction by crew of pirates while on an excursion to the pharos the vessel of the captors is however chased by and on the point of being taken when leucippe is brought on deck and decapitated by the pirates who throw the headless body into the sea and make their escape while clitophon stays the pursuit to recover the remains of his mistress sepulture clitophon now returns to alexandria to mourn his lost love and is still inconsolable at the end of six months when he is surprised by the appearance of clinias whom he had supposed to have perished when the vessel foundered at sea clinias relates that having like the others ﬂoated on piece of the wreck he had been picked up by ship which brought him back to sidon and his absence from home had been so short not to have been generally noticed he had thought it best not to mention it espec ially he had good account to give of his in the mean time calligone is given up lost sostratus who has heard of his daughter attachment to clitophon but not of the elopement writes from byzantium to give his consent to their union and diligent enquiries are made in every direction the runaway couple till information is at length obtained that clitophon has been seen in egypt his father hippias is therefore preparing to set sail alexandria to bring back the truant when clinias thinking it would be well to forewarn clitophon of what had occurred in his absence starts without delay unknown to hippias and reaches alexandria before him the intelligence thus received throws clitophon into fresh agonies of grief and remorse he curses his own impatience in carrying off leucippe when short delay would have crowned his happiness accuses himself anew the cause of her death and declares his determination not to remain in egypt and encounter his father his friends menelaus and clinias in vain endeavour to combat this resolve till the satyrus ﬁnds an expedient evading the difﬁculty young ephesian widow named melissa fair and susceptible who has lately lost her husband at sea and become the heiress of his immense wealth has recently in obed ience to the invariable law of greek romance ﬁxed an eye of ardent affection on clitophon and it is suggest ed by his friends that by marrying this new inamorata and sailing with her forthwith on her return to ephesus his departure would at once be satisfactorily explained to his father on his arrival and he might return to his friends at tyre after their emotions at the tragical catastrophe of leucippe had in some measure subsided after much persuasion clitophon accedes to this arrangement with the sole proviso that nothing but the ﬁançailles or betrothal shall take place in egypt and that the completion of the marriage shall be deferred till their arrival in the plea that he can not pledge his faith pg 38 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https another in the land where his beloved leucippe met with her fate this propo sal after vehement opposition on the part of the amorous ephesian is at last agreed to and clitophon with his bride sets sail ephesus accompanied by clinias while menelaus who remains in egyp t undertakes the task of explaining matters to hippias the voyage is prosperously accomplished and melissa becomes urgent the formal solemnization of the nuptials while clitophon continues to oppose frivolous delays which might have roused the anger of lady even of less ardent temperament her affection however continues undiminished but clitophon while visiting in her company her country residence in the neighbourhood of the city is thunderstruck by fancying that he recognizes in the disﬁgured lineaments of female slave said to be thessalian of the name of lacoena who approaches melissa to complain of the treatment she has received from the steward sosthenes the features of his lost leucippe his suspicions are conﬁrmed by billet which leucippe conveys to him through satyrus and his situation becomes doubly perplexing melissa more than ever at loss to comprehend the cause of his indifference applies to leucippe whom she supposes to possess the skill of the thessalians in magic to compel his affections promising her liberty reward leucippe is delighted by the proof which this request affords of the constancy of her lover but the preparations his marriage with melissa still proceed and evasion appears impossible when at the preliminary banquet the return of her husband thersander is announced who had been falsely reported to have perished by shipwreck terrible scene of confusion ensues in which thersander proceeding at very high rate shows the imperial penchant of pirate clitophon gets violent beating to which he submits with the utmost tameness and is thrown into fetters by the enraged husband and though melissa on certain conditions furnishes him with the means of escape from the house in the disguise of female he again unluckily encounters thersander and is lodged in the prison of ephesus leucippe meanwhile of whose unrivalled charms thersander has been informed by sosthenes is still detained in bondage and suffers cruel persecution from her brutal master who at last having learned from an overheard soliloquy her true parentage and history well her attachment clitophon of her relations with whom he was not previously aware forms scheme of ridding himself of this twofold rival by sending one of his emissaries into the prison who gives out that he has been arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the murder of leucippe who has been dispatched by assassins employed by the jealous melissa clitophon at once gives full credence to this awkwardly devised tale and determines not to survive his mistress in spite of the remonstrances of clinias who argues with much reason that one who had so often been miraculously preserved from death might have escaped also on the present occasion but clitophon refuses to be comforted and when brought before the assembly in the forum to stand his trial on the charge apparently it is not very clearly speciﬁed of having married another man wife he openly declares himself guilty of leucippe murder which he afﬁrm s to have been concerted between melissa and himself in order to remove the obstacle to their amours and now revealed by him from remorse he is of course condemned to death forthwith and thersander is triumphing in the unexpected success of his schemes when the judicial proceedings are interrupted by the appearance of religious procession at the head of which clitophon is astonished by recognizing his uncle sostratus the father of leucippe who had been deputed by the byzantines to offer sacriﬁces of thanksgiving at the temple of diana their victory over the thracians on hearing the state of affairs he furiously denounces the murderer of his daughter but at this moment it is announced that leucippe whom thersander had believed to be in safe custody has escaped and taken refuge in the temple of diana the interest of the story is now at an end but much yet remains before the conclusion thersander maddened at the prospect of being thus doubly baulked of his prey throws gross aspersions on the purity of leucippe and even demands that clitophon in spite of his now manifest innocence shall be executed in pursuance of the previous sentence but pg 39 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https of diana takes the lovers under his protection and the cause is adjourned to the morrow leucippe now relates the circumstances of her captivity alexandrian pirates having deceived their pursuers by beheading another captiv dressed in her garments had next fallen out with and murdered their base employer choereas and ﬁnally sold her two thousand drachmas to sosthenes while from sostratus on the other hand clitophon receives tidings that his sister calligone is on the point of marriage to callisthenes who it will be remembered had carried her off from tyre by mistake leucippe having become enamoured of the latter without ever having seen her and on the discovery of his error had made her all the amends in his power by an instant transfer of his affections thus everything is on the point of ending happily but the sentence passed against clitophon still remains unreversed and thersander in the assembly of the following day vehemently calls its ratiﬁcation but the cause of the defendant is espoused by the t who lavishes on the character and motives of thersander torrent of abuse couched in language little ﬁtting his sacred character while thersander shows himself in this respect fully match his reverend antagonist and moreover reiterates with fresh violence his previous charge against leucippe the debates are protracted to an insuf ferably tedious length but the character of leucippe is at last vindicated by her descent into cavern whence sounds of more than human melody are heard on the entrance of damsel of untainted fame the result of this ordeal is of course triumphant and thersander overwhelmed with confusion makes his escape from the popular indignation and is condemned to exile by acclamation suborner of false evidence while the lovers freed at length from all their troubles sail byzantium in company with sostratus and after there solemnizing their own nuptials return to tyre to assist at those of callisthenes and calligone the leading defects observable in this romance are obviously the glaring improb ability of many of the incidents and the want of connexion and necessary dependence between the several parts of the story of the device of the false stomach and theatrical dagger by means of which menelaus and satyrus after gaining moreover in moment the full conﬁdence of the buccaniers save the life of leucippe when doomed to sacriﬁce is the most ﬂagrant instance though her second escape from suppos ed death when clitophon imagines that he sees her head struck off by the alexandrian pirates is almost equally liable to the same objection while in either case the deliverance of the heroine might well have been managed without prejudice either to the advancement or interest of the narrative by more rational and probable methods the too frequent introduction of incidents and personages not in any way connected with or conducive to the progress of the main plot is also objectionable and might almost induce the belief that the original plan was in some measure altered or departed from in the course of composition it is difﬁcult to conceive what purpose the character of calligone the sister and ﬁancée of clitophon is introduced among the dramatic personae she appears at the beginning only to be carried off by callisthenes soon clitophon passion leucippe makes her presence inconvenient and we incidentally hear of her on the point of becoming his bride at the conclusion but she is seen only moment and never permitted to speak like walking gentlewoman on the stage and exercises not the smallest inﬂuence on the fortunes of the others gorgias is still worse used he is mere nominis umbra of whose bodily presence nothing is made visible nor is so much his name mentioned except the purpose of informing us that it was through his agency that the was administered to leucippe and that he has since been killed in the action against the buccaniers the whole incident of the philtre indeed and the consequent madness of the heroine is unnatural and revolting and serves end but to introduce choereas to effect cure but even had it been indispensable to the plot it might have been far more probably ascribed to the egyptian commander charmides with whose passion leucippe we were already acquainted and who had moreover learned from menelaus that he had little chance of success by ordinary methods from the engagement of the lady to clitophon nor are these defects compensated by any high degree of merit in the delineati on of the characters with the exception of leuci ppe herself they are all almost wholly devoid of pg 40 pg 41 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https or distinguishing traits and insipid and uninteresting to the last degree menelaus and clinias the conﬁdants and trusted friends of the hero are the dullest of all dull qualiﬁcation which perhaps ﬁts them in some measure the part they are to bear in the story affording some security against their falling in love with leucippe fate which they of all the masculine personages alone escape their active intervention is conﬁned to the preservation of leucippe from the bucoli by menelaus and great deal of useless declamation in behalf of clitophon before the assembly of ephesus from clinias satyrus also from whose knavish ingenuity in the early part of the tale something better was to be expected soon subsides into domestic and hands his master the letter in which poor leucippe makes herself known to him at ephesus when she imagines him married to melissa with all the nonchalance of modern footman clitophon himself is hardly shade superior to his companions he is throughout mere passive instrument leaving to chance or the exertions of others his extrication from the various troubles in which he becomes involved even of the qualities usually regarded inseparable from hero of romance spirit and personal courage he is so utterly destitute to suffer himself to be beaten and ill treated both by thersander and sostratus without an attempt to defend himself and his lamentations whenever he ﬁnds himself in difﬁculties or separated from his are absolutely puerile to the other characters thersander is mere vulgar rude and boisterou s captain of the sea brutal violence on his ﬁrst appearance and subsequent unprincipled machinations deprive him of the sympa thy which might otherwise have been excited in behalf of one who ﬁnds his wife and his property unceremoniously taken possession of during his absence while on the other hand the language used by the of diana in his invectives against thersander and his accomplices gives but low idea of the dignity or reﬁnement of the ephesian hierarchy but the female charact ers is almost always the case in the greek romances are far better drawn and inﬁni tely more interesting than the men even melissa though apparently intended only foil to the perfections of leucippe wins upon us by her amorous weakness and the invincible kindness of heart which impels her even when acquainted with the real state of affairs to protect the lovers against her husband malpractices leucippe herself goes far to make amends the general insipidity of the other characters though not heroine of so lofty stamp chariclea in whom the spirit of her royal birth is all along apparent she is endowed with mingled gentleness and ﬁrmness which is strongly contrasted with the weakness and pusillanimity of her lover uncomplaining tenderness when she ﬁnds clitophon at ephesus she imagines the husband of another and the calm dignity with which she vindicates herself from the injurious aspersions of thersander are represented with great truth and feeling and attach degree of interest to her which the other personages of the narrative are very far from inspiring in the early part of the story during the scenes in tyre and egypt the action is carried on with considerable spirit and briskness the author having apparently thus far kept before him model the narrative of heliodorus but towards the conclusion and indeed from the time of the arrival of clitophon and melissa at ephesus the interest ﬂags wofully the dénouement is inevitably foreseen from the moment clitophon is made aware that leucippe is still alive and in his neighbourhood and the arrival of thersander almost immediately afterwards disposes of the obstacle of his engagement to melissa but the reader is acquainted with all these circumstances before the end of the ﬁfth book the three remaining books being entire ly occupied by the proceedings in the judicial assembly the recriminations of the and the absurd ordeal to which leucippe is apparently introduced other purpose than to show the author skill in declamation the display of his own acquirements in various branches of art and science and of his rhetorical powers of language in describing them is indeed an object of which achilles tatius never loses sight and continual digressions from the thread of the story this purpose occur often extremely opos and sometimes entirely without reference to the preceding narra thus when clitophon is relating the terms of an oracle addressed to the byzantines previous to their war with the thracians he breaks off at once into dissertation on the wonderful qualities of the element of water the inﬂammable springs of sicily the gold extracted from the lakes of africa pg 42 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https is supposed to be introduced into conversation on the oracle between sostratus and his colleague in command and could only have come to the knowledge of clitophon by being repeated to him verbatim after considerable interval of time by sostratus again in the midst of the hero perple xities at his threatened marriage with calligone we are favoured with minute enumeration of the gems set in an ornament which his father purchased part of the trousseau and this again leads to an account of the discovery and application of the purple dye the description of objects of natural history is at all times favourite topic and the sojourn of the lovers in egypt affords the author an opportunity of indulging in details relative to the habits and appearances of the various strange animals found in that countr crocodile the hippopotamus and the elephant are described with considerable spirit and ﬁdelity and even the form and colours of the fabulous phoenix are delineated with all the conﬁdence of an eyewitness many of these episodical sketches though out of place when thus awkwardly inserted in the midst of the narrative are in them selves curious and well written but the most valuable and interesting among them are the frequent descriptions of paintings specimen of which has already been given on this subject especially the author dwells con amor and his remarks are generally characterised by degree of good taste and correct feeling which indicates higher degree of appreciation of the pictorial art than is generally ascribed to the age in which achilles tatius wrote even in the latter part of the ﬁrst century of our pliny when enumerating the glorious names of the ancient greek painters laments over the total decline in his own days of what he terms nat hist xxxv 11 an aspiring art but the monarchs of the macedonian dynasties in asia and above all the egyptian ptolemies were both muniﬁcent patrons of the ﬁne arts among their own subjects and diligent collecto rs of the great works of past ages and many of the es of the grecian masters were thus transfe rred from their native country to adorn the temples and palaces of egypt and syria we ﬁnd from plutarch that when aratus was exerting himself to gain the achæan league the powerful alliance of ptolemy euergetes he found means so effectual in conciliating the of the monarch the procuring him some of the master of pamphilus7 and melanthius the most renowned of the famous school of sicyon and the knowledge of the high estimation in which the arts were held under the egyptian kings gives an additional value to the accounts given by tatius of these treasures of past age his notices of which are the latest in point of time which have come down to us from an eyewitness we have already quoted the author vivid description of the painting of europa at shall now subjoin pendant to the former notice his remarks on pair of pictures at pelusium 7 pamphilus was macedonian by birth and pupil of eupompus the founder of the school of sicyon to the presidency of which he succeeded his pupils paid each talent year instruction and melanthius and even apelles himself time were among the number hist nat xxxv the great talent of melanthius like that of his master pamphilus lay in composition and grouping and so highly were his pictures esteemed that pliny in another passage says that the wealth of city would hardly purchase one in this temple of jupiter casius were two famous works of evanthes illustrative of the legends of andromeda and prometheus which the painter had probably selected pair from the similarity of the principal ﬁgure in each being bound to rock and exposed to the attack of terriﬁc animal in one case denizen of the air in the other monster of the sea and the deliverers of both being argives and of kindred blood to each other hercules and former of whom encountered on foot the savage bird sent by jove while the latter mounted on borrowed wings into the air to assail the monster which issued from the sea at the command of neptune in the picture of andromeda the virgin was laid in hollow of the rock not fashioned by art but rough like natural cavity and which if viewed only with regard to the beauty of that which it contained looked like niche holding an exquisite fresh

blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https which was seated on her pallid cheeks while beauty beamed forth from her eyes but even amid the pallor of her cheeks faint tinge of colour was yet perceptible so was the brightness of her eyes on the other hand in some measure dimmed like the bloom of lately blighted violets her white arms were extended and lashed to the rock but their whiteness partook of livid hue and her ﬁngers were like those of corpse thus lay she expecting death but arrayed like bride in long white robe which seemed not if woven from the ﬂeece of the sheep but from the web of the spider or of those winged insects the long threads spun by which are gathered by the indian women from the trees of their own country the monster was just rising out of the sea opposite to the damsel his head alone being distinctly visible while the unwie ldy length of his body was still in great measure concealed by the waves yet so partially to discover his formidable array of spines and scales his swollen neck and his long ﬂexible tail while the gape of his horrible jaws extended to his shoulder and disclosed the abyss of his stomach but between the monster and the damsel perseus was depicted descending to the encounter from the upper regions of the body bare except mantle ﬂoating round his shoulders and winged sandals on his cap resembling the helmet of pluto was on his head and in his left hand he held before him like buckler the head of the gorgon which even in the pictured representation was terrible to look at shaking its snaky hair which seemed to erect itself and menace

continuing straight and pointed like sword while the other was curved backwards so that with single stroke it might both inﬂict wound and ﬁx itself in the part struck such was the picture of andromeda the design of the other was thus prometheus was represented bound down to rock with fetters of iron while hercules armed with bow and arrow was seen approaching the vulture supporting himself by ﬁxing his talons in the thigh of prometheus was tearing open the stomach of his victim and apparently searching with his beak the liver which it was his destiny daily to devour and which the painter had shown through the aperture of the wound the whole frame of the sufferer was convulsed and his limbs contracted with torture so that by raising his thigh he involuntarily prese nted his side to the the other limb was visibly quivering in its whole length with teeth were clenched his lips parted and his brows winkled hercules had already ﬁtted the arrow to the bow and aimed it against his tormentor his left arm was thrown forward grasping the stock while the elbow of the right was bent in the attitude of drawing the arrow to his breast while prometheus full of mingled hope and fear was endeavouring to ﬁx his undivided gaze on his deliverer though his eyes in spite of himself were partially diverted by the anguish of his wound the work of achilles tatius with all its blemishes and defects appears to have been highly popular among the greeks of the lower empire an epigram is still extant attributed to the emperor leo the philosopher in which it is landed an example of chaste and faithful love and it was esteemed model of romantic composi tion from the elegance of its style and diction in which heretius ranks the author above heliodorus though he at the same time severely criticizes him want of originality accusing him of having borrowed all the interesting passages in his work from the ethiopics in common with heliodorus tatius has found host of followers among the later greeks some of whom the learned critic just quoted observes have transcribed rather than imitated him in the hysminias and hysmine of eumathius wretched production of the twelfth century not only many of the incidents but even of the names sostratus sosthenes and anthia are taken from clitophon and leucippe and to so pg 44 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https an extent is this plagiarism carried that two books out of the nine of which the romance consists are ﬁlled with descriptions of paintings while the plot not very intelligible at the best is still further perplexed by the extraordinary affectation of making nearly all the names alike thus the hero and heroine are hysminias and hysmine the towns are aulycomis eurycomis artycomis in all these works the outline is the same the lovers under go endless buffetings by sea and land imaginary deaths and escapes from marauders but not spark of genius or fancy enlivens these dull productions which sometimes maudlin and bombastic often indecent would defy the patience of the most determined novel reader one of these writers xenophon of ephesus the author of the ephesiacs or habrocomas and anthia is commended by politian the classical purity of his language in which he considers him scarcely inferior to his namesake the historian but the work has little else to recommend it the two principal personages are represented miracles of personal beauty and the women fall in love with habrocomas well the men with anthia literally by dozens at time the plot however differs from that of the others in marrying them at the commencement and sending them through the ordinary routine of dangers afterwards the ephesiacs are however noticeable from its having been supposed by mr douce illustrations of shakspear ii 198 that the catastrophe in romeo and juliet was originally borrowed from one of the adventures of anthia who when separated from her husband is rescued from banditti by perilaus governor of cilicia and by him destined his bride unable to evade his solic itations she procures from the poverty not the will of an aged physician named eudoxus what she supposes to be draught of poison but which is really an opiate she is laid with great pomp loaded with gems and costly ornaments in vault and on awakening ﬁnds herself in the hands of crew of pirates who have broken open her sepulchre in order to riﬂe the treasures which they knew to have been deposited there this work observes mr douce was certainly not published nor translated in the time of luigi porto the original narrator of the story of romeo and juliet but there is reason why he might not have seen copy of the original in we might enumerate several more of these later productions of the same school but separate analysis of each would be both tedious and needless none present any marked features of distinctio n from those already noticed they are all more or less indifferent copies either from heliodorus or achilles tatius the outline of the story being generally borrowed from one or the other of these sources while in point of style nearly all appear to have taken their model the ﬂorid rhetorical display and artiﬁcial polish of language which characterize the latter their redeeming point is the high position uniformly assigned to the female characters who are neither immured in the oriental seclusion of the harem nor degraded to household drudges like the athenian ladies in the polished age of but mingle without restraint in society the friends and companions of the other sex and are addressed in the language of admiration and respect but these pleasing traits are not sufﬁcient to atone the improbability of the incidents relieved neither by the brilliant fancy of the east nor the lofty deeds of

its own members the public eye ever watchful and timid waits scarcely the show of danger to take alarm and withdraw its favour michael shrunk from the bare conception of an act of violence it was more agreeable in an hour of to devise remedy which if it did not cure the disease helped at least to cicatrize the immediate wounds he looked from brammel to brammel father indemniﬁcation and the old man was in truth rare temptation fond pitiable father of false and bloodless child doting when others would have hated loving his prodigal with more anxious fondness his ingratitude grew the claims upon parent heart dwindled more and more away the man was girl in tenderness and sensibility he remembered the mother of the wayward child and the pains she had taken to misuse and spoil her only boy his own conduct returned to him in the shape of heavy reproaches and he could not forget or call to mind without remorse the smiles of encouragement he had given the ﬂattering approbation he had bestowed when true love justice duty mercy all called loudly rebuke restraint wholesome correction solemn chastisement could he be conscious of all this and not excuse the unsteady himself it was he who deserved the sufferer with his calamities imposed upon him by his erring sire he was ready to receive his punishment oh would that at any any expense of bodily and mental suffering he could secure his child from further sorrow and from deeper degradation to such heart and mind michael might well carry his complaints with some expectation of sympathy and reimbursement aggrieved he was he did not fail to paint his disappointment and sense of injury in the strongest colours but blacker than he was capable of such task he pictured the gross deception of which he had so cruelly been made the subject i could he said to the poor father in whose aged eyes turned to the earth tears of shame were gushing i could have forgiven any thing but that you deceived meanly and deliberately the character you gave with him was false you knew it to be so and you were well aware that nothing but mischief and ruin could result from connexion with him indeed mr allcraft replied the unhappy man i had great hopes of his reform ation he had improved of late years little and he gave his word that he would be steady if i had not thought so i should certainly not have permitted you to receive him what can we sir ah what mr brammel it is that i wish to know the present state of things can not continue where is he now pg 51 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https indeed i not know he is bad boy to hide himself from his father i not deserve it of him i can not guess are you aware sir that he is married they have told something of it i am in truth glad to hear it it will be to his wife interest to lead him back to duty you have not seen her then the old man shook his head well well sir continued allcraft this is not to the purpose we must protect ourselves his proﬂigacy must be checked at all events we must have conne xion with it hitherto we have honoured his drafts and kept your name and his free from disgrace i can so longer we have paid his last cheque this very day i shall advertise publicly our determination to honour his demands more mr allcraft interposed old brammel anxiously taking every word granted that must not be can not allow it the poor boy sake that determination must not be made at present i am sure he will reform at last i should not be surprised if he returned to business in day or two and settled steadily to work the remainder of his life it is likely enough now that he is married i have much to answer on account of that youth mr allcraft and i should never forgive myself if i suffered any thing to be done that is likely to render him desperate just when glimmering of hope is stealing upon us you shake your head sir but i am conﬁdent he will yet make up all his folly heaven grant it sir your sake yes and his own poor what will become of him if he does not now to these cheques mr allcraft let have them all i will restore every farthing that you have paid on his account and should any more be presented let them be duly honoured i hold myself responsible their dischar ge i am sure this is the wisest course to pursue it is quite reasonable you to demur and to object to these demands i like you the better mr allcraft your scruples you are an honourable man sir i would lose my last drop of blood to make my poor boy like you it is wise and praiseworthy in you to look so carefully to the good credit of your house and it is fair and right that i should take this matter upon myself i it persuaded of the propriety of the step and satisﬁed that all will go well with him yet be lenient with the unhappy boy sir and have yet little patience i am afraid sir that he will but presume on your generosity and good nature ah but he is never to know it mr allcraft i would not the world have him hear of what i have done should you discover his abode write to him i him that i am enraged at his i not think that i can ever be reconciled to him again say that my anger has my heart is break and kill if he persists in his ingratitude and cruelty implore him to come home and save the old man stopped and wept michael was not yet father and could not understand the tears it appears that he understood business much better taking leave of brammel soon he could after the latter had expressed wish to cash the cheques he went immediately to the bank and procured the documents he presented them with his own hand to the astounded father from whom also with his own hand he received one good substantial draft in fair exchange so far so good but in another quarter allcraft suddenly discovered that he had committed an egregious blunder he had entrusted planner with the secret of his critical pg 52 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https made him acquainted with the dishonest transactions of his father and the consequent bankruptcy of the ﬁrm not that this disclosure had been made in any violent ebullition of unguarded any particular love to an inability on the part of the divulger to keep his own good counsel michael when he raised planner from poverty to comparative afﬂuence was fully sensible of the value of his man dire necessity him it was indispensable that the tragic underplot of the play should never be known to either bellamy or brammel and the only safe way of concealing it from them was to communicate it unreservedly to their commo n partner and his peculiar protégé he did so with much solemnity and with many references to the extraordinary liberality he had himself displayed in admitting him to his conﬁdence and to share of his wealth maintain my secret he said to planner and your fortune shall be made betray and you are thrown again into garret you can not hurt nothing shall save you he repeated these words over and over again and he received from his conﬁdant assurance upon assurance of secrecy and unlimited devotion and up to the period of allcraft return from france the gentleman had every reason to rely upon the probity and good faith of his associate nor in fact had he less reason after his return were it not that the thief doth fear each bush an ofﬁcer he had cause whatever to suspect or tremble his mind any actual danger might have been at rest but what did he behold why planner and bellamy whom he had left distant acquaintances intimate and loving united and inseparable the tawny twins of siam not week passed which did not ﬁnd the former once twice or three times guest at the proud man table the visits paid to the bank were rather to mr planner than any other object mr planner only could give advice to the alteration of the south wing of the hall mr planner taste must decide upon the internal embellishments then there were private and mysterious conversations in the small back parlour nods and signiﬁcant looks when they met and separated and once michael called to see planner after the hours of business and whom should he discover in his room but mr bellamy himself sitting in conclave with the schemer and manifestly intent upon some serious matter what was the meaning of all this oh it was too plain the rebel planner had fallen from his allegiance and was making his terms with the enemy allcraft cursed himself thousand times his folly in placing himself at the mercy of so unstable character and immediately became aware that there had never been any cogent reason such step and that his danger would have been inﬁnitely smaller had he never spoken to human being on the subject but it was useless to call himself by turns madman and fool his pains what could be done now to repair the error absolutely nothing and at the best he had only to prepare himself the remainder of his days to live in doubt fear anxiety and torture in the meanwhile planner grew actually enamoured of the pantamorphica association the more he examined it the more striking appeared its capabilities the fairer seemed the prospect of triumphant unequivocal success in pursuance of his generous resolution he communicated his designs to allcraft they were received with looks of unaffected fright without an instant hesitation michael implored his partner to give up at once and ever all thoughts of the be faithful to his duty and to think well of his serious engagement your association sir he exclaimed in the anger of the moment is like every other precious scheme you have embarked ridiculous absurd planner in these three words could only ingratitude basest it had ever been his lot to meet here was return his straightforward unequalled liberality here was the affectionate expression of thanks which he had so proudly looked forward acknowledgment of superior genius which he had right to expect from the man who was to proﬁt so largely by the labour of his brains very well then let it be so he would prosecute the glorious work would himself supply the funds needful the undertaking and alone he would receive the great reward that most assuredly awaited him very delicately did michael hint to his partner that existed with his castles and associations in the unsubstantial air and where else but not so delicately to avoid heaping fuel on the ﬁre which he had already kindled in the breast of the offended schemer the latter bristled at the words lost an instant his said in his pg 53 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https more than he than he might easily to bruise the already smarting soul of allcraft threat escaped his taunt he spoke of his power and touched cuttingly upon the deep schemes of other men more feasible than his own perhaps and certainly more honest allcraft winced every syllable made known the speaker actual own dependence and utter weakness he made reply to the attack of the man whom he had drawn from beggary but he looked him in the face steadily and reproachfully and shamed him into vexation and regret i did not mean to speak unkindly michael he stammered with view to apologize i am sorry that i lost my temper you need not fear remember what i have said you have threatened planner answered allcraft trembling with irritation you have attempted to frighten into compliance with your demands i say sir you have threatened it is the ﬁrst shall be the last it shall promise you it shall i ask promise from you continued the excited and suspicious man writhing under sense of his helplessness you have betrayed the cloven foot i thank you it i am aware of what is to expect shall hold myself prepared nothing of the kind allcraft you know better you are safe with i am ashamed of myself what i have spoken give but never mind proceeded the unhappy michael i defy you your worst let this be your acknowledgment of past fulﬁlment of your sacred promise betray to bellamy and be at ease michael you not use well i spoke angrily and without consideration i am sorry that i did so and i have asked your forgiveness what can i more you should allow wounded feelings it was hard to hear you ridiculing an affair that occupies my serious thoughts i was more about it answer this how much does mr bellamy already know from make your mind happy on that score it is not to the interest of any one of us that secrets should be known you need not fear shake hands michael took his hand and to this association continued planner let have my way thing is clear and can not fail the elements of success are there and splendid fortune must be realized i am not greedy i want to grasp every thing myself i told you just now that we would share and share alike you are not up to projects of this nature i am trust to i will engage to enter upon new affair if i am disappointed in this the truth is i can not quietly let fortune slide through my ﬁngers when little skill and energy only are necessary to secure it come michael this once you must not say the hope however faint of making money by this speculation and the fear of offending the depositary of his great secret compelled at length from allcraft reluctant acquiescence he consented to the trial receiving planner solemn promise that in the event of failure it should be the last planner himself overjoyed at his victory prepared himself action and contemplated the magniﬁcent resources of the bank with resolute and daring spirit that would have gratiﬁed exceedingly the customers of the house could they have but known it planner conscientiously believed that he had hitherto failed in all his schemes because he had never commanded cash sufﬁcient to carry out his views this great obstacle being removed he wisely determined to make the most of his good fortune and in truth he was without the shadow of an excuse pg 54 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https and forbearance the anxiety which might have accompanied his ventures had the money been his own was mercifully spared him the thought of personal danger and ruin could never come to cloud his intellect or oppress his energy the ruin of any other party the idea by very happy dispensation never once occurred to him it took very few months to make mr planner the largest principal president and ﬁrst man in the famous pantamorphica and whilst he was busy in the purchase of lands required the extensive undertaking his dear friend mr bellamy was agreeably occupied in paying off by degrees the heavy mortgages which many years had been weighing on his beautiful estate in addition to the ten thousand pounds which he had abstracted during the absence of mr allcraft he had not hesitated to draw large sums under the very nose of his too easy and unsuspecting partner the manner of mr bellamy threw michael off his guard he walked so upon every body so even to allcraft in so high tone and with so patronizing an air that it was quite impossible to suspect him of being any thing but real coin sound man and worthy of all trust it is certainly true that mr bellamy had not brought into the concern he had engaged some twenty or forty thousand does not matter the reasons which he condescended to give this failure were perfectly satisfactory and accounted the well accounted it that michael entreated mr bellamy not to think about it but to take his time and how very natural it was man of mr bellamy consideration and enormous wealth to secure the little property that adjoined his own and to borrow from the bank any sum of money that he might want to complete so desirable purchase and how very natural likewise on the part of allcraft ever fearful of discovery ever desirous to keep upon the best terms with mr bellamy the great man of the country the observed of all observers be at all times anxious to oblige his friend to render him sensible of his desire to please him and of the obligation under which by these repeated acts of kindness and indulgence he was insensibly brought and so they reached the close of the ﬁrst year of partnership and who shall say that the situation of michael was an enviable one or that the persevering man had not good cause despondency and dread he was already deeply indebted to his wife not one of his three partners had proved to be such he expected and required danger threate ned from two of them mr bellamy had not afforded the support which he had promised stronger heart than michael might have quailed in his position yet the pressure from without animated and invigorated him in the midst of his gloom he was not without gleam of hope and consolation he had foreseen the business of the house rapidly increased its returns were great day and night he laboured to improve them and to raise the reputation of the tottering concern tottering it was though looking most secure himself he did not draw one farthi ng from the bank he resided with his wife in small cottage lived economically and sacriﬁced to his engrossing occupation every joy of the domestic hearth the public acknowledged with favour the exertions of the labouring man pronounced him worthy of his sire vouchsafed him their respect and conﬁdence bravely the youth proceeded on his ever to the straining to his to sacriﬁce his life rather than yield or not attain it noble of less ignoble better fate the second year passed on and then the third at the close of this michael looked again at his condition during the last year the business of the house had doubled had not the proﬁts and more than the proﬁts been dragged away by bellamy and ardent mind would have been satisﬁed his ceaseless toil but the continual drafts had kept ever in advance of the receipts draining the ppling its faculties even at this melancholy exhib ition his sanguine spirit refused to be cast down and to resign the hope of ultimate recovery and success he built upon the promise of mr bellamy who at length had engaged to refund his loans upon certain day and to add at the same time his and quota of ﬂoating capital he built pg 55 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https the illusions of planner strong who suddenly becoming sick of his speculation alarmed at his responsibility and doubtful of success had been some time vigorously looking out gentleman willing to purchase his share and interest in the unrivaled pantamorphica and to relieve him of his liabilities and had at last persuaded himself into the belief that he had found one he likewise ﬁxed period the restoration of fearful sum of money which michael madman that he was had suffered him to ﬂing away like dirt upon such expectation allcraft upon such props suffered his aching soul to rest there wanted but month to the acceptable season when claims upon the house poured in which could not be put off michael borrowed money once more from his wife to meet them he did it without remorse or hesitation why should he have think about it when the hour of repayment was so near at hand it was proper question man who could slumber on mine that was ready to burst and shatter him to atoms chapter ii meeting it was constant saying of old mr brammel that if his time were to come over again he would adopt very different plan from that which he had pursued in the education of his son now different plan it might have been but one leading to more satisfactory result i must take the liberty to deny of what use is experience to one who with sixty years of life in him still feels and thinks reasons and acts like child who but child would have thought of paying the wholesale demands of that dissolute incorrigible youth with the notion of effecting by such subtle means his lasting reformation who but child would have made the concealment of his name condition of the act may be guessed the success of this scheme was equal to its wisdom augustus theodore too grateful the facilities afforded him showed disposition to abridge his pleasures or to hasten his return in the regular and faithful dischar ge of his drafts his vulgar soul rejoiced to detect fear of offending and an eagerness to conciliate on the part of his partner michael allcraft he would see and acknowledge nothing else and the idea once ﬁxed in his mind he was not likely to rest contented with half the glory of his victory would punish the fellow would make him smart he would teach him to come all the way to france on purpose to bully him he had done with the gentleman yet master allcraft should cry loud enough before he had he sicken him still the hopeful youth pursued his he transmitted his orders at sight they were honoured augustus theodore chuckled with stupid delight over what he considered the pitiful submission of his partner who had not courage to reject his drafts and dared not utter now one brief expostulatory word mr brammel junior like the rest of the ﬁrm lived in his own delusions the fourth year dawned and mr brammel suddenly appeared amongst his friends he and his lady had travelled over europe they had seen the world had seen them they were sick of desired to settle noble villa with parks and paddocks was quickly taken and sumptuously furnished hunters were got from from an establishment worthy of the name rose like magic almost within sight of michael humble dwelling taking the neighbourhood by surprise startling and affrighting allcraft again the latter visited the fond old complained and once more the father entreated on behalf of his son begged time and patience and undertook to satisfy the prodigal extravagance he gave his money before willingly and eagerly and stipulated only with unmeaning earnestness secrecy and silence and the fourth year closed drearily it had opened the promises of bellamy and planner were far from fulﬁlment ever their performa nce vigorous and disastrous at ﬁrst the landed proprietor still redeemed day after day portions of his involved estate the schemer disappointed in his expectations of purchaser returned to his speculation with redoubled ardour and with fresh supplies of gold his only chance of ultimate recovery was to push boldly forward and to betray fear of failure one retrograde or timid step would open the eyes of men and bring down ruin on the pantamorphica planner

year of his life since he was born draws his difﬁcult breath through threescore years and ten whilst the young the hardy and the sound are smitten in their pride and fall in heaps about him it is less strange that house of business like that of our friend mr allcraft should assert its existence years rotten it was during the whole of the time at its very heart core and yet such is the case eight years elapsed and found it still in the land of the living yes and to the eye external proper and good house of business any you shall name its vitals were gone before the smallest indications of mischief appeared upon the surface life must have been well nourished to maintain itself so long and was it not answer thou kind physician gentle margaret answer thou balm and life garet gold eight weary years have passed and we have reached miserable day in the month of november the wind is howling and the rain is pelting against the parlour windows of the whose blinds are drawn close down the

it appear s in casting up accounts mr bellamy who looks remarkably glossy and very at the table likewise perusing leisurely the county newspapers through golden eyeglasses he holds them with the air of gentleman comfortable and at ease in all respects mentally and bodily augustus theodore swings on chair before the ﬁre which he keeps at work his own especial consolation his feet stretch along the amusement is the poker he has grown insuf ferably vain is dressed many degre es above the highest fashionable point and looks dissipated hopeless blackguard planner very subdued very pale and therefore very unlike himself stands behind the chair of allcraft and ever and anon he casts rueful glance over the shoulder of his friend upon the papers which his friend is busy with one speaks at intervals mr bellamy coughs extensively and loudly just to show his dignity and independence and to assure the company that his conscience is very tranquil on the his ﬁrm withers are unwrung and mr brammel struggl es like an bullﬁnch to produce whistle and fails in the attempt with these exceptions we have silent room quarter of an hour passes michael ﬁnishes his work he spends one moment in reﬂection and then he speaks now gentlemen he begins with deep sigh that seems to carry from his heart load of now if you please the paper and the poker are abandoned chairs are drawn towards the table the partners sit and look at one another face to face gentlemen said michael at ﬁrst slowly and seriously and in tone which none might hear beyond their you not i am sure require to advert to all the causes which have rendered this meeting necessary i have desire to use reproaches and i shall refer little i may to the past i ask you all to justice have i not laboured like slave the common good have i not toiled in order to avoid the evil hour that has come upon us have i not given every i not robbed another in order to prop up our house and keep its name from infamy be calm be calm interposed mr bellamy gently remarking that allcraft sligh tly raised his voice at the concluding words pg 57 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https calm calm mr bellamy exclaimed the unhappy speaker renouncing without hesitation all attempts at the suaviter in modo and yet fearful of showing his indignation and of being calm it is well you to talk so had i been less calm less easy had i done my i been determined seven years ago this cruel day would never have arrived you are my witness that it never would mr bellamy rose with much formality from his seat gentlemen he said i can not submi t to dark and plebeian innuendoes i have come here at great personal inconvenience and i am prepared to listen respectfully to any thing which mr allcraft thinks it his duty to bring before us but i must have you remember that gentleman and man of honour can not brook an insult i ask your pardon sir added allcraft in tone of i meant insult pray be seated i have the honour to present you with statement of our affairs we have claims upon us amounting to several thousand pounds which must be met within week third of the sum required will not be at our command how is it to be obtained and if obtained how is it to repair the inroads which year after year have been made upon the house and how secure it from further spoliation it is useless and absurd to hide from ourselves any longer the glaring fact that we are on the actual ver ge of bankruptcy well i have had nothing to with that you ca say it ejaculated mr brammel you have had the management in your own hands and so you have nobody but yourself to thank it i thought from the beginning how the concern would turn out your share sir in furthering the interests of the bank we will speak of shortly said michael turning to the speaker with contempt we have little time recrimination now recrimination mr allcraft interposed mr bellamy i must be allowe d to say that you betray very improper spirit in this you are far from being temperate temperate yes i said so mr bellamy said allcraft bursting with rage i have been your partner eight years i have not moment deserted my post or slackened in my duty i have given my strength my health my peace of mind to the house i have drawn less than your clerk from its resources but i have added to them wrongfully cruelly and unpardonably from means not my own which in common honesty i ought never to have which really really mr allcraft said bellamy interrupting him you have told us every word of this before wait sir continued the other i am intemperate and you shall have my excuse being so you mr bellamy have never devoted one moment of your life to the interests of the house not moment you have year after year without the slightest hesitation or remorse sucked its from it you have borrowed these accounts will show thousands of pounds and paid them back with promises and words you engaged to produce your fair proportion of capital you have given nothing you made grand professions of adding strength and stability to the ﬁrm you have been its block and hinderance mr allcraft said bellamy coolly you are still very young man have i told the truth pg 58 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https pshaw man speak to the point speak to the point sir we have heavy payments due next week are we prepared to meet them shall we be that unfortunate added mr bellamy very quietly you are sure of that you can not help another loan instance michael answered with very well violence mr allcraft pray such being the case i shall decline at present giving any answer to the unjust inhuman observations which you have made upon my conduct painful it is to pass this barbarous treatment over the present still my own private affairs shall be nothing in comparison with the general good this provided i will protect myself from future insult depend upon it you are wrong mr wrong you shall acknowledge it you will be sorry the expressions which you have cast upon gentleman your senior in years and here very loud cough let social station now sir let beg word or two in private it was very unfortunate that the whole establishment stood in unaffected awe of the redoubted mr bellamy allcraft notwithstanding his knowledge of the man and his previous attack upon his character was not at this moment free from the fascination and at the eleventh hour he found it difﬁcult to withdraw entirely his conﬁden ce in mr bellamy ultimate desire and capability to deal honorably and justly by him much of the mogul power was unquestionably derived from his massive physique but his chief excellence lay in that peculiar d patronizing air which he made it point to assume towards every individual with whom he came in contact he had scarcely requested few minutes private conversation with allcraft before planner and brammel jumped involuntarily from their seats if in obedience to word of command and edged towards the door if you please continued mr bellamy nodding to them very graciously and they departed in the course of ten minutes they were recalled by the autocrat himself the gentlemen resumed their seats and this time mr bellamy addressed them you see my dear sirs he began with him peculiar gentleness it is absolutely necessary to provide against the immediate exigency and to postpone all discussion on the past until this is met and satisfactorily disposed of certainly said augustus brammel who his part never wished to talk or think about the past again certainly hear hear i agree to that i knew you would dear mr gentleman of your discretion would not fail to so augustus looked up at mr bellamy to ﬁnd if he were jeering him but he saw reason to believe it such being the case continued the worthy speaker it behoves us now to look about some assistance our friend mr allcraft i am sorry to say does not feel disposed to help us once more through the pressure i am very sorry to say so perhaps he will think better of it allcraft shook his head ah just so he desponds little now he takes the dark side of things my own part i prefer the bright he believes you have heard that we are on the verge of bankruptcy upon my honour gentleman i really can believe in such thing there is general gloom over the mercantile world it will break off in time and we with the rest of mankind shall pass into the sunshine hear hear exclaimed augustus brammel that the way to look at things pg 59 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https taking it granted positively i an not inclined to really mr allcraft it is against your interest not to help us in this emer however taking it i say granted that our friend here will not succour appears to that only one legitimate course is open to us if we are refused at home let us apply aid near our home possible there are our london friends ah yes to be there are cried theodore augustus we surely can not hesitate to apply to them our name deservedly high they will be glad to accommodate us with temporary loan we will avail ourselves of three months that will give us time to turn about us and to prepare ourselves against similar unpleasant casualties see what we want mr allcraft let the sum be raised in london without delay and let us look forward with the hearts of men capital capital continued brammel i second that motion thank you sir said mr bellamy with gracious smile there remains then to consider only who shall be the favoured individual deputed to this important business one of us must certainly go to london and i think it due to our youngest member brammel to concede to him the honour of representing us in the metropolis offence will i trust be taken by our other friends and i hope that in my zeal mr brammel i shall not be suspected of betraying an undue preference mr bellamy turned towards augustus theodore with an almost affectionate expression of countenance he spoke these words but perceived to his mortiﬁcation that the latter instead of being pleasantly affected by his address wriggled in his chair most impatiently and assumed the complexion and aspect of man with whom something has suddenly and violently disagreed he bellowed out soon he could none of that mr bellamy make up your mind at go i ca borrow money i not know how to it i want the honour thank you it very good of you and i am much obliged to fact but you look out some body else if you please i beg to say i mr bellamy cast upon theodore one of his natural and annihilating glances and said deliberately mr brammel the ﬁrst time in your life you are honoured by being made useful individual you are to go to you shall go i answered brammel in his accustomed easy style and manner very well you are aware mr brammel that your respected parent has yet to be made acquainted with sundry lively doings of your own which you would rather i believe keep from his ears at present you likewise are aware that if any thing happens to the serious injury of the bank through your inheritance from that respected parent would be dearly purchased shilling i shall be sorry to hurt your feelings or your pocket i have wish to it but depend upon sir your father shall be wiser man if you are obstinate and disobedient i ca borrow know how to it said brammel peevishly and who reproaches you your inability my dear sir said bellamy coaxingly one i am sure you shall be taught every thing shall be made easy and agreeable you will carry your credentials from the house and your simple task shall be before hand well explained to you pg 60 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https i am not used to it and you never will be mr brammel if you begin to practise come i am sure you wish to see your father i am certain you are not anxious to part with your patrimony you are too sensible man pray let us have delay mr allcraft see what we want mr brammel will go to londo n we must take time by the forelock let us meet these heavy payments and then we can think and breathe and talk till then it is idle to wrangle and to lose one temper very well then there little more i imagine to be done at present augustus theodore still opposed his nomination like an irritable child but ﬂy kicking against stone wall was likely to move it brammel to break down the resolution of such personage mr bellamy after an hour insane remonstrance he gave in to his own alarm rather than to the persuasion of his partner he was fearfully in debt his only hope of getting out of it rested in the speedy decease of his unfortunate parent whom he had not seen months and who he had reason to believe had vowed to make him pay with his whole fortune any calamity that might happen to the bank through his misconduct or extravagance it was not from the lips of mr bellamy that he heard this threat the ﬁrst time what he should if it were carried out heaven only knows he consented to go to london on this disgusting mission and he could have bitten his tongue out speaking his acquiescence so enraged was he with himself and all the world at his defeat he did not affect to conceal his anger and yet strange to say it was not visible to mr bellamy on the contr ary he thanked mr brammel the cheerful and excellent spirit in which he had met his partners wishes and expressed himself delighted at the opportunity which now presented itself introducing their young friend to life then turning to michael allcraft he begged him to prepare their deputation his work immediately and to place obstacle in the way of his departure then he moved the adjournment of the meeting until the return of mr brammel and then he ﬁnished by inviting all his partners to dine with him at the hall that day and to join him in drinking success and happiness to their young adventurer the invitation was accepted and bellamy grand carriage drew up immediately with splash and clatter to the door chapter iii chapter of loans augustus brammel hated his partners with all his heart and soul he had never been very fond of them but the result of this interview gave an activity and form to feelings which it required only sufﬁcient occasi on to bring into play notwithstanding the polite tone which mr bellamy had cunningly adopted in placing his mission before him even he the ignorant and obtuse brammel could not fail to see that he had been made the tool the in business from which his partners shrank now had the young man been full of courage he was of vulgar conceit he might i verily believe have turned his hatred and his knowledge of affairs to very good account lacking the spirit of the smallest animal that crawls he was content to eject his odious malice in oaths and execrations and to submit to his beating after all sooner was the meeting at an end than he left the and turned his steps towards home he had beco it was very natural he brute of husband and the terror of his helpless household he remembered all at once that he had been deeply aggrieved in the morning by mrs brammel that many two of his shirt buttons had given way whilst he was in the act of dressing and unable to contain himself after the treatment of mr bellamy he resolved forthwith to have his vengeance out upon his wife but he had not walked hundred yards before his rancour and fury increased to such height that he was compelled to pull up short in the street and to vow with horrible oath that he would see all his partners roasting in the warmest place that he could think of before he move one inch to save their souls from rotting so instead of proceeding homeward he turned back again with view to make this statement but before

like thunderbolt to allcraft it was iniquitous unpardonable were the acts of his was the actual sum of money gone yet these were nothing compared with the distressing fact that intelligence of the evil work had already gone abroad was in circulation and might at any moment put violent end to his own unsteady course he carried the note to thrust it into his face and called him to account his

ﬁxed to parchment and the warrant of his release appeared in public print within week the fettered man was free within another week his bounding spirits came like back to him and in less than twenty days of freedom and repose he recovered quite many years of sweet and precious life he made quick use of his wings at ﬁrst like wild and liberated bird he sported and tumbled in the air and ﬁxed upon particular aim thousand captivating objects soon caught his eagle eye and then he mounted dazzled by them all and soon eluded mortal sight and reach but glad was the schemer his delight and sense of freedom were much inferior to those of his misguided and unlucky partner michael breathed man relieved from nightmare the encumbrance which had years prevented him from rising that had so lately threatened his existence was gone could longer hang upon him haunt and oppress him what deliverance et what price had he paid it true but was not the money already sacriﬁced would it have been restored had the luckless speculator himself remained never well fearful then was the sum let it go taking the incubus along with it allcraft took care to obtain the consent of bellamy to his arrangement he wrote to him explaining the reasons parting with their partner and an answer came from the landed proprietor acquiescing in the plan but slightly doubting the propriety of the movement

moment he was ignorant of his movements he resolved to make his way at once to the hall and to get what intelligence he could of its lord and master from the servants left in charge of that most noble and encumbered property accordingly he quitted his apartment threw ghastly smile into his countenance and then came quickly upon his clerks humming few cheerful notes with about much spirit and energy man might have if forced to sing comi c song just before his execution thoroughly persuaded that the ofﬁcials had not obtained an inkling of what had transpired in his sanctum and that he left them without suspicion of evil upon their minds he started upon his errand and waited not breath until he reached his destination he arrived at the arrived at the hall he rang the loud bell and minute

transaction would he not have been ashamed to it would he have subjected himself to the just reproaches and upbraidings of his partner when by his absence he might so easily have avoided them certainly not michael allcraft few brief seconds was happier man than he had been years his eyes were hardly free of the tears which he had shed in the extremity of his distress and he was now ready to weep again in the very exuberance and wildness of his delight he presented his card to the corpulent and powdered footman he was announced he was ushered in walter bellamy esquire sitting in state received his friend and partner with many smiles and much urbanity he was still at breakfast and advancing slowly in the meal like gentleman whose breakfast was his greatest care in life nothing could be more striking than the air of stately repose visible in the proprietor himself and in the specious and solemn who stood behind serving than sublime dumb waiter michael was affected by it and he approached his colleague with rising sentiment of perhaps the effect of the the result of natural apprehension most glad to see you my very good friend began the most be seated lovely morning this plate mr allcraft thank have breakfasted said michael declining the kind offer i had thought of ﬁnding you at home mutual and unexpected pleasure just so i had thought of coming home until i started

mr bellamy and he continued having returned i presume you spend some time amongst us pg 73 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https not day my friend i am on the wing again i have left dozen men behind who hunt over the country if i rejoin them without delay i am off again michael moved uneasily in his chair but how are you mr allcraft how are all our friends nothing new i venture to say this

your determination be surprised at any thing mr allcraft take things they come if you wish to be happy michael very uneasy indeed wished to make remark but he looked at the man in crimson plush and held his tongue mr bellamy observed him you have something to say can i give you any advice my friend pray command and speak without reserve much you please and quickly you please i assure you time is precious in half an hour i have twenty men to see and twice many things to again michael glanced at the stout footman who was pretending to throw his mind into the coming week and to appear oblivious of every thing about him i have question to ask proceeded michael hesitatingly but it can be answered in moment and at another little while when you are quite at leisure you please only remember i have end of engagements and if i am called away i can not return to you poor michael his expectations were again at fearful discount the language and demeanor of mr bellamy seemed decisive of his intentions what could he but fasten on his man and not suffer him to leave his sight without an explanation which he dreaded to receive mr bellamy continued to be very polite and very talkativ and to prosecute his repast with unyielding equanimity at the close of the meal the servant removed the cloth and departed at the same instant the landed proprietor rose from his chair and was about to depart likewise michael alarmed at the movement touched mr bellamy gently on the sleeve and then less gently detained him by the wrist what you mean sir asked bellamy turning sharply upon his partner what you mean what is your object mr bellamy said allcraft pale death and much excited you must not go until you have satisﬁed on point of life and death to both of us your conduct is mystery i can not explain it i know not what are the motives which actuate you these are known to yourself let them be so but i have question to ask and you must and shall answer it must and shall mr allcraft take

our condition you know that there needs only breath to destroy us in one moment ever at this very time your purpose is known to the world and before we can prevent it the bank may be run upon and annihilated what will be said of your proceedings how can you reconcile the answer which you have just now given to with your vaunted high sense of honour or even with your own most worldly interests have you ﬁnished sir said bellamy in quiet voice exclaimed michael in angry tone of indignation i have not ﬁnished i call upon you mr bellamy to mark my words to mark and heed so heaven help i bid you listen to the truth quiet and easy you profess to be i will be cozened by you longer if you carry out your work your doings shall be told to every human soul within hundred miles of where you stand

bellamy by all means let it stop if it be necessary inevitable arrangement i would not interfere with it the world act mr allcraft precisely you think proper it is all i ask on my own account i have unfortunately private debts to very large amount what is still more unfortunate they must be paid i have means of paying them except by selling my estate and therefore it must go i hope you are satisﬁed michael threw himself into chair and moved about in it groaning mr bellamy closed the door and approached him this is very unnecessary display of feeling mr allcraft said the imperturbable bellamy can answer good end the thing i have told you is inevitable cried allcraft implorin gly not so mr bellamy think well our dreadful situation reﬂect that before another day is gone we may be ruined beggared and that this very property may be wrested from you by our angry creditors what will become of us heaven sake my dear good sir not rush blindly upon destruction not suffer us to be hoote d trampled upon despised cursed by every man that meets us you can save us if you it just being just mr allcraft replied bellamy composedly the less we speak about that matter the better had justice been ever taken into account you and i would in all probability not have met on the present business i can not help saying that when you are ready to justify to your conduct in respect of your late father liabilities i shall be more disposed to listen to any thing you may have to urge in reason touching the produce of this estate until that time i am an unmoved man you conceive pg 74 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https yes said michael changing colour i perceive your am bellamy continued the unhappy speaker stammering until he almost burst with rage you are villain you have heard of my misfortunes and you take mean advantage of your knowledge to crush and kill you are villain and i defy you mr bellamy moved leisurely to the and rang the bell the stout gentleman in plush walked in and the landed proprietor pointed to the door mr allcraft william said the squire very well said michael white with agitation very well sure you are living man your ruin shall be coincident with mine not step shall i fall down which you shall not follow and be dragged yourself you shall not be spared one pang i warn you of your fate and it shall come sooner than you look it pooh pooh you have been drinking mr allcraft you lie sir you have lied months and upon lies and you need not say another word you shall ﬁnish your sentence sir elsewhere begone william show mr allcraft to the door william pretended to look very absent again and bowed michael stared at him second or two if confounded and then like madman rushed from the room and house chapter vi the crash the plans and objects of mr walter bellamy were best known to himself what ever they might be he diver ged from them few hours in order to give his miserable partner the opportunity he had promised him of completing that very inauspicious last which he had uttered in bellamy house previously to his abrupt departure michael had not been in the an hour after his return from the hall before he was visited by gentleman who introduced himself the particular friend of bellamy on whose particular business he professed to come allcraft with his brain on ﬁre received the visit of this man with secret glee all the way home he had prayed that bellamy might prove good his word and not fail to demand immediate satisfaction he longed death with full and yearning desire and he could kiss the hand that would be merciful and give the fatal blow suicide at heart it was something to escape the guilt and punishment of bellamy was reputed shot michael was aware of the fact and hugged the consciousness to his soul he would not detract from his reputation the duellist should add another laurel to his chaplet of honour and purchase it with his blood he had resolved to ﬁght and fall it was very evident that the friend of mr bellamy expected rather to frighten michael into humble and contrite apology than to ﬁnd him ready and eager the battle he commenced his mission by very long and address and assured mr allcraft time after time that nothing but the most ample and the most public amende could be received by his friend after what had taken place michael listened impatiently and interr upted the speaker in the midst of his oration you are quite right sir said he if an apology is to be made it should be an ample one but i decline to make any whatever i am prepared to give mr bellamy all the satisfaction that he asks i will refer you at once to my friend and the sooner the affair is settled the better well but surely mr allcraft you must regret the strong expression pg 75 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol

certainly unprepared michael resolution nothing name your friend sir michael had already ﬁxed upon second and he told his name his visitor went to seek him and the poor bewildered man rubbed his hands gleefully though he had just saved his life instead of having placed it in such fearful jeopardy that day passed like dream the meeting was quickly arranged six on the following morning was the hour ﬁxed the place was ﬁeld the ﬁrst beyond the turnpike gate and within mile of the city soon michael made sure of the duel he saw his conﬁdential clerk his name was burrag he had been servant in the forty years and had known michael since his birth it was he who gave the newspaper into allcraft hands on the ﬁrst arrival of the latter at the bank that morning he was quiet old man of sixty an affectionate creature and much part of the the iron chest the desk the counter or any other solid ﬁxture he stepped softly into his master room after he had been summoned there and he gazed at his unhappy principal father might at his own child in beloved and favourite child you are not well this morning sir said burrage most respectfully you look very pale and anxious my looks belie burrage i am very well i have not been so well years i am composed and happy i have been ill but the time is past how old are you burrage turned threescore sir old enough to die death is sweet thing old man when it comes to the i have had my share of trouble too much much said burrage his eyes ﬁlling with water you have half killed yourself here i am sure your poor father never expected this nobody could have expected it in his time when you were little fat boy running about without thought except thought of kindness other people michael allcraft burst into ﬂood of gushed faster and faster into his eyes and he sobbed only men sob who have reached the climax of earthly suffering and trial not take on so my dear sir said burrage running to him pray be calm i am sure you are unwell you have been ill some time you should see i am very much afraid that your disease is beyond their truth i am burrage said michael in whisper and still sighing it is all over it is ﬁnished prepare the to your own safety hide yourself from the gaze of men it will strike us all dead you frighten mr are really very your brain is want little repose and recreation yes you are right recreat ion of repose of tomb we will have one at i have made the selection have you heard any bad news sir news more hopes and lying and peace now and not eternal wretchedness pg 76 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https had you not better leave the bank mr allcraft and go home your hands are burning hot you are in high fever put up the up the shutters muttered michael more to himself than to his clerk write bankrupt on the

doors are closed to be god forbid sir why so ould you drive mad am i to have rest am i to be devoured eaten away by anxiety and trouble have you human pity are you selﬁsh the rest is it possible sir it is the truth but speak not of it i will have your life if you betray until the event tells its own tale we close the door to open it more you hear the words they are very simple words why you stare so if you could guess their meaning have dreaded have suspected it said burrage wringing his hands but it has always seemed impossible poor mr allcraft poor exclaimed michael you begin already you throw it in my teeth so soon you are in the right with the in my trample in the dust not speak unkindly to master said the old clerk you will break my heart at once if you what you have told is hard enough to bear in one day michael took the good fellow hand and answered whilst his lips quivered with grief it is enough old friend go your ways leave to myself i have told you it whilst it remains one oh what havoc what devastation go burrage your not breathe to your work the clerk went he was bid but stupiﬁed and stunned by the information he had received he took his accustomed seat at the desk and placed large ledger before him he was occupied with one triﬂing account half the day and did not ﬁnish it at last simple sum of compound addition puzzled the man who an hour before could have gone through the whole of the arithmetic in his sleep oh boasted intellect of man how little is it thou canst when the delicate and feeling heart is out of tune how impotent thou art how like rudderless ship upon stormy sea poor burrage was helpless and adrift and michael sat hours together alone in his little room he was literally afraid to creep out of it he struggled to keep his mind steadily and composedly ﬁxed upon the fate that awaited fate which he had marked out himself and resolved not to escape he forced himself to regard the great enemy of man his best only comforter and refuge but just when he deemed himself well armed least vulnerable and most secure the awful reality of horrible corruption rottenness decay and its still more awful and obscure uncertainties started suddenly before him and sent sickening chill through every pore of his unnerved ﬂesh then he retreated from his d it were life and dared not look behind pg 77 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https terrible was the sight of his grim adversary he leaped from his chair if unable to sit there and whilst he paced the room he drew his breath though he needed air heart throbbed and his brain grew tight and hot within his skull the ﬁt passing away michael hastened to revie w the last few years of his existence and to bribe himself to quietness and resignation by contrasting the hateful life which he had spent with the desirable repose offered to him in the grave and by degrees the agitation ceased alarm subsided and the deluded man was once more cozened into hardened and unnatural tranquillity in this way ﬂew the train of feeling succeeding to another until the spirit of the man gave in and would be moved longer at last the unhappy banker grew sullen and silent he ceased to sigh and groan and weep his brain refused to think he drew his seat to the window of the room which permitted him unperceived to observe the movements in the folding his arms he looked doggedly on and clenched his teeth and frowned he saw the fortunate few who came money and received the unfortunate many who brought their left and lost it he was indifferent to all he the spirits fair may be supposed to look upon the earth moment before the sweeping pestilence that comes to thin life vigorous and active in that house of business whose latest hour had knell was already sounding but it moved him not he heard men speak his name in tones of kindness whose lips on the morrow would deal out curses he saw others hat in hand begging an audience who would avoid him with sneer and scorning when he passed them in the street he looked upon his own servants who could not ﬂatter their master too highly and would be the ﬁrst to cry him down and rail against his unpardonable extravagance and recklessness but he heeded nothing his mind had suspended its operations whilst his physical eye stared upon vacancy it was very strange he continued in this fashion long time and suddenly sensibility seemed restored to him an ashy paleness came over eyelid trembled and his lips were drawn down convulsively if through strong and heavy grief he rose instantly rushed to the bell and rang it violently burrage came to answer it monster exclaimed his master gazing at him spitefully have you feeling left within you how could you it what sir rob that poor old man plunder and kill that hoary unoffending creature why did you take his miserable earnings why did you rob his little ones why clutch the bread from his starving grandchildren he will die of broken heart and will plead against at the why was that old man money taken we must take all or nothing sir you forbade to speak syllable yes but could you not have given him look one merciful look to save his life and my soul from everlasting ruin you might you could have done it but you conspire to overthrow mark not word if you hope to live the poor clerk held up his hands shook them piteously sighed and went his way again it was six in the evening and every soul connected with the bank excep t michael and burrage had left it they were both in the private room which the former had not quitted during the day michael was writing letter the clerk was standing mournfully at his side when the note was ﬁnished directed and sealed allcraft turned to his old friend and i shall not sleep at home burrage i have business which must be seen to indeed sir you had better go home you are very unwell pg 78 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https silence once more i tell you burrage it can not be this business must not be neglected i have written to mrs allcraft explaining the reason of my absence you will yourself deliver the letter to her with your own hands burrage you hear yes sir faltered burrage wishing himself deaf very well i have more to say sir said the man walking slowly of stay burrage you are true old oldest give your hand i have spoken harshly and cruelly not think ill of my temper has been soured by the troubles of life you give my you not the old man did not answer he could not he held the hand of his master tightly in his own he drew it to his lips and kissed it and then ashamed not of the act but of his unmanly tears he walked slowly to the door and quitted the head bending to the earth whence it never again was raised two hours later michael was many miles away he had followed to his humble home the aged man who had that morning paid his substance into the bank much he had to answer michael could not bear to carry about with him the knowledge that he had ruined and destroyed the labourer why and how it was that he felt so acutely the stranger and selected him from the hundreds who were beggared by his failure it is impossible to guess it is certain that he restored every sixpence that had been deposited in the morning and could not die until he had done so where allcraft passed the night was never known he was punctual to his appointment on the following morning and so was mr bellamy it is due to the latter to state that at the latest moment he was willing far in him lay to settle the difference without proceeding to extreme measures all that man could offer who did not wish to be suspected of rank cowardice he offered without reservation but allcraft was inexorable he repeated his insult on the ﬁeld and there was nothing to be done but to make him accountable his words at the

brilliant rising sun on their plumes and arms the sound of their trumpets and bands was heard from time to time enriched by the distance and coming on the fresh morning breeze with something of its freshness to the ear and the mind the troops now passing under the knoll on which the commander and his staff had taken their stand were the main body and were austrian battalions superbly uniformed and covered with military decorations the fruits of the late turkish campaigns and the picked troops of an empire of thirty millions of men nothing could be more brilliant novel or picturesque than

letter was handed round our circle in succession and seemed equally beyond comprehension to us all we had yet to learn the temperament of capit al where every produced total change of the popular mind the letter fantastically expressed it was conveyed the true condition of the hour the picture was true but the countenance changed every moment he might well have given the colours of cloud i had now entered on course of adventure the most exciting of all others and at the most exciting time of life but all the world round was in state of excitement every nation of europe was throwing open its armoury and preparing its weapons the ﬁeld the troops invading france were palpab ly more than the advanced guards of prussia and austria even with all my inexperience i foresaw that the war would differ from all the past that it would be not war of tactics but war of opinion that not armies but the people marshalled into hosts would be ultimately the deciders of the victory and that on whichever side the popular feeling was more serious persevering and intense there the triumph would be gained i must still confess however in disparagement to my military sagacity that i was totally unprepared the gallant resistance of the french recruits what can they without ofﬁcers thousand of whom had been noblesse and were now emigrants what can they without commissariat what can they without pay and who is to pay them in bankrupt nation those were the constant topics at headquarters we were marching to an assured victory france was at an end we should remodel the government and teach the sans culottes the hazard of trying the trade of politicians there was but one man in the camp who did not coincide in those glittering visions let once more justice to prince whose character has been affected by the caprices of fortune the duke of brunswick language to we saw the tricolor waving on the walls of longwy the ﬁrst fortress which lay in our road sir your court must not be deceived we shall probably take the town and defeat its wavering army but up to this moment we have not been joined by single peasant the population are against us this is not german war it is more like yours in america i have but one hundred and twenty thousand men against millions to my remark that there might be large body of concealed loyalty in france which only waited the advance of the allies to declare itself his calm and grave reply was that i must not suffer my government to suppose him capable of abandoning the royal cause while there was hope in military means that it was his determination to hazard all things rather than chill the coalition but this let impress upon your ministry said he with his powerful eye turned full on that if intrigue in the german cabinets or tardiness on the part of yours shall be suffered to impede my progress all is at an end i know the french if we pause they will pour on if we not reach paris we must prepare to defend berlin and vienna if the war is not ended within month it may last those twenty years the commander was true to his word he lost time before night our batteries were in full play upon the bastions of longwy and our tents had not yet overtaken us i lay down under vineyard shed in circle of the staff with our cloaks our pillows listening to the roar of our artillery until it mingled with my dreams pg 84 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https were on horse an hour before daybreak and the cannonade still continued heavy it was actively returned and the rampart s were circuit of ﬁre spectacle nothing could be more vivid striking and full of interest to wait the slow approaches of formal siege was out of the question intelligence had reached us that the scattered french armies having now ascertained the point at which the burst over the frontier was to be made had been suddenly combined and had taken strong position directly in our way to the capital protracted siege would raise the country in our rear and thus placed between two ﬁres the grand army might ﬁnd itself paralysed at the ﬁrst step of the campaign the place must be battered until breach was made and stormed la turque our anxiety during the day was indescribable with our telescopes constantly in our hands we watched the effect of every new dischar ge we galloped from hill to hill with the impatience of men in actual combat and every eye and tongue was busy in calculating the distances the power of guns and the time which the crumbling works would take to ﬁll up the ditch the reports of the engineers towards evening announced that practicable breach was made and three battalions of austrian grenadiers and many of prussians were ordered under arms the assault to make this gallant enterprize more conspicuous the whole army was formed in columns and marched to the heights which commanded view of the fortress the ﬁre from the batte ries now became continued roar and the guns of longwy whose ﬁre had slackened during the day answered them with an equal thunder the space between was soon covered with smoke and when the battalions of grenadiers moved down the hillside and plunged into the valley they looked like masses of men disappearing into the depths of ocean the anxiety now grew intense i hardly breathed and yet i had mingled sensation of delight eagerness and yet of uncertainty to which nothing that i had ever felt before was comparable i longed to follow those brave men to the assault and probably would have made some such extravagant blunder but seeing varnhorst broad visage turned on with look of that quiet humour which of all things on earth soonest brings man to his senses my good friend said he however ﬁne this affair may be live in hope of seeing something ﬁner never be shot at longwy when you may have chance of scaling the walls of paris i have made vow never to be hanged in the beginning of revolution nor to be shot in the beginning of war but come the duke is beckoning to us let us follow him we saw the general and his staff gallopi ng from the ground where he had rema ined from the beginning of the assault to height still more exposed and where the guns from the fortress were tearing up the soil from this spot large body of troops were seen rushing from the gate of the fortress and plunging into the valley the result of this powerful sortie was soon heard every thing was invisible under the thick cloud which grew thicker every moment in the volleys of musketry and the shouts of the troops on both sides varnhorst now received an order from the chief of the staff which produced its effect in the rush of squadron of prussian cavalry on the ﬂank of the enemy column in few minutes it was broken and we saw its wrecks swept along the side of the hill an universal shout was sent up from the army and our next sight was the ascent of the austrian and prussian standards gradually rising through the smoke and making their way towards the glacis they had reached the foot of the breach when the ﬁre of the town suddenly ceased white ﬂag waved on the rampart and the drums of the garrison beat the chamade longwy had surrendered all now was triumph and congratulation we ﬂocked round the duke and hailed his ﬁrst conquest promise of perpetual success he was in high spirits at an achievement which was so important to the national impression of his talents and resources the sortie of the garrison had given the capture an éclât which could not have been obtained by the mere surrender of strong place but the most important point of all was the surrender before the assault the sight of our troops is enough was the universal conclusion if the fortiﬁed barrier of france can not resist what will be done by troops raw peasants and ofﬁcers raw their troops the capitulation was matter of half an hour and by nightfall i followed the duke and his escort into the town it was illuminated by order of the conquerors and wheth er bongrè or malgrè it looked showy we had gazers in abundance the dashing staff caracoled their way through the streets i observed however that we had acclamations to have pg 85 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https us might be hazardous experiment while so many hulans were galloping through the grande rue but we got smiles in the midst of the crowd i met varnhorst steering his charger with small difﬁculty and carrying packet of notes in his hand go to your quarters and dress said my friend you will have busy night of it the duke has invited the french commandant and his ofﬁcers to dine with him and we are to have ball and suppe r afterwards the ladies lose time he left wondering at the new world into which i had fallen and strongly doubting that he would be able to ﬁll up his but i was mistaken the dinner was handsomely attended and the ball more handsome ly still fortune la guerre reconciled the gallant captains of the garrison to the change and they fully enjoyed the contras t between night on the ramparts and the hours spent at the prussian generalissimo splendidly furnished table the ball which followed exhibited crowd of the belles of longwy all happy dress and dancing could make them it was charming episode in the sullen history of campaigning and before i ﬂung myself on the embroidered sofa of the mayor where my billet had been given the night i was on terms of eternal friendship with whole group of classic psyches and cleopatras but neither love nor luxury neither the smiles of that fair champagnaises nor the delight of treading on the tesselated ﬂoors and feasting on the richness of municipal tables could now detain us we were in our saddles by daybreak and with horses that outstripped the wind with hearts light air and with prospects of endless victory and orders and honours innumerable before us we galloped along preceded surrou nded and followed by the most showy squadrons that ever wore lace and feathers the delight of this period was indescribable it was to new birth of faculties that resembled new sense of being buoyant and elastic lightness of feelings and frame the pure air the perpetual change of scene the novelty of the landscape the restless and vivid variety of events and those too of the most powerful and comprehensive nature the superb display of the ﬁnest army that the continent had sent to war the last hundred years and all this excitement and enjoyment with an unrivaled vista of matchless conquest in the horizon triumphal march through the provinces to be consummated by the peace of europe in paris ﬁlled even my vexed and wearied spirit with new life if i am right in my theory that the mind reaches stages of its growth with much distinctness the frame this was one of them i was conscious from this time of more matured view of human being of clearer knowledge of its impulses of more vigorous ﬁrm and enlar ged capacity dealing with the real concerns of life i still loved and strange hopeless and bewildering that passion was in the breast of one who seemed destined to all the diversities of remained without relief or relaxation through all it was the vein of gold or perhaps the stream of ﬁre beneath the soil inaccessible to the power of change on the surface but that surface under going every impulse and inﬂuence of art and nature the army now advanced unopposed still we received neither cheers nor reinforcements from the population yet we had now begun to be careless on the topic the intelligence from paris was favourable in all the leading points the king was resuming his popularity though still prisoner the jacobins were exhibiting signs of terror though still masters of every thing the recruits were running away though the decree the general rising of the country was arming the people in short the news was exactly of that checkered order which was calculated to put us all in the highest spirits the submission of paris at least until we were its conquerors would have deprived us of triumph on the spot and the proclamation of general peace would have been received the command general mourning the duke was in the highest animation and he talked to every one round him we marched along with more than condes cension he was easy familiar and ﬂushed with approaching victory we have now said he broken through the barrier the pride of vauban and the boast of france these hundred years verdun will fall the commandant of thionville in desperation at the certainty of our taking the town by assault has shot himself and the keys are on their way to nothing but villages now pg 86 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https in our road and once past those heights and he pointed to range of woody hills on the far horizon and we shall send our light troops en promenade to paris we all responded in our various ways of congratulation apropos said the duke applying to marston you have been later on the spot than any of us what can you tell of this dumourier who i see from my letters is appointed to the forlorn hope of command of the broken armies of lafayette and luckner my answer was brieﬂy hope that the new general would be much overma tched by the duke fortunes in the ﬁeld he had been by party in the capital still he seemed to clever and even remarkable man however inexperienced soldier if he is the ofﬁcer of that name who served in the last french war he is an old acquaintance of mine observed the duke i remember him perfectly he was mere boy who in rash skirmish with some of our hussars was wounded severely and taken prisoner but i learned that he was the son of french literateur of some eminence whom i had met in paris and i had conceived favourable opinion of the young soldier gallantry i gave him his parole and sent him back to his family who i think were provencals he was unquestionably spirited and intelligent and with experience might make either minister or general but he has begun by failure in the one capacity it will be our business to show him that he may ﬁnd success equally difﬁcult in another at all events we have nothing but this minister between us and he has taken up position on the argonne ridge in our front to force it will be but an affair of three hours adieu gentlemen he put spurs to his horse and galloped to one of the columns which approached with trumpets sounding bearing the captured banner of the church tower of longwy the world was now before us and we enjoyed it to the full varnhorst and i were inseparable and feasted on the scene the gaiety the oddity of the various characters which campaigning developes more than any mode of existence the simple meal the under tree the songs of our troopers the dance in the villages soon the peasantry had discovered that we did not eat women and even the consciousness of life wholly without care formed delicious state of being if this is the life of the arab i often was ready to exclaim what folly would it be in him to leave the wilderness if the esquimaux can sleep through one half of the year and revel through the other is he not the true philosopher in the midst of his frost and snow guiscard who sometimes joined our party was now and then moved to smile at our unripe conceptions of the nature of things but we laughed at his gravity and he returned to pore over the mysteries of that diplomacy which evidently thickened on him hour by hour i recollect however one of his expressio my friend you think that all the battle is to be fought in front i can assure you that much more severe battle is to be fought in the rear argonne will be much more easily mastered than the king closet and the aulic council we had good reason to remember the oracle one morning with half dozen hussars i was ranging the thickets on the ﬂank of the advance with the spirit of an english on reaching the summit of rising ground i saw some miles off party of horsemen making their way at full speed across the country the perfect level of the plains particularly in champagne makes the ground open i called my hussars and we galloped forward to intercept on seeing us they slackened their speed and were evidently in consultation at length the sight of our uniforms reassured then and one of their number came forward to meet us to our enquiry the answer was that general lafayette desired to be led to the headquarters i now saw this memorable man the ﬁrst time and was busy in my usual style in looking the hero or the revolutionist in his physiognomy i was disappointed in both i saw quiet visage and ﬁgure of moderate size rather embonpoint and altogether the reverse of that and cassius which i had pictured in my imagination but his manners perplexed much his pg 87 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https they were calm easy and almost frank it was impossible to recognize in him the frenchman except by his language and he was the last man in whom i could ever have detected that pride of the theatre the french marquis his manners were english and i had him even in our short ride to the camp and congratulated myself on being thrown into the intercourse of one who had played so conspicuous part in the most conspicuous scene of our day but on his introduction to the duke my ardour received sudden chill i saw instantly by the utter absence of all cordiality in his reception that the french fugitive had taken dangerous step and that his parisian ill fortune had deprived his retreat of all merit in the sight of the commander my doubts were soon conﬁrmed by message from his tent i obeyed and i passed the lines saw lafayette surrounded by troop of hulans of the guard i found the duke pacing uneasily in front of the tent marston said he with vexed manner your capture of this morning has added to our perplexities you acted zealously and with the spirit that distinguishes your nation but i heartily wish that la fayette had taken any other direction than towards us his fall has been contemplated some time and even the possibility of his being arrested by some of our parties i have received communication from the allied cabinets on the contingency and the question now is how to execute my order without public weakness or personal severity i proposed to accompany him while we were on the march and to pledge myself his honour when we arrived at quarters generously offered was the reply but my duty in the ﬁrst instance prohibits his remaining in the camp and in the next my feelings himself would spare man who has commanded the enemy troops the sight of that actual collision which must immediately take place we attack the deﬁles of the argonne he entered the tent wrote few lines and returned to lafayette must consider himself prisoner but my wish is to treat him with honour i must beg of you marston to take charge of him the time your offer has relieved from an embarrassment and i shall take care to make honourable mention of your conduct in this instance in all others to both the courts of berlin and st james the marquis must be sent to berlin and i must request that you will be ready to set out with him this evening the sound was thunder this evening when the decisive action of the war was to be fought next morning to berlin when all my gallant friends were to be on the march to paris impossible i retracted my offer at once but the prince not accustomed to be resisted held his purpose ﬁrmly representing that the french general was actually my prisoner and my court was equally interested with those of the allied powers in preventing his return to embroil france it was my duty her commissioner to see that the measure was effectively performed but the appearance of leaving the army on the very eve of important service was not to be argued or even commanded away the duke was equally inﬂexible though his sentences were perhaps shorter than mine and i ﬁnally left his presence declaring that if the request were persi sted in i should throw up my commission at once volunteer common trooper into the ﬁrst squadron which would admit and then his highness might of course order wherever he pleased stately smile was the answer to this tirade i bowed and retired within hundred yards i met my two friends varnhorst and guiscard and poured out my whole catalogue of wrongs at once varnhorst shared my indignation ﬁercely pulled his thick mustaches and muttered some phrases about oppression martinetism and other dangerous topics which fortunately were scattered on the air guiscard neither raged nor pg 88 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https but walked into the ducal tent after few minutes he returned and then his sallow countenance wore smile you have offended the duke desperately said he and sovereign prince i dare say that banishment from his territories life would be the least reparation but general we think that we can not have too many good troops and your proposal to take hulan lance and pistol in your hand is irresistible in short he receives you volunteer into his own hussars and you are henceforth at his disposal he orders tormentor here made malicious pause which threw into fever i gazed on his countenance to anticipate his mission it wore the same deep and moveless expression his highness orders that you shall escort with squadron general lafayette to the chateau our former headquarters and where we ﬁrst met there deliver over the frenchman to an ofﬁcer of the staff who will be in readiness to escort him further and in the mean time if the very ﬁery and independent marsto n should have objection to travel at night he may return and be in time whateve r is to be done here bravo bravo exclaimed varnhorst guiscard you are the ﬁrst of negotiators was the quiet reply i pretend to nothing more than the art of being good listener i merely waited until the duke had spok en his will and then interposed my sugg estion it was adopted at once and now our young friend has only to ride hard and come to shade his brow with share of any laurels which we may pluck in the forest of argonne in the next hours i was communication was made in the most courteous mann er to the marquis he had at once perceived the difﬁculties of his position and was glad to leave them behind far possible our escort was mounted within few minutes and we were in full gallop over the fruitful levels of champagne to speed of this order time and space were of little importance and with the rapidity of ﬂock of falcons we reached the foot of the noble hill on which embosomed in the most famous vineyards of the vine country stood the chateau it was blazing with lights and had evidently lost nothing of its population by the change of headquarters we were soon brought to stand by challenge in french and found that we were longer among the jovial jägers of deutchland we had fallen in with the advanced corps of the emigrant army under the command of the prince of condé here was new dilemma our prisoner was perhaps the most startling name which could have been pronounced among those and headlong men the army was composed almost wholly of the noblesse and lafayette under all his circumstances of birth sentiments and services had been the constant theme of noble indignation the champion of the american republic the leader of the parisian movem ent the commandant of the national guard the chief of the rebel army in the was terribly against him even the knowledge of his fall could not have appeased their resentment and the additional knowledge that he was within their hands might have only produced some unfortunate display of what the philosopher calls wild justice in this difﬁculty while the ofﬁcer of the patrol was on his way to the chateau to announce our coming i consulted the captain of my escort but though capital sabreur he was evidently not made to solve questions in diplomacy after various grimaces of thinking and even taking the meersham from his mouth i was thrown on my own resou rces my application to the captive general was equally fruitless it was answered with the composure of one prepared all consequences but it amounted simply just you please but time was to be lost and leaving the escort to wait till my return i rode up the hill alone and desired an interview with the ofﬁcer in command of the division fortunately i found him to be one of my gayest parisian companions now transformed into ﬁerce chevalier colonel des chasseurs bronzed like an arab and mustached like tiger but his pg 89 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https man was the same ever i communicated my purpose to him brieﬂy possible his open brow lowered and his ﬁngers instinctively began playing with the hilt of his sabre and if the rencontre could have been arranged on the old terms of man to man my gallant friend would have undoubtedly made the bearer of messa ge on the spot but i had come other objects and gradually brought him round he allowed that prisoner was something entitled to respect the request of his distinguished and valued friend marston dear to him by so many charming recollections of paris was much more and we ﬁnally arranged that the general should be conveyed unseen to an apartment in the chateau while i did him and his braves camarades the honour of sharing their supper i gave the most willing consent ride of thirty miles had given the appetite of hunter i was now introduced to new scene the room was ﬁlled with muskets and knapsacks piled against the walls and of those who sat down were private soldiers yet there was scarcely man who did not wear some knightly decoration and i heard the noblest names of france everywhere round thus extremes meet the faubour g st germains had taken the equality of the new order of things and the very ﬁrst attempt to retain an exclusive rank had brought all to the same level but it was generous graceful and gallant level all was under their privations and the fearful chances which awaited them were evidently regarded with feeling which had all the force of physical courage without its roughness i was much struck too with the remarkable appearance of the military ﬁgures round contrary to our general notions of the foreign noblesse those exhibited some of the men whom i had ever seen this was perhaps in considerable degree owing to the military life in countries where the nobility are destitute of public employment they naturally become the victims of the diseases of indolence and proﬂigacy transmit their decrepitude to their descendants and bequeath dwarﬁshness and deformity to their name but in france the young noble was destined soldiership from his cradle his education partook of the manly preparations the soldier career the discipline of the service even in peace taught him some superiority to the effeminate habits of opulence and sense of the actual claims of talents integrity and determination gave them all an importance which whatever might be the follies of an individual from time to time powerfully shaped the general character of the nobles in england the efforts political power and the distinctions of political fame preserve our nobility from relaxing into the slavery of indulgence the continual ascent of accomplished minds from the humbler ranks at once reinforces their ability and excites their emulation and if england may proudly boast of men of intellectual vigour worthy of rising to the highest rank from the humblest condition she may with not less justice boast of her favourites of fortune ﬁtted to cope with her favourites of nature among these showy and soldiers the hours passed delightfully anecdotes of every court of europe where most of them had been either tourists or envoys the piquant tales of the court of their unfortunate sovereign contemptuous of the present possessors of power and chansons gay and some us all forget the ﬂight of time among their military choruses was one which drew tears from many bold eye it was species of brief elegy to the memory of turenne whom the french soldier still regarded his tutelar genius it was said to have been written on the spot where that great leader fell reçois turenne où perdis lavie les transports soldat qui plaint et dans assis près du cef des césars dans le ciel peutêtre bellone et mars suivre en tout exauce ma prière puis ainsi remplir et ﬁnir ma carrière the application to the immediate circumstances of those brave gentlemen was painfully direct what might bring was unknown further than that they would probably pg 90 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https be engaged with their countrymen and whether successful or not they must be embarked in war against france but my intelligence that an action was expected on the next day awoke the soldier within them again the wrongs of their order the plunders of the ruling faction their hopeless expatriation if some daring effort was not made and the triumphant change from exiles to possessors and conquerors stirred them all into enthusiasm the army of the allies the enemy position the public feeling of paris and the hope of sharing in the honours of an engagement which was to sweep the revolutionary canaille before the gentlemen of france were the rapid and animating topics all were ardent all eloquent fortune was at their feet the only crime was to doubt only difﬁculty was to choose in what shape of splendid vengeance of matchless retribution and of permanent glory they should restore the tarnished lustre of the diadem and raise the insulted name of france to its ancient rank among the monarchies of the world i never heard among men so many brilliancies of many expressions of feeling full of the glowing display of what the heart of man may unconsciously retain the time when some great emotion rouses all its depths and opens them to the light of day it was to new chapter in the history of man the news which i had brought of the positions of the armies rendered an object of marked interest i was questioned on every point ﬁrst and especially of the intention of the commander with the most anxious yet most polished minuteness but on this subject my lips were comparatively sealed the state of the troops with whom they were so soon to be brought into contact became the more manageable topic on mentioning that dumourier was placed in command i received free and full communications on the subject of his qualities being the last hope of revolutionary france one had known him in his early career in the engineers another had served along with him in corsica third had met him at the court of portugal the concurring report being that he was coxcomb of the ﬁrst water showy but superﬁcial and though personally brave sure to be bewildered when he found himself the ﬁrst time working the wheels and springs of that puzzling machine an army in the ﬁeld caustic old provençal marquis with his breast glittering with the stars of whole constellation of knighthood yet who sat with the and of the rank and ﬁle upon him agreeing with all the premises stoutly denied the conclusions he is coxcomb said the old marquis well he is only the ﬁtter to command an army of upstart he has seen nothing but corsican service well he is the ﬁtter to command an army of banditti and he has been an espion of the government in portugal what better training could he have heading an army of traitors rely upon it gentlemen that you have mistaken his character if you think that he is not the very man whom the mob of paris ought to have chosen their general i merely recommend that when you go into action you should leave your watches in camp and if you charge any of their battalions look well to your purses the old soldier sally restored our gaiety but the man best acquainted with the french commander was my friend the chevalier at the head of the table it has singularly enough happened to to have met dumourier in almost every scene of his life since his return from his ﬁrst service in germany our ﬁrst meeting was in the military hospital in toulouse where he had been sent like myself to recover in his native air from the wounds of our last german campaign he was then coxcomb but clever one full of animal spirits and intoxicated with the honour of having survived the german bullets of being appointed to company and wearing croix our next meeting was in portugal our minister had adopted some romantic idea of shaking the english inﬂuence and dumourier had been sent an engineer to reconnoitre the defences of the country the word espion was not wholly applicable to his mission yet there can be doubt that the memoir published on his return was not volume of travels his services had now recommended him to the government and he was sent to corsica there again i met him my regiment formed part of the force in the island he was high on the staff our intercourse was renewed and he was regarded very expert diplomatist few years after i found him in still higher situation favourite of choiseul and managing the affairs of the polish confederation on his return to paris such was the pg 91 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https in which he stood that he was placed by the minister of war at the head of commission to reform the military code thus he has been always distinguished and has at least had experience even this slight approach to praise was evidently not popular among the circle and i could hear murmurs distinguished more with the pen than the sword diplomacy business of clerk command is another af fair mon cher chevalier said the old marquis with laugh pray after being in so many places with him were you with him in the bastile this was followed with roar i saw my friend swarthy cheek burn he started up and was about to make some ﬁerce retort when ﬁne old man general with many orders the marquis and still whiter head averted the storm by saying whether the chevalier was with dumourier in that predicament i know not but i can say that i was i was sent there the high offence of kicking page of the court down the grande escalier at versailles impertinence at the time when dumourier was sent there by the duc knowing more than the minister i assure you that i found him most agreeable gay very witty and very much determined to pass his time in the pleasantest manner imaginable but our companionship was too brief perfect union of souls said he laughing i was liberated within week while he was left behind i think the better part of year but his talents was the question down the table gentlemen said the old man my experience in life has always made judge of talents by circumstances if example i ﬁnd that man has the talent exactly ﬁtted his position i give him credit had the talent making the bastile endurable and i required other but there were times when graver topics varied our pleasantry and he exhibited very various intelligence practical experience of the chief european courts and i am sorry to say very striking contempt their politics and their politicians alike he was especially indignant at the selﬁsh perﬁdy with whic h the late king had given him up to the ignorant jealousy of the minister and looked forward to the new reign with resolute and sometimes gloomy determination to be revenged if that man is republican it is the bastile that has made him one and if he ever shall have fair opportunity of displaying his geniu s unless cannonball stops his career i should conceive him capable of producing powerful impression on europe the conversation might again have become stormy but the entrance of patrol whom vacant space at the table had been left forty or ﬁfty ﬁne tall fellows now came rushing into the room ﬂinging down shakos knapsacks and sabres and fully prepared to enjoy the good cheer provided them i heard the names of the ﬁrst families of france among those montmorencies the lamaignons the nivernois the rochefoucaults the noailles familiar household words all was again they had little adventure in scaring away corps of the rustic nation al guards who to expedite their escape had ﬂung away their arms which were brought in good prize the festivity and frolic of youth engaged in cause which conferred certain dignity even on their tours page renewed the pleasantry of the night we again had the chansons and i recollect one sung with delicious taste by handsome youth nephew of the writer the duc nivernois the duke had requested ringlet from beautiful woman she answered that she had just found grey hair among her locks and could

daughter she had some secret on her mind which utterly bafﬂed even the jew paternal sagacity letters had reached either of them from france and he almost implored to return or if that were impossible

my last breath i shall bless you poor mariamne i had at least better hopes than those her but within this billet was third it was but few lines yet at the foot of those lines was the clotilde tourville the light almost forsook my eyes my head swam if the paper had been talisman and every letter written with the pen of magic it could not have produced more powerful effect upon my hands trembled and my ears thrilled and yet it contained but few unimportant enquiry addressed to mariamne whether she could forward letter to the chateau montauban in champagne or whether her father had any correspondent in the vicinity who could send her the picture of beloved relative which in the haste of their ﬂight to england they had most reluctantly left behind the note at once threw every thing else into the background what were invasions and were kings and the slightest wish of the being who had written this billet all this i admit to be the fever of the waking illusion to which mesmerism or magic is but frivolity like all fevers it is destined to pg 94 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https away or to kill the patient yet the time what on earth is so strange or so dangerous to the delicious to the soul but after the long reverie into which i sank with the writing of clotilde in my hand i recollected that fortune had once given the power of meeting the wish es of this noble and beautiful creature the resemblance of the picture that had so much perplexed and attracted was now explained i was in the chateau montauban and i now blessed the chance which had sent to its honoured walls to hasten to the chamber where i was again to look upon the exquisite resem blance of features which till then i had thought without similar in the world was matter of instinct and winding my way through the intricacies of galleries and corridor s loaded with the baggage of the emigrant army and strewed with many gallant noble who had exchanged the down bed of his ancestral mansion the bare ﬂoor or the open bivouac i at length reached the apartment to whic h the captive general had been consigned to my utter astonishment instead of the silence which i expected under the circumstances i heard the jingling of glasses and roars of laughter was this the abode of solitude and misfortune i entered and found lafayette indeed conducting himself with the composure of personage of his rank but the other performers exhibiting totally different temperament group of polis h ofﬁcers who had formerly borne commissions in the royal service and now followed the emigrant troops had recognized lafayette and insisted on paying due honours to the noble comrade with whom they had served beyond the atlantic hamlet menace to his friend that he would teach him to drink deep ere he depart had been adopted in the amplest sense by those jovial sons of the north and healths were sent round the board with rapid circulation my entrance but slightly deranged the symposium and i was soon furnished with all the freemasonry of the feast by being called on to honour to the toast of his majesty the king of great britain my duty was now done my initiation was complete and while my eyes were ﬁxed on the portrait which still in its unharmed beauty looked beaming on the wild revel below i heard in the broken queries and interjectional panegyrics of these hyperborean heroes more of the history of lafayette than i had ever expected to reach my ears his life had been the strangest contrast to the calm countenance which i saw so tranquilly listen to its own tale it was quixotic and two hundred years ago could scarcely have escaped the pen of some french cervantes he had begun life an ofﬁcer in the french household troops in absolute boyhood at sixteen he had married at eighteen he had formed his political principles and begu n his military career by crossing the atlantic and offering his sword to the republic to meet the thousand wonderings at his conduct he exchanged the ancient motto of the lafayettes new one of his own the words why not were his answer to all and they were sufﬁcient on reaching america he asked but two favours to be suf fered to serve and to serve without pay in america he was more republican than the republicans he toiled traveled and bled with an indefatigable zeal the independence of the colonists his zeal was passion his love of liberty romance his hostility to the dominion of england an universal scorn of established power but if fantastic he was bold and if too hot the frigidity of america he was but preparing to touch france with kindred ﬁre he refused rank in the french army coupled with the condition of leaving the service of the republic and it was only on the french alliance in 1788 that he returned to paris to be received with feigned displeasure by the king and even put under arrest by the minister but to be welcomed by the praises of the true sovereign the queen feted by the court the sovereign of that sovereign and huzzaed by the mob of paris already the sovereign of them all from his military prison he emer ged colonel of the king regiment of dragoons while this narrative was

dashing revolutionist plodder over the desk ever wore more broadcloth countenance an occasional smile was the only indication of his interest in what was passing around him he evidently avoided taking share in the discussion of his transatlantic career probably from delicacy to his english auditor but when the conversation turned upon france the man came forth and he vindicated his conduct with spirit and fulness that told what he might have been when the blood of youth was added to the glow of the imagination he was now evidently exhausted by toil and dispirited by disappointment man could be more thoroughly ruined bafﬂed in theory undone in exile from his country fugitive from his overwhelmed by the hopelessness of giving constitution to france and with nothing but the dungeon before him and the crash of the guillotine behind what was to be done said lafayette france was treasury was empty proﬂigate reign of louis xv had at once wasted the wealth dried up the revenues and corrupted the energies of france ministers wrung their hands the king sent his confessor the queen the nation groaned there was but one expedie nt to call on the people in 1787 the assembly of the notables was summoned it was the ﬁrst time since the reign of henry iv france had been direct and formal despotism almost two hundred years she had seen england spread from an island into an empire she had seen america spread from colony into an empire what had been the worker of the miracle while all the despotisms remained within the boundaries ﬁxed centuries ago like vast dungeons never extending and never opening to the light and air except through the dilapidations of time i saw england and america expanding like fertile ﬁelds open to every breath of heaven and every beam of day expanding from year to year by the cheerful labour of man and every year covered with new productiveness the use of universal mankind i own that there may have been rashness in urging the great may have been dangerous disregard of the actual circumstances of the people the time and the daring hand of the philosopher may have drawn down the lightning too suddenly to be safe the patriot may have ﬂashed the blaze of his torch too strongly on eyes so long trained to the twilight of the dungeon the leader of this enterprise himself like the ﬁrst discoverer of ﬁre may have brought wrath upon his own head and be conde mned to have his vitals gnawed in lonel iness and chains but nothing shall convince lafayette that great work has not been begun the living race all nations and all posterity i could not suppress the but when will the experiment be comple when will the tree planted thus in storms take hold of the soil when will the tremendous tillage which begins by clearing with the conﬂagration and ploughing with the earthquake bring forth the harvest of peace to the people these must be the legacy to our children was the reply in grave and almost contrite tone the works of man

my impression of this remarkable man was that he had more heart than head that single idea had engrossed his faculties to the exclusion of all others that he was following phantom with the belief that it was substantial form and that like the idolaters of old who offered their children to their frowning deity he imagined that the costlier the sacriﬁce the surer it was of propitiation few men have been more misunderstood in his own day or in ours lifted to the skies an hour by popular adulation he has been sunk into obscurity ever since by historic contempt both were mistaken he was the man made the the middle term between the reign of the nobility and the reign of the populace certainl y not the man to ride on the whirlwind and direc t the storm but certainly altogether superior to the indolent luxury of the class among whom he was born glory and liberty the two highest impulses of our common nature sent him at two and twenty from the most splendid court of europe to the swamps and

unknown to the calculation of man he was whirled along by force which whirled the monarchy the church and the nation with him and sank only when france plunged after him i have honour similar career and homage similar memory but it is from those mingled characters that history derives her deepest lesson her warnings the weak her cautions the ambitious and her wisdom the wise on the retiring of the party the night my ﬁrst act was to summon the old swiss and his wife who had been left in charge of the mansion and collect from them all their feeble memories could tell clotilde but madame la maréchale was much more important personage in their old eyes than the charmante enfant whom they had dandled on their knees and who was likely to remain charmante enfant to them during their lives the chateau had been the retreat of the maréchale after the death of her husband and it was in its stately solitudes and in the woods and wilds which surrounded it many league that clotilde had acquired those accomplished tastes and that characteristic dignity and force of mind which distinguished her from the frivolity of her however elegant and attractive who had been trained in the salons of the court the green glades and fresh air of the forest had given beauty to her cheek and grace to her form and scarcely conceiving how the rouged and jewelled maréchale could have endured such an absence from the circles of the young queen and the beaux restes of the wits and beauties of the court of louis the 15th i thanked in soul the fortunate necessity which had driven her from the atmosphere of the du barris to the shades thus sacred to innocence and knowledge but the grand business of the thing was still to be done the picture was taken down at last to the great sorrow of the old servants who seemed to regard it patron saint and who declared that its presence and its presence alone could have saved the mansion in the ﬁrst instance from being burned by the patriots who generally began their reforms of the nobility by laying their chateaux in ashes and in the next from being plundered by the multitudes of whiskered savages speaking unknown tongues and came to leave france without ni pain ni vin her legitimate sons but the will of madame la maréchale was to them the laws of the medes and persians irresistible and unchangeable and with heavy hearts they dismounted the portrait and assisted in enfolding and encasing it with much the same feeling that might have been shown in paying the last honours to rightful branch of the beloved line but in the wall which the picture had covered i found small recess closed by an iron door and evidently unknown to the swiss and his old wife i might have hesitated about extending my enquiry further but time the great discoverer of all things saved my conscience with slight pressure against the lock it gave way the door ﬂew open and dropped off the hinges mass of rust and decay within was casket of larger size than that generally used jewels but my curiosity durst not go beyond the superscription which was consignment of the casket in the name of the maréchale to her banker in london whatever might be the contents it was clear that like the picture it had been left behind in the hurry of ﬂight and that to transmit it to england was fairly within my commission before our busy work was done day was glancing in through the coloured panes of the ﬁne old chamber i hurried off the swiss with my precious posse ssions to the next town in one of the baggage carts with trooper in front to prevent his search by hands still more hazardous than those of ofﬁcer and then mounting my horse and bidding brief farewell to the brave and noble fellows who were already mustering the march and envying with all their souls i set off at full speed to rejoin the army pg 97 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https all my speed the action had begun some hours before i came in sight of the ﬁeld with what pangs of heart i heard the roar of the cannon league on league while i was threading my bewildered way and spurring my tired horse through the miry paths of country alternately marsh and forest with what pantings i looked from every successive height to see even to what quarter the smoke of the ﬁring might direct with what eager vexation i questioned every hurrying peasant who either shook his moody head and refused to answer or who answered with the fright of one who expected to have his head swept off his shoulders by some of my troop i shall not now venture to tell but it was genuine torture could be felt by man at length exhausted by mortal fatigue and ready to lie down and die i made last effort would listen more to the remonstrances of the troop whose horses were sinking under them i ordered them to halt where they were pushed on alone and winding my way through forest covering the side of low but abrupt hill or rather succession of hills i suddenly burst out into the light and saw the whole battle beneath around and before it was magniﬁcent letter from lemuel gulliver to the editor the request of my friends i forward to you free translation of the proceedings of meeting of

friday last at the nag head in the borough pursuant to public advertisement in the gazette the object of the meeting was to take into consideration the present consumption of the article and to devise means its increase the celebrated horse comrade of theatre presided on the occasion the business of the meeting was opened by young racer of great promise who said it was his anxious desire to protect the interests of the horse community and to promote any measure which might contribute to the increase of the consumption of oats and improve the condition of his he was not versed in political economy nor indeed economy of any kind he had heard much of demand and supply and the difﬁculty of regulating them properly but his own part he found the latter always equalled the former though he understo od such was not the case with his less fortunate brethren he warmly advocated the practice of sowing wild oats and considered that much of the decrease of consumption complained of arose from the undue encouragement given to the growth of other grain and that the horse interest would be best promoted by imposing maximum to the growth of wheat and barley according to the acreage of each particular farm hackney horse declared himself in favour of the which he understood from sir peter lawrie to mean the wooden pavement he admitted it was not pg 98 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https adapted rainy seasons but it was impossible to doubt that things went much more smoothly wherever it was establis hed and that he and the working classes whom he represented found in it considerable relief from the heavy duties daily imposed upon them he wished that some measure could be devised superseding the use of nosebags which he designated an intolerable nuisance especially during the summer months but he principally relied an improvement in condition on the prohibition of the mixture of chaff with oats which latter article he contended was unﬁt the use of horses who earned their daily food and ought to be limited to those cattle who spent an idle existence in bright chestnut horse of great power and in the parks warmly replied to the last neigher he denounced the slippery measure unworthy of horse of spirit and adding greatly to the burdens with which horses like himself were saddled he daily saw steeds of the noblest blood and most undaunted action humbled to the dust by its operation and if sir peter lawrie was to be believed it was more dreaded by the household troops than napoleon army on the ﬁeld of waterloo he yielded to horse in an anxious desire to promote the true interests of the horse community but he could not give his support to measures so unsafe merely because they enabled small and inferior section of their community to move more smoothly he reprobated in strong terms the unfeeling allusion of the last neigher to the unfortunate inmates of union whom his own part he looked upon nowise inferior to the horse himself of whose right to be present at meeting of consumers of oats he entertained serious doubts loud neighs of order order scotch horse feared that strictly speaking he was included in the same category with the horse and had right to be heard having persona l interest in the question but he trusted he might be permitted to speak the delegate of the horses of scotland who were ignorant of the houynhym language and not entitled to attend permission being granted to the surprise of the assembly he descanted with much asperity upon the gross oppression to which horses in scotland were subject their rough coats and ragged appearance plainly manifested and stated in conclusion that hope or expectation of bettering the condition of the scotch horse could be entertained until their lawful food was restored to them and scotchmen were compelled by act of parliament to abstain from the use of oatmeal and live like the rest of the civilized world several horses belonging to members of the whig administration then endeavoured to address the meeting with an evident intention of converting the proceedings into party question but they were informed by the president in the midst of loud snorting and neighing that they had not the slightest right to be present they were all undoubtedly turned out life this decision appeared to give universal satisfaction an irish horse was of opinion that the great cause of the present difﬁcul ties arose from deﬁciency in the quality and not the quantity of the article and strongly recommended the growth of irish oats in england to the surprise of the english delegates he warmly eulogized the superiority of the irish oat but it afterwards appeared upon the production of sample that he had mistaken the potatoe oat the irish oat an old english hunter next addressed the meeting and was listened to with deep attention he impressed upon the young delegates the good old adage of look before you leap and cautioned them against the delusive hope that their condition would be improved by change of measures in the course of his long life he had experienced measures of every description and had invariably found that his supplies depe nded not on the measure itself but on the hand that ﬁlled it he had ever given his willing support to his employers and served them faithfully and if they were well acquainted pg 99 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https with the secrets of the stable they would learn the fallacy of their favourite maxim of measures not men and trust the administration of their affairs to upright and steady grooms rather than those fancifu l gentlemen who were perpetually changing the rules of the stables and altering the form of the measures whereby they embarrassed the regular feeding and training of the inmates without produ cing any practical good horse imputed their want of condition to the misconduct of their leaders who he said could never be kept in the right path or made to of the work which properly belonged to them by strange fatality they were generally purblind and always shyed most fearfu lly when an opposition coach approach ed them indeed it was well known that the horses selected these duties were generally speaking vicious and unsound and not taken from the most able and powerful but from the most showy classes he then proceeded to descant upon the general wrongs of horses he congratulated the community upon the abolition of bearing reins those grievous burdens upon the necks of all horses and he trusted the time would soon arrive when the blinkers would also be taken off every thrown open and every horse his own leader several other delegates addressed the meeting and various plans were discussed but it invariably turned out upon investigation that the change would only beneﬁt the class of animals by whom it was proposed was of opinion that the true remedy lay in decreasing the amount of speed and shortening the spaces between milestones welsh pony was the abolition of tolls which he said exhausted the money intended repairs whilst some from lincolnshire proposed the encouragement of pasture land the abolition of tillage and the disuse of oats altogether the harmony of the meeting was at one period interrupted by the unfortunate use of the word blackguar d by delegate from the collieries which caused magniﬁcent charger from the royal horse guards blue to rear up and with great indignation demand if the allusion was personal but who was satisﬁed with the explanation of the president that it was applicable only in warlike sense long lean bay horse with sour head demanded similar explanation of the word job and was told it was used in working sense several resolutions drawn by two embodying the supposed grievances of the community were ﬁnally agreed upon and

open that in order to obtain power he hung out false colours to the nation that his declarations before the general election have been disregarded and falsiﬁed by his acts on attaining ofﬁce we will ever demolish all such calumnies and false pretences by going step by step through document which we made point of procuring at the time and preserving hitherto and to which we have since frequently referred on hearing uttered the slanderous charges to which we allude that document is copy of the speech which sir robert peel on the 28th june 1841 addressed formally to his constituents but virtually of course to the whole nation one of his earliest declarations was the following gentlemen i have ever professed moderate opinions on politics the principles i professed and adhered to i shall adhere to during my public life whether in opposition or in power are i believe in perfect conformity with the prevailing good sense the moderation and the intelligen ce of the great body of the people of england this was sufﬁciently distinct notice to all men especially to those of extreme opinions whether tory liberal or radical of the course of action which was to be looked from the expectant prime minister then ﬁrst he proceeded to admit the existence of manufacturing distress i admit and deplore it but i not despair i have seen distress in manufactures and in commerce before now i think the causes of the present distress are but the cloud will soon blow that the great foundations of manufacturing prosperity are not affected and i hope i shall very shortly see the day when our manufactures will once more revive and when we shall again ﬁll the place we have always of producers the markets of the world pg 105 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https its cause now let us consider the important question to how far the distress in the manufactures and commerce of the country is fairly attributable to the he proceeded to show from lord palmerston ofﬁcial statement in parliament on the 22d july 1840 that between the years 1830 and 1839 the exports had risen from the value of to and the imports from to clear proof that notwithstanding the local and temporary checks which our commerce had experienced on the whole it had gone on steadily improving and that between the two periods it had increased not much less than from two to three he then took the shipping and navigation of the country the preceding three years and in looking at them i can not help thinking that if there was any thing like an absolute decrease in trade and commerce there would also be decrease in the shipping of the country well said sir robert peel what i ﬁnd the returns showed an increase presented within the last three years from tons to tons now mark during the whole of this period the were in operation how then can they be fairly or honestly assigned the cause of the present manufacturing and commercial distress but if the were not what was the cause i see causes enough in the world well in this country why there should be manufacturing and commercial distress at the present moment irrespective and totally independent of the these 1st i fear that in the north of england an undue stimulus has been given to manufacturing industry by the accommodation system pursued by the banks i think the connexion of the manufactur er with the banks gave an undue and an improper impulse to trade in that quarter of the county and i think that in consequence of this there have been more manufactur es produced within the last two years than were necessary to supply the demand 2ndly look to the state of some of the foreign countries which took at one time the greatest quantity of our manufactures south america its ports strictly blockaded by france the united states of north america in state of nascent hostility and also labouring under distress similar to our own and arising from similar causes the facility of accommodation afforded by certain banks there gave an undue stimulus to industry this produced extravagant speculations many persons failed in consequence and trade necessarily then came to peninsula france the great kingdoms of the middle and north of egypt china had been and were in such state occasioned all interruption of our trade thither stoppage in the demand manufactured goods and correspondent depression in commerce when you put all these things together all causes mind you affecting the market your goods and then combine them with the two or three defective harvests we have had of late i ask you to answer the question whether or not they have been sufﬁcient to account the depression of manufacturing industry then came sir robert peel to the two grand and suddenly discovered panaceas of the late government recruiting the exhausted revenue and relieving the general viz cheap sugar and cheap bread 1st to foreign sugar i clearly and freely admit that those restrictions which can not be justiﬁed should be removed and that the commerce of the country should be perfectly free whenever it can possibly be so but i consider the article of sugar to be wholly exempt from the principle pg 106 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https free trade the question now is after the sacriﬁces which this country has made the suppression of the slave trade and the abolition of slavery and the glorious results that have ensued and are likely to ensue from these whether we shall run the risk of losing the beneﬁt of those sacriﬁces and tarnishing ever that glory by admitting to the britis h market sugar the produce of foreign slavery if you admit it it will come from brazil and cuba in brazil the exists in full force in cuba it is unmitigated in its extent and horrors the sugar of cuba is the ﬁnest in the world but in cuba slavery is unparalleled in its horrors i not at all overstate the fact when i say that slaves are annually landed in cuba that is the yearly importation into the island but when you take into consideration the vast numbers that perish before they leave their own coasts the still greater number that die amidst the horrors of the middle passage and the number that are lost at sea you will come to the inevitable conclusion that the number landed in but slight indication of the number shipped in africa or of the miseries and destruction that have taken place among them during their transport thither if you open the markets of england to the sugar of cuba you may depend on it that you give great stimulus to slavery and the sir robert peel then pointed out peculiar and decisive distinctions between the case of sugar and that of cotton tobacco and coffee that though all of them were the produce of slave we can not now reject the cotton of the united states without endangering to the last degree the manufacturing prosperity of the kingdom secondly of all the descriptions of slave produce sugar is the most cruelly destructive of human proportion of deaths in sugar plantation being inﬁnitely greater than on those of cotton or coffee thirdly slave grown sugar has never been admitted to consumption in this country he also assigned two great operating reasons rejecting sugar that the people of england required the great experiment of emancipation to be fairly tried and they would not think it fairly tried if at this moment when the colonies were struggling with such difﬁculties we were to open the ﬂoodgates of foreig n supply and inundate the british market with sugar the produce of adopting the very words of the whig of the board of trade mr labouchere on the 25th june the other reason was that our immense possessions in the east indies give us the means and afford us every facility acquiring sugar the produce of free labour to an illimitable extent 13 the following striking passage from the writings of the celebrated dr channing of america was quoted by sir robert peel in the speech under consideration great britain loaded with an unprecedented debt and with grinding taxation contracted new debt of hundred millions of dollars to give freedom not to englishmen but to the degraded african i know not that history records an act so disinterested so sublime in the progress of ages england naval triumphs will shrink into more and more narrow space in the records of our moral triumph will ﬁll page take care emphatically added sir robert peel that this brighter page be not sullied by the admission of slave sugar into the consumption of this our encouragement too our unnecessary encouragement of slavery and the sentiments so much foreign sugar now ii foreign corn and we beg the special attention of all parties to this portion of the manifesto of sir robert peel look at the capital invested in land and agriculture in this at the interests involved in at the arrangement that has been come to the commu tation of at your importation of corn diminishing the last ten the burdens on the land peculiar to this all these circumstances into consideration and then you will agree with mr mcculloch the great advocate of change in the that the vast importance of agriculture nearly half the population of the empir are directly or indir ectly dependent on it employment and the means of subsistence prudent statesman would pause before he gave his sanction to any measure however sound in principle or beneﬁcial to the mercantile and manufacturing classes that might endanger the prosperity of agriculture or check the rapid spread of improvement 15 pg 107 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https 14 we believe says mr mcculloch himself in another part of the pamphlet longman 1841 6th edit from which sir robert peel is quoting that land is more heavily taxed than any other species of property in the that its owners are clearly entitled to insist that duty should be laid on foreign corn when imported sufﬁcient fully to countervail the excess of burdens laid upon the land 15 speech pp 9 now the sliding scale i just here repeat the opinion which i have declared here before and also in the house of commons that i can not consent to substitute ﬁxed duty of 8s on foreign corn the present ascending and descending scale of duties i prefer the principle of the ascending and descending scale to such an amount of ﬁxed duty and when i look at the burdens to which the land of this country is subject i not consider the ﬁxed duty of 8s on corn from poland and prussia and russia where such burdens exist sufﬁcient protection it 16 16 if you disturb agriculture and divert the employment of capital from the land you may not increase your foreign that is thing to dwell under existing circumstances will assur edly reduce the home trade by reducing the means to meet the demand and thus permanently injure yourselves also 17 17 i have come to the conclusion that the existing system of an ascending and descending scale of duties should not be altered and that moreover we should much possible make ourselves independent of foreign not disturb the principle of the existing these which when you have an abundance of your own exclude altogether the foreign when the price rises in this country freely admits it 18 18 speech quoted the following remarkable language of lord melbourne on the 11th june whether the object be to have ﬁxed duty or an alteration to the ascending and descending scale i see clearly and distinctly that that object will not be carrie d without most violent causing much and deep sense of without stirring society to its foundations and leaving behind every sort of bitterness and animosity i not think the advantages to be gained by the change are worth the evils of the struggle 19 19 and sir robert peel concluded the foregoing summary of his views on the great questions then proposed to the country its decision in the following words i ask your free suf frages with this frank and explicit declaration of my opinions 20 20 on this there occur to us three 1st was this or was it not frank and explicit declaration of his opinions and 2d did it or did it not tested by the result of the general election completely satisfy blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https 3d in what respect has the subsequent conduct of sir robert peel been inconsistent with these declarations and we echo the stern enquiry of the duke of wellington the when the wher and the how of sir robert peel deceiving his supporters or the country pause reply failing to receive none can be given except in the shall proceed to condense the substanc of this memorable manifesto into few word s offer some general observations designed to assist in forming correct judgment upon the topics discussed in the ensuing pages and then give fair an outline we know how to present of the doings of sir robert peel and his government by way of comment upon and illustration of his previous and preparatory sa yings what then was the substance of sir robert peel declaration on presentin g himself before the country candidate the ofﬁce which he ﬁlls he avowed himself man of moderate political opinions recognized the existence of manufacturing and commercial distress but referred it to causes of only temporary nature unconnected with the repudiated the empirical expedients proposed by the late ministry and pledged himself to maintain the principle of protection to our agricultural interests declaring his deliberate preference of sliding scale of duties to ﬁxed duty upon foreign corn the ﬁrst of the observations to which we beg the reader earnest attention sir robert peel has to govern by means of reformed house of commons it is want of well considering this circumstance that one or two respectable sections of the conservative party have conceived some dissatisfaction at the line of policy adopted by sir robert peel they forget that we have already stated the tory party was nearly destroyed by the passing of the reform bill that from its ashes rose the conser vative party adapted to the totally new political exigencies of the times its grand object being it were out of the elements of democracy to arrest the progress of democracy the bond of its union was correctly described by its founder consisting in attachment to the fundamental institutions of the to rational changes rendered requisite by the altered circumstances of the determination to maintain on their ancient footing and foundation our great institutions in church and state keeping these grand objects ever in view the true policy to be adopted was to widen the foundations on which should stand that new party which was to draw from time to time its strength from its opponents none saw this more clearly than sir robert hence the moderation indispensable and which he prescribed to himself and recommended to all those who chose to act with him and the steady acting upon which has at length conducted them to their present splendid position of power and responsibility could the government of the country be now carried on upon principles that were even ago more than queen victoria could govern on the principles of queen elizabeth we must look at things not they were or we would wish them to they are and are likely to be he is unable to take just and comprehensive view of political affairs in this the position of parties and the tendency of the principles respectively advocated by them who does not see that the great and only contest now going on is between conservative and destructive we say we are satisﬁed that we say it in conformity with the opinions of the immense majority of persons of intelligence and the forces which would drive sir robert peel government from ofﬁce would immediately and inevitably supply their places by government which must act upon destructive principles this will not be believed by many of those who moving in the circumscribed sphere of intense party feeling can contemplate only one object return to power and disregard the intentions of the ﬁerce auxiliaries of whose services they would avail themselves to the country at large however who breathe freer air the true nature of the struggle is plain the sun at noonday the number of those who only nominally belong to parties but have very deep stake in the preservation of our national institutions and see distinctly the advantages of minister acting ﬁrmly on moderate principles and who will consequently give him silent but steady support in moments of danger is inﬁnitely larger than is suppose d by the pg 108 pg 109 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https of the conservative party such minister however must make up his account with receiving often only cold and jealous support from those of his adherents who incline to extreme opinions while his opponents will increase their zeal and animosity in proportion to their percep tion of the unobjectionableness of his measures the practical working of his moderation continuan ce in power and their own exclusion from it such minister must possess large share of fortitude careless of its exhibition and often exposing him to the charge of insensibility he moves steadily on amongst disaf fected supporters and desperate opponents mindless equally of taunts threats reproaches and misrepresentati ons he must resolve to bide his time while his measures are slowly developing themselves relying on the conscious purity of his motives such man this the country will prize and support and such man we sincerely believe that the country possesses in the present prime minister he may view therefore with perfect equanimity degree of methodized clamour and violence which would overthrow minister of different stamp such are the the consolations and that course of moderation which alone can be adopted with permanent success by conservative minister governing with reformed house of commons another observation we would offer has its object to abate the pique and vexation under which the ablest volunteer advisers of the minister are apt to suffer on his disregard of their counsels and sometimes to revenge themselves by bitter and indiscriminate censure of his general policy they should remember that while they are irresponsible volunteers he acts under tremendous responsibility to sustain which however he has advantages which none but those in his situation can possibly the of able brother ministers with all those sources and means of universal information which the constitution has placed at his disposal the superior knowledge of the circumstances of the country thus acquired enable him to see insuperable objections to schemes and suggestions which their proposers reasonably deem to be palpably just and feasible we have often thought that if sir robert peel or any other prime minister were to take one of these eager and conﬁdent advisers into his cabinet and calmly exhibit to him the actual imminent adopting the course of procedure which that adviser has been strenuously recommending he would go away with slightly increased distrust of himself and consideration the minister neither sir robert peel nor any other minister would be so arrogantly stupid to disregard free information and advice merely because it came from such persons who if they have right to expect their advice to be follow ed have yet clear right to offer it and urge it with all their force present ministers had the disadvantage in some respects of succeeding to those who if they could nothing made up it by promising every thing sir robert peel and his friends on the contrary made promises whatever beyond what would indeed be implied by acceptance of honestly to endeavour to govern the country the permanent good of the country while admitting the existence of great distress they expressly admitted also that they saw mode of sudden relief that distress but would trust to the energies of the country gradually recovering themselves under steady and cautious management sir robert peel frankly stated in the house of commons just previously to the dissolution in 1841 that he had hope of an immediate return of prosperity and that such had become the state of our domestic and foreign embarrassments that we must years expect to struggle with difﬁcu lty this was their language on the eve of the general election yet the country placed conﬁdence in their honour and capacity heartily sickened of the prodigal promises of their opponents the extravagant visionary hopes which they held forth at the eleventh hour in their frenzied eagerness to obtain majority at the last election are still gleaming brightly before the eyes of numbers of their deluded supporters imposing on the present government the painful and ungracious duty of proving to them that such hopes and expectations can not be realized even brief space without breaking up the foundations of our national existence and greatness pg 110 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https can the conservatives be expected in two years time to repair all the evils resulting from ten years gross mismanagement of the national affairs by their predecessors the evil that they did lives after them but the fortunate strength of the conservative party moreover in opposition and the patriotism and wisdom of the house of lords the late ministers would by the time of their expulsion from ofﬁce have rendered the condition of the country utterly very nearly desperate it assuredly was their vacillating inconsistent wild and extravagant conduct during these ten years had generated an universal sense of insecurity and want of conﬁdence among all the great interests of the country which locked up enterprise trade and commerce drooped daily and the revenue melted away rapidly every year great things were justly expected from the practical skill and experience possessed by the new government but time is requisite the development of policy which had and still has to contend against such numerous and formidable obstacles conﬁdence especially mercantile conﬁdence is delicate ﬂower of slow growth and very difﬁcult to rear breath may blight it it will bloom only in tranquil and temperate air if ever there was man entitled to speak however with authority upon this subject it was mr baring the late candidate and unquestionably the future member the city of man constantly engaged in vast mercantile transactions in all parts of the globe and whose ability equals his experience in the presence of great number of gentlemen representing of the wealth and intelligence of the city of london thus spoke mr baring on the 6th october 1843 i rejoice that sir robert peel did not hold out to the country the fallacious hope that by any particular measure he could restore prosperity or cure sufferings which were beyond the reach of legislation and that he patiently relied upon the resources and energies of the country to set trade and commerce right that expectation is already beginn ing to be realized that calm reliance is already justiﬁed i am speaking in the presence of those who are much if not more conversant with business than myself and they will contradict if i am not right when i say that great symptoms of improvement in the trade and industry of the country have manifested themselves which symptom s are of such nature that they not appear to be the result of momentary excitement produced by some fallacious experiment but of the paramount of commerce and of fresh in the prosperity of the empire i am asked what have the government done why they have restor ed confidence to the country they have terminated wars they have restored conﬁdence at home and commanded respect abroad now however the doings of the government and of those we shall take more detailed or extended notice than is requisite in our opinion to exhibit the general system and plan of their procedure and show its complete consistency with the declaration of opinions made by sir robert peel previous to the general election of it will be borne in mind that the then existing distress in our commercial and manufacturing interests he referred to three temporary causes undue stimulus which had been given to industry in the manufacturing the accommodation system pursued in the banks the troubled and hostile condition of almost all those foreign countries which used to be the best customers our manufactures and the two or three preceding defective harvest the ﬁrst of these was not of nature to call or perhaps admit of direct and speciﬁc legislative interference it originated in vicious system of contagious private speculation which has involved many thousands of those engaged in it in irredeemable shall we add deserved disgrace and which had better perhaps be left to work its own cure the last of the three causes was one to which all mankind is every where subject and which is in great measure beyond the reach of effective human interference before proceeding to explain the steps taken to remedy the second our distracted foreign relations let us premise brieﬂy the present that the very earliest acts of ministers showed how profoundly sensible they were of the necessity of doing something and that promptly to relieve the grievous distress under which the lower orders were suffering and at the same time afford safe effective and permanent stimulus to trade and commerce comprehensive survey of the state not only of our own but foreign commercial countries satisﬁed them practical men of the pg 111 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https difﬁculties to be here contended with the steps they took after due deliberation the proposing the new tariff and the new shall presently refer to let us now point out the measure reﬂecting inﬁnite credit upon those who had the sagacity and resolution to propose it we shall not dwell upon this great temporary measure which in one year has poured upwards of ﬁve millions into the exhausted exchequer further than to say that soon ever it was known among the monied classes that the minister environed he was with ﬁnancial difﬁculties would risk any amount of popular odium rather than add to the permanent burdens of the country or permit the ruinous continuance of an excess of expenditure over revenue soon this was evident we say the great monied interests of the kingdom recognized in sir robert peel an honest minister and gave him forthwith its complete conﬁdence which has never since been an instant withdrawn from him and how great are the obligations of that vast portion of the most suffering classes of the community whom he exempted from this extraordinary contribution to the burdens of the state but now foreign affairs may not the present ministers look with just pride towards every quarter of the globe and exclaim quæ regio in terris nostri non plena laboris in truth their success here has been sufﬁcient to set up half dozen is known to man better than lord palmerston the duke of wellington and lord aberdeen have restored peace to the whole world it on footing of digniﬁed security and equality by the persevering energy the calm determination and inexhaustible resources of lord aberdeen the winter of our discontent has been made glorious summer with all the great powers of the world look at our glorious but irritable is there any language too strong to express the delight which we feel at the renovated sympathy and af fection which exist between us we can not answer france to the extent which we can england but we know that through the length and breadth of this beloved queen familiar visit to the king of the french their affectionate greeting and her majesty enthusiastic reception by the people diffused feeling of joy and affection towards france which will not soon should it ever but would that visit have taken place if lord palmerston and not lord aberdeen had presided over the foreign councils of this country is disagreeable question and we pass on then to america thanks to the mission of lord ashburton peace has been secured between us on terms equally honourable to both we are now at peace with the united peace not to be disturbed by the to whiggish eyes promising aspect of the oregon which we tell our aforesaid friends will end at it is not by the way the fault of our government that this disputed matter was not embr aced by the washington treaty lord palmerston and his doleful ally the morning chronicle were daily stigmatizing the treaty of washington highly dishonourable and disadvant ageous to this country it may interest our readers to see what one of the disaf fected american senators had to say on the subject thus spoke in the senate mr benton member of congress the concessions of great britain to the united states are small the territory granted to the united states is of such nature that it will never be of importance to hold it while the possessions given up by the united states are important and valuable to them and have the effect of admitting foreign power within territory which was granted to the united states by the treaty of 1783 when i see the government giving up more than great britain demanded i can not conceal my amazement and mortiﬁcation glancing however from the west to the we see wars in india and china brought gloriously to an advantageous w ars to adopt the language of one of the greatest mercantile authorities living which have been deranging our money transactions and making our trade trade of hazard and speculation most injurious to the commerce of the empire at lar ge pg 112 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https on the one hand we are reliev ed from the ruinous drain upon our resources occasioned by our protracted warlike operations in india and china on the other prospect is opened to us by the immensely important treaty into which the emperor of china has entered with this country of very great and permanent commercial advantages which are already being realized let our manufacturers however beware of the danger of forfeiting these advantages by excessive eagerness to avail themselves of these newly acquired markets ago we earnestly warned them on this and we now earnestly repeat that warning notwithstanding observed an able french journalist few weeks ago upon this subject the opening of ﬁve ports to european commerce china will many years preserve her internal laws her eccentric tastes her inveterate habits china is the country of routine and immovability the treaty with great britain can not modify the nature of china in few months if the english are not prudent in their exports if they overload the newly opened ports with foreign produce they will injur themselves more than they were injur ed by the war just in every word of this we concur but alas what weight will such considerations have with the agitating manufacturers in the north of england their ﬁerce but anxiety to make rapid fortunes will make most of them in very few years melancholy evidences of the justness of our observations we can not pass from the east without noticing the sound statesmanship which is regulating all lord ellenborough leading movements in matter now universally admitted how unspeakably contemptible and ridiculous has the lapse of few months rendered the petty clamours against him with which the ministerial party commenced their last year campaign without however travelling round the entire circle of our foreign connexions and are one or two points to which we will brieﬂy refer striking instances of the vigilant and indefatigable energy and the powerful diplomatic inﬂuence of lord aberdeen especially with reference to the securing commercial advantages to this which has extorted the following testimony during the present month december from another french journal by means favourably disposed to this country the english government is incontestably the best served of all governments in the means of obtaining new and extending old markets and in the rapid and complete knowledge of the course to be adopted to ensure the sale of the immense products of great britain in different parts of the globe take instance the case of russia we have actually succeeded in wringing from the tenacious and inﬂexible cabinet of st petersbur g an important commercial advantage on lord aberdeen accession to ofﬁce he found russia in the act of aiming fatal blow at very important branch of our shipping trade by levying differential duty on all british vessels conveying to russian ports any goods which were not the produce of the british dominions after however skilful and very arduous negotiation our foreign secretary has succeeded in averting that we retain the great advantages of which we were about to be deprived nor has this signal advantage been purchased by any sacriﬁce on the part of great britain but only by permission founded on most equitable principles russian vessels arriving here from russian ports with the produce of russian poland to possess the same privileges if they had come direct from russian ports russian poland being able to communicate effectively with the sea only through the prussian territory look again at has also been recently the object of persevering and energetic negotiation on the part of lord aberdeen it is true that at present his exertions have been attended with direct success but we have doubts whether the importance of the proposed brazilian treaty has not after all been greatly exaggerated however this may be lord aberdeen is at this moment strenuously at work with the young emperor could be desired by the most eager advocate of commercial treaty with brazil but suppose the emperor advise rs should be disposed to continue their obstinate and unreasonable opposition observe the gentle pressure upon them to be felt by and by which lord aberdeen has contrived to effect by the commercial treaty which he has concluded with the contiguous republic of monte video and other states on the right bank of the river plata the admission on most favourable terms of british imports into these states one of them is the uruguay republic which borders through great extent of country on brazil the government of which is utterly unable to prevent the transfer of merchandise across the border whereby pg 113 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https exclusion of british goods from the brazilian territory is rendered matter of physical impossibility 21 great britain at the commencement of the 19th ccc it is true that our efforts to enter into commercial treaties with france and portugal have not yet been successful but formidable are the obstacles at present in existence we not despair those least wonder at the present position of affairs who are best acquainted with the artiﬁcial and comp licated positions of the respective coun tries and their relations and consequent policy towards each other whatever can be done by man is at this moment being done by lord aberdeen and sooner than we have at present right to expect his indefatigable exertions may be crowned with only in these but in other quarters all foreign governments must be strongly inﬂuenced in such matters by contemplating steady and strong government established in this country and that object they see more nearly and distinctly every day such without entering into details which would be inconsistent with either our space or our present object is the general the rapidly returning tide of prosperous commercial intercourse of the foreign policy of conservative government which has raised great britain within the short space of two years to even higher elevation among the nations of the world than she had occupied before liberal ministry undertook the governme nt of the country policy to adopt the equally strong and just language of an able writer replete with auspicious evidences of the efﬁcacy of intellect combined with ﬁrmness activity and integrity in restoring to wholesome and honourable order chaotic jumble of humiliations and fears hatred and confusion thrice trebly confounded 22 22 thoughts on tenets of ministerial policy by very quiet looker aylott london while thus successfully active abroad have ministers been either idle or unsuccessful at home let us look at their two main new tariff and the new the object of the ﬁrst of these great measures was give healthy and speedy but permanent stimulus to trade and commerce and at the same time to effect such reduction of price in the leading articles of consumption should greatly reduce the cost of boon of course inexpressibly precious to the poorer classes mark the moment at which this bold and critical line of policy was conceived and carried into moment when the nation was plunged into such depth of gloom and distress had very nearly induced utter despair when there was deﬁcien cy of ﬁve millions sterling in the revenue of the two preceding years and certainty of greatly augmented expenditure the future owing to our wars in the east and elsew here we mark this in order to appreciate display of the true genius of statesmanship foreseeing one effect of such measure namely serious reduction in the revenue derived from the customs and which would commence with the bare announcement of such measure the government had to consider whether it would prove perm anent or only temporary reduction and to act accordingly after profound consideration they satisﬁed themselves whether justly or not remains to be seen that the diminution of revenue would prove only temporary and to secure the immediate beneﬁts of the measure they imposed temporary the onerous pressure of which was to cease soon matters should have come round again that period they ﬁxed at the expiration of three years after an interval of two years their calculations appear to have been well or ill founded let us see early in march 1842 they announced the proposed new tariff instantly producing the effect on the customs duties which had been anticipated and succeeded in bringing it into operation on the 9th of the ensuing july the deﬁciency of revenue which ensued was so very serious that it would have alarmed the whole country but their conﬁdence in the ﬁrmness and sagacity of ministers particularly evidenced by their announced measures we have not at the present moment before us the earliest quarterly revenue returns of the period referred to but it will sufﬁce to state that such had been the extent of the reductions effected that the deﬁciency on the year ending on the 5th october 1843 amounted to less sum than pg 114 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https the decrease on the quarter ending on that day being still however each succeeding at least the latter more satisfactory indications of rallying revenue and we are enabled to announce the highly gratifying fact that up to the 8th of the present month december the customs duties returns are of the most decisively improving character the receipts of duties the port of london alone during that period exceeds the receipt on the corresponding period of last year by while the returns from all the outports especially from liverpool are of the same cheering character and warrant us in predicting that the returns to be presented on the 5th of the ensuing month will afford most triumphant proof of the accuracy of the minister calculations and the success of his policy be it borne in mind moreover that his realized in the year ending on the 5th october last the immense sum of far therefore concerns the direct ﬁnancial effects of the new tariff and its counterbalancing the results of sir robert peel policy are such may stagger and confound the boldest of his opponents now however the two great objects of the new tariff which were declared by sir robert peel23 to be the revival of commerce and such an improvement in the manufacturing interest would react on every other interest in the country and diminishing the prices of the articles of consumption and the cost of living 23 hansard vol lxi with respect to the ﬁrst of these objects we had prepared copious explanati on of the highly satisfactory working of one great portion of the machine of the new tariff viz the relaxation of the taxes on the raw materials of manufactur but it has occurred to us that the necessity of our doing so has been entirely superseded by the following very remarkable admission contained in number of the morning chronicle newspaper published towards the close of september last an invaluable admission tending to prove out of the mouth of the bitterest opponent of the present ministry the general success of their domestic policy notwithstanding insurrection in wales and agitation in ireland there are various circumstances in the present aspect of our national affairs of an encouraging and cheering nature the ﬁrst and most prominent thing which strikes an observer is the undoubted general reviv al of trade and commerce every thing seems to indicate that the morning is breaking that the dreary night of disaster and suffering through which all our material interests have been passing since 1836 is now over the hum of busy industry is once more heard throughout our manufacturing districts our seaports begin once more to stir with business merchants on have smiling faces and the labouring population are once more ﬁnding employment easier of access and wages are gently slowly rising this has not come upon us sudden ly it has been in operation since the end of last year but so terrible was the depression so gradual the improvement that the effects of the revival could not be perceptible till within recent period our exports of cotton and wool during the present year very considerably exceed those of similar period in the preceding and though there might be increase of export without increase of proﬁt the simple fact that the districts of our great

individual dissatisfaction and distress some of the persons thus situated angrily quitted the conservative ranks those of the opposition others position of mortiﬁed neutrality but we believe that many

has been so utterly sickened by the people calling themselves the league we not nevertheless despair of securing the attention of our readers to the few observations which we have to offer upon subject which however hackneyed is one of paramount importance we are satisﬁed that nine out of every ten even of newspaper readers turn with disgust from the columns headed league doings of the league great meet ing of the league and so forth and making every allowance the exigencies occasioned by the dearth of topics while parliament is not sitting we are exceedingly surprised that the great london newspa pers should inﬂict upon their readers so much of the slang and drivel of the gentry in question in the due prosecution of our subject we can not avoid the topic of the new even were we so disposed and we shall at once proceed to our task with two objects in vindicate the course pursued by sir robert peel and set forth brieﬂy and distinctly those truly admirable qualities of the existing which are either most imprudently misrepresented or artfully kept out of view by those who are now making such desperate efforts to overthrow it mark how plain tale shall set them down whether foreign corn should be admit ted into this country on payment of ﬂuctuating duties or ﬁxed duty or free of all duties are obviously questions of the highest importance involving extensive and complicated considerations sir robert peel lord john russell and the persons banded together under the name of the league may be taken representing the classes of opinion which would respectively answer these three questions in the afﬁrmative all of them appealed to the nation at large on the last general election the form in which the question was proposed to the country it fell to the lot of the advocates of ﬁxed duty to prescribe and they shaped it thus in the queen speech it will be you to determine whethe r the not aggravate the natural ﬂuctuations of supply whether they not embarrass trade derange currency and by their operation diminish the comforts and increase the privations of the great body of the community to this question the country returned deliberate and peremptory answer in the nega expressing thereby its will that the existing system which admi ts foreign corn on payment of ﬂuctuating duties should continue the country thus adopted the opinions of sir robert peel rejected those of lord john russell and utterly scouted those of the league in spite of all their frantic exertions we believe that this deliberate decisio n of the nation is that to which it will come whenever again appealed to and is supported by reasons of cogency the nation is thoroughly aware of the immense impor tance of upholding and protecting the agriculture of the country and that to secure this grand object it is necessary to admit foreign corn into the country only when our deﬁciencies absolutely require it that in the operation of the of duties and the exact distinction between its effect and that of the proposed ﬁxed duty is demonstrably this that the former would admit foreign corn in dear years excluding it in seasons of abundance while the latter would admit foreign pg 117 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https in seasons of abundance and exclude it in dear years our present concern however is with the course taken by the present government have they hitherto yielded to the clamour with which they have been assailed and departed from the principle of affording efﬁcient protection to the agriculture of the country not hair breadth nor will they we have seen that sir robert peel previously to the general election declared his determination to adhere to the existing system of regulating the admission of foreign corn by the power of the of duties but both he and the leading members of his party had distinctly stated in parliament just before its dissolution that while resolved to adhere to the principle of they would not pledge themselves to adhere to all the details of that scale and they said well and wisely there were grave objections to some of those details these objections they have removed and inﬁnitely added to the efﬁciency of the but in removing the principal objections they stirred hornet rendered furious host of sleek gamblers in grain who found their occupation gone suddenly on the other hand the government conferred great substantial beneﬁt upon the country by securing just balance between protection to the britis h corn consumer and producer removi ng at the same time from the latter source of jealousy and prejudice few words will sufﬁce to explain the general scope of those alterations under they system established by statute 9 geo iv 60 in the year 1828 the duty on foreign corn up to the price of 68s per quarter was so high and declined so very slowly 5s 4s 3s 2s 1s 0s 18s to amount to virtual prohibition against importation but when the price mounted from 68s to 72s per quarter the duty declined with such great rapidity 16s 13s 10s 6s 2s to occasion the alarming and frequently recurring evils of glut and panic now the following was the mode in which these serious defects in the law of 1828 were taken advantage of by the aforesaid desperat and greedy rogues in grain who are utterly prostrated by the new system they entered into combination the purpose of raising the apparent average price of corn and forcing it up to the point at which they could import vast quantities of foreign corn at little or duty thus the price of corn was rising in people were turned with execration against those into whose pockets the high prices were supposed to go the poor farmers whereas those high prices really were all the while ﬂowing silently but rapidly into the pockets of the aforesaid rogues in grain gamblers of the corn exchange effected their salutary alterations by statute 5 and 6 vict 14 in the following manner substituted the former duties of 10s 8d per quarter when the price of corn was 70s per quarter and 1s when the price was 73s duty of 4s when the price of corn is 70s per quarter and made the duty fall gradually shilling by shilling with the rise of price to and 1s thus are at one blow destroyed all the inducements formerly existing to hold their foreign corn in the hopes of forcing up the price of corn to the low duty every inducement being now given them to sell and none to speculate another important provision preventing fraudulent combinations to raise the price of corn was that of greatly extending the averages and placing them under regulations of salutary stringency so far then from evincing disposition to triﬂe with or surrender the principle of the the government have with inﬁnite pains and skill applied themselves to effect such improvements in it will secure its permanency and better appreciation of its value by the country at large with every additional year experience of its admirable qualities there is perfect identity of principle both working to the same good end between the existing and the new tariff their combined effect is to oppose every barrier that human wisdom and foresight can devise against dearth and famine in england securing an abundant supply of corn and meat from abroad whenever our own supply is deﬁcient but up to that point protecting our home producers whose direct interest it will henceforth be to supply us at fair and moderate prices it is the cunning policy of the heterogeneous opponents of the existing to speak of them doomed by sort of universal tacit consent to familiarise the public with the notion that the recent remodeling of the system is to be regarded constituting it into nothing more than sort of towards great fundamental pg 118 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol

have the deepest stake in its total repeal of the thinking man believes that there is the remotest prospect of such thing but many imag ine that ﬁxed duty would be great change the better and safe sort of compromise between the two extreme parties can any thing be more fallacious we hesitate not to express our opinion that the idea of main taining ﬁxed duty on corn is an utter absurdity and that lord john russell and his friends know it to be so and are guilty of political dishonesty in making such proposal they affect to be friends of the agricultural interest and satisﬁed of the necessity protection to that body and yet they acknowledge that their ﬁxity of duty is of precisely the same nature the ﬁnality of the reform bill last only till the ﬁrst pressure shall call an order in council does any one in his senses believe that any minister could abide by ﬁxed duty with corn at the price of with starving and therefore an agitating and rebellious population ﬁxed duty under all times and circumstances is glaring impossibility and besides is it not certain that the period the issue of an order in council will be grand object of speculation to the corn importer and that he will hoard and create distress merely to force out that order and the issuing of that order would depend entirely on the strength or the necessity of the minister on his squeezableness anxiety popularity does the experience of the last ten years justify the country in placing conﬁdenc on such point in whig ministry in every point of view the project of ﬁxed duty is exposed to insuperable objections it is plain that on the very ﬁrst instant of there being pressure upon the ﬁxed duty it must give way and ever once off it is gone ever it can never be again what is to govern the amount at which it is to be ﬁxed must it be the additional burden on land or the price at which foreign countries with their increased facilities of transport and improved cultivation of their soil would be able to deliver it in the british markets what data have we in either case on which to decide let it however always be borne in mind by those who are apt too easily to entertain the question to either ﬁxed duty or total repeal of duty that the advantag es predicted by the respective advocates of those measures are mere assumptions we have experience by which to try the question the doctrines of free trade are of very recent growth the data on which its laws are founded are few and also uncertain and does any one out of bedlam imagine that any minister of this country would consent to run such tremendous try such experiments upon an article of such immense importance to its let us never lose sight of lord melbourne memorable words whether the object be to have ﬁxed duty or an alteration to the ascending and descending scale i see clearly and distinctly that the object will not be carried without most violent causing much blood and deep sense of stirring society to its

ridiculous compromise suppose they effected their avowed object of total repeal of the any one weak enough to imagine that they would then dissolve nor they now dream of such thing but are at the present moment we are informed fraternizing with other political societies of very dangerous character and on the eve of originating serious and revolutionary movements their present organization is precisely that of the french jacobins their plan of operation the same let any one turn to the league circular of the 18th november and he will see announced plan of action on the part of this association precisely analagous in all its leading features to that of the french jacobins and we would call the attention of the legislature to the question whether the league in its most recent form of organization and plan of action be not clearly within the provisions of statutes 57 geo 19 25 and 39 geo 79 what steps if any the legislature may take is one thing it is quite another what course shall be adopted by the friend s of the conservative supporters of the british constitution it is impossible to assign limits to the mischief which may be effected by the indefatigable and systematic exertions of the league to diffuse pernicious misrepresentations and artful and popular fallacies among all classes of society that they entertain fearfully envenom ed hatred of the agricultural interest is clear and their evident object is to render the landed proprietors of this country objects of ﬁerce hatred to the inferior orders of the community if man tells his story every morning of my life by the year end he will be my master said burke and i shall believe him however untrue and improbable his story may be and if whilst the league can display such perseverance determination and system its opponents obstinately remain supine and silent can any one wonder if such progress be not made by the league in their demoralizing and revolutionary enterprize that it will soon be too late to attempt even to arrest if this journal has earned during quarter of century career of unwavering consistency and independence any title to the respect of the conservative party we desire now to rely upon that title the purpose of adding weight to our solemn protest against the want of union and the apathy from whatever cause now but too visible in vain we and others exert ourselves to the uttermost to diffuse sound political principles by means of the press in vain the distinguished leaders of our party ﬁght the battles of the constitution with consummate skill and energy in their exertions be not supported by corresponding energy and activity on the part of the conservative constituencies and those persons of talent and inﬂuence professing the same principles by whom they can and ought to be easily set in motion it is true that persons of liberal education of high and generous tone of feeling of intellectual reﬁnement are entitled to treat such men cobden bright and acland with profound contempt and dislike the notion of personal contact or collision with them representatives of the foulest state of ill feeling that can be generated in the worst pg 126 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https sordid avari ce selﬁshness envy and malignity but they are up and doing and steadily applying themselves with palatable topics to the corruption of the hearts of the working classes so unless the persons to whom we allude choose to cast aside their morbid be up and at them in the language of the duke of then will be veriﬁed the observation of if when bad men combine the good not associate they will fall one by unpitied sacriﬁce in contemptible struggle vast are our forces they can effect comparatively nothing without union energy and system with these their power is tremendous and irresistible what we would say therefore organize organize let every existing conservative club or association be stirred up into increased action and put into real working trim forthwith and where none such clubs or associations exist let them be immediately formed and set into cheerful and spirited motion let them all be placed under the vigilant superintendence of one or two real men of business local knowledge of ability and inﬂuence we would point out conservative solicitors auxiliaries of inﬁnite value to those engaged in the good cause men of high character of business habits extensive acquaintance with the character and circumstances of the capable of bringing legitimate inﬂuence to bear upon them in far more direct and effective manner than any other class of persons one such young and active solicitor with moderate salary permanent secretary in order to secure and in some measure requite his services throughout the be worth ﬁfty dilletante friends of the good cause dropping in every now and then but whose friendship evap orates in mere talk let every local conservative newspaper receive constant and substantial patronage they are worthy of the very highest consideration on account of the ability with which they are generally conducted and their great inﬂuence upon local society many of them to our own knowledge display degree of talent and knowledge which would honour to the very highest metropolitan journals let them then be vigorously supported their circulation extended through the inﬂuence of the resident nobility and gentry and the clergy of every particular district throughout the kingdom let opportunity be missed of exposing the true character of the vile and selﬁsh agitators of the league let not the league have all the publishing to themselves but let their impudent fallacies and falsehoods be instantly encountered and exposed on the spot by means of small and cheap tracts and pamphlets which shall bring plain wholesome and import ant truths home to the businesses and bosoms of the very humblest in the land again let the resident gentry seek frequent opportunities of mingling with their humbler neighbours friends and dependents by way of keeping up cordial and hearty good understanding with them so to rely upon their effective whenever occasions may arise political action let all this be done and we may defy hundred leagues let these objects be kept constantly in view and the league will be utterly palsied had it hundred times its present thousand times its present members let us now however turn brief space to ireland the present condition of which we contemplate with profound concern and anxiety but with neither surprise nor dismay far regards the government the state of affairs in ireland bears at this moment unquestionable testimony to the stability and strength of the government and one know this better than the gigantic impostor to whom so much of the misery of that afﬂicted portion of the empire is owing he perceives with inexpressible mortiﬁcation that neither he nor his present position awake any sympathy or excitement whatever in the kingdom at large where the enormity of his misconduct is fully appreciated and every movement of the government against him sanctioned by public opinion the general feeling is one of profound disgust towards him sympathy and commiseration his dupes and of perfect conﬁdence that the government will deal ﬁrmly and wisely with both repeal of the union pshaw every child knows that it is notion too absurd to be seriously dealt with that great britain would rather plunge instanter into the bloodiest civil war that ever desolated country than submit to the dismemberment of the empire by repealing the union between great britain and ireland pg 127 pg 128 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https opinion has had from time to time every possible mode of authentic and solemn expression that can be given to the national will in speeches from the throne in parliamentary declarations by the leaders of both the whig and conservative governments the members of both houses of parliament are with not single exception worth noticing unanimous upon the subject the press whether quarterly monthly weekly or daily of all classes and shades of political opinions is unanimous upon the subject in society whether high or low the subject is never broached except to enquire whether any one can one moment seriously believe the repeal of the union to be possible in ireland itself the vast majority of the intellect wealth and respectability of the island without distinction of religion or politics entertains the same opinion and determination which prevail in great britain is mr ignorant of all this he knows it certainly he knows that queen victoria occupies the throne of these realms and yet down to his very last appearance in public he has solemnly and perseveringly asseverated that the repeal of the union is an absolutely certain and inevitable event and one that will happen within few months is he in his senses if so he is speaking from his knowledge of some vast and dreadful conspiracy which he has organized himself which has hitherto escaped detection the idea is too monstrous to be entertained moment what then can mr be about our opinion is that his sole object in setting on foot the repeal agitation was to increase his pecuniary resources and at the same time overthrow sir robert peel government by showing the queen and the nation that his admitted chief difﬁculty one insuperable and that he must consequently retire we believe moreover that he is to certa in extent acting upon secret understanding with the party of the late government who however never contemplated matters being carried to their present pitch but that the ministry would long ago have retired terriﬁed before the tremendous demonstration in ireland we feel certain if it were past event that had the desperate experiment succeeded so far to replace the present by the late government mr intentio n was to have announced his determination to give england one more trial place repeal once more in order to see whether england would really at length justice to ireland in other words restore the halcyon days of lord normanby nominal and mr real rule in ireland and enable him by these means to provide himself his family and dependents old age is creeping rapidly upon him physical powers are longer equal to the task of vigorous he is known to be in utterly desperate circumstances the reckless character of his proceedings during the last ﬁfteen months is in our opinion fully accounted by his unexpected discovery that the ministry were strong enough to defy any thing that he could and to continue calmly in their course of administering not pseudo but real justice to ireland supported in that course by the manifest favour and countenance of the crown overwhelming majorities in parliament and the decided and unequivocal expression of public opinion his personal position was in truth inexpressibly galling and most critical and he must have agitated or sunk at once into ignominious obscurity and submission to government whom individually and collectively he loathed and abhorred vain were the hopes which doubtless he had entertained that his agitation assumed bolder form it would provoke formidable demonstrations in england against ministers and their policy not meeting could be got up to petition her majesty the dismissal of her ministers but it is quite conceivable that mr in the course he was pursuing forgot to consider the possibility of developing power which might be too great him which would not be wielded by him but carry him along with it the following remarkable expressions fell from the perplexed and terriﬁed agitator at great dinner at lismore in the county of waterford in the month of september last like the heavy on the ice my pupils are overtaking it is now my duty to regulate the vigour and temper the energy of the compress it were the exuberance of both we said that mr revived the repeal agitation and the fact was so he ﬁrst raised it in however at various previous periods of his life professed desire to struggle repeal but mr shiel in his examination before the house of commons in 1825 characterized such allusions mere rhetorical artiﬁces what pg 129 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https his real motives observes the able and impartial author of ireland and its rulers35 when he announced his new agitation in 1829 can be left only to him to determine it is probable that they were of so mixed nature that he himself could not accurately deﬁne them it is however quite possible that after having so long tasted of the luxuries of popularity he could not consent that the chalice should pass from his lips agita tion had perhaps begun to be necessary to his existence tranquil life would have been hell to him it would seem that mr earliest recorded manifesto on repeal was on the 3d june 1829 previous to the clare election on which occasion he w want political excitement in order that we may insist on our rights irishmen but not catholics and on the 20th of the same month in the same year 1829 he listen to this ye his infatuated dupes that before three years there would be parliament in dublin in the general elections of 1832 it was proclaimed by mr that member should be returned unless he solemnly pledged himself to vote the repeal of the union but it was at the same time hinted that if they would only enter the house professed repealers they would never be requir ed to vote repeal on the hustings at the county of waterford election one of these gentry sir richard keave on being closely questioned concerning the real nature of his opinion on repeal let out the whole truth i will hold it an imposing weapon to get justice to ireland this has held true ever since and completely exempliﬁes all the intervening operations of mr it has been his practice ever since to connect every grievance with the subject of convert every wrongful act of any government into an argument the necessity of an irish legislature can it be wondered at that the present government thoroughly aware of the true state of the case their regard the cry repeal simply an imposture its utterers impostors they did and so regard it and its allowing either the one or the other to disturb their administration of affairs with impartiality and ﬁrmness but nevertheless keeping most watchful eye upon all their movements 35 pp 43 at length whether emboldened by conviction that the of the government was occasioned solely by their incapacity to grapple with an agitation becoming hourly more formidable and that thus his schemes were impelled onwards by those whom he had roused into action but could longer restrain movements became daily characterized by more astounding vivid the glare of sedition and even treason which surrounded them still the government interfered not their apparent inaction most wondered very many murmured some were alarmed and mr laughed at sir robert peel on one occasion when his attention was challenged to the subject in the house of commons replied that he was not in the least degree moved or disturb ed by what was passing in ireland this perfect calmness of the government served to check the rising of any alarm in the country which felt conﬁdence of the ministry being equal to any exigency that could be contemplated thus stood matters till the 11th july last when at the close of the debate on the state of ireland sir robert peel delivered very remarkable speech it consisted of calm demonstration of the falsehood of all the charges brought by the repealers against the imperial parliament of the impolicy and the impracticability of the various schemes the relief of ireland proposed by the opposition of the absolute impossibility of parliament entertaining the question of repeal of the union and distinct answer to the what course you intend to pursue that answer is worthy of being distinctly brought under the notice of the reader i am prepared to administer the law in ireland upon principles of justice and impartiality i am prepared to recognise the principle established by there shall be equality in civil privileg es i am prepared to respect the franchise to give substantially although not nominally equality in respect to the social condition of to the relation of landlor d and tenant36 am prepared to give the most deliberate consideration to the importan t matters involved in those questions with respect to the established church i have already stated that we are not prepared to make an alteration in the law by which that church is maintained pg 130 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https 36 in conformity with this declaration has been issued the recent commission enquiring into the state of the law and practice in respect to the occupation of land in ireland and in respect also to the burdens of county cess and other charges which fall respectively on the landlord and occupying tenant and reporting to the amendments if any of the existing laws which having due regard to the just rights of property may be calculated to encourage the cultivation of the soil to extend better system of agriculture and to improve the relation between landlord and tenant in that part of the united kingdom we recollect being greatly struck with the ominous calmness perceptible in the tone of this speech it seemed characterised by solemn declaration to place the agitation of ireland ever in the deprive them of all pretence accusing england of having misgoverned ireland since the union it appeared to us if that speech had been designed to lay the basis of contemplated movement against the agitation of the most decisive kind the government acted up to the spirit of the declaration on that occasion of sir robert peel with perfect dignity and resolution unmoved by the taunts the threats the expostulations or fears of either enemies or friends mr tone increased in audacity but we greatly doubt whether in his heart he had not frequent misgivings to the real nature of the frightful silence cette affreuse silence government in whose councils the duke of wellington took decided part and which was actually at that moment taking complete military occupation of ireland on what information they were acting one knew but their preparations were the worst during all this time nothing could exceed the tranquillity which prevailed in england none of these threatening appearances these tremendous preparations caused the least excitement or alarm the funds did not vary farthing per cent in consequence of them and to what could all this be ascribed but to the strength of public conﬁdence in the government at length the harvest in ireland had been got in ships of war surrounded the coast thirty thousand picked and chosen troops ready instant action were disposed in the most masterly manner all over ireland with an almost insane audacity mr appointed his crowning monster meeting to take place at clontarf in the immediate vicinity of the residence and presence of the queen representative and of such military force rendered the bare possibility of encountering it appalling the critical moment however the interfe rence of government had at length arrived and it spoke out in voice of thunder prohib iting the monster meeting the rest is matter of history the monster demagogue fell prostrate and confounded among his confederates and in an agony of consternation declared their implicit obedien ce to the proclamation and set about dispersing the myriad dupes fast they arrived to attend the prohibited meeting thus was the queen peace preserved her crown and dignity vindicated without one sword being drawn or one shot being ﬁred mr had repeatedly deﬁed the government to go to law with him they have gone to law with him and by this time we suspect that he ﬁnds himself in an inﬁnitely more serious position than he has ever been in during the whole of long and prosperous career of agitation here however we leave him and his fellow defendants we may however take this opportunity of expressing our opinion that there is not shadow of foundation the charges of blundering and incompetency which have been so liberally brought against the irish he certainly appear s in the earlier stages of the proceedings to have evinced some little only consider under what unprecedented provocation his conduct has since however been characterised by calmness and dignity and his legal capabilities all competent judges who have attended to the case will pronounce them to be and we feel perfectly conﬁdent that his future condu ct of the proceedings will convince the public of the justness of our eulogium the selection by the government of the moment interference with mr proceedings was unquestionably characterised by consummate prudence when the meetings commenced in march or april this year they had nothing of outward character which could well be noticed they professed to be meetings to petition parliament repeal and undoubtedly lawyer could say that such meeting would per be illegal any more than meeting to complain of catholic relief or to pray its or any other matter which is conside red settled part of the established constitution the mere numbers were certainly alarming but the meetings quietly dispersed without pg 131 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https breach of the peace and after two or three such meetings without any disturbance attending them one could with truth swear that he expected breach of the peace direct consequence of such meeting though many thought they saw civil war remote consequence the meetings went on some ten twelve ﬁfteen occurred breach of the peace disturbance the language indeed became gradually more daring and ferocious but an attempt to put down the ﬁrst meeting by force would have been considered wanton act of oppression and direct interference with the subject right to petition it became very difﬁcult practical question at what moment any legal notice could be taken by prosecution or executive notice by proclamation to put down such meeting notwithstanding several conﬁdent opinions to the contrary advanced by the newspaper press at the time greater grosser not have been made than to have prosecuted those who attended the early meetings or to have sent the police or the military to put those meetings down an acquittal in the one case or conﬂict in the other would have been attended with most mischievous consequences and to the latter it is clear that the executive never ought to interfere unless with force which renders all resistance useless it appears perfectly clear to us even now that prosecution the earlier meetings must have failed there existed then none of that evidence which would prove the object and the nature of the association and to proclaim meeting without using force to prevent or disperse it if it deﬁed the proclamation and to use force without being certain that the extent of the illegality would carry public opinion along with the use of force further to begin to use force without being sure that you have enough to be acts of madness and at least of great and criminal disregard of consequences now when meeting after meeting had taken place and the general design and its mischief were unfolded it became necessary that some new featur should occur to justify the interference of government and that occurred at the clontarf meeting meeting had before that ventured to call itself repeal infantry and to clontarf horsemen also were summoned and were designated repeal cavalry and in the orders their assembling marching and conducting themselves military directions were given and the meeting had it been permitted to assemble would have been parade of cavalry ready civil war it would have been sort of the face of the city of dublin in open deﬁance of all order and government let us add that just at that time mr had published his address to all her majesty subjects in all parts of her dominions most libellous and treasonable publication and the arrangements to secure the peace were more complete and could be brought to bear more easily on the clontarf than on any of the preceding meetings the occasion presented itself and soon possible the irish authorities assembled at dublin the proclamation appeared the ground was and force that was irresistible went out to keep the peace and prevent the meeting the result showed the perfect success of the government enterprise the foregoing topics will doubtless occupy much of the attention of parliament during the ensuing session we were anxious to place on record our own opinions the result of much reﬂection during period when events were transpiring which threw upon the government an awful responsibility and rendered their course one of almost unprecedented difﬁculty modern times we are convinced have witnessed but few instances of such masterly policy combined with signal one or two general topics connected with ireland we have time only to glance at first the faint reluctant disavowal and discouragement of mr l and his repeal agitation by the leading during the last session when emphatically challenged by sir robert peel to join him in denouncing the attempted dismemberment of the empire irrespective and independ ent of all party consideration we are prepared to expect that in the ensuing session the opposition will to great extent make common cause with mr out of mingled fear and gratitude and hope towards their late friend and patron such course will immensely strengthen the hands of the queen government pg 132 blackwood edinburgh magazine vol lv https any thoughtful and independent politician the present sovereign state of ireland demonstrates the utter impossibility of governing it upon the principle of breaking down or disparaging the protestant interest such course would tend only to bloody and interminable anarchy thirdly misery springs from social more than political evils and the greatest boon that providence could give her would be powerful government inﬂexibly resolved to put down agitation lastly we wonder at the exasperation of the peasantry who have so many years had their money extorted from them without ever having had up to this moment the shadow of an equivalent and how long is this disgraceful pillage to go on but we must conclude the ensuing session of parliament may and probably will be stormy one and harassing to the government but they may prepare to encounter it with cheerful conﬁdence their measures during their brief tenure of ofﬁce have been atten ded with extraordinary of that both the sovereign and the country are thoroughly aware and we entertain high hopes concerning the future we expect to see their strong majority in the house of commons rather augmented than diminished by reason of the events which have happened during the recess if the ministers remain ﬁrm in their who doubts it support the agricultural interests of the country and persevere in their present vigoro us policy towards ireland the gover nment is impregnable and the surges of repeal agitation in ireland and agitation in england will dash against it in vain so long they pursue this course they will be cheered by augmented indications of the national and of that implicit and affectionate conﬁdence in their councils which we rejoice to know is vouchsafed to her ministers by our gracious sovereign end of the project gutenberg ebook blackwood edinburgh
