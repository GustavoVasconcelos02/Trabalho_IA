the vast prairie into the countries of attakapas on the east and opelousas on the west on its west bank at its head of navigation lies the sorry little town of vermilionville near about which on the north and east the prairie rises and falls with gentle swell from whose crests one may from the top of wave somewhat overlook the surrounding regions until few years ago stand on whichever one you might the prospect stretched away fair and distant in broad level or gently undulating expanses of crisp compact turf dotted at remote intervals by farms each with its house nestled in planted grove of oaks or oftener pride of china trees far and near herds of horses and cattle roamed at will over the plain if moment you passed from one point of view to another the eye was shut in it was only where in some lane you were walled in by ﬁelds of dense tall sugar or cotton or by huge green chickasaw hedges studded with their roses eastward the plain broke into slight ridges which by comparison with the general level were called hills while toward the north it spread away in quieter swells with more frequent ﬁelds and larger houses north south east and west far beyond the circle of these horizons not this parish of lafayette only but landry martin iberia mary s vermilion are the land of the acadians this quarter off here to northward was named by the exiles in memory of the land from

to have one s hamlet called nightingale or whippoorwill or goldﬁnch or oriole the home of zoséphine and bonaventure s childhood was in the district known carancro in bluf f english carrion crow chapter ii bonaventure and zoséphine they did not live la chapelle that is in the village of six or eight houses clustered about the small wooden spire and cross of the mission chapel sosthène s small cottage with garret stairs outside in front on the veranda and its farm behind was not even on highway nor on the edge of any rich bas fond it was au large out across the smooth unscarred turf of the immense prairie conveniently near one of the clear circular maraises one sees of every size and in every direction on the seemingly level land here it sat still picture within its hollow square of

previous travel that showed the way to it more than the occasional soilure of the short turf by few wheels or hoofs where the route led into or across the coolées from marais to marais slipped southward toward the great marshes of the distant unseen gulf when i say the parent of one of these two children and guardian of the other was man of note i mean one thing his house was painted that he was the owner of thousands of cattle one need not mention so were others who were quite inconspicuous living in unpainted houses rarely seeing milk never tasting butter men who at call of their baptismal names would come forth from these houses barefooted and bareheaded in any weather and while their numerous progeny grouped themselves in the doorway one behind another in inverse order of age and stature would either point out your lost way or quite readily sosthène ask you in beneath roof where the never went dry or grew cold by day nor would it distinguish him from them to say he had many horses or was always well mounted it was land of horsemen one met them incessantly men in broad hats and dull homespun with thin soft untrimmed brown beards astride of small but handsome animals in mexican saddles the girths and bridles of plaited hair sometimes pialle or arriatte plaited rawhide coiled at the adieu onesime adieu at meeting the same at parting adieu françois adieu christophe adieu lazare and they with their gentle animal gaze what did make sosthène notable was the quiet thing we call thrift made graceful by certain rudiments of taste to say sosthène means madame sosthène well and this is how it was that zoséphine gradnego and bonaventure deschamps though they went not to school nevertheless had instance the clean cypress ﬂoors beneath their pattering feet the neat round mats at the doors that served them towns and villages the strips of carpet that stood one to mermentau that one to côte gelée third la chapelle the walls of unpainted pine the beaded joists

principal room the house s one mantelpiece of wood showily stained in three colors and surmounted by pair of gorgeous vases beneath which the two children used to stand and feast their eyes worth ﬁfty

mysterious process called marrying which greatly mystiﬁed zoséphine but equally pleased her by the festive and jocund character of the occasions times when there was ravishing abundance of fried and boulettes to bonaventure these affairs brought less mystery and less unalloyed pleasure he understood them better some boys are born lovers from the time they can reach out from the nurse s arms they must be billing and cooing and choosing mate such was ardent little bonaventure and none of the gradnego weddings ever got quite through its ceremony without his big blue eyes being found full of of mingled anger and by some unpardonable oversight he and zoséphine were still left unmarried so that the pretty damsel would have to take him aside and kiss him they clasped and promise him next time without fail nevertheless he always reaped two proud delights from these events one sosthène always took him upon his lap and introduced him his little creole and the other the came to these great governor who lifted him to his knee and told him of those wonderful things called cities full of people that could read and write and about steamboats and at length one day when weddings had now pretty well thinned out the ranks of sosthène s family the made his appearance though marriage was impending bonaventure sitting on his knee asked why he had come and the told him there was war you not want to make haste and grow up and be dragoon the child was silent and sosthène laughed little he said privately in english which tongue his exceptional thrift had put him in possession of aw naw

conscript fought and fell cause that was really none of theirs simple peasants and many died in camp and of wounds often of fevers often of mere longing home bonaventure and zoséphine learned this much of war that it was state of affairs in which dear faces went away and strange ones came back with tidings that brought bitter wailings from mothers and wives and made les vieux old very silent three times over that was the way of it in sosthène s house it was also condition of things that somehow changed boys into men very young great distance away but still in sight across the prairie dot of dark green showed where dwelt sister and brother of sosthène s vieille there was not the same domestic excellence there at sosthène s yet the dooryard was very popul ous with fowls within the house

sympathy in the family cares that makes such offspring the mother s comfort and the father s hope at that age he had done but one thing to diminish that comfort or that hope one would have supposed an

beausoleil had bought ﬁddle he had hardly got it before he knew how to play it yet to the father s most welcome surprise he remained just bold rider and skilful thrower of the arriatte ever he came into great demand the balls when the courier with red kerchief on wand came galloping round the day before from île to île these descendants of maritime race call their homestead groves islands tell where the ball was to be he would assert if there was even hope of it that thanase was to be the ﬁddler in this way thanase and his pretty little jarmaine now in her fourteenth year grew to be well acquainted at thirteen of course she began to move in society which meant to join in the thanase did not dance with her or with any one she wondered why he did not but many other girls had similar thoughts about themselves he only played his playing growing better and better ﬁner and ﬁner every time he was heard anew to the few other cavaliers very willing were they to have it so the music could not be too good and if thanase was already perceptibly rival when hoisted up in chair on top of table ﬁddle and bow in hand twisting to borrow their own twisting the ears of that little red beast and rubbing his abdomen with stick it was just well not to urge him to come down into the lists upon the but they found one night at length that the music could be too thanase struck up something that was not dance and lads and damsels crowded around standing and listening and asking ever more and the ball turned out failure because the concert was such success the memory of that night was of course still vivid next day sunday and zosé phine s memory was good any one s i wish you might have seen her in those days of the early bud the time had returned when sosthène could once more get all his had marriages decimated one vehicle thing he had not been able to almost these twenty years zoséphine and bonaventure sat on back seat contrived them in the family calèche in front

of youth of mettle of neatness of ﬁt in the dress ﬁrm erectness in the little slim back faint proudness of neck glimpse of ribbon at the throat another at the waist something of assertion in the slight crispness of her homespun sunbonnet and ravishing glint of two sparks inside it you got one glance more and you rode on if you were young blade you would the soldier lads used to curled up but if you were an old mustache you would smile inwardly and say to yourself she will have her way she will make all winds blow in her chosen direction she will please herself she will be her own good luck and her own commander and withal nobody s misery or humiliation unless you count the swain after swain that will sigh in bonaventure sitting beside her you could just see his bare feet limply pendulous under his wide hat and yet he was very real personage bonaventure said zoséphine was they were returning from church the wide rawhide straps of their huge wooden vehicle creaking new saddle would if new saddle were big house b onaventure i wish you could learn how to dance i am tired trying to teach this and most of the unbroken english of this story stands acadian french bonaventure looked meek moment and then resentful he said thanase does not thanase bah what has thanase to with it who was even thinking of thanase was he there last night ah yes i just rememb er now he was but even he could dance if he chose while can t learn you vex thanase what you always bring him up i wish you would have the kindness just not to remind of him why does not some one tell him how he looks hoisted up with his feet in our faces scratching his ﬁddle now the ﬁddle ﬁddle would just suit you ah if you could play but the boy s quick anger so ﬂashed from his blue eyes that she checked herself and with contemplative serenity added pity nobody else can play so well that tiresome fellow it was positively silly the way some girls stood listening to him last night i d be ashamed or rather too proud to ﬂatter such i wish he wasn t my cousin pg 11 pg 12 pg 13 the project gutenberg ebook of bonaventure by george washington cable https still incensed remarked with quiet intensity that he knew why she wished thanase was not cousin it s such thing exclaimed zoséphine so forcibly that madame sosthène s sunbonnet turned around and murmur of admonition came from it but the maiden was smiling and saying blithely to bonaventure oh can t even guess she was about to say more but suddenly hushed behind them galloping horse drew near softly pattering along the turfy road he came abreast he dropped into quiet trot the rider was boyish yet manly ﬁgure in new suit of gray linsey the pantaloons thrust into the tops of his sturdy russet boots and the jacket ending underneath broad leather belt that carried heavy revolver in its holster at one hip campeachy hat shaded his face and shoulders and pair of mexican spurs tinkled their little steel bells against their huge spiked rowels on his heels he scarcely sat in the hat to spurs you might have drawn perpendicular line it would have taken in shoulders thighs and all adjieu said the young centaur and sosthène replied from the creaking calèche adjieu thanase while the rider bestowed his rustic smile upon the group madame sosthène s eyes met his and her lips moved in an inaudible greeting but the eyes of her little daughter were in her lap bonaventure s gaze was hostil word or two passed between uncle and nephew including remark and admission that the were getting worse than ever and with touch of the spur the young horseman galloped on it seems enough to admit that zoséphine s further remarks were silly without reporting them in full look at his back what airs if i had looked up i should have laughed in his face etc well she concluded after much such chirruping there s one doesn t care cent if i should die he would forget to come to the funeral and you think i wouldn t be glad well you re mistaken usual i hate him and i just know he hates everybody hates the eyes of her worshipper turned upon her but she only turned her own away across the great plain to the vast arching sky and patted the calèche with little foot that ached deliverance from its sunday shoe then her glance returned and all the rest of the way home she was sweet the last dip of from the boiling battery chapter iv the conscript officer by and by thanase was sixteen eighteen was the lowest age conscription yet he was in the confederate uniform but then so was his uncle sosthène so was his father it signiﬁed merely that he had been received into the home guard the times were sadly unsettled every horseman and how much more every group of horsemen that one saw coming across the prairie was watched by anxious eyes from the moment they were visible specks to see whether the uniform would turn out to be the blue or the gray which was the more unwelcome i shall not say but this i can that the blue meant invasion and the gray meant conscription sosthène was just beyond the limit of age and thana two years below it but thanase s father kept horse saddled all the time and slept indoors only on stormy nights not be misled he was neither deserter nor coward else the nickname which had quite blotted out his real name would not have been indian he was needed at home was not his war his war was against and like marauders and there was other man in all carancro whom these would not have had on their track rather than him but one gray dawn they found there was another not unlike him they had made an attempt upon sosthène s cattle one night had found themselves watched and discovered had turned and ﬂed westward half the night and had then camped in the damp wood s of bas fond when just day was breaking

moaning villain into his saddle and take him along though he is going to die before ten miles are gone over so they turn homeward leaving high revel the think of bonaventure the slender the intense

into the dandy s arm she whispered gleefully i wish he might never get well said the boy the girl s smile vanished her eyes ﬂashed lightning an instant the blood ﬂew to her cheeks and she bit her lip why don t you now while he can not help don t you go to him and hit him square in the face like arm ﬂew up and she smote him with her sunbonnet full between the like that she ran away laughing joyously while bonaventure sat down and wept with rage and shame day by day he went about his trivial tasks and efforts at pastime with the one great longing that zoséphine would more kindly let him be her slave and take thanase beyond reach instead of this thanase got well and began to have perceptible down on his cheek and upper lip to the great amusement of zoséphine he had better take care she said one day to bonaventure her eyes leaving their mirth and expanding with sudden seriousness or the conscript ofﬁcer will be after him though he is but unlucky word bonaventure s bruised spirit seized upon the thought they were on their way even then la chapelle and when they got there he knelt before mary s shrine and offered the longest and most earnest prayer thus far of his life and rose to his feet under burden of guilt he had never known before it was november the next day the wind came hurtling over the plains out of the bitter cold the sky was all one dark gray at evening it was raining sosthène said he sat down to supper that it was going to pour and blow all night chaouache said much the same thing to his wife they lay down to rest farther away from carancro than many of carancro s people had ever wandered in the public room of village tavern twelve or ﬁfteen men were tramping busily about in muddy boots and big clanking spurs looking to pistols and carbines of

story of sosthène chaouache thanase and the jayhawkers he gathered up his sabre and walked out followed by the rest rattle of saddles splashing of hoofs and then sound was heard but the wind and the pouring rain the short column went out of the village at full gallop day was fully come when chaouache rose and stepped out upon his galérie he had thought he could venture to sleep in bed such night and sure enough here morning came and there had been intrusion thanase too was up it was raining and blowing still across the prairie far the eye could reach not movement of human life could be seen they went in again made ﬁre of few fagots and an armful of hung the kettle and emptied the old coffee from the cof the mother and children rose and dressed the whole family huddled around the good hot

warmer pastures they knew it all by heart yonder farthest île is sosthène the falling ﬂood makes it almost undiscernible even if one looked he would not see that number of horsemen have come softly plashing up to sosthène s front fence sosthène s house and grove are themselves in the way they spy bonaventure he is just going in upon the galérie with an armful of fagots through their guide and spokesman they utter not the usual halloo but quieter hail with friendly beckon the men were bedraggled and so wet one could not make out the color of the dress one could hardly call it uniform and pretty certainly it was not blue adjieu responded bonaventure with some alarm but the spokesman smile d he pointed far away and asked if certain green spot glimmering faintly through the rain was not

one needs to know the road even to place in full view across the plain bonaventure with riot in his heart and feeling himself drifting over the cataract of the sinfullest thing that ever in his young

spattering squad trot away in the storm wondering why there is storm in his own heart they are gone sosthène inside the house has heard nothing the tempest suffocates all sounds not its own and the wind is the wrong way anyhow now they are far out in the open chaouache s île still glimmers to them far ahead in the distance but if some one should only look from the front window of its dwelli ng

round behind and stood in the cold wet gale watching the distant company lessening on the view it was but short dim dark streak creeping across the ﬁeld of vision like some slow insect on spot just beyond it was grove that would presently shut the creeping line ﬁnally from sight they reached it passed beyond and disappeared and then bonaventure took off the small hat that hung about his eyes and safe from the sight and hearing of all his tiny world lifted his voice and with face kindling with delight swung the sorry covering about his head and cried three times ora or but away in the night madame sosthène hearing an unwonted noise went to bonaventure s bedside and found him sobbing if his heart had broken he has had bad dream she said he would not say word the curé of vermilionville and carancr was creole gentleman who looked burly and hard when in meditation but all that vanished when he spoke and smiled in the pocket of his cassock there was always deck of cards but that was only the game of solitaire you have your pipe or cigar your ﬂute or violoncello he had his little table under the and his game of solitaire he was much loved to see him beyond earshot talking to other men you would say he was by nature man of affairs whereas when you came to hear him speak you ﬁnd him quite another sort one of the elisha kind against the elijahs man of the domestic sympathies whose inﬂuence on man was personal and familiar one of the sort that heal bitter waters with handful of salt make poisonous pottage wholesome with little meal and ﬁnd easy quiet ways to deliver poor widows from their creditors with loss to either man whom men reverenced while women loved and children trusted him the was fond of his company although the curé only smiled at politics and turned the conversation back to family matters he had natural gift divining men s women s children s personal wants and every one s distinctively from every other one s so that to everybody he was an actual personal friend he had been long time in this region it was he who buried bonaventure s mother he was the connecting link between bonaventure and the governor whenever the curé met this man of worldly power there were questions asked and answered about the lad little after thanase s enlistment the priest and the who if i remember right was home only transiently from camp met on the square of vermilionvi lle and stood to chat bit while others contemplated from across the deep mud of the street these two interesting representatives of sword and gown two such men standing at that time must naturally one would say have been talking of the strength of the defences aroun d richmond or the emperor maximilian s operations in mexico or kirby smith s movements hardly far enough away to make it seem comfortable but in reality they were talking about thanase he can not write said the curé and if he could one at home could read his the promised to look after him and how he asked does sosthène s little orphan get on the curé smiled he is ly queer child so old yet so young in some things he will be an infant long he lives in others he has been old from the cradle he takes every thing in much earnest man of ﬁfty what is to become of him oh he will come out all right said the that depends some children are born with ﬁxed characters you can tell almost from the start what they are going to be be they much or little they are complete in themselves and it makes comparatively little dif ference into what sort of world you drop thanase instance said the yes you might say thanase but never bonaventure he is the other type just marked and positive traits but those traits not yet builded into character loose mass of pg 28 pg 29 pg 30 the project gutenberg ebook of bonaventure by george washington cable https the beauty or ugliness to which such nature may arrive depends on who and what has the building of it into form what he may turn out to be at last will be mere product of circumstances he is too original that oh he s study another boy under the same circumstances might turn out entirely different and yet it will make an immense difference how his experiences are allowed to combine with his the speaker paused moment while bonaventure s other friend stood smiling with interest then the priest added he is just now struggling with his ﬁrst great what is that it belongs replied the curé smiling in his turn to the conﬁdences of the confessional but he added with little anxious look i can tell you what it will it will either sweeten his whole nature more and more or else make it more and more bitter from this time forth and that is triﬂe to you or whether good or bad in large way or in small way he is going to make himself the mused i m glad the little fellow has you friend father ll tell you if sosthène and his wife will part with him and you will take him to live with you and mark you not try too hard to make priest of him i will bear his i will it said the curé it required much ingenuity of argument to make the gradnego pair see the matter in the desired light but when the curé promised sosthène that he would teach the lad to read and write and then promised la vieille that zoséphine should share this educational privilege with him they let him go zoséphine was not merely willing but eager to see the arrangements made she beckoned the boy aside and spoke to him alone you must go bonaventure you will go will you i ask you think how ﬁne that will be educated i can not endure an uneducated person ca sré vaillant pour savoir lire it will be bully to know how to read aie ya yaie stretched her eyes and bit her lip with c est t y gai pour savoir écrir that s ﬁne to know how to write i will tell you secret dear bonaventure any girl of sense is bound to think it much greater and ﬁner man to read books than to ride horses she may not want to but she has to it she can t help herself still bonaventure looked at her mournfully she tried again when i say any girl of sense i include course i think more of man can write letters than of one who can play the ﬁddle there now i have told you and when you have learned those things i will be proud of you and besides you know if you don t go you make lose my chance of learning the same things but if you go we will learn them together he consented she could not understand the expression of his face she had expected gleams of delight there were none he went with silent docility and without tear but also without smile when in his new home the curé from time to time stole glances at his face ﬁxed in unconscious revery it was full of grim unhappy satisfaction self is winning or dying hard i wish ill to thanase but if there is to be any bad news of him i hope the sake of this boy s soul it will come quickly so spoke the curé alone to his cards chapter vi m issing the war was in its last throes even when thanase enlisted weeks and months passed then soldier coming home

morning it was just after sunday morning mass that sosthène and chaouache with their families and friends crowded around this bearer of tidings had thanase been in any battles yes two or and had not been wounded although he was the bravest fellow in his company sosthène and chaouache looked at each other triumphantly smiled and swore two simultaneous oaths of admiration zoséphine softly pinched her mother and whispered something madame sosthène addressed the aloud did thanase send other message except that mere ye all zoséphine leaned upon her mother s shoulder and softly breathed he is the mother looked around upon her daughter in astonishment the ﬂash of scorn was just disappearing from the girl s eyes she gave little smile and chuckle and murmured with her glance upon the man he has leave of absence he is deserter then madame sosthène saw two things at once that the guess was good one and that zoséphine had bidden childhood ﬁnal the daughter felt bonaventure s eyes upon her he was standing only step or two away she gave him quick tender look that thrilled him from head to foot then lifted her brows and made grimace of pretended weariness she was growing prettier almost from day to day and bonaventure he had amusements this one thing which one knew but the curé had taken possession of him the priest sometimes seemed to himself cruel so well did it please him to observe the magnitude bonaventure plainly attributed to the matter the boy seemed almost physically to bow under the burden of his sense of guilt it is quickening all his faculties said the curé to himself zoséphine had hardly yet learned to read without stammering when bonaventure was already devouring the few french works of the curé s small bookshelf silent on other subjects on one he would talk till pink spot glowed on either and his blue eyes shone like hot noon sky he would debate the right and wrong of any thing every thing and the rights and wrongs of men in every relation of life blessed was it him then that the tactful curé was his father and mother in one and the surgeon and physician of his mind thus the struggle brought him light to the boy s own eyes it seemed to be bringing him only darkness but the priest saw better that is but his shadow he is standing in it it is deepening that shows the light is thus spake the curé to himself he sat at solitaire under his one afternoon the boy passed out of sight and the curé s eyes returned to his game of solitaire but he slowly laid one card upon another now here now there he still thought of bonaventure there will be peace him

and round those limits of your enclosure worse still if you seek those deﬁnitions only to justify your overriding another s happiness in pursuit of your the boy was not in hearing this was apostrophe

you it is because happiness pursued is never overtaken and can you guess why that is well never mind my son you like to something bonaventure nodded the curé rose taking from his bosom he left his chair red silk handkerchief and he laid the on the table and drawing back with smile said here sit down in my place and write what i tell you while i stretch my legs so never mind whether you understand or not i am saying it myself it helps to understand it better now i walk you write happiness pursued is never overtaken because ave you written that because little we are god s image makes

bear it she kept at home now closely she had learned to read and sosthène and his vieille had pronounced her education completed in one direction only could the eyes of bonaventure go and meet nothing

narrowly and tenderly one night away in the small hours the curé was aroused by the presence of some one in his room who is that he rose from his pillow it is i father said low voice and against the darkness of an inner door he saw dimly the small long nightdress of the boy he loved what gets you up bonaventure come here what troubles you i can not sleep murmured the lad noiselessly moving near the priest stroked the lad s brow have you not been asleep at all but you have had bad dreams that woke you only and what was that there was silence did you dream thanase example the priest reached out and took the boy s small slender hands in his they were moist and cold and did you dream pg 40 pg 41 the project gutenberg ebook of bonaventure by george washington cable https i dreamed he was

earn bread he asked alms but after while he passed eastward into third state and at length into the mountains of fourth meantime the weeks were lengthening into months the year was in its decline

thousand feet below its stony river shining like silken fabric in the sunset lights the great hillsides clad in crimson green and gold and the long trailing smoke of the last rare motionless blue to rest in the chill he met man who suddenly descended upon the track in front of him from higher up the mountain great lank mountaineer and when bonaventure asked the apparition the untiring question to which so many hundreds had answered the tall man looked down upon the questioner bright smile suddenly lighting up the unlovely face and asked makes ﬁddle thess talk an cry well he hain t been gone

you must excuse i didn t understand you at ﬁrst yes this is thank you sir have you seen anywhere coming back from the war young man named thanase beausoleil back from the war why everybody done got back from the war long lawng the speaker pronounced it but the pronunciation could not be untrue the careless assertion second time and again third bona venture fell upon the trail but each time it was colder than before and yet he was pushing on fast he dared many kind man s invitation to tarry and rest was gratefully declined once where two railways parted one leading south the other west he followed the southern days and then came back to the point of separation and by and by found the lost thread again on the more westward road but the time since thanase had passed was the longest yet was it certainly thanase yes the ﬁddle always settled that question and had he not got home he had not come somewhere in the long stretch between bonaventure and carancro there must be strange tidings on the ﬁrst new year s eve after the war the sun was sinking upon the year s end bonaventure turned that last long curve of the new orleans jackson and great northern railroad through the rushes ﬂags willows and of the cleared swamp behind the city of the creoles and passing around the poor shed called the depot paused at the intersection of calliope and magnolia streets waiting the turn of chance

breadth of manhood the ﬁrst soft uneven curls of beard were on his thin cheek and chin patient weariness and humble perseverance were in his eyes his coarse matched attire was whole and but the soilure of clean companioning with nature had browned his skin and dried his straight ﬁne hair any reader of faces would have seen the lines of unselﬁsh purpose about his lips and when they parted nervo usly speech the earnest glow of that purpose in countenance that neither smiled nor frowned and though it was shaded cast shadow the police very soon knew him they smiled at one another and

thread that ran all through it dye that colored it many other occupations helping to make up that life and to make it with all its pathetic slenderness far more than it was likely ever to have been

way had been through land whose whole civil order had been condemned shattered and cast into the mill of revolution total remoulding every day came like the dischar ge of great gun it could not but be that humble his walk was and his years so few his fevered mind should leap into the questions of the hour like naked boy into the surf he made mistakes sometimes in childish sometimes in an older way some against most worthy things but withal he managed to keep the main direction of truth after his own young way of thinking and telling it he had such power to formulate his large conclusions you or even i have but whatever wrought to enlighten the unlettered whatever cherished manhood s rights alike in lofty and lowly whatever worked the betterment of the poor whatever made man not too much and not too little his brother s keeper keeper not by mastery but by fraternal service did these things was to him good religion good politics so at least the curé told the from time to time they talked of the absent bonaventure and of his letters however they had to admit one thing all this did not ﬁnd thanase and why now should thanase longer be sought was there any thing to gain by ﬁnding him dead not bonaventure he felt plainly though he had seen an angel write the decree that to bonaventure deschamps kind of proﬁt or advantage under the sun must come by such way but was there any thing to be gained in ﬁnding that thanase still lived the police will tell you they told bonaventure that in these days of steam and steel and yoked lightning man may get lost and be found again but that when he stays lost and is neither dead nor mad it is because he wants to be lost so where was to be the gain in ﬁnding thanase alive oh much indeed to bonaventure the star of new hope shot up into his starless sky when that thought came and in that star trembled that which he had not all these weary months of search dared see even with fancy s eye image of zoséphine that he had never set out to if he could but stand face to face with evidence that thanase could have reached home and would not this thought was making new lines in the young face see here said voice one day bonaventure s sleeve

turned to the right passed two more turned to the left brick walls on either side damp pavements under foot still strode on in silence they turned once more to the right in dim narrow way the captain patted the youth softly on the back and said ask questions and i ll tell you so bonaventure asked none but presen tly in one of those dens called sailors somewhere down on the water near the mint he was brought face to face with stranger whose manner seemed to offer the reverse proposition of him the youth asked questions and got answers thanase beausoleil still lived far beyond seas how why if this man spake truly because here in new orleans at the last turn in the long weary journey that was to have brought the young volunteer home he had asked and got the aid of this informant to the mast foreign parts but why because his ambition and pride explained the informant had outgrown carancro and his heart had tired of the diminished memory of the little zoséphine bonaventure hurried away what storms buf feted one another in his bosom night had fallen upon the great city long stretches of street lay now between high walls and now between eaves empty of human feet and rife with solitude through long distances he could run and leap and make soft mild pretence of shouting and smiting hands the quest was ended rivalry gone of its own choice guilt washed from the hands love returned to her nest zoséphine zoséphine away now away to the reward of penance patience and loyalty unsought reward he ran the crescent moon ran before him in the sky and one glowing star dipping low beckoned him into the west and yet that night great riot broke out in his heart and in the morning there was look on his face though in that tumult conscience had been drugged beaten stoned and left dead

of the old opelousas railroad with the city and the mississippi at his back when he had sent letter ahead of him he had money left to pay railway passage should he delay that or aught else he might

before with such determined eagerness nothing could turn him about now once train came in sight in front of him just he had started across but he ran forward across the open ties and leaped clear of the track on the farther side just when another instant would have been too late he stood moment only among the palmettos and rushes the hurtling mass thundered by then pushed quickly into the whirling dust of the track and hurried on between the clicking rails not knowing that yonder dark dwindling speck behind was bearing away from him stran ge tidings from the curé the summer was coming on the suns were hot there were leagues on leagues of unbroken shaking prairie with never of shade but only the glowing upper blue with huge dazzling clouds moving like herds of white elephants pasturing across heavenly ﬁelds too slowly the eye to note their motion and below the tremulous sheen of reed and bulrush the wet lair of serpent and alligator now and then there was the cool blue of sunny waters winding hither and thither toward the sea and sometimes miles of deep forest swamp through which the railroad went by broad frowzy treeless clearings ﬂanked with impassable oozy ditches

bien c est all right alors well then it s all right whether all right or not bonaventure was aware of it and tried to hide it under special kindnesses to others and particularly to the dullard of the school grandson of catou and nicknamed crébiche 4 the child loved him and when claude rang the chapel bell and before its last tap had thrilled dreamily on the morning air when the urchins playing about the schoolhouse espied another group coming slowly across the common with bonaventure in the midst of them his coat on his arm and the children s hands in his there among them came crébiche now

why you grande pointe folk allow it you want your children stuffed full of american ideas what is in those books they are studying you don t know neither i would not look into one of them but you ought to know that to learn english is to learn you know who print those books that your children are rubbing their noses in yankees oh i doubt not they have been sharp enough to sprinkle little of

furtive liftings of her young black eyes marguerite remembered bonaventure deschamps well and lovingly years she had seen the letters that at long intervals came from him at grande pointe to her mother here in almost every one of them she had read high praises of claude he had grown thus to be the hero of her imagination she had wondered if it could ever happen that he would come within her sight and if so when where how and now here at time of all times when it would have seemed least possible he had it were rained down she wondered with more deﬁn iteness of thought than ever before what were the deep feelings which her reticent little mothe guerite was an inch the kept hid in that dear breast rarely had emotion moved it she remembered its terrible heavings at the time of her father s death and the later silent downpour of tears when her only sister and brother were taken in one day since then those eyes had rarely been wet yet more than once or twice she had seen tears in them when they were reading letter from grande pointe had her mother ever had something more than sister s love bonaventure had bonaven ture loved her and when before her marriage or after her widowhood the only answer that came to her she now stood knife in hand by the griddle was roar of laughter that found its way through the hall the and two closed doors from the men about the ﬁreside that was the third time she had heard it what could have put them so soon into such gay mood could it be claude somehow she hoped it was not her mother reminded her that the batter would burn she quickly turned them the laugh came again when by and by she went to bid claude to his repast the laughter she reached the door of the burst upon her the storm would have done had she opened the front door it came from all but claude and tarbox claude sat with knee in his hands smiling the semicircle had widened out from the ﬁre and in the midst tarbox stood telling story of which grande pointe was the scene bonaventure deschamps the hero the circumstance and he the accidental arbiter of destinies that hung upon its results the man had retired the night and half an eye could see that the had captivated the whole remaining audience he was just at the end marguerite at the door the laugh suddenly ceased and then all rose it was high bedtime and did they get married asked one three or four gathered close to hear the answer who sidonie and bonnyventure yes i didn t stay to see i went away into mississippi tennessee and alabama and just only few weeks ago took notion to try this attakapas and opelousas region but that s what claud tells more than ﬁve years ago your supper wants you want to go out and sit with you oh trouble not the slightest it will make feel if i was nearer to and so the group about claude s late supper numbered four and because each had known bonaventure though each in very different way from any other they were four friends when claude had demolished the ham and eggs the strong black coffee and the and at the top of the hall stairway tarbox was on his way to bed one of the dispersed ﬁreside circle stopped him saying that s an awful good story i wouldn t try poor one on pg 168 pg 169 pg 170 the project gutenberg ebook of bonaventure by george washington cable https oh really now in good earnest it is good it s good in more ways than one now you know that man hid away there in the swamp at grande pointe he little thinks that six or eight men away off here in vermilionville are going to bed better s it sir that s sir having heard of him tarbox smiled with affectionate approval and began to move away but the other put out say look here i m going away on that two clock train i want that book of yours and i don t want to subscribe and wait i want the book now that s my way i m just that kind of man i m the nowest man you ever met up with that book s just the kind of thing man like who ain t got time to go exhaustively delving and investigating and researching into things and yet has got to keep sharp brier tarbox on looking into his baggage found he could oblige this person before night fell again he had done virtually the same thing one by one all the rest by that time they were all gone but mr tarbox made vermilionville his base of operations several days claude also tarried reasons presentl y to appear the ladies parlor small room behind the with just one door which let into the hall at the hall s inner end was given up to his use and of evenings not only tarbox but marguerite and her mother well met with him gathering familiarly about lamp that other male lodgers were not invited to hover around the group was not idle tarbox held big hanks of blue and yellow yarn which zoséphine wound off into balls square table quite ﬁlled the centre of the room there was confusion of objects on it and now on one side and now on another claude leaned over it and slowly toiled from morning until evening alone and in the evening with these three about him marguerite with her sewing dropped upon the ﬂoor watching his work with an interest almost wholly silent only making now and then murmured comment her eyes passing at intervals from his eyes to his hands and her hand now and then guessing and supplying his want he looked one thing or another that had got out of sight what was he doing to marguerite more than he was aware of zoséphine beausoleil saw and was already casting about somewhat anxiously in her mind to think what if any thing ought to be done about it she saw her child s sewing lie forgotten on the ﬂoor and the eyes that should have been following the needle ﬁxed often on the absorbed unconscious face so near by she saw them scanning the bent brows the smooth bronzed cheek the purposeful mouth and the unusual length of dark eyelashes that gave its charm to the whole face and she saw them quickly withdrawn whenever the face with those lashes was lifted and an unsuspecting smile of young companionship broke slowly about the relaxing lips and the soft eyes claude little knew what he was doing neither did marguerite but aside from her what was his occupation i will explain about ﬁve weeks earlier than this passenger on an train of morgan s louisiana and texas railway stood at the rear door of the last coach eying critically the track it glided swiftly from under the train and shrank perpetually into the west the coach was nearly empty one was near him save the brakeman and by and by he took his attention from the track and let it rest on this person there he found singular attraction had he seen that face before or why did it provoke vagu reminiscences of great cypresses overhead and shaded leafy distances with bayous winding out of sight through them and impenetrable to the eye and but through them only few feet away suddenly he knew wasn t it your father he said who was my guide up bayou des acadiens and blind river the time i made the survey in that big swamp north of grande pointe isn t your name claude pierre and presently they were acquainted you know i took great fancy to your father and you ve been clear through the arithmetic twice why see here you re just the sort of man here don t you want to learn to be surveyor the questioner saw that same ambition which had pleased him so in the father leap joy in the son s eyes an agreement was quickly reached then the surveyor wandered into another coach and nothing more passed between them that day save one matter which though trivial has its place when the surveyor returned to the rear train

the it seems that he was an engineer chief of party engaged in redeeming some extensive waste swamp and marsh the chief engineer on the third day afterward drew near the place where he suddenly recollected claude would be waiting to enter his service and recalled this part of their previous interview he said to himself it would be good the father but not best the son and fell to thinking how often parents are called upon to wrench their affections down into cruel bounds to make the foundations of their children s prosperity claude widened to his new experience with the rapidity of something hatched out of shell moreover accident was in his favor the party was in its upper ranks and claude found himself by this stress taken into larger and larger tasks fast he could though ever so crudely qualify them tisn t at all the best thing you said one of the surveyors but i ll lend you some books that will teach you the why well the how in the use of these books by ht certain skill

childhood woman worthy higher and so all by accident chance upon chance here was claude making maps and this delightful work he thought was really all he was doing in zoséphine s little inner parlor by and by it was done the engineer had not yet arrived the storm had delay ed work in one place and undone work in another and he was detained beyond expectation but letter said he would come in day or two more and some maps of earlier surveys drawn by skilled workmen in great new orleans arrived seeing which claude blushed his own and fell to work to make them over if at ﬁrst you not succeed

day six years gone the wet spongy margin of tiny bayou under his feet the great swamp at his back the leafy under growth all around his canoe and paddle waiting him and bonaventure repeating to amp

like any man in dat whole worl i radder make myself like bonaventure and you she was so slow to answer that he looked at her even then she merely kept on sweeping her ﬁngers slowly and idly back and

each according to knowledge of him nor did their common likings stop with him the things he had taught claude to love and seek suddenly became the admiration of marguerite to stir and hum in her young heart and to pour forth like waking bees in the warm presence of spring claude was new interpretation of life to her one caught abed by the ﬁrst sunrise at sea her whole spirit leaped with unmeasured into fresh garments and to new and beautiful stature and looked out upon wider heaven and earth than ever it had seen or desired to see before all at once the life was more than meat and the body than raiment presently she sprang to action in the convent school whose white belfry you could see from the end of madame beausoleil s balcony whither zoséphine had sent her after teaching her all she herself knew it had been the mind knowledge now it was knowledge the mental training and enrichment had value now never before dreamed of the old were got down recalled from banishment nothing ever had been hard to learn and now she found that all she seemed to have forgotten merely required like the books little beating clear of dust and claude was there to help if c having start of one hundred miles travels and so and so and so how fast must i travel in order to she can not work the problem thinking of what it symbolizes c himself takes the slate her dark eyes lifted an instant to his are large with painful meaning she sees at glance she must if the arithmetical is the true than the whole distance now between them but claude says there is an easy way she draws her chair nearer and nearer to his he bows over the problem and she can not follow his pencil without bending her head very close to ﬂuffy bits of her black hair touch the thick locks on his temples look to your child zoséphine beausoleil look to her ah she can look but what can she she saw the whole matter saw more than merely an unripe girl smitten with the bright smile goodly frame and bewitching eyes of promising young rustic saw her heart ennobled her nature enlar ged and all the best motives of life suddenly illuminated by the presence of one to be mated with whom promised the of all harmonies promised in the effort to lift poor daily existence higher and higher out of the dust and into the light what could she say if great spirits in men or maidens went always or only with high fortune mere acadian lass tavern maiden were safe enough come one fate or another if marguerite were like many girl in high ranks and low to whom any husband were husband any snug roof home and any living what may maiden or mother bid her when she looks upon the youth so shaped without and within to her young soul s belief in its wants that all other men are but beasts of the ﬁeld and creeping things and he alone adam to whom could the widow turn father mother to their rest the curé who had stood over her in baptism marriage and bereavem ent long ago to higher dignities and wider usefulness in distant ﬁelds oh the presence and counsel of bonaventure it is true here was tarbox so kind and so replete with information so shrewd and so ready to advise she spurned the thought of leaning on him and yet the thought often returned already his generous interest had explo red her pecuniary affairs and his suggestions too good to be ignored had moulded them into better shape and enlar ged their net results and he could tell how many tacks make pound and what electricity is and could cure wart in ten minutes and recite oh why should the spirit of mortal be proud and this evening the seventh since the storm when one weak moment she had allowed the conversation to drift toward wedlock he had stated woman s chances of marrying between the ages of ﬁfteen and twenty to wit 14½ per cent and between thirty and 15½ hah exclaimed zoséphine her eyes ﬂashing they had not done in many day tis not dat way in opelousas arithmetically speaking the statisticia n quickly explained he ventured to lay foreﬁnger on the back of her hand but one glance of her eye removed it you see that s merely arithmetically considered now of course looking at it of course why to that there are ladies madame beausoleil rose left tarbox holding the yarn and went down the hall whose outer door had opened and shut moment later she entered the room again claude marguerite s heart sank her guess was right the

storms purifying the air yonder treading down rich harvests now replenishing the streams and now strewing shores with wrecks here blessing there calamity see what this one had done marguerite well what she could not lament she dared not rejoice oh if she were claude and claude were she how she wondered how many miles day she could learn to walk if she should start out into the world on foot to ﬁnd somebody she had heard that bonaventure had once done to ﬁnd her mother s lover there are bonaventures now she thinks in these decayed times mamma speech was french why we never see bonaventure how far is it to grande pointe ah my child hundred miles even and to my uncle rosamond s robichaux on bayou terrebonne fully far and almost the same journey there was but one thing to be done claude out of her heart the storm had left wounds on grande pointe every roof was safe even the old where bonaventure had kept school before the schoolhouse was built the shelt ering curtains of deep forest had broken the onset of the wind and the little cotton corn and tobacco ﬁelds already harvested were merely made little more tattered and brown the november air was pure sunny and mild and thrilled every now and then with the note of some lingering bird green and bosky confusion still hid house from house and masked from itself the all but motionless human life of the sleepy woods village only an adventitious here and there had been stripped of its golden foliage and kept but its ripened berries with the red birds darting and ﬂuttering around them like so many hiccoughing comanches about dramseller s tent and here if one must tell thing so painful our old friend the neglecting his faithful wife and letting his home go to decay kept dropping in all hours of the day tasting the berries rank pulp stimulating stimulating drowning care you know lost so many children and the rest gone off in ungrateful forgetfulness of their old father yes and ready to sing or ﬁght just any other creature happened not to wish and going home in the evening scolding and swaggering and getting to bed barely able to hang on to the roost it would have been bad enough even man but but the storm wrought great change in one small house not in grande pointe yet of it until the storm ever since the day pierre had returned from the little n where claude had taken the cars he had seemed patiently resigned to the new loneliness of bayou des acadiens his thatched hut which day by day sat so silent between the edges of the dark forest and the darker stream looking out beyond the farther bank and far over the green waste of rushes with its swarms of blackbirds sweeping capriciously now this way and now that and the phantom passing slowly across from one far line of cypress wood to another but since that night when the hut s solitary occupant could not sleep the winds and thought of claude there was great difference inside and this did not diminish it grew it is hard man to be both father and mother and at the same time be childless the bonds of this condition began slowly to tighten around pierre s heart and then to cut into it and so the same day on which claude in vermilionville left the beausoleils tavern the cabin on bayou des acadiens ever in his mind s eye was empty and in grande pointe his father stood on the one low step at the closed door of bonaventure s little frame schoolhouse he had been there full minute and had not knocked every movement came only after an inward struggle many associations crowded his mind on this doorstep six years before almost on this spot mere then he and maximian roussel had risen from the grassy earth and given the ﬁrst two welcoming to the schoolmaster and now one result claude who did not know his letters then was had greatness

away from their paternal homes then indeed the priest had said only too truly that these public schools teach every thing except morals and religion from the depth of pierre s heart there quickly came denial of the charge and on the moment like chanted response there fell upon his listening ear monotonous intonation from within the door had begun its exercise he knew the words by heart so often had

beausoleil i wouldn t tell anybody zoséphine responds with digniﬁed bow she has years ago noticed in herself that though she has strength of will she lacks clearness and promptness of decision she is at loss now to know what to with tarbox here he is the seventh time but there is always plausible explanation of his presence and person of more tactful propriety it seems to her never put his name upon her tavern register or himself into her company she sees nothing shallow or specious in his dazzling attainments they rekindle the old ambitions in her that bonaventure lighted and although tarbox s modest loveliness is not visib le yet certain fundamental rectitude discernible behind all his nebulous gaudiness conﬁrms her liking then too he has earned her gratitude she has inherited not only her father s small fortune but his thrift well she can see the sagacity of tarbox s advice in pecuniary matters and once and once again when he has told her quietly of some little operation into which he and the thinks the world of he going to dip and she has accepted his invitation to venture in also to the extent of single thousand dollars the money has come back handsomely increased even now the sale of all her prairie lands to her former which brought her out here yesterday and lets her return this morning is made upon his suggestion and is so advantageous that somehow she doesn t know why she almost fears it isn t fair to the other side the fact is the country is passing from the pastoral to the agricultural life the prairies are being turned into countless farms and the people are getting wealth so explains tarbox whose happening to come along this morning bound in her direction is pure accident the of hasn t done its best he says again one thing i ve had other ﬁsh to fry you know he ventures glance at her eyes but they ignore it and he adds i mean other ﬁnancial tis so says zoséphine and tarbox hopes the reason this faint repulse is only the nearness of this

to be satisﬁed with that doesn t it to you it does zoséphine says so she sees the double meaning and tarbox sees that she sees it but must still move cautiously so he says well i m not satisﬁed it s perfect far it goes but don t expect to be satisﬁed with it if i ve seemed satisﬁed shall i tell you why it was my zoséphine makes reply but her dark eyes meeting his moment and then falling to her

too dull mentioned casually the city and saw marguerite lighten up eagerly the city was chosen the physician s sister living there would see mar guerite comfortably established all was presently

wring from it before it seemed safe the instrument to trust it in her hands she had learned to draw its bow and years now there had been resident within the parish who could not have been her scholar

may play who after life s ﬁrst great billow has gone over him smites again his forgotten instrument with tears of all emotions mingled starting from her eyes and the bow trembling on the strings she told the violin her love and it answered her be strong be strong you shall not love naught he shall come shall come back and lead us into from that time the violin had more employment than ever before in all its days so it and marguerite were gone away to the great strange city together the loneliness they left behind was sad burden to zoséphine other one thing had had so much inﬂuence to make so nearly vulnerable the defences of her heart when tarbox essayed to storm them on the night following that event the same that he had spent so sleeplessly in martinville she wrote letter to marguerite which though intended to have just the opposite effect made the daughter feel that this being in new orleans and all the matter connected with it were one unmixed mass of utter selﬁshness the very

build modest fortune the blood was good even though it was not the blood of ancient robbers and the son in the next generation found his way by natural and easy stages through barataria and into the city and became the merchant of his many sugar and rice planting kinsmen and neighbors it was great favor to marguerite to be taken into such household this she felt it so the household felt it so yet almost from the start they began to play her in their social world their best they could she had her hours of school and of home study also her music both lessons and practice was in earnest both to books and violin and had teachers who also were in earnest and so she found little time social revels almost all sociality is revel in society and especially in the society she met but when she did

before she little guessed that the best impression she had ever made she made here of course it was not merely on account of the violin she had beauty not only of face and head but of form and

unconsciously clasped her eyes starting and an outcry of amazement checked just within her open rounded mouth she stopped and stood an instant in the brightly lighted chamber marguerite sat on the bedside exactly she had come from the carriage save that white gossamer web had dropped from her head and shoulders and lay coiled about her waist her tearless eyes were wide and ﬁlled with painful meditation even when she turned to the alarmed and astonished girl before her with suppressed exclamations of wonder and pity the girl glided forward cast her arms about the sitting ﬁgure and pleaded

to her knees buried her face in her hands and wept marguerite laid her hands upon the bowed head and looked down with dry eyes she presently said again it is headache go back to your there is nothing to tell only i have been very very foolish and very very selﬁsh and i am going home the door closed softly between the two then marguerite sank slowly back upon the bed closed her eyes and rocking her head from side to side said again and again in moans that scarcely left the lips my mother my mother take back oh take back my mother my mother at length she arose put off her attire lay down to rest

had outgrown his service it was true only that by and by there had come juncture in his affairs where he could not without injustice to others make place claude which he could advise claude to accept and they had parted with the mutual hope that the separ ation would be transient but the surveyor could not but say to himself that such incidents happening while we are still young are apt to be nts

temptation that they could invent could stay him from following claude father and son went in one direction and the camp in another i must confess to being somewhat vague to just where they were i should have to speak from memory and i must not make another slip in topography the changes men have made in southern louisiana these last few years are great i say nothing again of the vast widths of prairie stripped of the herds and turned into corn and cane ﬁelds when i came few months ago to that station on morgan s louisiana and texas railroad where claude ﬁrst went aboard somebody had actually moved the bayou the swamp and the prairie apart however the exact whereabouts of the pierres is not important to us tarbox when in search of the camp he crossed the teche at martinville expected to ﬁnd it somewhere eastward between that stream and the atchafalaya but at the atchafalaya he found that the work in that region had been ﬁnished three days before and that the party had been that long gone to take part in new work down in the prairies tremblantes of terrebonne parish the louisiana land reclamation company think that was the name of the concern projecting the scheme this was back in early february you note thither tarbox followed the album of universal information went along and did it made his progress rather slow of course but one of tarbox s many maxims was never to make one day pay another when it could be made to pay itself and during this louisiana campaign he called had developed new art each day pay itself several times over many of these people he said said it solely and silently to himself are ignorant shiftless and set in their ways and even when they re not they re out of the current it were they haven t headway and so they seldom any way to make money except somehow in connection with the plantations there s end of chances here to man that s got and nerve to use he wrote that to zoséphine but she wrote answer day rarely passed that he did not ﬁnd some man making needless loss through ignorance or inactivity whereupon he would simply put in the sickle of his sharper wit and garner the neglected harvest or seeing some unesteemed

precincts days at time but isn t that what time is he would say to those he had been dealing with he ﬁnally snapped the band around his and they would respond yes that s and then he would wish them hearty farewell while they were thinking that at least he might know it was his treat thus it was the middle of february when at houma the parish seat of terrebonne he passed the last rootlet of railway and standing ﬁnally under the blossoming of terrebonne bayou far down toward the gulf heard from the chief of the engineering party that claude was not with him he didn t leave us we left him and up to the time when we left he hadn t decided where he would go or what he would his father and he are together you know and of course that makes it harder them to know just how to the speaker was puzzled what could this empearl ed free lance of fellow want with claude he would like to ﬁnd out so he added i may get letter from him suppose you stay with until and to his astonishment tarbox quickly jumped at the proposition letter came but when the hours had passed the surveyor had taken that same to say tarbox that we have seen him show pierre and claude he was about to start on tour of observation eastward through series of short canals that span the shaking prairies from bayou to bayou from terrebonne to lafourche lafourche to des allemands so through lake ouacha into and up barataria again across prairie and at length leaving lake cataouaché on the left through to the mississippi river opposite new orleans he would have pressed tarbox to bear him company but before he could ask twice tarbox had consented they went in skiff with stalwart negro rowing or towing whenever the sail was not the best it s all of sixty miles said the engineer but if the wind doesn t change or drop we can sleep in achille s hut send this man and skiff back and make achille with his skiff put us on board the who is achille achille oh he s merely cajun living on shell bank at the edge of lake cataouaché with an indian wife used to live somewhere on bayou des allemands but last year something or other scared him away from there he s to be sort of outcast i don t suppose he s ever done anybody any harm but he just seems to be one of that kind that can t bear to even try to keep up with the rest of humanity the sort of man swamps and shaking prairies were specially made you know he s living right on top of bank of fossil shells now of barrels of them he knows would bring him little fortune if only he could command the intelligence and the courage to market them in new orleans there s chance some bright man who isn t already too busy why didn t i think to mention it to claude but then neither he nor his father have got the commercial knowledge they would need now speaker suddenly paused and the two men sat close beside each other under an umbrella in the stern of the skiff looked into tarbox s eyes and smiled and smiled i m here said mr tarbox yes responded the other and i ve just made out why and you re right tarbox you and claude with or without his father will make strong team you ve got business to be canvassing books you it s my line said the canvasser smiling fondly and pushing his hat back was wonderful how he kept that hat smooth and i m the head of the line voice replied far up the height excelsior i was acquainted with mr longfellow pg 217 pg 218 pg 219 the project gutenberg ebook of bonaventure by george washington cable https tarbox persisted the engineer driving away his own smile you know what you are you are born contractor you ve found it out and that s why you re looking where is he asked mr tarbox well i told you the truth when i said i didn t know but i haven t doubt he s in neither have i said the and if i had i wouldn t give it room if i knew he was in new jersey still i d think he was in vermilionville and go there looking him and wherefore occult the two men looked at each other smilingly in the eye and the boat glided on the wind favored them with only now and then the cordelle and still more rarely the oars they moved all day across the lands and waters that were once the fastnesses of the baratarian pirates the engineer made his desired observations without appreciable delays and at night they slept under achille s thatch of rushes the two travellers stood alone moment next morning the engineer said you seem to be making study of my it s my natural instinct replied tarbox the study of human nature comes just natural to it does to duck to scratch the back of its head with its hind foot just easier the is study you re but he reciprocates said the engineer he studies the student of man held his smiling companion s gaze with his own thrust one hand into his bosom and lifted the digit of the other the eyes are called the windows of the soul and looks commercing with the skies thy rapt soul sitting in thine have you tried to look into his eyes you can t it he won t let you he s got something in there that he doesn t want you to in the middle of the afternoon when achille s skiff was already the shades of the swamp on his way homeward and his two landed passengers stood on the levee at the head of harvey s canal with the mississippi rolling by their feet and on its farther side the masts and spires of the city lighted by the western sun swinging round the long bend of her yellow harbor tarbox of fered his hand to say the surveyor playfully held it i mean disparagement to your present calling he said but the next time we meet i hope you ll be contractor ah responded

stand the lair of one of whom you may have heard who has retreated straight backward from grande pointe and from advancing enlightenment and order village drunkard claude s trouble then was not that his father s happiness beckoned in one direction and his in another but that his father s was linked on behind his could the father endure the atmosphere demanded by the son s widening powe r could the second nature of lifetime habits bear the change of his higher spirit there was doubt neither father nor son had any conception of happiness separate from noble aggrandizement nay that is scant justice far more than they knew or than pierre at least would have acknowledged they had caught the spirit of bonaventure to call it by higher name and saw that the best life self is to live the best possible others all others bonaventure would have insisted but claude pierre would have amended they could not return to grande pointe where then should they go claude stood with his arms akimbo looked into his father s face tried to hide his perplexity under smile and then glanced at their little pile of effects there lay their the same ever but the bundles in madras handkerchiefs had given place to and instead of pots and pans here were books and instruments what reply did these things make new orleans the great city even claude shrank from that thought it was the name of quite different place they spoke name that claude s lips dared not speak because lo these months and months his heart had spoken it it at ﬁrst in so soft whisper that long time he had not known it was his heart he heard when something within uttered and the place s name he would silently explain to himself it is because i am from home it is this unﬁxed this life without my father without bonaventure that does it this is not love of course i know that in the ﬁrst place i was in love once when i was fourteen and it was not at all like this and in the second place it would be hopeless presumption in muddy vagabond that i am and in the third place burnt child dreads ﬁre and so it can not be love when papa and i are once more together this unaccountable longing will but instead of ceasing it had grown the name of the place was still the only word the heart would venture but it meant always one pair of eyes one young face one form one voice still it was not now and then the hospitality of some near the camp was offered to the engineers and sometimes just to prove that this thing was not love he would accept such an invitation and even meet pretty maiden or two and ask them music and which he had talk enough to answer their questions and conjectures about surveyor s life etc but when he got back to camp matters within his breast were rather worse than better he had then tried staying in camp but without beneﬁt cured every thing aggravated and yet he knew so perfectly well that he was not in love that just to realize the knowledge one evening when his father was day s march ahead and he was having pleasant chat with the chief one else nigh and they were dawdling away its closing hour with pipes metaphysics psychology and like triﬂes which claude of course knew all about told him of this singular and amusing case of haunting fantasy in his own experience his hearer had shown even more amusement than he and had gone on smiling every now and then afterward with signiﬁcance that at length drove claude to bed disgusted with him and still more with himself there had been one offsetting comfort an unintentional implication had somehow slipped in between his words that the haunting fantasy had blue eyes and yellow hair all right the angry youth had muttered tossing on his iron couch let him think so and then he had tossed again and said below his breath it is not love it is not but i must never answer its call if i love is what it will be my father my father would that i could give my whole heart to thee thou givest all to pg 222 pg 223 pg 224 the project gutenberg

father on all their worldly goods his riﬂe between his knees waiting his son s choice and ready to make it his own and here stood the son free of foot to follow that voice which was calling louder than ever before but feeling assured that to follow it meant love without hope him and this dear father the pain of yielding up the larger share of his son s heart if love were subject to arithmetic

conditions were putting their inmost quality to proof claude saw now what he could not see before why his friend the engineer had cast him loose without word of advice to where he should go or what he should it was because by asking advice he had really proposed to be his own master and now could he it dare he try it the ﬁrst step he took was taken i suppose instinctively rather than intelligently certainly it was perilous he retreated into himself pierre found work aﬁeld of this sort there was plenty the husbandmen s year and the herders too were just gathering good momentum but claude now

once and even we should ﬁnd the whole business stupid shooting barnyard fowls zoséphine had walked out earlier than tarbox he had seen her go but dared not follow he read thou shalt not plain print on her back she walked quietly away that same little peremptory back that once in her father s calèche used to hold itself stiff when thanase rode up behind the occasional townsman that lifted his slouch hat in deep deference to her silent bow did not read unusual care on her fair brow yet she too was troubled marguerite she was the trouble zoséph ine knew her child could never come back to these old surroundings and be content the mother was not willing she should she looked at photograph that her daughter had lately sent her what change from the child that had left her it was like the change from leaf to ﬂower there was but one thing to follow her so zoséphine had resolved to sell the inn she was gone now to talk with the old about ﬁnding purchaser her route was not by the avenue of oaks

something and she ll come back this he loitered out across ﬁelds but not too far off or out of sight and by and by there she came with just the slightest haste in her walk she received him with kindly

startled and then bowed gravely yes i want your advice it s only busin ess but it s important and it s point where woman s instinct is better than man s there was some melancholy satire in her

within himself it was natural to tarbox to spin web it is spider to manœuvre was the profoundest instinct of his unprofound nature zoséphine felt the slender threads weaving around her but in her heart of hearts there was certain pleasure in being snared it could not to her seem wholly bad tarbox to play spider provided he should play the harmless spider tarbox spoke again and she listened

think so you don t i know you better in this matter than you know yourself and you don t think it s right you know justice belongs to the state and that when you talk to yourself about what you owe to justice it means something else that you re too sweet and good to give the right name to and still want it you don t want it you don t want revenge and here s the proof josephine you know and i know that if without more than one look of the offer to buy your favor at that price even ever so lawfully you d thank one minute and then loathe to the end of your zoséphine s face had lost its hardness

ﬂashes out upon his and her breath came and went long and deep without sound but at his last words she strangest be where she saw tears in his eyes saw them moment and then could see them more her own her lips relaxed her form drooped she lifted her face to reply but her mouth twitched she could not speak i m not so foolish i look he said trying to smile away his emotion if the state chooses to hunt him out and put him to trial and punishment i don t say i d stand in the way that s the state s business that s the public safety but it s too and bonnyventure have made it too to help any one least of all the one i love to be he saw his words were prevailing and followed them up oh you don t need it any more than you really want it josephine you mustn t ever look toward it again i throw myself and my love across the path don t walk over us take my hand give yours come another way and if you ll let such poor excuse teacher and guide help you i ll help you all i can to learn to say

loving you if i must say i can say tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at must i are you going to make say that zoséphine still in tears silently and with drooping head pushed her way across the stile and left him standing on the other side he sent one pleading word after her isn t it most too late to go the rest of the way alone she turned lifted her eyes to his an instant and nodded in twinkling he was at her side she glanced at him again and said quite contentedly yass tis so and they went the short remnant of the way together chapter xii the beausoleils and pierres you think of going to new orleans in the spring certainly the spring is the time to go when you ﬁnd yourself there go some day they haven t moved it there is talk of that to the christian women s exchan ge already mentioned in the rue bourbon quarter you step immediately from the sidewalk into the former of house built early in the century fashionable residence that at least is its aspect notice instance in the back parlor crowded now like the front one with really interesting old wooden mantelpiece of course this is not the way persons used to go in old times they entered by the and open carriag upon which these still open by several glass doors on your right step out there you ﬁnd veranda crowded with neat clothed tables before some late alterations there was great trellis full of green sunshine and broken breezes entangled among vines of and the scuppernong grape here you will be waited on by small damsels of methodist unsop histication and presbyterian propriety to excellent refreshment only if you know your soul s true interest eschew their fresh bread and insist on having yesterday however that is matter of taste there and matter at all here all i need to add is that there are good apartments overhead to be rented to women too good this world and that in the latter end of april 1884 zoséphine and mar guerite beausoleil here made their home the tavern was sold the old life was left far behind they had done that dreadful thing that everybody deprecates and everybody likes to the country and come to live in the city and zoséphine was well pleased man who had tried and failed to be merchant in the city he and his wife took the tavern so zoséphine had not reduced the rural not sinned against besides she had the good conscience of having ﬂed from and apart it yet without being so hid but suitor s proper persistency could ﬁnd her just now he was far away prosecuting the commerc ial interests of claude s one or two inventions but he was having great success he wrote once or got hoped to be back within month when marguerite after her mother s receipt of each of these letters thought she saw cloud on her brow zoséphine explained with revival of that old look of sweet which the daughter so loved to see that they contained matters of business not at all to be called troubles but the little mother did not show the letters she could not marguerite did not even know their writer had changed his business to claude his name was never mentioned each supposed the other was ignorant that he was in the city and because he was never mentioned each one knew the other was thinking of him pg 248 pg 249 pg 250 the project gutenberg ebook of bonaventure by george washington cable https claude what are you thinking of has not your new partner in business told you they are here not word of it that ll keep till i get back tarbox had said to himself and such shrewdness was probably not so ungenerous after all if you want thing done well it yourself he said one evening to man who could not make out what he was driving at and later tarbox added to himself the man that ﬂies the kite must hold the and so he kept his counsel but that does not explain we remember that claude already knew that marguerite was in the city at least had her own mother s word it here weeks had passed new orleans is not so large its active centre is very small even by accident on the street canal street especially he should have seen her time and again and he did not at any rate not to know it she really kept very busy indoors and in other doors so did he more than that there was his father when the two ﬁrst came to the city pierre endured the town week but it was martyrdom doing it claude saw this tarbox was with him the latter part of the week he saw it he gave his suggestive mind to it one night the next day pierre and he wandere d off in and on foot and by the time the sun went down again new provision had been made at about ninety minutes jaunt from the city s centre up the river and on its farther shore near where the old company canal runs from lock in the river bank back through the swamps and into the baratarian lakes pierre had bought with his lifetime savings neat house and fair orangery ﬁelds none you see claude git doze new all right he go to ingineerin agin and him and you tarbox be takin some cawntrac buil levee or break up old steamboat or raise somet in what been sunk or somet in dat way and den he certain want somboddie to boss gang fellows and den he say papa i want and den i say how i got ﬁfty arpent 42 acres rice in ﬁeld and den he say how i goin widout you and den dare be ﬁfty arpent rice gone ﬁelds better here with the vast wet forest at his back the river at his feet the canal the key to all barataria lafourche and terrebonne full of acadian ﬁshermen hunters timbe gatherers and the like the great city in sight from yonder neighbor s balustraded and claude there to rally to his side or he to claude s at moment s warning he would be an of that of the telegraph an operator in the wild products of the swamp the prairies tremblantes the lakes and in the small harvests of the pointes and bayou margins moss venison ﬁsh crabs shrimp melons garlic oranges périque tobacco knowledge is power he knew wood water and sky by heart spoke two languages could read and write and understood the ways and tastes of two or three odd sorts of lowly human kind is dominion i not say the bottle went never to his lips but it never was lifted high and now to the blessed maxim gotten from bonaventure he added one given him by tarbox in ees strank not mere union of hands alone but of counsels there were claude and tarbox and he instance at tarbox s suggesti on claude brought to his father from the city every evening now the picayune and now the from european and national news he modestly turned aside whether he read the i not know i hope not but when he had served was capital camp he and claude had eaten and their pipes were lighted you should have seen him scanning the latest quotations and debating the ﬂuctuations of the moss market the shrimp market and the garlic market thus claude was rarely in the city save in the busy hours of the day much oftener than otherwise he saw the crimson sunsets and the cool purple sunrises he and pierre pulled in the father s skiff diagonally to or fro across the mississippi between their cottage and the sleepy outposts of city just under the levee at the edge of that green plain where certain man gentle shy and unworldly our engineer friend thought claude to be was raising the vast buildings of the next year s universal exposition but all this explains only why claude did not to his knowledge see marguerite by accident yet by intention why not by intention first there was his fear of sinning against his father s love that alone might have failed to hold him back but second there was his helplessness love made tarbox if any thing were needed to make him brave it made claude coward and third there was that helpless terror of society in general of which we have heard his friend talk i have seen strong horse sink trembling to the earth at the beating of an empty drum claude looked with amazed despair at man s ability to overtake pretty girl acquaintance in canal pg 251 pg 252 pg 253 the project gutenberg ebook of bonaventure by george washington cable https and walk and talk with her he often asked himself how he had ever been moment at his ease those november evenings in the tavern s at vermilionville it was because he had task there sociality was not the business of the hour and now i have something else to confess about claude something mortifying in the extreme you see the poverty of all these explanations their very multitude makes them weak many ﬁres can not quench love what was the real matter i will tell claude s love was deep sentiment he had never allowed it to assert itself passion the most he would allow it to be was yearning it was scarcely personal while he was with marguerite in the inn his difﬁdence alone was enough to hide from him the impression she was making on his heart in all their interco urse he had scarcely twice looked her full in the face afterward she had simply become in memory the exponent of an ideal he found himself often now asking himself why are my eyes always looking her should i actually know her were i to see her on this sidewalk or in this and while still asking himself these silent questions what does he one day but all intents and purposes at in to the another girl you remember uncle remus s story of brer rabbit with the bucket of honey inverted on him it was the same way with claude he wa n t des only bedobble wid it he wuz des kiver it happened thus an artist friend whose studio was in carondelet street just off of canal had rented to him workro om little loft above the studio it had one window looking out over roofs and upon the western sky and another down into the studio itself it is right to say friend although there was acquaintanceship until it grew out of this arrangement the artist single man was much claude s senior but claude s taste design and love of work and the artist s grave sincerity simplicity and cordiality of was spaniard with spaniard s perfect mutual regard which only common difﬁdence prevented from running into comradeship one saturday afternoon claude thirsting outdoor air left his eyrie short turn in canal street the matinée audiences were just out and the wide sidewalks were crowded with young faces and bright attires claude was crossing the neutral ground toward bourbon street when he saw coming out of bourbon street young man who might be creole and two young girls in light and what seemed to him extremely beautiful dresses especially that of the farther one who the three turned with buoyant step into canal street to their left showed an instant the proﬁle of her face and then only her back claude s heart beat consciously and he hurried to lessen the distance between them he had seen more than the proﬁle but the moment in which he saw it it seemed to be none other than the face of marguerite chapter xiii the chase claude came on close behind now he could see his mistake it was not she but he could not regret it this was marguerite repeated yet transcended the stature was just perceptibly superior the breadth and grace of these shoulders were better than marguerite the hair arranged differently and far more effectively than he had ever seen it on marguerite s head seemed even more luxurious than hers there was altogether ﬁner digni ty in this one s carriage than in that of the little maid of the inn and see now she turns her head to glance into this shop window it is and it isn t it isn t and it is it is not marguerite it is like her in proﬁle singularly like yet far beyond her the nose little too ﬁne and certain sad ﬁrmness about the mouth and eyes well he could see in the proﬁle but proﬁles are so he had never seen in mar guerite but how i know what i know he asked himself still following on the marguerite i know is but thing of my dreams and this is not that marguerite of my actual sight to whom i never gave word or smile or glance that calls redemption this is the marguerite of my pg 254 pg 255 pg 256 the project gutenberg ebook of bonaventure by george washington cable https was still following when without any cause that one could see the young man of the group looked back he had an unpleasant face it showed small offensive energy that seemed to assert simply him and all his against you and all yours his eyes were black piercing and hostile they darted their glances straight into claude guilty claude dogging the steps of ladies on the street he blushed shame turned corner into exchange alley walked little way down it came back saw the great crowd coming and going vehicles of all sorts hurrying here and there ranks of waiting their turns to start to all points of the compass sellers of peanuts and buyers of bouquets acquaintances meeting or overtaking one another nodding bonnets lifted hats faces faces faces but the one face was gone caught claude and by mere face the charge is too unkind young folly yes or old folly may read goodness rashly into all beauty or not care to read it in any but it need not be so upon the face of youth the soul within writes its confessions and promises and when the warm pulses of young nature are sanctiﬁed by upward yearnings and pure conscience the soul that seeks its mate will seek that face which behind and through all excellencies of mere tint and feature mirrors back the seeker s own faiths and hopes and when that is found that to such one is beauty judge not you never saw

charge with unpleasant ﬂatness to be caught means to be in love to be in love implies wish and hope to marry and these were just what claude could not allow may not man nevertheless have an ideal of truth and beauty and look worshipfully upon its embodiment humph his eyes sought her in vain not only on that afternoon but on many following the sun was setting every day later and later through the black of and behind low dark curtains of orange groves yet he began to be more and more tardy each succeeding day in meeting his father under the riverside oaks of the exposition grounds and then on the seventh day he saw her again now he was more conﬁdent than ever that this vision and he except in dreams had never spoken to each other yet the likeness was wonderful but so too was the unlikeness

in one who was and yet seemed not to be or rather seemed to be and yet was not marguerite and then he went on to his father that this could never mean marriage never mean the father s supplanting man

not in the least to her he couldn t advertise it was midday following the eve of his confession to his father the last eleven or twelve days ever since he had seen that blessed apparition turn with the two young friends into canal street out of had been venturing daily luncheon just down into bourbon street to the christian women s exchange now by all the laws of fortune he should in that time

ho she was moment somewhat more than her proﬁle shone upon claude s bewildered gaze i shall see her eye to eye at last shouted his heart within but the next moment she turned away and with two companions who came across the same threshold moved up the street and at the nearest corner vanished her companions were the american lady and the artist claude wheeled and hurried to pass around the square in the opposite direction and he reached the middle of its third side saw the artist hand them into the lift his hat and return towards the studio the two men met at the foot of the stairs the spaniard s countenance betrayed restrained elation you goin see picture now he said in modestly triumphant tone come in he added claude would have passed the studio door they went in together the spaniard talked claude scarcely spoke i can not repeat the conversation literally but the facts are these few evenings before the artist had been one of the guests at musical party given by lady whose name he did not mention he modestly believed it be seated beside the hostess when young jung creole he called was spending few days with her played the violin the spaniard s delicate propriety left her also nameless but he explained that he understood she was from the teche she played an amateur he qualiﬁed but what had struck him more than the music was her beauty her ﬁgure her picturesque grace and when he confessed his delight in these his hostess seemingly on the inspiration of the moment said paint her picture paint her just so i ll give you the order not mere and he had agreed and the jung lady had consented the two had but just now left the studio morrow servant would bring violin etc the ladies would follow and you hear music anyhow said the artist that was his gentle way of intimating that claude was not invited to be looker on the next day claude in his nook above with the studio below shut from view by the curtain of his inner window heard the ladies come he knows they are these two one voice the elder blooms out at once in gay abundance of words and the other speaks in soft low tones that before they reach his ear run indistinguishably together soon there comes the sound of tuning the violin while the older voice is still heard praising one thing and another and asking careless questions i suppose that cotton cloth covers something that is to have public unveiling some day doesn t it claude can not hear the answer the painter drops his voice even below its usual quiet tone but claude knows what he must be saying that the cloth covers merely portrait he is ﬁnishing of young man who has sat it to please wifeless and but him childl ess and fondly devoted father and now he can tell by the masculine step and the lady s one or two lively words that the artist has drawn away the covering from his claude s own portrait but the lady s young companion goes on tuning her tink tink tink and now the bow is drawn pg 263 pg 264 pg 265 the project gutenberg

reduplication of it declare he looks almost good you the voice stops short there is moment s silence in which the unseen hearer doubts not the artist is making signs that yonder window and curtain are all that hide the picture s original and the voice says again i wish you d paint my picture and the violin sounds once more its experimental notes but there are other things which claude can neither hear nor see nor guess he can not see that the elder lady is already wondering at and guardedly watching an agitation betrayed by the younger in tremor of the hand that fumbles with her and in the foot that trembles on the ﬂoor in the reddened cheek and in the bitten lip he may guess that the painter sits at his easel with kindling eye but he can not guess that just the elder lady is about to say my dear if you don t feel tremor vanishes the lips gently set and only the color remains but he hears the ﬁrst soft moan of the tense string under the bow and second and another and then he rests his elbow s upon the table before him and cover s his face in his trembling hands it seems to him if his own lost heart had entered into that vibrant medium and is pouring thence to heaven and her ear its prayer of love paint artist paint let your brushes ﬂy none can promise you she shall ever look quite like this again catch the lines waving masses and dark coils of that hair the poise of head and neck the eloquent sway of the form the folds of garment s that longer hide but are illumined by the plenitude of an inner life and grace the elastic feet the ethereal energy and discipline of arms and shoulders the supple wrists the very ﬁngers quivering on the strings the rapt face and the eyes claude claude when every bird in forest and ﬁeld knows the call of its mate can you not guess the meaning of those strings must she open those sealed lips and call your very she who would rather die than call it he does not understand yet without understanding he answers he rises from his seat he moves to the window he will not tiptoe or peep he will be bold and bad brazenly he lifts the curtain and looks down and one one the artist and not the patroness of art but that one who would not lift her eyes to that window all the world s s he is standing there listening and looking down he counts himself all unseen yet presently shame drops the curtain he turns away yet stands hearkening the music is about to end the last note trembles on the air there is silence then someone moves from chair and then the single cry of admiration and delight from the player s companion is the player s name mar guerite beausoleil hours afterward there sat claude in the seat where he had sunk down when he heard that name the artist s visitors had made long stay but at length they were gone and now claude too rose to go out his steps were heard below and presently the painter s voice called persuadingly up st pierre pierre come they stood side by side before the new work claude gazed in silence

some noble cypress forests tantalizingly near to navigation and market but practically great way off because the levees of the great sugar estates on the mississippi river shut out all deep overﬂows hence these forests could be bought seemingly mere tithe of their value now he proposed to buy such stretch of them along the edge of the shaking prair ie north of lake cataouaché would show on his part he said caution but not temerity he invited her to participate and why the simple reason that the expert and engineer had dropped the remark that in his opinion certain levee could not possibly hold out against the high water of more than two or three more years and that when it should break it would spread from three to nine feet of water over hundreds of square miles of swamp forests

his mouth to enjoy in the train s momentary stay the delightful air that came across the open prairie the who had got rid of his game ventured near his former patron it might be the engineer could give him work whereby to earn day s ready money he was not disappointed the engineer told him to come in day or two by the waterways the knew so well across the swamps and prairies to bayou terrebonne

neat pirogues set upon racks under their deep shade the indescribable ﬂoods of sunlight and caverns of shadow the clear brown depths beneath his own canoe or at the bottom the dark waving tresses of

still long way off he saw lighted by the sunset rays what he quickly recognized canoe drawn half out of the water almost at his door he warily drew nearer presently he stopped and stood slowly and softly shifting his footing about on the oozy soil at little point of shore only some ﬁfty yards away from his cabin his eyes peering from the ambush descried man standing by the pirogue and searching with his gaze the wide distances that would soon be hidden in the abrupt fall of the southern night the knew him not by name but by face the day the outlaw saw bonaventure at the little railway station this man was with him the name the did not know was pierre the ambushed man shrank step backward into his his riﬂe was in his hand and he noiselessly cocked it he had not resolved to shoot but riﬂe is of use until it is cocked while he so stood another man came into view and to the ﬁrst one s side this one too he knew despite the soft hat that had taken the place of the silk one this was tarbox the acadian was conﬁrmed in his conviction that the surveyor s invitation him to come to houma was part of plot to entrap him while he still looked the two men got into the canoe and pierre paddled swiftly away the let down the hammer of his gun shrank away again turned and hurried through the tangle regained his canoe and paddled off the men s departure from the cabin was in his belief ruse but he knew how by circuits and short cuts to follow after them unseen and this he did until he became convinced that they were fairly in the company canal and gliding up its dark colonnade in the direction whence they had evidently come then he returned to his cabin and with riﬂe cocked and with slow stealthy step entered it and in headlong haste began to prepare to leave it long he knew every spot of land and water leagues around bear or fox would know the region about his den he had in mind now bit of dry ground scarce ﬁfty feet long or wide deeply hidden in the swamp to the north of this lake how it had ever happen ed that this dry spot lifted two or three feet above the low level around it had been made whether by some dumb force of nature or by the hand of men yet more untamable than he had never crossed his pg 274 pg 275 pg 276 the project gutenberg ebook of bonaventure by george washington cable https it was beyond measure of more value to him to know by what he had seen growing on it season after season that many long year waters had overﬂowed it in the lake close to his hut lay moored his small centerboard lugger and into this he presently threw his few appliances and supplies spread sail and skimmed away with his pirogue towing after his loaded riﬂe lay within instant reach by choice he would not have harmed any living creature that men call it wrong to injure but to save himself not only from death but from any risk of death rightful or wrongful he would not through courage but in the desperation of frantic cowardice have killed hundred men one by one by this time it was night and when ﬁrst the lugger and after it was hidden away the pirogue had carried him up slender bayou near they could to the point he wished to reach he had still to drag the loaded pirogue small distance through the dark often wet and almost impenetrable woods he had taken little rest and less sleep in his late journeyings and when at length he cast himself down before his ﬁre of dead fagots on the raised spot he had chosen he slept heavily he felt safe from man s world at least the night only one thing gave him concern he lay down it was the fact that when with the old habit strong on him he had approached his selected camping ground with such wariness of movement the dragging pirogue would allow he had got quite in sight of it before number of deer on it bounded away he felt an unpleasant wonder to know what their unwilling boldness might signify he did not awake to replenish his ﬁre until there were only few live embers shining dimly at his feet he rose to sitting posture and in that same moment there came confusion of sound trampling through froze his blood and robbed his open throat of power to cry the next instant he knew it was but those same deer but the ﬁrst intelligent thought brought new fear these most timid of creatures had made but few leaps and stopped he knew what that meant he leaped to his feet the deer started again and he heard to his horror the ground had been dry and caked when he lay down plash of their feet in water trembling he drew his boots on made and lighted torch and in moment was dragging his canoe after him in the direction of the lugger presently his steps too were plashing he stooped waved the torch low across the water s surface and followed the gleam with his scrutiny but he did so not any doubt that he would see he did the yellow ﬂood of the mississippi he believed he believed his existence that his pursuers had let the river in upon the swamp ruin whom they might to drive him from cover presently he stepped into the canoe cast his torch into the water took his paddle and glided unerringly through darkness and wild tangle of under growth large and small where you or i could not have gone ten yards without being lost he emer ged successfully from the forest into the open prairie and under sky whose stars told him it would soon be day glided on down the little bayou lane between walls of lofty rushes up which he had come in the evening and presently found the lugger he had left her with her light mast down hidden among the brake canes that masked little cove the waters were already in the prairie he boarded the little vessel at the stern raccoon waddled in noiseless haste over the bow and splashed into the wet covert of reeds beyond if only to keep from sharing his quarters with all the vermin of the noisome wilderness the one human must move on he turned the lugger s prow towards the lake and spread her sails to the faint cool breeze but when day broke the sail was gone far and wide lay the pale green leagues of reeds and bulrushes with only here and there low willow or two beside some unseen lagoon or sinuous band of darker green where round rushes and myrtle bushes followed the shore of some hidden bayou the waters of the lake were gleaming and crinkling in tints of lilac and silver stolen from the air and away to the right and yet farther to the left stood the dark phalanxes of cypress woods thus had thousand mornings risen on the scene in the sight of the outlaw numberless birds ﬂuttered from place to place snatching their prey carolling feeding their young chattering croaking warbling and swinging on the bending rush but if you looked again strange signs of nature s mute anguish began to show on every log or bit of smaller drift that

with oars mast and the like he has contrived something by which he can look out over their tops he has powder and shot coffee salt and rice he will not be driven out at night he spreads his sail and seeks the open waters of the lake where he can sleep by littles without being overrun by serpents but when day breaks there is visible sign of his presence yet he is where he can see his cabin it is now deep in the water and the ﬂood is still rising he is quite sure one has entered it since he left it strain of perpetual watching when at dawn of the ﬁfth day he again looked cover in the prairie the water was too high to allow him concealment and he sought the screen of some willows that fringed the edge of the swamp forest anchoring in few rods width of open water between them and the woods he did not fear to make on the small hearth of mud and ashes he had improvised in his lugger the meagre ﬁre needed to prepare his food its slender smoke quickly mingled with the hazy vapors and shadows of the swamp he cast his eye abroad he found nowhere any sign of human approach here and there the tops of the round rushes still stood three feet abov the water but their slender needles were scarcely noticeable far and near over prairie over lake lay the unbroken yellow ﬂood there was ﬂutter of wings whistle of feathered mate to mate call of nestlings from the ruined nests except the hawk

any tangible thing until searching glance had failed to ﬁnd the glittering eye and forked tongue that meant beware in the ﬂooded prairie the trees were loaded with the knotted folds of the moccasin

storm he looked about him to see what provision was needed to meet and weather its onset on the swamp side the loftiest cypresses should the wind bring any of them down would not more than cast the spray of their fall far his anchorage the mass of willows on the prairie side was nearer but its trees stood low here and there the branches touched the water the hurricane might tear away some boughs but could more he shortened the anchor and tried the hold of the anchor on the bottom to make sure the lugger might not swing into the willows in every fork of every bough was huge dark mass of serpents plaited and piled one upon another and ready at any moment to glide apart towards any new shelter that might be reached while eye and hand were thus engaged the hunter s ear was attentive to sounds that he had been hearing more than an hour these were the puff of and plash of wheel evidently from small steamer in the company canal she was coming down it that is from the direction of the river and the city whither was she bound to some one of the hundred or more plantations and plantation homes that the crevasse had desola ted likely enough in such event she would not come into view although some time now he had seen faint shreds of smoke in the sky over distant line of woods but it ﬁlled him with inward tremors to know that if she chose to leave the usual haunts of navigation on her left and steam out over the submer ged prairies and the lake and into the very shadow of these cypresses she could it without fear of snag or shallow he watched anxiously the faint smoke reached certain point if the next thin curl should rise farther on it would mean safety but when it came it seemed to be in the same place the last and another the same and yet another the same she was making almost straight line the spot where he stood only small low point of forest broke the line and presently far away she slowly came out from behind it chapter xviii the tornado the acadian stooped at once and with quick splash launched his canoe minute later he was in it gliding along and just within the edge of the forest where it swept aroun d nearly at right angles to the direction in which the steamboat was coming thus he could watch the approaching steamer unseen while every moment putting distance between himself and the lugger pg 284 pg 285 pg 286 the project gutenberg ebook of bonaventure by george washington cable https strange visitor came on how many men there were on her lower deck were they really negroes or had they blackened their faces men sometimes when they are going to hang poor devil in the woods on the upper deck are two others whose faces not seem to be blackened but moment later they are the most fearful sight of all only too plainly does the fugitive see that they are the same two men who stood before the doorwa y of his hut six days before and see how many canoes on the lower deck while the steamer is yet half mile away from the hidden lugger her lamps and ﬁres and their attendant images in the water beneath glow softly in the fast deepening twilight and the night comes swiftly down the air is motionless across the silent waste an engine bell jangles the puff of steam ceases the one plashing at the stern is still the lights glide more and more slowly with great crash and rumble that is answered by the echoing woods the anchor runs out its short measure and the steamer stops gently the s paddle dipped again and the pirogue moved back towards the lugger it may be that the ﬂood was at last numbing his fear it had so soon done that of all the life around him it was in his mind to something calling more courage than he had ever before commanded in his life save on that one day in carancro when stung to madness by the taunts of brave man and driven to the wall he had grappled and slain his tormentor he had the thought now to return and under cover of the swamp s deep outer margin of shadow silently lift into the canoe the bit of iron that anchored the lugger and noiselessly draw her miles away to another covert or if the storm still held back even at length to step the mast spread the sail and put the horizon between him and the steamer before daybreak this he had now started to and would if only courage would hold on and the storm hold of time his canoe moved swiftly but he drew near the lugger his speed grew less and less and eye and ear watched and hearkened with their intensest might he could hear talking on the steamer there was dead calm he had come to spot just inside the wood abreast of the lugger his canoe slowly turned and pointed towards her and then stood still he sat there with his paddle in the water longing like dumb brute longing and without motion struggling courage enough to move forward it would not come his heart jarred his frame with its beating he could not stir he looked out upon the sky soft faint tremor of light glimmered moment over it without disturbing shadow below the paddle stirred gently and the canoe slowly drew back the storm was coming to betray him with its lightnings in the black forest s edge the lingered trembling oh the nerve to take brave man s chances little courage would have saved his life he wiped the dew from his brow with his sleeve every nerve had let go again there came across the water the very words of those who talked together on the steamer they were saying that the felling of trees would begin in the morning but they spoke in tongue which acadians of late years had learned to understand though many hated it but of which he had never known twenty words and what he had known were now english tongue even without courage to have known little english would have made the difference between life and death another glimmer spread dimly across the sky and faint murmur of off thunder came to the ear he turned the pirogue and ﬂed soon the stars are hidden light breeze seems rather to tremble and hang poised than to blow the rolling clouds the dark wilderness and the watery waste shine out every moment in the wide gleam of lightnings still hidden by the wood and are wrapped again in darkness over which thunders roll and jar and answer one another across the sky then like charge of ten thousand lancers come the wind and the rain their onset covered by all the artillery of heaven the lightnings leap hiss and blaze the thunders crack and roar the rain lashes the waters writhe the wind smites and howls ﬁve ten twent y minutes an hour two hours sky and the ﬂood are never an instant wholly dark or the thunder one moment silent but while the universal roar sinks and swells and the wide vibrant illumination shows all things in ghostly fresh ﬂoods of lightning every moment rend the dim curtain and leap forth the glare of day falls upon the swaying wood the reeling bowing tossing willows the seething waters the whirling rain and in the midst the small form of the distressed steamer her revolving toiling behind to lighten the strain upon her anchor then all are dim ghosts again while peal if the heavens were rent rolls off around the sky comes back in shocks and throbs and sinks in long roar that before it can die is swallowed up in the next ﬂash and peal pg 287 pg 288 pg 289 the project gutenberg ebook of bonaventure by george washington cable https deserted lugger is riding out the tornado whirled one moment this way and another that now and again taking in water her breaks the force of many gust that would have destroyed her out in the open but in the height of the storm her poor substitute an anchor lets go its defective hold on the rushy bottom and drags and the little vessel backs backs into the willows she escapes such entanglement would capsize her and by and by when the wind lulls moment and then comes with all its wrath from the opposite direction she swings clear again and drags back nearly to her ﬁrst mooring and lies there swinging tossing and surviving still den of snakes the tempest was still ﬁerce though abating and the lightning still ﬂashed but less constantly when at point near the lugger the pirogue came out of the forest laboring against the wind and with water on the face of the man in it each gleam of the lightning showed the pallid confession of mortal terror where that frail shell had been or how often it had cast its occupant out one can ever know he was bareheaded and barefooted one can not swim in boots without them even one who has never dared learn how may hope to swim little in the darkness he drew alongside the lugger rose balanced skilfully seized his moment and stepped safely across her gunwale slight lurch caused him to throw his arms out to regain his poise the line by which he still held the canoe straightened out its length and slipped from his grasp in an instant the pirogue was gone glimmer of lightning showed her driving off sidewise before the wind but it revealed another sight also it was dark again black but the outcast stood freezing with horror and fright gazing just in advance of his feet and waiting the next gleam it came brighter than the last and scarcely step before him he saw three great serpents moving towards the spot that gave him already such slender footing he recoiled step but instantly he made the second cold living form was under his foot its folds ﬂew round his ankle and once twice it struck with frantic effort he spurned it from him all in the same instant blaze of lightning discovered the maimed form and black and red markings of bastard hornsnake and with one piercing wail of despair that was drowned in the shriek of the wind and roar of the thunder he fell few hours later the winds were still the stars were out sweet silence had fallen upon water and wood and from her deck the watchmen on the steamer could see in the sky broad soft illumination and knew it was the lights of slumbering new orleans eighteen miles away by and by farther to the east another brightness began to grow and gather this light into its outstretched wings in the nearest wood soft twitter came from single tiny bird another voice answered it different note came from third quarter there were three or four replies the sky turned to blue and began to ﬂush ﬂew out of the woods on her earliest quest family provision thrush began to sing and in moment more the whole forest was one choir what wonderful

curtain between them she had thought until the last moment he will come he will confront us we pass out the overtake us at the foot of the the the carriage window but it had not been so and now they were gone from the place and here sat this friend this gay cynical knower of men s and women s ways answering her chatter in short smiling responses with steady eye ﬁxed on her and reading marguerite believed plainly if it were any of the along the rattling street the writing on her ﬂuttering heart and so even while she trembled with strange delight pain shame and alarm pleaded through her dancing glances now by turns and now in confusion together mercy and concealment but in fact this friend sat glancing upon the young face beside her with secret sympathy and admiration it was only this wild fear of betrayal that at length betrayed reaching the house the street door was hardly shut behind them when marguerite would have darted up to her chamber but her friend caught her hands across the balustrade and said with roguery in her own eyes mar guerite you sweet pg 293 pg 294 pg 295 the project gutenberg ebook of bonaventure by george washington cable https w at yes what there s something

from her mother of her return from terrebonne and she hastened to rejoin her in their snug rooms over the women s exchange when she snatched zoséphine into her arms and shed tears the mother merely wiped and kissed them away and asked explanation the two were soon apart marguerite hungered unceasingly solitude only in solitude could she or dared she give herself up to the constant recapitulation of every minutest incident of the morning and that was ample employment they seemed the happenings of month ago she felt if it were imperative to ﬁx them in her memory now or lose them in confusion and oblivion forever over them all again and again she went sometimes quickening memory with words sometimes halting in long reverie at some intense juncture now with tingling pleasure at the unveiling of the portrait the painter s cautionary revelation of the personal presence above or claude s appearance at the window now with burnings of abasement at the passionate but ineffectual beseechings of her violin and always ending with her face in her hands though to hide her face even from herself shame that with all her barefaced it seemed to her her abject had not come mar guerite

asleep but heard the clock strike and clock next door attest and another day began to shine in at the window it brighte ned her spirits rose she had been lying long in reverie now she began once more the rehearsal but the new day shone into it also when the silent recital again reached its end the old distress was longer there but in its place was new sweet shame near of kin to joy the face unhidden looked straight into the growing light whatever else had happened this remained that claude was found she silently formed the name on her parted claude claude claude claude and could not stop though it gave her pain the pain was so sweet she ceased only when there rose before her again the picture of him drawing the curtain and disappearing but even then she remembered the words don t worry we ll bring it out all right and smiled when zoséphine the ﬁrst sunbeam struck the turned upon her elbow and looked into the fair face beside her the eyes were closed in sleep she arose darkened the room and left it chapter xx love anger and m isunderstanding the city bells had sounded noon when the sleeper opened her eyes while she slept claude had arrived again at his father s cottage from the scene of the crevasse and reported to tarbox the decision of himself and the engineer that the gap would not be closed months to come while he told it they sat down with pierre to breakfast claude who had had chance even to seek sleep ate like starved horse tarbox watched him closely with hidden and growing amusement presently their eyes fastened on each other steadily tarbox broke the silence you don t care how the crevasse turns out i ve asked you question now twice and you don t even hear why you don t ass ag in responded the younger man reaching over to the and rubbing his bread in the last of the gravy some small care called pierre away from the board tarbox leaned forward on his elbows and not knowing he quoted said softly there s something up what is it op asked claude in his full voice frowning op where at w at is ah yes said tarbox with af fected sadness y es that s it i thought so somebody oh hey somebody claude stopped with morsel to his mouth glared at him several seconds and then resumed his eating not like horse now but like bad dog gnawing an old bone he glanced again angrily at the embodiment of irreverence opposite tarbox smiled claude let slip not intending it an audible growl with his eyes in the plate tarbox s smile increased to noiseless laugh and grew and grew until it took hopeless possession of him his nerves relaxed he trembled the table trembled with him his eyes ﬁlled with tears his brows lifted laboriously he covered his lips with one hand and his abdomen shrank until it pained him and claude knew and showed he knew it all that was what made it impossible to stop at length with tottering knees tarbox rose and started silently the door he knew claude s eyes were following he heard him rise to his feet he felt though he would have given thousand dollars if his legs would but last him through the doorway but to crown all pierre met him just on the threshold breaking with unintelligent sympathy into broad simp le smile tarbox laid one hand upon the door support and at that moment there was hurtling sound something whizzed by tarbox s ear and the crashed against the and ﬂew into hundred pieces the ran like deer hundred yards and fell grovelling upon the turf the laugh still griping him with the energy of panther s jaws while claude who in blind pursuit had come threshing into his father s arms pulled his hat over his eyes and strode away towards the pg 299 pg 300 pg 301 the project gutenberg ebook of bonaventure by george washington cable https ferry tarbox returned towards the cottage pierre met him looking very grave if not displeased the swamper spoke ﬁrst dass mighty good you i was yondah to stop dat boy he would he d have served right said the other and laughed again pierre shook his head though this confession were poor satisfaction and said dass not cajun mad he dawn t git mad easy but when he git mad it bre k out all ove him yass he goin feel bad all day now i see tear in his eye when he walk

trees on her land and so forth and so forth you ll hardly see before bedtime it was the ﬁrst hour of the afternoon when claude left his little workroom and walked slowly down to and across canal street and into bourbon he had spent the intervening hours seated at his with his face in his hands he was in great bitterness his late transport of anger gave him burdensome concer indeed there was consolation in the thought that he should by and by stand erect before one who was so largely to blame and make that full confession and apology which he believed his grande pointe schoolmaster would have offered could bonaventure ever have so shamefully forgotten himself yet the chagrin of having at once so violently and so impotently belittled himself added one sting more to his fate he was in despair an escaped balloon burst bubble could hardly have seemed more utterly beyond his reach than now did marguerite and he could not blame her she was right he said sternly to to treat his portrait something that reminded her of nothing whether it did so or not to play on with undisturbed inspiration to lift never glance to his window and to go away without word look sign to any one when the least breath or motion would have brought him instantly into her sacred presence she was right she was not him there is ﬁtness of things and there was ﬁtnes him her and yet she must and would ever be more to him than any one else he would glory in going through life unloved while his soul lived in and on the phantom companionship of that vision of delight which she was and should ever be the midday bells sounded softly here and there he would walk i say he went slowly down the old rue bourbon he had hunger he would pass by the women s exchange there was nothing to stop there was not madame beausoleil in terrebonne and marguerite the guest of that chattering woman in silk and laces but when he reached the exchange doors he drifted in silently and supinely any would ﬂoat into the new crevasse the same cashier was still on duty she lighted up joyously he entered and when he had hung his hat near the door leaned forward to address him but with faint pain in his face and loathing in his heart he passed on and out into the veranda the place was well ﬁlled and he had to look about to ﬁnd seat the bare possibility that she might be there was overpowering there was total suspension of every sort of emotion he felt he took his chair and essayed to glance casually around light and unreal any one who ever walked the in dream the blood leaped in torrents through his veins and yet his movements he fumbled aimlessly with his knife fork and glass were slow and languid slender young waitress came rested her knuckles on the table and leaned on them let her opposite arm hang limply along the sidewise curve of her form and bending smile of angelic affection upon the young acadian said in conﬁdential undertone the cashier told to tell you those ladies have claude rose quickly and stood looking upon the face before him speechless it was to him exactly if man in uniform had laid hand upon his shoulder and said you re my prisoner then still gazing and aware of others looking at him he slowly sank again into his seat she just told to tell you said the damsel y es sir have you ordered humph he was still looking at her i say have you given your order pg 302 pg 303 the project gutenberg ebook of bonaventure by george washington cable https she paused awkwardly she knew he had not and saw that he was trying vainly to make her words mean something in his mind sha

into his outer pocket jar in time with the heavy thump thump thump beneath it the waitress staid an awful time at last she came i waited she sweetly said to get hot he drew the refreshments towards him mechanically the mere smell of food made him sick it seemed impossible that he should eat it she leaned over him lovingly and asked if referring to the attitude would you like any thing more sweet his ﬂesh crawled he bent over his plate shook his head and stirred his cof fee without having put any thing into it she tripped away and he drew breath of momentary relief leaned back in his chair and warily passed his eyes around to see if there was anybody who was not looking at him and waiting him to begin to eat ages speak with claude s rose took up his check and went to the desk the cashier leaned forward and said with soft blitheness they re here they re now claude answered never word he paid his check he waited change he cast another glance over the various groups at the tables all were strangers then he went out on the single sidewalk step he halted and red and blind with mortiﬁcation turned again into the place he had left his hat with one magniﬁcent effort at dignity and unconcern he went to the rack took down the hat and he lowered it towards his head cast last look down the room stood marguerite she had entered just in time it seemed to him but just too late in fact

electric light tarbox was really very brave man had he not been how could he have ventured something after the middle of that afternoon in his best attire up into claude s workroom he came to apologize but claude was not there he waited but the young man did not return the air was hot and still tarbox looked at his was quarter of ﬁve he rose and descended to the street looked up and down it and then moved briskly down to and across canal street and into bourbon he had an appointment claude had not gone back to his loft at all he was wandering up and down the streets about four he was in bienville street where the run through it on their way out to spanish fort beautiful some six miles away from the city s centre on the margin of lake pontchartrain he was listlessly crossing the way train came along and it was easy the habit of the aforetime brakeman to move him the last platform passed the crossing he reached out mechanically and swung aboard spanish fort is at the mouth of

and moved towards its centre his eyes still on the beautiful silent advance of the vessel with number of persons who had gathered from both ends of the bridge he paused and leaned over the rail the schooner with her crew looking up into the faces of the throng glided close by female form came beside him looking down with the rest and shedding upon the air the soft sweetness of perfumed robes masculine voice just beyond said thing of beauty is joy forever claude started and looked up and behold mar guerite on the arm of tarbox his movement drew their glance and the next instant tarbox beaming apology and pouring out glad greetings had him by the hand burning choking stammering claude heard and answered he knew not how the voice of the queen of all her kind another pair pressed forward to add their salutations they were zoséphine and the surveyor because the facilities entertaining male visitor were slender at the women s exchange because there was hope of more and cooler air at the because spanish fort was pretty and romantic spot and not so apt to be thronged west end and because marguerite she described it was tired of houses and streets and also because he had something to say to zoséphine tarbox had brought the pretty mother and daughter out here the engineer had met the three by chance only few minutes before and now the bridge closed again he passed zoséphine over to claude walked only little way with them down path among the shrubbery and then lifted his hat and withdrew once in his life tarbox he walked with marguerite in advance of claude and her mother was at loss what to say the drollness of the situation was in danger of overcoming him again behind him was claude his mind tossed on wild sea of doubts and suspicions i told him thought tarbox while the girl on his arm talked on in pretty broken english and sprightly haste about something he had lost the drift i told him i was courting josephine but i never proved it to him and now just look at this look at the whole sweet mess something has got to be he did not mean something direct and openhanded that would never have occurred to him he stopped and with marguerite faced the other pair one glance into claude s face darkened with perple xity anger and distressful effort to look amiable and comfortable was one too many tarbox burst into laugh pardon he exclaimed checking himself until he was red i just happen ed to think of something very funny that happened last week in beaus oleil i know it must look odd voice still trembled little but he kept sober and yet i must take just moment business claude can i see you they went step aside tarbox put on business frown and said to claude in low voice hi diddle diddle the cat and the ﬁddle the cow jumped over the moon the

old mother hubbard she went to the cupboard to get her poor dog bone but when she got there the t smile so bare and so the poor dog had none will that be satisfactory claude nodded and they turned again to their companions the exchange was made with the grace silence and calm unconsciousness of pure oversight of general complicity very soon it suited zoséphine and tarbox to sit down upon little bench beside bed of heart and listen to the orchestra but marguerite preferred to walk in and out among the leafy shadows of the electric lamps and so side by side he had once seen bonaventure and sidonie go they went claude and marguerite away from all windings of disappointment all shadows of doubt all shoals of pg 307 pg 308 pg 309 the project gutenberg ebook of bonaventure by george

wish what she replied softly and in the same tongue i wish he responded that this path might never he wondered at his courage and feared that now he had ruined all she made answer but when he looked down upon her she looked up and smiled little farthe r on she dropped her fan he stooped and picked it up and in restoring it somehow their hands touched and lingered and then one brief unspeakable moment maiden s hand the ﬁrst time in his life lay willingly in his then glad she was frightened marguerite said she must go back to her mother and they went chapter xxii double spanish est are well enough but if i might have one small part of new orleans to take with wherever i may wander in this earthly pilgrimage i should ask the old carrollton gardens they lie near the farthest upper limit of the expanded city i should want of course to include the levee under which runs one side of the gardens fence also the opposite shore of the mississippi with its just discernible plantation houses behind their levee and the great bend of the river itself with the sun setting in unutterable gorgeousness behind the distant pecan groves of point and the bronzed and purpled waters kissing the very crown of the great turfed levee down under whose land side the gardens blossom and give forth their hundred perfumes and bird songs to the children and lovers that haunt their winding alleys of oleander jasmine laurestine orange aloe and rose the grove of magnolias and oaks and come out upon the levee s top the sun sinks to catch the gentle breeze and see the twilight change to moonlight on the water one evening i sat on one of the levee benches here with one whose i am and who is mine beside we noticed on the water opposite us and near the farther shore large skiff propelled with two pairs of oars and containing besides the two rowers half dozen passengers then i remembered that i had seen the same craft when it was farther down the stream the river is of typical character about here coming around the upper bend the vast current sweeps across to this the carrollton side and strikes it just above the gardens with an incalculable gnawing tearing power hence the very high levee here the farther back the levee builders are driven by the corroding waters the lower the ground is under them and the higher they must build to reach the height they reached before from carrollton the current rebounds and swinging over to the other shore strikes it boiling like witch s caldron just above and along the place where you may descry the levee lock of the company canal i knew the waters all about there and knew that this skiff full of passengers some of whom we could see were women having toiled through the seething current below was now in broad eddy and if it was about to cross the stream would so only after it had gone some hundred yards farther up the river there it could cross almost with the current and so it did i had forgotten it again when presently it showed itself with all its freight silhouetted against the crimson sky i said quickly i believe bonaventure deschamps is in that boat pg 310 pg 311 pg 312 the project gutenberg ebook of bonaventure by george washington cable https was right the skiff landed and we saw its passengers step ashore they came along the levee s crown towards us by two by bonaventure was mated with young methodist preacher who had been my playmate in boyhood and who lived here in carrollton behind him came pierre and sidonie then followed claude and marguerite and behind all zoséphine and tarbox they had come they explained to us from funeral at the head of the canal they did not say the funeral of friend and yet i could see that every one of them even the preacher had shed tears the others had thought it best and pleasantest to accompany the minister thus far towards his home then take turn in the gardens and then take the the city s centre bonaventure and sidonie were to return next day by steamer to belle alliance and grande pointe the thoughtful tarbox had procured bonaventure s presence at the inquest of the day before the identifying witness thus to save zoséphine that painful ofﬁce and yet it was of zoséphine s own motion and by her sad insistence that she and her daughter followed the outcast to his grave yes she had said laying one hand in bonaventure s and the other in sidonie s and speaking in the old acadian tongue when i was young and proud i taught thanase to despise and tease him i did not know then that i was such coward myself if i had been better scholar bonaventure when we used to go to school to the curé better in the books merely but in those things that are so much better than the things books different all might have been thank god bonaventure one of us she turned to sidonie to add but that one was bonaventure we will all go the we will all go and bury vain the the inﬂuence of the sad ofﬁce they had just performed was on the group still they paused to give us the words of greeting we coveted yet we could see that certain sense of being very very rich in happiness was on them all though dif ferently on every one zoséphine wore the pear pearl the preacher said and started down the steps that used to lead from the levee down across pretty fountained court and into the town but my friend i must tell you i like to call him my friend and like it better every day we can t all be one sort you d like him if you knew him i friend tarbox beckoned to detain him christian i is the preacher s real name he turned back and met tarbox just where i stood they laid their arms across each other s shoulders in very meth odist way and i heard tarbox say i want to thank you once more we ve put you to good deal of trouble you gave us the best you had i ll never forget what you said about them who through fear of death are all their time subject to i wish you were catholic why so we could pay you your trouble i don t think you ought to take it hard if you get check in s thy money survive with thee said the preacher is that all you want to be priest isn t there another reason his eyes twinkled isn t there something else i could you or i should turn priest yes said tarbox with grave lips but merry eyes we ve both got to have in fact they had two yet i have it from her husband himself that madame tarbox insists to this day always with the same sweet dignity that she never did say yes on the other hand when claude and marguerite were kneeling at the altar the proud pierre senior spoke an audible and joyously impatient afﬁrmative every time either of them was asked question when the time came kissing sidonie turning from both brides kissed pierre the more that she kissed not claude then turned again and gave tear with the kiss she gave to zoséphine but the deepest gladdest tears at those nuptials were shed by bonaventure deschamps pg 313 pg 314 the project gutenberg ebook of bonaventure by george washington cable https acadians
