shall not know anything of his life and of the movements of thought that have made them possible if some indian traveller will not tell it seemed to him natural that i should be moved he said i read rabindranath every day to read one line of his is to forget all the troubles of the i said an englishman living in london in the reign of richard the second had he been shown translations from petrarch or from dante would have found books to answer his questions but would have questioned some florentine banker or lombard merchant i question you all i know so abundant and simple is this

nineteen when he wrote his ﬁrst novel and plays when he was but little older are still played in calcutta i so much admire the completeness of his life when he was very young he wrote much of natural objects he would sit all day in his garden from his year or so to his perhaps when he had great sorrow he wrote the most beautiful love poetry in our language and then he said with deep emotion words can never express what i owed at seventeen to his love poetry after that his art grew deeper it became religious and philosophical all the inspiration of mankind are in his hymns he is the ﬁrst among our saints who has not refused to live but has spoken out of life itself and that is why we give him our i may have changed his words in my memory but not his thought little while ago he was to read

maha rishi would sometimes sit there all through the next day once upon river he fell into contemplation because of the beauty of the landscape and the rowers waited eight hours before they could

gogonendranath and abanindranath tagore who are artists and dwijendranath rabindranath s brother who is great philosopher the squirrels come from the boughs and climb on to his knees and the birds alight upon his i notice in these men s thought sense of visible beauty and meaning though they held that doctrine of nietzsche that we must not believe in the moral or intellectual beauty which does not sooner or later impress itself upon physical things i said in the east you know how to keep family illustrious the other day the curator of museum pointed out to little man who was arranging their chinese prints and said that is the hereditary connoisseur of the mikado he is the fourteenth of his family to hold the he answered when rabindranath was boy he had all round him in his home literature and i thought of the abundance of the simplicity of the poems and said in your country is there much propagandist writing much criticism we have to so much especially in my own country that our minds gradually cease to be creative and yet we can not help it if our life was not continual warfare we would not have taste we would not know what is good we would not ﬁnd hearers and readers of our energy is spent in the quarrel with bad taste whether in our own minds or in the minds of i understand he replied we too have our propagandist writing in the villages they recite long mythological poems adapted from the sanskrit in the middle ages and they often insert passages telling the people that they must their i i i have carried the manuscript of these translations about with days reading it in railway trains or on the top of omnibuses and in restaurants and i have often had to close it lest some stranger would see how much it moved these which are in the original my indians tell full of subtlety of rhythm of untranslatable delicacies of colour of metrical display in their thought world i have dreamed of all my live long the work of supreme culture they yet appear much the growth of the common soil the grass and the rushes tradition where poetry and religion are the same thing has passed through the centuries gathering from learned and unlearned metaphor and emotion and carried back again to the multitude the thought of the scholar and of the noble if the civilization of bengal remains unbroken if that common mind one through all is not with us broken into dozen minds that know nothing of each other something even of what is most subtle in these verses will have come in few generations to the beggar on the roads when there was but one mind in england chaucer wrote his troilus and cressida and thought he had written to be read or to be read our time was coming on was sung by minstrels while rabindranath tagore like chaucer s forerunners writes music his words and one understands at every moment that he is so abundant so spontaneous so daring in his passion so full of surprise because he is doing something which has never seemed strange unnatural or in need of defence these verses will not lie in little books upon ladies tables who turn the pages with indolent the project gutenberg ebook of gitanjali by rabindranath tagore https they may sigh over life without meaning which is yet all they can know of life or be carried by students at the university to be laid aside when the work of life begins but the generations pass travellers will hum them on the highway and men rowing upon the rivers lovers while they await one another shall ﬁnd in murmuring them this love of god magic gulf wherein their own more bitter passion may bathe and renew its youth at every moment the heart of this poet ﬂows outward to these without derogation or condescension it has known that they will understand and it has ﬁlled itself with the circumstance of their lives the traveller in the clothes that he wears that dust may not show upon him the girl searching in her bed the petals fallen from the wreath of her royal lover the servant or the bride awaiting the master s in the empty house are images of the heart turning to god flowers and rivers the blowing of conch shells the heavy rain of the indian july or the moods of that heart in union or in separation and man sitting in boat upon river playing lute like one of those ﬁgures full of mysterious meaning in chinese picture is god himself whole people whole civilization immeasurably strange to us seems to have been taken up into this imagination and yet we are not moved because of its strangeness but because we have met our own image though we had walked in rossetti s willow wood or heard perhaps the ﬁrst time in literature our voice in dream since the renaissance the writing of european familiar their metaphor and the general structure of their has ceased to hold our attention we know that we must at last forsake the world and we are accustomed in moments of weariness or exaltation to consider voluntary forsaking but how can we who have read so much poetry seen so many paintings listened to so much music where the cry of the ﬂesh and the cry of the soul seems one forsake it harshly and rudely what have we in common with bernard covering his eyes that they may not dwell upon the beauty of the lakes of switzerland or with the violent rhetoric of the book of revelations we would if we might ﬁnd in this book words full of courtesy i have got my leave bid farewell my brothers

give now the day has dawned and the lamp that lit my dark corner is out summons has come and i am ready my journey and it is our own mood when it is furthest from kempis or john of the cross that cries and because i love this life i know i shall love death yet it is not only in our thoughts of the parting that this book fathoms all we had not known that we loved god hardly it may be that we believed in him yet looking backward upon our life we discover in our explo ration of the pathways of woods in our delight in the lonely places of hills in that mysterious claim that we have made unavailingly on the woman that we have loved the emotion that created this insidious sweetness entering my heart unbidden even one of the common crowd unknown to my king thou didst press the signet of

weight in the world and always humbly though he were only sure his way is best him men going home glance at and smile and ﬁll with shame i sit like beggar maid drawing my skirt over my face and when they ask what it is i want i drop my eyes and answer them at another time remembering how his life had once different shape he will say many an hour i have spent in the strife of the good and the evil but now it is the pleasure of my playmate of the empty days to draw my heart on to him and i know not why this sudden call to what useless an innocence simplicity that one does not ﬁnd elsewhere in literature makes the birds and the leaves seem near to him they are near to children and the changes of the seasons great events before our thoughts had arisen between them and us at times i wonder if he has it from the literature of bengal or from religion and at other times remembering the birds alighting on his brother s hands i ﬁnd pleasure in thinking it hereditary mystery that was growing through the centuries like the courtesy of tristan or pelan indeed when he is speaking of children so much part of himself this quality seems one is not certain that he is not also speaking of the
