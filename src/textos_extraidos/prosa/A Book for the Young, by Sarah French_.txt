man is born to trouble the sparks ﬂy upward but let ask is there not vast amount made by ourselves and we not often take it up in anticipation too often indulge and give way to it when by cheerful resignation we might if not wholly avert yet greatly nullify its power to mar our peace mind i now speak of and minor troubles not those coming immediately from god are we not guilty of ingratitude in

which led into veran covered with clematis and the elder of the two might be about ﬁfty perhaps not so much her features bore traces of suffering and sadness which plainly told that sorrow had planted far deeper wrinkles there than time alone could have done the younger an interesting girl of nineteen bore strong resemblance to her mother they were both dressed in deep mourning the room which they occupied though plainly and simply furnished had yet an air of taste and elegance fortescue was the widow of an ofﬁcer who died of cholera in the east indies leaving her with one daughter and other means of support than small annuity and her pension an old servant of her own had married corporal in the same regiment who having purchased his dischar ge now followed the trade of carpenter to which he had been brought up previous to enlisting and was settled in his native place and the faithful hannah hearing of the captain death wrote to fortescue telling her not only of the beauty of the spot but the cheapness of living in that part of the world concluding by saying house was then vacant and could be had on very reasonable terms fortescue immediately wrote and engaged it though common looking building yet by putting veranda round and making few alterations inside it soon with little painting and papering was transformed into pretty cottage the work required was an advantage to fortescue inasmuch it occupied her mind and thus prevented her dwelling on her recent afﬂiction in other respects too she felt that kind providence had directed her steps to the little village in which we ﬁnd the good she found to was the greatest balm her wounded spirit could receive though her means were so limited still wide ﬁeld of usefulness lay before her book the young by sarah french https fortescue had strong mind and though her trial was hard very hard to bear she remembered from whom it came and not murmur escaped her devotedly attached to her husband she deeply lamented her loss still she sorrowed not one without hope she had the consolation of knowing few were better prepared the change and she strove to take comfort in reﬂecting how greatly her grief would have been augmented were not such the case but she felt that her shield had been taken from her and knowing how precarious was her own health she saw how desolate would be her child should it please god to remove her also but true christian can not mourn long and the tears of agony would force themselves down her cheek and her feelings almost overpower her she ﬂew to her bible and in its gracious promises to the afﬂicted found that support and consolation the mere worldling can neither judge of nor taste some delay though actual doubt to ultimately obtaining her pension had caused inconvenience all their ready money had been absorbed in the alterations of their house though they had observed the utmost economy and demands were made which they had not at the time funds to meet ethelind was miserable but fortescue bore against all trusting something would turn up so it did while discussing the matter letter came with an enclosure from an old school fellow begging them to procure her board and lodging in the village few months intimating how much she would like it if they could accommodate her themselves the terms the ﬁrst quarter were highly remunerative and they gladly acceded to miss trevor proposition and the few requis ite preparations being made we will if our reader pleases go back to the evening when mother and daughter sat awaiting the arrival of their new inmate fortescue had never seen beatrice trevor but ethelind was loud in her praises they sat in anxious expectation much beyond the usual time the arrival of the stage and were just giving her up the night when the rumbling of wheels was heard and post chaise drove up out of which sprang young lady who in another moment was clasped in ethelind arms and introduced to her mother who welcomed her most kindly oh what little paradise said beatrice looking round her how happy you must be here ethelind let have one peep outside ere daylight is gone so saying she darted through the french casement on to the lawn which sloped down to the water edge well i declare this is perfect elysium i am so glad i made up my mind to come here instead of going with the fultons to cheltenham i am indeed rejoiced that you are so pleased with our retreat my dear miss trevor it is indeed lovely spot miss trevor if you please my dear madam it must be plain beatrice and you must regard you ethelind and be mother to i know i greatly need monitress you will ﬁnd i fear sad giddy fortescue smiling benignly promised acquiescence and taking her hand which she grasped affectionately led her into the next room where tea was waiting after which ethelind took her up stairs and showed her the little bedroom prepared her they remained here some time chatting over their old school days till summoned to prayers on taking leave the night fortescue begged if at all heavy in the morning that beatrice would not hurry up but she arose early much refreshed and delighted with all she saw ethelind soon joined her and offered to help her unpack and arrange her things while the only servant they had prepared the breakfast soon the morning meal was over and little necessary arrangements made ethelind proposed ramble which was gladly acceded to on the part of beatrice they passed through an orchard into lane and they crossed rustic bridge the village church came in view it was small gothic structure standing in the burial ground and they approached it beatrice was struck with admiration at the beds of ﬂowers then blooming in full perfection on the graves this is very beautiful and by means uncommon sight in south wales but she had never seen it before well i declare this is lovely really book the young by sarah french https to render the charm of romance complete you ought to have very interesting young curate with pale features and dark hair and eyes and so we have said ethelind and had he sat his picture you could not have drawn more correct likeness but i regret to say barclay stay is not likely to be permanent one of lord eardly sons is to have the living soon the family returns from the continent which we are all sorry short the time is that barclay has been among us he is generally liked and from his manner we think the curacy little it is an object to him though even now he does great deal of good and you would hardly believe all he has accomplished i wish he were here i am sure you would like him i think said beatrice it is well he is not i might fall in love with him and then and then what asked ethelind why it must end in disappointment to both if he is poor and i am poor it would be little use our coming together but were i rich i expected to have been then i might have set my cap at your young curate and rewarded his merit oh said ethelind he deserves to be rich he would make such good use of wealth even now he is very charitable charitable beatrice curate on perhaps less than hundred year must have deal to be charitable with absur d i grant you he may have the heart but certainly not the means i know not said ethelind but i hear continually of the good he does and his kindness to the poor and doubt if the honourable frederic eardly will much out upon these proud scions of nobility i have not common patience with the younger members of the aristocracy taking holy orders solely the sake of aggrandizing the elder branches of the family they are rarely actuated by pious motives we had only one service till barclay came and now he ofﬁciates morning and evening besides managing to duty in the afternoon sick clergyman who lives ﬁve miles of f and has lar ge family two of whom our worthy curate educates more ethelind or my heart will be irrecoverably gone but what large house is that i see among the trees that is eardly house and the family ever reside there they have not since we have been in this part of the world but when in england i am told they spend part of every summer here and if they come they will spoil both our pleasure and our privacy say what you will great people are nuisance in small village to those who are situated like us i grant it is unpleasant but they may great deal of good to their poor tenants but hark it is striking two dinner hour will wonder what is become of us there is short cut through the park which we will take it will save at least quarter of mile so through the park they went and they left it to cross the road gentleman suddenly turned the corner and barclay stood full before them why barclay exclaimed ethelind where in the name of wonder did you come from did you rise from the lake or drop from the clouds i thought you were many book the young by sarah french https and so i expected to be said he shaking hands with her and bowing to beatrice but circumstances wholly unexpected compelled to return and are you going to remain some months i believe i am really glad to hear it and so i am sure will mamma be but in the agreeable surprise your unlooked return gave i forgot to introduce miss trevor the conversation now took general turn and barclay accompanied them to their door where he only staid to shake hands with fortescue and then took his leave promising to return in the evening may naturally be supposed many weeks followed of delightful intercou rse barclay when ever it did not interfere with his duties was the constant attendant of ethelind and beatrice he spent every evening at fortescue cottage affording much speculation to the village gossips to which of the two young ladies would ultimately become the curate choice with their aid he carried out his much cherished object of establishing sunday school and everything was going on quietly till at length an unusual bustle was observed in the village artizans of every description were sent from london and the news was soon spread that after the necessary repairs and preparations were completed the family might be expected this was anything but welcome intelligence to ethelind and beatrice who feared all their enjoyment would be disturbed when barclay came in the evening he conﬁrmed the report and little else was talked of it is really provoking said ethelind i am quite of beatrice opinion and think great folks anything but desirable in such small place at least to people circumstanced we are i am of opinion said mr barclay you will ﬁnd it quite the reverse shall you remain curate asked fortescue frederic eardly purposes to make poor bennet his curate but if he is so ill he will not be able to the duty said beatrice it is not hard and eardly is well able to it himself but will he said she i really feel curious to see how this embryo bishop will get on i suppose nothing less is the object of his taking orders oh miss trevor judge not so harshly is it not possible that in singleness of heart he may have gone into the church unmindful of all but the sacred calling i not pretend to judge but i believe worldly honour or pecuniary consideration inﬂuenced his choice i know his grandfather left him quite independent oh tell barclay it is very unlikely but it is natural that you should take his part because what responded barclay you think money or interes t would prompt to say what i think or mean said beatrice i think you the last person in the world to truckle to the great but more of this what kind of being is this frederic eardly book the young by sarah french https i am poor judge of character besides you would hardly give credit being impartial they say he is spoilt by his mother and sisters by whom he is perfectly idolized and to whom he is in return devotedly attached come that and helping poor bennet are certainly very redeeming traits but will his giving him preference be doing justice to you who have done so much and will it here feeling she was going too far she coloured barclay too was much confused and beatrice was greatly relieved when fortescue turned the conversation she had long remarked to herself there was mystery about barclay which she could not understand there was at times reserve she attributed to pride if not well born he was quite au fait in all the usages of society he never spoke of his family but fortescue once asked him if he had any sisters when he replied two such any brother might be proud of but while he spoke the blood mantled in his forehead and fearing it might result from pride she dropped the subject and the future avoided saying anything that might recall it trusting that in time she might win his conﬁdence almost unconsciously to herself was ethelind under the garb of friendship indulging preference from which her delicacy shrank she could plainly see growing attachment in barclay to beatrice and could not moment suppose he could be insensible to her friend fascinations which certainly were very great she was the more convinced that barclay loved beatrice his manners evidently changed and at times he was absent and thoughtful and she sometimes fancied unhappy once it struck her his affections might be engaged elsewhere and that beatrice had shaken his faith to her to whom it was plighted she observed beatrice using all her efforts to attract and win barclay and yet she doubted if she were sincere many things in her conduct led to this conclusion and showed little coquetry in her disposition be it it may she met barclay attentions more than half way and seemed never in such spirits when with him at any rate poor ethelind delicacy took the alarm and she resolved to crush her own growing attachment in the bud and hide her feelings in reserve and so great was her that her love mr barclay was unsuspected by all save her mother beatrice and ethelind were returning one evening from long walk and being very tired they sat down on bank facing the towy to rest themselves and watch the setting sun sink behind the undulating mountains that almost surrounded them they were some minutes so absorbed in the scene before them that neither spoke at last beatrice exclaimed what pity it is ethelind that you and barclay never took it into your heads to fall in love with each other you would make such capital cler gyman wife beatrice said ethelind why talk thus you mean to say that you have been insensible to his attachment to you i not mean to say that replied she but i can assure you that if there is such feeling it is only on his side and yet you have not only received but met his attentions with such evident pleasure and given him such decided encouragement now ethy how could i resist ﬂirtation with such an interesting character oh beatrice did you never think of the pain you might inﬂict by leading him to suppose his af fection was reciprocated never my consciencious little ethelind he is too poor nay too good to think seriously of becoming his wife book the young by sarah french https oh beatrice i thought you had more noble heart than to triﬂe with the affections of such man particularly now there is chance of recovering your property you might be so happy and make him so too and you think if i recover it i should throw myself away on poor curate and that i should like to lead such quiet life my dear girl i was never made to appreciate such goodness or imitate it either then of course you will alter your conduct ere you go too far and not render him wretched perhaps life of course i shall such thing his attentions are too pleasing it does not appear he will be here long so i must make the most of the time oh beatrice think what havoc you may make in the happiness of worthy man look at his character see his exemplary conduct and could you the paltry gratiﬁcation of your vanity condemn him to the pangs of unrequited love he has now i fear the ills of poverty to struggle against did you notice his emotion when speaking of his mother and sisters perhaps they are dependant on him must not shall not triﬂe with him thus and why not dearest ethelind i shall really begin to suspect you like him yourself oh that tell tale blush how it becomes you i think said ethelind any one would colour at such an accusation well then to be honest i have heart to give heart to give surely you are not engaged and act thus i am indeed cruel heartless beatrice said ethelind you can not mean what you say i most solemnly afﬁrm it but i will tell you all bye and bye now i can not i am smarting too much under you severe philippic you shall indeed know all t said the thoughtless girl let us go home your mother will be waiting tea and barclay with her how can you face one you have so injured said ethelind i could not when you see little more of the world you will call these little ﬂirtations very venial errors i hope said ethelind i shall never call wrong right or right wrong neither i trust shall i ever act if i thought so they reached home and found tea ready but barclay was not there nor did he visit them that evening but about eight fortescue received note begging her to excuse him he had so much to attend to preparatory to the family coming to the park they saw more of him during the week on sunday he looked ethelind thought very pale coming out of church he spoke to her mother and she thought there was tremor in his voice he spoke if concealing some internal emotion they made many conjectures to the cause of this extraordinary conduct but both fortescue and ethelind felt certain there must be some good reason caprice had never since they had known him formed any part of his conduct they were therefore obliged to come to the conclusion that if they knew it they would ﬁnd he had good reason his conduct to ethelind when he met her alone his manner was friendly ever but she fancied he had often avoided them when she and beatrice were together sometimes she suspected book the young by sarah french https beatrice sincerity he sent books and fruit to fortescue usual but rarely went to the cottage and if he did always timed his visits so to go when the younger ladies were out he would however saunter home with ethelind if alone after the duties of the sunday school and consult her on many of his plans in short he daily became more like his former self the fact was that the day on which beatrice and ethelind held the discussion he had started to meet them but feeling tired sat down to rest on the very same bank they afterwards occupied but the sun shining fully on it he had retreated behind large tree and having fallen asleep was awakened by their talking and thus became an unintentional auditor of their conversation it was thunderbolt to him to hear beatrice acknowledge herself positively engaged and yet wilfully resolve to encourage his attentions and thus triﬂe with his feelings before beatrice came he had been much pleased with the unaffected manner of ethelind whose character he highly respected but her reserve made him conclude she was indifferent to him but how did she rise in his estimation he heard the conversation not word of her advice to beatrice was lost on him and he only wondered he had not done her more justice how grateful he felt the noble indignation she expressed at her friend levity and the honest warmth with which she took his part and strove it were to prevent his being betrayed by the heartless coquetry of beatrice he regarded all that had occurred special intervention of providence to save him from future misery his regard beatrice was daily increasing and believing her good and amiable he desired to win the affection which he fully thought was reciprocal and how did the discovery of her treachery dash the cup of happiness from his lips but it was because he believed her truly amiable that he loved her he thought now the veil was drawn aside he should soon get over his disappointment but unworthy she was she had so entwined herself in his heart that it was easy task to tear her image from he was and soon reﬂected that instead of grieving he ought to be thankful his escape ethelind saw he was wretched and fancied beatrice was some how or other the cause she pitied him and prayed him but it was all she could but she was not sorry to hear beatrice say she had an invitation to miss fulton wedding which she was determined to accept the night previous to her departure barclay unasked remained to tea and when he took leave he put letter into the hand of beatrice which she slipped into her pocket she thought unseen by any one but ethelind saw it though she took notice nor did beatrice mention it before retiring to rest she read follows m y d ear m iss t revor i should ill act up to that fearless line of duty my sacred calling prescribes were i not friend to urge you to reﬂect on your present line of conduct and ask you to pause on it ere you wreck not only the happiness of others but your own at the shrine of inordinate vanity shall i honestly own that mine has narrowly escaped being wrecked and that from your own lips i learnt such was the case believing you good and amiable you seemed i was fascinated and allowed my feelings to outrun my judgment and yet i can hardly say that such was the case i thought you all woman should be let warn and entreat you on all future occasions you wish to be happy to deal fairly and truly with him who may seek to win your affection i was an unwilling listener to your conversation with miss fortescue the other day and there from your own lips learnt that while engaged to another you scrupled not to receive and encourage my attentions and more than that you declared your resolution of holding out hopes you never meant to realize had i known you were bound to another whatever my feelings had been you i had never sought to win your love but i fully believed you ingenuous you seemed had you not met the advances so sincerely made by with such seeming pleasure whatever the struggle might have cost it had passed in silence i will candidly own that while my respect is lessened i can not forget what book the young by sarah french https towards you have been time alone can heal the peace of mind you have so recklessly wounded but i again advise you to reﬂect seriously on the past and be assured that she who pursues such line of conduct you have done will ever ﬁnd it militate against her own happiness well that of others and i fear it has done so in the present instance while smarting under the bitter feelings your behaviour called forth i wrote to an intimate friend and spoke of my disappointment and the struggle i had to obtain such mastery over myself would prevent it interfering with my duty unfortunately that friend was the very man to whom you are engaged which i did not know at the time nor am i prepared to say if i had how i should have acted geor ge graham is an honourable fellow who believed you faithful himself thus has your thoughtless nay i will go farther and say highly culpable levity sacriﬁced the happiness of two honest hearts ever beat in the human breast i would say i pity you but i can hardly expect your own peace to have suf fered mine is responsible and sacred calling and feeling it to be such i want when i marry woman who will aid not hinder in my arduous duties i have far human inﬁrmity permits done with the world and its pleasures but i am but mortal and who knows to what frivolity nay to what sin but the merciful interposition of god you might have led and that while bound to teach and guide others i might in my daily conduct have contradicted the truths i was bound to enforce on ﬁrst coming to reside here i was much pleased with miss fortescue and i felt that with her i could be happy but her reserve made fancy her indifferent to and i judged she could not return my love and while her conduct increased my esteem i resolved that i would not forfeit her friendship by persevering in attentions i feared she cared not you came your beauty struck your fascinating manners made an impression i could not resist your seeming pleasure in my attentions misled and my heart was enslaved ere my judgment could act but more you have yourself undrawn the veil and humbly i thank the merciful prov idence that has thus things and interfered to save i hardly know what you can scarcely wonder that i avoided you after what i heard and it was not till i could sufﬁciently command my feelings to stay at fortescue and see you it is not that i still love you i can not love the woman i longer respect i not hate you but i sincerely pity you and humbly and fervently i pray that you may ere too late see the errors of your conduct you by your own confession deem coquetry venial error can that be such from which come such cruel and mischievous results but more i forgive you most freely and shall ever fervently pray that you may see and feel how inimical to peace here well hereafter is such conduct you have shown ever your sincere friend f words can justice to the agony of beatrice feelings she read the foregoing letter she was thunderstruck here was blow to her happiness how completely was she caught in her own toils she could but feel the retribution just of all men she knew geor ge graham to be one of the most fastidious and that of all things he held the most despicable she well knew was coquette she loved him with passionate devotion but knew if the effort cost him his life he would cast her from his affections she was almos t maddened with the

came ﬂashing down and the forky streak of lightning bolt lit up the gloomy town the thunders crashed across the heaven the fatal hour was come book the young by sarah french https aye broke in with mufﬂed beat the of the drum there was madness on the earth below and anger in the sky and young and old and rich and poor came forth to see him die oh god that ghastly gibbet how dismal is to see the great spectral the ladder and the tree hark hark the clash of arms the bells begin to toll he is coming he is coming god have mercy on his soul one last long peal of thunder the clouds are cleared away and the glorious sun once more look down upon the dazzling day he is coming he is coming like bridegroom from his room came the hero from his prison to the scaf fold and the doom there was glory on his forehead there was lustre in his eye and he never walked to battle more proudly than there was colour in his visage though the cheeks of all were wan and they marvelled he passed them that great and goodly man he mounted up the scaf fold and he turned him to the crowd but they dared not trust the people so he might not speak aloud but he look up toward heaven and it all was clear and blue and in the liquid ether the eye of god shone through yet black and murky battlement lay resting on the hill though the thunder slept therein all else was calm and still then radiant and serene he rose and cast his cloak away he had taken his latest look of earth and sun and day beam of light fell him like glory round the shriven and he climbed the lofty ladder it were path to heaven then came ﬂash from out the cloud and stunning thunder roll and man dared to look book the young by sarah french https was on every soul there was another heavy sound hush groan and darkness swept across the sky the work of death was done ghost story the young my d ear c harles when i promised to write to you during the holidays i little thought i should have so much to put in my letter i actually fancied it would be difﬁcult to ﬁnd enough to ﬁll one sheet and now i really believe two will not be sufﬁcient all i have to say but to commence my story which you must know is real ghost story but to begin while we were at breakfast the other morning papa showed mamma an advertisement in the times newspaper remarking at the same time that it appeared just the thing he had long wanted and that he would go to the solicitor and make enquiries and if it seemed still eligible would go immediately and see about it upon asking what it was i was told it was an estate in south wales to be disposed of on which was large commodious dwelling house which at triﬂing expence might be converted into family mansion it commanded the paper said picturesque view with plenty of shooting and further stated that on one part of the grounds were the ruins of castle and great deal more in its favor but you know the glowing descriptions with which these great london auctioneers always set of f any property they have to dispose of papa had every reason to be satisﬁed that it was what he desired so it was settled he should start by railway that very evening and you may judge how delighted i was when he asked if i should like to accompany him you may be sure i did not refuse so we got ready and started by the eight train we travelled all night and arrived at our destination about four next day papa thought i should sleep during the night but i found it impossible gentleman whom we met in the cars knew the place and said so much in favour of it that i could think of nothing else but he admitted there was drawback and that great prejudice existed against it which caused little difﬁculty in the disposal of it was reported to be haunted and one or two people who had bought it had actually paid money to get off the bargain of course hearing this my mind dwelt much on it though i said nothing lest i might be suspected of being afraid now you know it is not little frightens at school but i was greatly puzzled at all i heard and determined i would rally my courage after dinner we strolled out to take look at the proposed purchase papa was very much pleased with all he saw house grounds and prospect were he said all he could wish and not even the report of ghost did he consider any disadvantage but quite the contrary he certainly would never else be able to buy it double the sum they now asked it by the time we got back to the inn davis our landlady had learnt the purport of our visit and we consequently found her in great consternation book the young by sarah french https hardly entered than she exclaimed why surely sir you are not going to buy castle hill why it is haunted sure my name is peggy davis well my dear madam said papa haunted or not such is my present intention why sir nobody can live there you know there ghost seen there every night oh replied papa we shall soon i think send the ghost of f packing send ghost off packing really sir you must pardon but you are strange gentleman dear dear why you know that four or ﬁve have tried to live there and could the ghost would let you may laugh but it real truth that it drove every mother son away yes not one of them could stay well my good davis we shall soon see whether i can or not at any rate i shall try well you certainly are gentleman and you must please remember whatever comes of it i warned you why there was james reece bold reckless fellow and very wicked one into the bargain who feared nothing nor nobody agreed ﬁve pounds to stay the night and was never heard of any more and some go so far to say his ghost has been seen alongside the others once or twice the others repeated papa why you mean to say there is more than one yes sure sir two or three but is use telling you i really think you are unbelieving jew and away trotted the old dame talking to herself fast she chatted to papa the next morning after another ineffectual effort from davis to persuade him to give it up papa went and concluded what appeared to him an excellent bargain with the lawyer who was too anxious to serve his employer not to try and make light of the reports and not only this but to ﬁx papa so that he could not possibly retract he came to the inn and dined with us poor davis appeared rather in awe of him she never spoke word but she came in and out with different things she gave papa some very signiﬁcant looks but always behind crawford back sooner had that gentleman left us than papa told he had made up his mind to take possession of his new purchase by passing the night in the haunted house charles you are my most intimate friend and therefore i may open my heart to you and tell you honestly but mind not word to the other boys when we get back to school that my heart began to fail i know it ought not i had been taught better things and should not have suffered myself to have been inﬂuenced by an ignorant old woman there was bedstead left in one of the rooms put up by gentleman who had nearly bought the place and who hearing such dreadful stories determined to try and pass night there ere he ﬁnally closed people said he heard such strange noises and saw such odd sights that he ran away book the young by sarah french https returned the bed and bedding had the country people believed all vanished at the bidding of the ghost indeed some scrupled not to say that he had himself been spirited away papa said when he heard it that most likely he was ashamed of his cowardice and that this prevented his going again to the village papa sent davis or griffy davis his wife was pleased to call him but the old body herself came and entreated of papa not to try and entice him to accompany us it seems that papa cool and determined manner had made great impression on griffy who perhaps got more sceptical on these matters on account of it davis was so importunate on the subject that she obtained the desired assurance that griffeth davis should not be directly or indirectly tempted to encou nter the ghost or ghosts the case might be the old man soon came and you would have laughed to see the old dame rubicond face with her large grey eyes peering over his shoulder notwithstanding the promise given she had some doubts that he might be induced to try his prowess in the haunte d chamber papa asked him if he knew any strong bodied young man whom good sum of money would induce to accompany him and stay the night griffy scratched his head and pondered some short time till at length he said he knew but one at all likely they were he said all so plaguey timerous or timm ersome i believe was the word but he thought davy evans might go if well paid if he were certain papa would remain too but another doubt was started davy had talked of taking some cattle to fair some miles off and might be gone however it turned out that he was on hand and agreeable to go with the understanding that he was to have his money even if papa was conquered by the ghost or had to run his ghostship this was soon obviated by papa depositing the money in davis hands an arrangement that seemed to give great satisfaction to davy the next difﬁculty was the bedding necessary this davis never expected to see it again had to be paid davy evans seemed stout stalwart fellow who had rather good countenance papa who had put the same question before again asked if he were sure he was not afraid oh sir said davy not bit thank god i never intentionally harmed man woman or child or wronged them that i of in any way and therefore i may trust in providence go wherever i will and i certainly ai afraid of the ghosts up there but your courage may fail you my friend at the last there nothing like trying sir i have been in these parts long and i know there strange noises to be heard but then little noise breaks bones and ca hurt and to ghost why seeing its made of air that ca much mischief either especially to ﬂesh and blood can it now well my friend we try the question however very soon said my father i must own charles i again began to feel little queer and i think papa noticed it he told to please myself to going with him or staying at the inn i was nervous though i felt sure nothing could really harm and then i recollected i should always repent if my courage failed so i said boldly out i shall certainly go with you papa very well my son but even now if you had rather stay behind i promise not to reﬂect on you afterwards therefore act just your feelings prompt you i am myself so fully persuaded that not anything supernatural book the young by sarah french https will harm us that i am determined to ﬁnd out what can have led to such extraordinary reports but papa you not think ghosts are sometimes to be seen frederic said he i will not pretend to say what guilty conscience or imagination may have conjured up and fancied but i have neither i not expect to see anything supernatural but i said before having heard so much about the mysteries of this place i think that even had i not made the purchase i should like to ﬁnd them out but if you see the ghost papa will you then believe in such things wait till fred these are silly suppositions religious well educated boy to make from whom far better things might be expected now only reﬂect moment and then ask yourself what good can these appearances i really now began to be quite ashamed of myself and thought i was not only foolish but wicked in giving credence to the superstitious nonsense i had heard davis now coming in with some things papa had ordered to take with him again ventured to say she hoped he would not repent going to castle hill adding she would pay every attention to the young gentleman meaning myself in his absence if i am not mistaken he would rather accompany davis he has been early taught to fear nothing but acting wickedly and i feel very sure be will not shrink from passing the night where i however he can please himself davis actually looked aghast and though i again expressed my readiness and determination to go i own i was little very little afraid well it must be you please i see you are gentleman not very soon turned when you make up your mind to thing what time may we expect this said ghost to visit us when does it usually appear why sir generally they say from twelve till two well you may smile said she seeing papa unable to control his features but its not once i have warned you nor twice either you have done so said papa and i feel certainly much obliged by your kind intentions i always heard the welsh were superstitious but could not have believed they carried it to such an extent you in this neighbourhood it may be so but you are so very unbel ieving may be you believe in corpse candles oh yes when they lighted i and ai they always lighted what you mean said papa are they not the lights you burn during the night while dead body lies unburied book the young by sarah french https bless your innocent heart the corpse candies are seen burning and moving of themselves afore people die coming down the roads from the houses they live in warning warning what my dear davis what earthly purpose can they answer have we not warning enough in the daily events of our lives to impress us with the instability of life and yet how rarely does death ﬁnd us prepared well well you may be unbelieving you like and talk you will i shall always believe when i see corpse candle there be death but just wait till you pass one night in castle hill may be you tell dif ferent story then the long and the short of the matter davis is this i liked the property and have bought it and am determined to reside in it if god spares my life to the ghost or ghosts i am well persuaded that although some natural causes may render the house and premises untenable supernatural ones i am sure have nothing to with it time passed on and the clock struck eight the hour ﬁxed on to leave the inn castle hill when papa brought large trunk and basket which he had tried to ﬁx on davy shoulders but strong he was he was unable to carry them both he therefore got wheel barrow the trunk while papa and i carried the basket between us and off we started great concourse of people were at the door many of whom accom panied us to the foot of the hill and there left us we went in and took up our quarters in the room in which was the bedstead and which was considered to be the most constant rendezvous of the ghost davy lighted good ﬁre and found table and three chairs one of which however proved rickety so davy had to seat himself on the trunk to our surprise we found the bedstead not in the same place in which we saw it in the morning this rather at least so i thought astonished papa however he made comment on the circumstance papa had taken care to bring good supper he also brought large pair of pistols and we had blunderbuss the latter the property of our friend davy these with sword he arranged to his own satisfaction under the pillow and in about an hour we sat down to good and substantial supper davy offered to replace what was left in the basket but papa jokingly told him to leave it the ghost we now sat nearly an hour and half and except some occasional out burst of merriment davy told us some droll things about the ghost which were current in the village we were still we well could be at last i got very sleepy well i migh t it was nearly twelve papa made lie down and said he thought he would so himself not thinking he said it was necessary to shew so much courtesy to the ghost wait it we did not undress davy ﬁxed himself before the ﬁre and soon gave proof that he was asleep by snoring most loudly mind my dear charles in giving you this account that papa told about it afterwards i had fallen asleep too till ﬁve minutes to twelve all was quiet the grave and then commenced the slamming of the doors and knockings and thumpings if done with the instrument the paviours use to beat down the stones they pave with this continued some minutes and then the door gradually opened and female tall and thin entered dressed in an old fashioned yellow brocade with sweeping train over her head was thrown an immense gauze veil her features were sharp and she was very pale she paused she entered and advancing book the young by sarah french https from the door to the bed she again made full stop upon which papa rose up and sat on the bed when she threw out her arms exclaiming impious and daring mortal why presumest thou to intrude here where none like thee are permitted to come of all those who have attempted it none have ever been left to tell the tale indeed said my father advancing towards her i trust you will make an exception however hold said she nor dare come nigh to one whose nature is so different to thine own aye said my father who then and what art thou not ﬂesh and blood thou art again i ask rash mortal why are thou here i remained this night madam in the hopes of meeting you that i might inform you that having purchased this property i purpose residing on it at least six months of the year consequently i must request you and your friends supernatural or human to quit the place altogether many before said she have tried but vainly to retain possession and to attempt it would be fatal enough said my father drawing pistol from belt under his coat if you are really of spiritual nature my weapon will be harmless if you are not the consequences be upon your own head he spoke he pointed the pistol at her heart with courage worthy better cause she darted by him and tried one or two of the wainscot panels if seeking private spring which davy who was fully awake by this time perceiving sprang up and caught hold of her grasping her tightly she wrestled with him with the strength of lioness and but papa help she must have escaped he now ﬁred the pistol at the wainscot to show her it really contained slug which he thought she might doubt and taking the fellow instrument from his pocket told her it was loaded like the other and that unless she that moment really and truly confessed who and what she was and by whom employed her hours were numbered trembling and almost gasping breath she fell on her knees and implored mercy it can be shown said my father only on one condition full confession of every thing connected with your being here but faltered she if i shall i be given up to them and they will surely kill if i am tell the truth said my father and if i judge from your last words you are the tool of others you shall be protected and if deserving or even repentant shall be cared but stay said he pouring out glass of wine you are greatly agitated take this and then sit down now if you will tell the truth you may dismiss your fears and by making the only reparation in your power full disclosure you may also make friend of indeed sir i will i feel sure you will keep your word you see before you one who till the last few years knew not the ways of sin i was carefully and tenderly brought up some miles from here but book the young by sarah french https acquaintance with young man i married him against the wishes of my parents i soon found out he was smuggler he brought to these parts where i have been compelled to act the character you saw this evening to prevent any body buying the place it being so near the sea and having passage under ground it just suited the purpose the gang consists of six men who are all but one gone out with boat to fetch cargo the moon sets about half past three when they will bring it in had you been here last night they were all in the cave would you like to return to the paths of duty and virtue asked my father oh yes sir but how can i who will now look on how can i leave one who though so wicked and i fear hardened in wickedness is still very dear to only purpose to rightly said my father and god will surely open way you all you have to is to pray to and trust in him oh sir that is what my poor old father would say that is just how he used to talk to and she fell to crying bitterly is he still living he is sir letter i wrote begging his forgiveness was returned to neighbouring only the other day papa then insisted on her taking some more refreshment and looking at his watch perceived it was nearly one much was to be done ere the smugglers returned the woman informed him that only one then remained who ought to have been on the watch to light beacon prepared in case of any danger but that there was so little fear of any thing of the kind that he had freely indulged in spirits of which there were plenty in the cave and was now fast asleep in state of intoxication consequently could be secured without any difﬁculty she accompanied papa and davy to the bed but on reaching it started back with horror and would have fallen had not the latter caught her the wretched being that lay before them was her husband who had returned wounded and from the state of exhaustion he was in it appeared dangerously so she was alarmed and both papa and davy were so too least the man they expected to ﬁnd had escaped and given the alarm but it was not the case at little distance they found him lying on the ground so completely under the inﬂuence of drink that he was easily secured papa now concluded it better to light the beacon particularly when he learnt that doing so would deter the smugglers from running their cargo till another signal was given the poor creature entreated that something might be done her husband and papa much moved by her distress told her surgeon should be sent but that he did not consider it safe either davy evans or himself to remain alone she then pointed to door which contained the arms and ammunition of the gang in case of being discovered he secured the key of this and then despatched davy to the village who soon roused griffy davis to whom he triumphantly announced the capture of the ghost and speedily returned with several of the villagers whom he assured should be well rewarded from the spoils of the smugglers the latter soon after seeing the light announcing danger sent secret emissary who ﬁnding all was discovered returned to the others who immediately left the country and although strict search has been made tidings have yet been heard of them and it is supposed they have ﬂown to foreign parts it was ludicrous to see and hear davis she thought papa an extraordinary man before but now she knew not how to express book the young by sarah french https of his courage and discernm ent even i fell in share of her praises who could she said have thought it indeed every one seemed surprised and wondered they never suspected the truth papa did but i must leave all their surmises and curious remarks till we meet only telling you jenkins the wounded man lived long enough to testify sincere repentance and poor mary his wife was restored to her parents through the intercession of papa who thinks she will respectable character the man who was taken was doubtless more guilty than could be proved however he was found sufﬁciently so to be sent to hard labour three months in the neighbouring penitentiary he proved to be the identical jamie reece who was said to have been spirited away by the ghost but who in fact joined the gang which had just lost one of their number an immense quantity of contraband goods were found secreted i must now conclude this voluminous epistle and trust we shall soon meet when i have great deal more to say and next summer you will i hope be able to come spend month here i remain my dear charles yours

how is your mother this morning said venerable looking clergyman he pressed the hand of fair young girl apparently not more than eighteen her face was pale with watching and her eyes were red with weeping and though she seemed in deep distress there was subdued and resigned manner about her she replied not any better sir i fear she has had very bad night her cough has been so very troublesome saying this she opened door which led to an inner apartment into which montgomery entered and approached the bed followed by the afﬂicted daughter who now tried to assume composure of manner very foreign to her feelings faintly smiling she exclaimed here dear mamma is our kind friend again the poor sufferer looked anxiously at him her attenuated fram and sharpened features told the sad tale that consumption had done its work and the hand of death was upon her well my dear madam said the good pastor i will not ask if you are better i will only hope the same spirit of resignation to the divine will ﬁlls your mind when i left you yesterday remember in whom you trust and whom there are promises recorded there pointing to bible that lay on the bed and thrice happy are they who can rely on them in afﬂiction hour i have read them to you and your own eye you tell has often rested on them you have only therefore to your way unto the lord and he shall bring it to pass oh yes replied the suffering woman in feeble tone i know it all i know he is able and willing to take care of my hapless children i can and trust them to him book the young by sarah french https he will more than supply the place of the only parent left them but oh my dear sir convinced i am of all this it is nevertheless hard to leave them may he forgive my weakness but human nature is such here she paused from exhaustion it is my dear madam meant that we should so and trial would lose the object which it is sent did we not feel its bitterness but you must try and rejoice that you are allowed to manifest both faith and hope under so severe and trying dispensation let entreat you to remember the many instances recorded in scripture where answer has been given from on high to the prayers of those who can faithfully cling to them but while the worthy man strove to lead the sufferer beyond this sublunary sphere his heart bled the poor children she was leaving the ﬁrst blow she received was the sudden news of her husband death in the crimea which came to her ears so abruptly that her nerves received shock from which she did not rally months this was followed by letter informing her that some property which had been left to her few months previous to captain willoughby departure had been claimed by distant branch of the family heir at law the testamentary document being found invalid these circumstances joined to delicate health following each other so quickly proved too much feeble nature and she sunk under them her excellent daughter whose fragile form seemed little calculated to breast the storms of adversity that now threatened her was unwearied in attention to her dying parent she saw there were heavy trials before her and knew they could not be averted though she could not tell how she was to meet them but there was trusting feeling in her young heart that must ever be inseparable from trust in god providence and she sat through the long nights watching by her mother bed thousand vague shadows of the future ﬂitted before her and many schemes offered themselves to her mind she tried to drive them off it seemed to her sinful she durst not think but she could pray and she did so and oh the eloquence of that simple trusting prayer that her god would protect and bless her and the two young beings whose sole dependance she was soon to be how widely changed was her position in few short months the petted and almost idolized child of doting parents whose every wish had been anticipated must now soon exert herself to support her orphan brother and sister willoughby is often the case with those suffering from pulmonary affection went off very suddenly and now was every threatened evil likely to burst on poor helen devoted head but though weak in the ﬂesh she was strong in faith relying she had been early led to on her god she seemed to rise with fresh energy under accumulated trials she soothed and kissed the weeping children by turns but their grief was so violent they refused to be comforted the night her mother was consigned to the grave was indeed trying one to helen the good clergyman who had gone back to the house after the funeral now knelt in prayer with the bereaved ones and commending them to the care of their heavenly father took leave promising to be with them early next day farewell my child said he to helen fear not the future it is merciful and loving god who lays his rod upon you and though the clouds of darkness loom heavily around you with him nothing is impossible and he could in one moment disperse them if it were better you may you be puriﬁed by the afﬂiction he sends good night once more and remember that not sparrow falls to the ground unheeded by him who made it how was it that this feeble child of afﬂiction went to bed that night in some degree composed every earthly hope seemed blighted her parents one by one were called her little patrimony taken away and she and the little ones left almost friendless was it to make her the better feel where she could and must place her sole dependance doubtless it was oh ye happy sons and daughters of prosperity you read this description which many an afﬂicted one is now realizing with apathy ye regard it an scene of trial believe it is such thing while you are book the young by sarah french https every earthly comfort i will say by every earthly luxury lolling perhaps on your sofas or in your easy chairs your cup ﬁlled to overﬂowing with every blessing hundreds of your fellow creatures young you are suffering privations you hardly like to think of but which they alas have to bear helen rose early refreshed by long sleep brought on by many nights of broken rest she kissed the tears off her sleeping brother and sister cheeks and having recommended herself and them to god proceeded to commence the arduous duties that now devolved on her when montgomery came he found her doing that which he was about to suggest preparing an immediate sale of the furniture by taking an inventory while the faithful servant was busily employed cleaning the house which tenant was luckily found the two young ones were doing their best to aid their sister montgomery wished them sent to the vicarage but helen would not hear of it till the day of or after the sale well has it been said that god tempers the wind to the shorn lamb and so did she ﬁnd it on applying through montgomery to neighbouring auctioneer he gratuitously attended and did all in his power to dispose of the things to advantage willoughby had taken the house on coming into possession of the property and furnished it throughout so that being in good order most of the furniture fetched fair price the day after willoughby died montgomery had written to sister of his who lived twenty miles off to enquire small house should there be such in her neighbourhood she sent word there was cottage in the suburbs which she thought would just suit and therefore had taken it one year certain it being very moderate rent although greater part of the things sold had obtained fair price there were several useful articles that would have gone little and but the good clergyman have been completely sacriﬁced these he bought in among them was large carpet and the piano he thought they might if the money were needed be privately and more advantageously disposed of the funeral expenses were comparatively small although helen desired to pay every respect to her mother memory montgomery convinced her it was an imperative duty on her to avoid unnecessary expenditure she knew not what calls might yet be made on her resources it next became consideratio n how the things reserved from the sale could be got with the least expense to their new place of residence but nancy who was present said there was distant relative of hers farmer who volunteered to take them in his large waggon which he said by starting at midnight could be accomplished in one day and it was anything but busy time he could it with little loss added to which he expressed himself right glad to be able to serve young lady who with her mother had been so uncommonly kind to his only parent during long illness when did good action ever lose its reward helen thankfully accepted montgomery kind offer of taking the young ones to stay with him till she was settled in their new abode but henry would not hear of it he insisted on remaining with his sister and doing all he could to help her so that not liking to leave fanny alone it was agreed they both should accompany her she was not sorry this she thought the bustle and novelty would divert their minds from their sorrow herself so much was required of her both to think and to that she had time to dwell on the desolation of her position i must not here forget to state that though only eighteen helen had experienc ed other troubles than those which now bowed her down and they were such the youthful mind ever feels most keenly she had with the sanction of her parents been engaged to edward cranston he was himself considered unexceptionable and the match was thought very eligible one he was ﬁve years helen senior and had just entered the practice of the law with every prospect of being called to the bar he was ﬁrst attracted by her beauty and afterwards won by her amiable and pleasing manner idolized by his own family where she ﬁrst met him and unremitting in his attention to herself she soon felt attached and conﬁdingly plighted her troth and all seemed the couleur rose his stay was some time prolonged but he had at length to leave it was hard struggle to him to part from her and he did not so without many promises of ﬁdelity to see him leave her was the ﬁrst trial she knew the pang was severe but his devotion was such that she doubted not his faith and most indignantly would she have repudiated the idea that his love her could lessen but his disposition was naturally volatile and once away from her and within book the young by sarah french https of other beauty he could not resist its power he became enslaved by the fascinations of another and poor helen was almost forgotten painfully did the conviction force itself upon her his letters became ﬁrst less frequent and then less affectionate love is generally quicksighted but helen own heart was so pure and so devoted that it was hard to believe she was longer beloved hers was indeed delicate position she noticed the alteration in edward cranst on style of writing and fancied it proceeded from any cause but diminution of regard her that she thought could not be possible but soon alas did she learn the to her sad truth that her afﬁanced lover was devoted to another most beautiful girl residin g in the same town and it was said they were engaged and too true were the reports which the following letter conﬁrmed m y d ear h elen how shall i write or where ﬁnd words to express all i desire to say shall i commence by hoping that absence has led you to regard with less affection or shall i honestly say i longer love you you deserve to be loved and that i am longer worthy your affection it costs much to say this but you would not wish to deceive you you would not wish to go perjured from the altar with you i most earnestly hope nay i feel sure you will not regret that i have discovered this mistake ere too late the peace of both i have opened my heart and most bitterly i regret its delinquency but our affections are involuntary and not under our control till the last two months i believed mine to be inviolably yours i know i am betrothed to you and if you require it am bound in honour to fulﬁl my engagement but i will ask you ought i to so feeling i longer love you i ought is it not more really honourable to lay myself open and leave the matter to your decision if we are united three individuals are miserable life but it shall rest with you oh my excellent helen give and pity your still af fectionate edward what blow was this to her warm and sanguine heart what return to love so trustingly bestowed she uttered not one reproach in her reply but merely released him from every promise and wished him every happiness she had from the tenor of all his late letters had presentiment of coming evil but she could hardly till that cruel one just given to the reader realize its full extent but the young and must feel keenly in these matters in particular if their all is embarked and if founded on esteem the affections are not given by halves and i ﬁrmly believe the author who says man is the creature of ambition and interest his nature leads him forth into the struggle and bustle of the world love is but the embellishment of his early life or song piped between the intervals but woman whole life is history of her affections the heart is her world it is there her ambition strives empire it is there her avarice seeks treasures she sends forth her sympathies on adventures and embarks her all in the trafﬁc of affection and if shipwrecked unless she be strongly supported by religious principles it is complete bankruptcy of her happiness but let the young remember there is often in these disappointments so hard to meet the most wholesome and salutary chastenings how very many happy wives can look back with thankfulness and gratitude to the all directing hand of providence that by blasting of their seemingly fair prospects they are directed to happier fate than their own inexperience would lead them how often does their heavenly father manifest his care by leading them from the shoals and rocks of misery which are oft times hidden not only from themselves but even from the anxious eye of parental vigilance when helen had paid the funeral expenses and some triﬂing debts she found she had but small sum left it was now her all the present support of three individuals and book the young by sarah french https future poor girl did she think of that it did indeed cross her mind but she suppressed the murmuring sigh that arose and her beloved mother precepts were remem bered and her injunctions that in every trial she would cling to her god help and truly and wonderfully was this lone girl supporte d and almost superhuman were the efforts she was enabled to make fortunately much manual labour was saved by the faithful servant nancy whom entreaties could force to quit she insisted on accompanying the children of her beloved mistress to their new home she therefore went with the wagg on and the next day montgomery drove the three young ones to their destination they were to spend the ﬁrst night with cameron whom helen found the counterpart of her worthy brother less reﬁned in manner it is true and with few advantages of education but she had much common sense and most benevolent disposition and was able to judge most sensibly of things passing around her greatly prepossessed by all she had heard of helen she received her with the warmth of an old friend little henry soon became an especial favourite he was delighted with the change and the natural buoyancy of his disposition soon led him to forget past sorrows the farm yard the garden the promised ﬁshing from the neighbouring trout stream were all novelties that enchanted him nancy was up early and with the aid of cameron servant had got nearly everything into the different rooms ere that lady and helen could get there the cottage was very small but nature had done much the situation which was indeed beautiful there was small bed room off helen that was exactly the thing henry and back one which nancy took granted would be hers and had accordingly put all her things in it everything was soon nicely arranged and but little had to be bought cameron sent great many things from her house that she said were superﬂuous causing much extra trouble to keep in order this helen knew was only intended to lessen the sense of obligation naturally active in her habits she soon made the little place comfortable and while she thought how different it was to what she had been used to she also remembered how much better it was far better than she could expect under existing circumstances her next consideration was the possibility of getting something to their support before their little money was expended she consulted with cameron to the probability of obtaining needlework at which she was very expert though she feared the conﬁnement might injure her health of which it behoved her to take especial care the sake of little fanny and henry however if any could be obtained at once she resolved to take it till she could ﬁx on something else and early the next day camer on called to say sherman the doctor wife would have some ready if miss willoughby would call at three in the afternoon helen pride rose and her heart beat high was she to go it herself she the moment revolted at the idea but principle soon came to her aid and she accused herself of want of moral courage what said she to cameron has it pleased god to place in position at which i dare to murmur oh my dear friend what would my beloved mother say could she witness my foolish struggle between principle and pride were it not my good should i be called on to it my dear girl and that being who sees principle triumph will reward it go then my child you see and feel what you ought to therefore act up to it it is only when the right path is rugged there is any merit in walking in it you are right my excellent friend may god direct this rebellious heart of mine oh how unlike am i to that dear departe d one who here she burst into tears cameron now rose to go and helen promised to call after she had been to sherman in the afternoon she dressed herself to go the work her deep mourning added if possible to her appearance when in health she was extremely lovely but it was beauty one can hardly describe since it arose not from regularity of feature sufﬁce it to say she found sherman alone who received her not only kindly but with degree of feeling and respect that is rarely accorded those whom adversity has depressed book the young by sarah french https not having sent the work and said that indisposition alone induced her to trouble helen to call the directions to making the shirts about which the doctor was very particular while pointing out how they were to be done little girl about eleven burst into the room and threw herself on the sofa on her mother desiring her to leave she cried out in wayward tone i sha i want to stay here because i like it and i will too papa would let if he was at home and if you turn out i tell him so i will susan my child you must indeed you must leave i want to speak to miss willoughby alone oh yes i know you you want to hear you tell her how to make papa shirts fie my dear how can you act thus perversely said sherman she forcibly led her to the door which had sooner closed on the petulant child than she apologized with much feeling and seemed greatly mortiﬁed at this contr temps of her little girl in fact my dear miss willoughby she said she is with several others running almost wild want of good school in the place oh madam cried helen in almost breathless haste you say school is wanted here oh tell would they think too young if i were deemed capable which i feel i am my beloved mother spared pains in grounding thoroughly in the essential points and accomplishments i have had the best masters indeed said sherman could you undertake to impart the rudiments of music i am sure i could said helen blushing she spoke at the idea of having thus to praise herself when i left of f learning i could play anything of f at sight if that be the case i can easily get you few pupils to commence with but how will you manage room oh replied the enthusiastic girl cheered by these opening prospects there is room at the back of our parlour which being so large i did not care to furnish it would make an admirable school room it is indeed lucky thought my dear miss willoughby and may be not only of beneﬁt to yourself but to the inhabitants of the place that is if you are capable and attentive indeed indeed i will be both only permit to make the trial said the excited helen that you shall and have my little susan to begin with and the sooner you so the better but let beg of you not to be too sanguine fear of disappointment let see this is wednesday you could not manage to get your room in order by monday could you at any rate said helen i would take the few who would attend at the ﬁrst in our little parlour helen then after thanking sherman the suggestion rose to go when that lady invited her back to tea wishing to get more insight into her plans and capability before she ventured to recommend her to others and she wished that her husband the doctor should see and converse with helen whom she began to feel great interest she had much reliance on his judgment and penetration into character having gleaned from the early part of her conversation with sherman her anxiety about the shirts which were new and difﬁcult pattern helen insisted on taking and doing them at her leisure which after repeated refusals she at length agreed book the young by sarah french https returning home she called agreeably to her promise on cameron who was much pleased with the result of her visit herself see my dear miss willoughby said she how your conduct was rewarded i was sure it would be adhering to the right had you sent nancy the work perhaps you would never have got it and your qualiﬁcation teacher might never been known was there not my dear helen special providence here yes indeed there was here i must beg to digress little to urge the advantage of thorough education which can never be too highly appreciated or too strongly enforced under any reverse of fortune who can calculate on the beneﬁts to say nothing of the gratiﬁcation it affords in so many ways knowledge is power and alwa ys secures its possessor degree of inﬂuence that wealth can never command oh would that all mothers well daughters could but be duly impressed with sense of its vital importance then we should not see girls day after day permitted on any frivolous excuse to absent themselves from school if time be so truly valuable we know it really is how doubly nay trebly is it in the period devoted to education if we could only rightly reﬂect on the true end of education this serious waste could never be what is it i ask is it merely to acquire certain amount of rudimental information and perhaps superﬁcial acquaintance with showy accomplishments assuredly not it is to learn how to think rightly that we may by thinking rightly know how to act so rudimental instruction is necessarily the foundation and such must be duly and fully appreciated but it is the application of knowledge that education is meant to teach and this must be acquired by line upon line and precept upon precept here little and there little it is not the work of day nor is it to be gained by alternate periods at school who know but those who teach half the time that is required to recover what is lost in these frequently recurring temporary absences it is not only large portion of rudimental instruction that is lost but those many opportunities which every conscientious teacher eagerly and anxiously avails herself of to enforce good principles this can be done at stated periods but they must be seized circumstances call them forth whether suggested by the teachings of the sacred writings or from the ample pages of history or even from the lesson she may convey from the sentiment that often heads child simple copy book if these lost and frittered away periods be of account then there is both time and money thrown away by those who are regular in their scholastic attendance most amply was willoughby sedulous care in the education of her daughter repaid what comforts it brought to her orphan children and to how many would it prove equally serviceable and save them from eating the bitter bread of dependence it was but little in consonance with the state of helen feelings to mix with strangers so soon after her beloved mother death and most gladly would she have declined going back in the evening and proposed to send an apology and say she would be with sherman early the following day but cameron whom she consulted and upon whose advice she generally acted strongly advised her to go and take fanny with her sherman had requested situate you are my dear said she you owe it to yourself and the dear children to make many friends you can the shermans are and i may say inﬂuential people and may you great deal of good i have known them many years worthy and sincere characters this was enough and helen was punctual to the time named the doctor was in to tea and his frank good humoured manner completely won helen heart he too on his part was much pleased with her after conversing some time he appeared thoughtful and then put several questions to her among others asked if she had ever applied the allowance from the compassionate fund herself and the children saying he knew some who received it and that he would inquire what forms were necessary obtaining it adding i believe it is not much not more than ten pounds year each but there are three of you thirty pounds is worth trying book the young by sarah french https was very grateful the suggestion and the good doctor promised to make the requisite inquiries next day while they were thus chatting together the two little girls were amusing themselves in the drawing room which communicated with the parlou r by folding doors and just the doctor was remarking how quiet they were the piano was struck and pretty sonata played sherman was surprised to ﬁnd it was fanny and still more so on hearing that helen had been her sole instructress she played very prettily the doctor who was passionately fond of music was then very anxious to hear helen play and asked her to so but kind feeling restrained him from urging her when she gave her reason which i need not tell the reader was the recent death of her mother the evening passed off very cheerfully and helen found ere she left sherman she had secured warm friends in her and her excellent husband it was agreed that on the following day she should her introduced to several families where she would be likely to obtain pupils and so successful were sherman efforts that she had the promise of six to commence with on the following monday and ere month had elapsed three more were added to the number i should before have mentioned that on the death of her mother helen had written to an aunt who was in great afﬂuence informing her of the sad event from whom she received cool letter of condolence but not the slightest of fer of assistance finding it necessary to forward certiﬁcates of her parents marriage well those of her own and the children baptism she wrote to her aunt information to where she might obtain them in reply she informed her where she could get them and then concluded by offering her and fanny an asylum such she termed it if their board helen would instruct her three cousins she took care to insinuate that doing this would involve additional expense she must be content to be received mere stranger she would be expected even to assist in the family needle work fanny selwyn said would not require much clothing to be purchased two of her cousins were older than she was and never half wore their things out adding helen would in all probability obtain the compassionate allowance it might with care clothe her and help henry if he needed anything she ﬁnished her heartless letter by saying of course helen would try and ﬁnd place him he must not she said be too particular now helen read and it and then bursting into tears fell on her knees and thanked her heavenly father who had given her the means by honest industry of saving herself and little ones the bitter pang of eating the bread of dependence after this with what heartfelt thankfulness did she sit down with them to their frugal meal she wrote and respectfully declined her aunt offer the fact of the matter was this selwyn had heard of helen successful attempt and though she held communication with her sister illoughby after that lady had offended her father by marrying yet she had little doubt of helen capability and thought after the energy and self reliance she had manifested she might she was though rich most parsimonious woman turn it to her own account and few years at least get her children cheaply educated it was helen determination if she obtained the compassionate allowance to keep it reserve her brother education she mentioned her intention to sherman who expressed his warm approval of her plan one day nancy who had been to the shop groceries came in very hastily to the room helen and cameron were sitting in oh miss helen you know while i was waiting in conway shop who should come in but peggy smith to say she was going to leave the place and go to her mother long way off she was all along so sickly and she herself but lone woman here well she going to sell that nice cow and let the ﬁeld that joins our little paddock which she holds on lease now i know that cow is milker and i thought if you would buy her i have good deal of time i could soon clear the ﬁve pounds which is all she asks it she will calve in month and conway will take all the butter we want book the young by sarah french https it will be capital thing helen said cameron if nancy understands how to manage her i should think i did when i was brought up in dairy all my life till i went to live with willoughby and mother been sick two months at time and i made all the butter and cheese too cameron told helen she had doubt it might be made quite proﬁtable investment nancy was such good manager and even offered to lend the money but helen had so well economised her little stock this was not required weeks and months passed away but satisfactory or indeed any answer at all could be obtained to the compassionate allowance at last sherman wrote again to the war ofﬁce and received an answer saying the request could not be complied with on the ground that captain willoughby death was not properly authenticated though it was not in the least doubted miniature of willoughby and his pocket book were found in the breast of dead major friend of his and in the same regiment it was supposed that he consigned them to the major in his dying moments the grant therefore could not be allowed while the essential document was wanting among her pupils she gave lessons in music at their own house to the misses falkner one morning being tired of waiting which she invariably had to she sat down to the instrument to pass away the time one of her favorite songs lay before her on the piano and she almost unconsciously struck the keys and played the accompaniment and sang it hardly had she ﬁnished than miss falkner came in exclaiming she did so what you here mortimer how long have you been waiting not taking the slightest notice of helen some time said he but both my apology and thanks are due to this lady the high treat she has afforded i was standing outside the veranda when she entered and seeing it was stranger was going off when she commenced favorite air of mine and i was spell bound but you will introduce will you not oh yes certainly said miss falkner in hesitating tone it is the young person to whom julia goes to school and who gives and eliza lessons in music miss willoughby here she stopped she did not even add the gentleman name i am sorry miss willoughby said she i can not take my lesson and therefore need not detain you helen colored and bowing left the room the stranger rose opened the door her and accompanied her to the street door when he again bowed his head respectfully when he returned to the room miss falkner rallied him on his politeness to the village governess she contemptuously styled helen village queen i think said he she certainly has most digniﬁed and ladylike bearing and is very good looking too well i declare mr mortimer you have quite lost your heart by means my dear miss falkner it is not quite so vulnerable lovely face and graceful form alone will never win it even with the addition of such syren voice miss willoughby possesses she sings not only sweetly but scientiﬁcally of course said she if people are to get their living by their talents they ought to be well cultivated so little accustomed since the death of her mother to kindness from the world in general and made to feel so keenly her dependant situation helen fully appreciated book the young by sarah french https deference accorded to her by the stranger her pupils increased so that in short time she had twelve besides several accomplishments but the misses falkner reasons best known to themselves declined her future instructions and just she was preparing to go to them day or two after being so cavalierly dismissed falkner was announced at the cottage she came she said to pay the bill and say her daughters would discontinue their lessons of course she said you will only char ge the time you actually came to them helen quietly replied that she should certainly expect the quarter they had commenced to be paid she knew they could afford it and she felt it due to those she laboured not to throw away one penny well said falkner this comes of patronizing nobody knows who it is just what one might expect madam said helen her colour rising she spoke had you thought proper to have done so you might have known who i was i think said the unfeeling woman julia quarter is up i shall keep her at home too the present you think proper said the agitated girl well well you are mighty high i think person obliged to work her bread you are come down pretty low and hold said helen let intreat you falkner to desist these cruel taunts god has been pleased to place in my present position and it is with thankfulness nay with pride i exert the talents he has given the support of myself and the dear children he has committed to my care poverty madam may try us and that severely but while we act rightly it can never degrade us but in the eyes of those unfeeling yourself mighty ﬁne and heroic to be sure is it not pity mortimer is hidden somewhere to hear you he was when you sung and pretended not to know he was listening he could see through it though well we did and let tell you artful you are that he is not bird to be caught with chaff but there your money so give receipt this she sooner received than of f she started helen who had with difﬁculty restrain ed her tears now gave way to her feelings and thus relieved her ged heart at this moment cameron came in and having heard all that had passed said never mind my dear child we must all be tried some way or other and even this cruel heartless woman could not vex you thus did not god permit her to so we have all yes the very best of us proud rebelliou s hearts that need chastisement and it is not us to choose how it is to be done god knows best meet it therefore my dear humbly from him and not man all will yet come right you are good girl still helen dear you need we all the chastening of the almighty we every one of us come short and weighed in his balance are found wanting few days after this henry who had been out ﬁshing came in with his basket full of trout look there helen said he what you think of that there trout you why henry dear are you already so expert at ﬁshing asked his sister book the young by sarah french https replied henry but gentleman joined and we angled together see what beautiful ﬂies he has given he caught three ﬁsh to my one but he would make take all oh he real nice fellow he has hired bently hunting lodge the season and says i may go with him whenever i please if you will let whenever it does not interfere with your studies henry but you must mind and not be troublesome to him i take care of that but i forgot to tell you i met sherman i was coming home and she wants you to go to tea there and susan is to come down and stay with fanny sherman had seen cameron and learnt from her the cruel manner in which falkner had behaved and kindly desired to have chat with helen in order to soothe and strengthen her mind and if it were possible render her less vulnerable to these shafts of malice after they had some time discussed the matter now said sherman let us forget all unpleasantries and give one of your nice songs i wonder where the doctor is he promised to be in to tea but i suppose he has taken it where he is detained helen sat down and played and sang at length the doctor voice was heard in the passage but sherman insisted on her going on and held up her ﬁnger her husband entered in token of silence the doctor sent sherman to the parlour door where stood mortimer when helen had ﬁnished she turned and saw him he bowed and went across to her and expressed his pleasure in meeting her again in such frank manner that our heroine if such she may be called soon lost all feeling of embarrassment and went on playing and singing and the evening passed imperceptibly away when the doctor escorted helen home mort imer accompanied them to the gate leading to the cottage and took his leave their meeting at sherman was entirely the result of accident mortimer had been on friendly terms at the house ever since he had been in the neighbourhood but both the doctor and his wife concluded he was engaged to miss falkner they never thought to ask him when helen was expected and so tenacious was he not to win her affections till assured he could make her his that he carefully assumed an indifference he was far from feeling he pitied her position which he saw was trying one and he greatly admired the way she acquitted herself in it he gained great insight into her character in his conversations with henry who entirely off his guard was very communicative the following letter however from mortimer to an old friend will best elicit his views and opinions m y d ear mmerson i promised to let you know where i brought up and here i am domiciled in pretty little country village where bently has property and i have hired his snug hunting lodge and in the mind i am in i shall remain the next six months that is if when the term renting this said lodge expires i can ﬁnd place to which i can bring my sister emily here there is hardly room enough myself and philips who is still my factotum valet groom and i know not what besides however he is content and so am heartily sick of town and its conventualities and tired of being courted and feted not myself but my fortune i care not if i never see it again i am weary too of blessedness and yet afraid to venture on matrimony why is it so few are happy who there is some grand evil somewhere but where there the rub i look narrowly into every family i visit especially the newly married ones and i see the effect but not the cause now one can not be without the other we well know i fear i expect too much from the other sex and begin to think there is more truth than poetry in your observation that i have book the young by sarah french https made on purpose i certainly want to ﬁnd one very different from most that i have yet seen travelling between london and bath i met my father old friend and college chum falkner who ﬁnding i had settled plans persuaded to take bently hunting lodge which is in the vicinity of his villa falkner is worthy good creature whom i should give credit great deal of common sense were he not so completely under the dominion of his wife perfect xantippe by the bye i think however wise he might be in some respects that master socrates was bit of goose particularly if history maintains he did he knew what virago he was taking but however deﬁcient in her duty wife falkner goes to the other extreme and overacts her part mother but i am very ungrateful in thus animadverting on her behaviour you must know she has singled out your humble servant most especial favourite and though she does not wish her girls married takes right good care to let know that she thinks the woman who gets will be lucky and that much she would grieve to part from one of her daughters yet were an eligible chance to offer she would throw obstacles in the way i verily believe she has discarded little girl who taught her daughters music solely fear i should fall in love with her and certainly she is far superior to the misses falkner she well can be both in attainments and personal attractions i am so afraid of coming to hasty conclusion but own myself greatly prepossessed in her favour she has been well and carefully brought up i have watched her in church and have marked an unaffected devotion which i have seen carried to the sick and suffering poor around her she has lost both parents and now by her talents supports an orphan brother and sister the former an intelligent interesting boy of thirteen is frequent companion of mine and if i can without wounding the delicacy of the sister i trust to be of some future service to him i have indirectly and perhaps you will say unfairly questioned the boy and all tells in her favour now here it must be genuine miss willoughby plays and sings like syren but then so does many pretty triﬂer beauty and accomplishments are very well to pass an evening away but in companion life far more is required much more than these must i ﬁnd in woman ere i venture to ask her to be mine i am heartily tired of my present life it is lonely stupid way of living living i live i merely vegetate i have taste dissipation neither have i any great predilection ﬁeld sports miss willoughby is i think far superior to the generality of her sex but she shall never have an idea of my partiality till i am thoroughly persuaded she can make happy although she may not come up to my standard of female perfection she is far too amiable and too forlorn to be triﬂed with and therefore i will not try to win her affections till i know i can reciprocate them with regard to the falkners i will be guarded i respect the old man sincerely and his family farther deponent sayeth not he is the beau ideal of country squire and i think you will like him they are all remarkably civil and i must many reasons keep up an intercourse or give room elsewhere of having my plans suspected the whole village i believe have given to one of the falkners i not wish even the worthy sherman and his excellent wife to suspect that i feel more than common interest in their protegee i wish you would come down month i think you would like this part of the country and i am sure you and falkner would get on together neither have i the slightest doubt but you would be pleased with the shermans they are gems perfect gems in their way and to miss willoughby come and judge yourself you are engaged or i might not perhaps be so pressing just i was concluding this letter was brought by the mail from distant relative who is just returned from india it was hastily written and sent off while the ship was laying in the downs requesting if possible to book the young by sarah french https at deal so i am off short time and will write to you directly i return till when farewell ever faithfully yours george every meeting increased helen respect mortimer she often met him at sherman but it seemed always the result of chance nor had she the slightest idea that he felt her other than the esteem of friend the village gave him to one of the misses falkner and helen took it granted it was so she rather regretted it she thought him too good and feared they could neither of them appreciate his worth she occasionally met the falkners at sherman when the eldest young lady always took care to monopolize him which reasons of his own he readily fell into when he took leave to go to deal helen could not help fancying there was tenderness and peculiarity in his tone he addressed her and yet she thought she must be mistaken and that it was only his natural friendly warmth of manner she had none of that silly vanity that leads many girls to fancy because man is kind and attentive he must be in love she missed him greatly latterly he had accompanied her in her songs and supplied her with music and books still all was done under the mask of friendship and duplicates of these little presents were generally procured falkner villa also henry too was sadly at loss his companion all his out door amusements seemed to have lost their interest and he began to look anxiously the time proposed his return room was prepared both mortimer and his cousin at falkner on his return however he preferred going to his own quarters leaving sir horace mortimer his relative to the hospitalities of falkner villa sir horace mortimer stay with them opened fresh ﬁeld falkner speculations and not being either so fastidious or his cousin geor ge sir horace at one time bid fair to set the former an example they were all assembled at sherman few nights after mortimer return when sir horace was introduced to helen he almost started but said nothing however his eyes were so completely riveted on her that he became quite short his ﬁxed gaze became painful sherman was during the evening called to the door when he received parcel from london carriage paid which the man said he had promised to place in the doctor own hand the worthy man wondering from whom it could possibly come retired to his own room and opened it it contained willoughby portrait and the pocket book the latter he locked up carefully the former he was carrying to helen who being engaged with sherman in the adjoining room he showed it to sir horace mortimer with whom he had just been conversing about helen and her orphan char ge can it be possible said he or my eyes deceive the doctor looked inquiringly but sir horace said more at last he went up to the doctor and asked if helen was expecting the arrival of the miniature sherman replied she knew it was safe but was quite uncertain when it might arrive then my dear sir would you trust with it till morning when i will restore it at an early hour i would not ask but very particular reasons connected it may be of much moment to that dear girl if i strongly suspect i have seen that miniature before there is secret and very minute spring which i could not well ascertain without my glasses believe my dear doctor i have very cogent reasons my request and i feel common interest in miss willoughby but we are attracting the notice of those people i am staying with who are not at all friendly disposed towards her in fact they have done all in their power to prejudice against her book the young by sarah french https doctor marvelled much at the request but readily acceeded to then both he and sir horace mortimer joined in the general conversation when the little party broke up sir horace mortimer undertook to be helen escort and offered her his arm miss falkner having come with him quietly took the other when they reached helen abode which was in the way to falkner villa at parting sir horace requested permission to call and see her at an hour he named next day and she promised to be ready will you send your young brother i have heard much of him and must make his acquaintance oh said miss falkner we are going to call at the cottage and i will be your guide we have long been intending to pay visit to miss willoughby mamma is anxious to apologize some little misunderstanding helen tried to speak but her words could ﬁnd utterance in reply to the impertinent speech of miss falkner but shaking sir horace warmly by the hand she bowed and went into her home at breakfast miss falkner told her mother that sir horace mortimer had made an appointment to visit miss willoughby they could avail themselves of his escort and go with him this i beg leave to say though apparently the thought of the moment was preconcerted proposition but one which sir horace declared impossible he had particular business with miss willoughby at which none but sherman and cameron could be present this was spoken so decidedly that further opposition was made to his wish to go alone but both mother and daughters were sadly puzzled conjecture was rife among them the whole morning at last they came to the conclusion that he had made up his mind to propose must be so else why sherman and cameron present point therefore was least with the falkners of her acceptance of him rich east indian oh there could be doubt of that and the elder miss falkner could breathe again since she was free to captivate george mortimer with whom she was desperately in love thus vain and silly people jump at conclusions and thus is half the business of country town or village settled without any concurrence or even knowledge of those most concerned the request of sir horace mortimer set helen wondering and certainly deprived her of some hours sleep his peculiar manner and his ardent gaze too recurred to her mind she lay thinking on the subject she was completely puzzled he was perfect stranger whom she had never before seen nor he her what could it mean would not some have concluded he was in love with her but man old enough to be her father such an idea never entered her head in fact she could make probable guess so she determined to make virtue of necessity and wait quietly till he came early the next day she sent cameron and told her of the appointment sir horace had made and she thought it more than probable the falkners might accompany him they spoke of
