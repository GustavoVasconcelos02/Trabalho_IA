most of the essays were that was not yesterday chapter i adventures among books i in an age of reminiscences is there room the confessions of veteran who remembers great deal about books and very little about people i have often wondered that biographia literaria has so seldom been biography or autobiography of man in his relations with other minds coleridge to be sure gave this name to work of his but he wandered from his apparent purpose into world of alien disquisitions the following pages are frankly bookish and to the bookish only they appeal the habit of reading has been praised virtue and has been denounced vice in case if we except the perpetual study of newspapers which can not fairly be called reading is the vice or the virtue common it is more innocent than eating though like it unlocks to us artiﬁcial paradises i try to say what i have found in books what distractions from the world what teaching not much and what consolations in beginning an autobiographia literaria an account of how and in what order books have appealed to mind which books have ever above all things delighted the author must pray to be pardoned the sin of egotism there is other mind naturally of which the author knows so much of his own on n soi the poor girl says in one of paul bour get s novels in literature in love one can only speak himself this author did not like fulke greville retire into the convent of literature from the strife of the world rather he was born to be from the ﬁrst dweller in the cloister of library among the poems which i remember best out of early boyhood is lucy ashton s song in the bride of lammermoor look not thou on beauty s charming sit thou still when kings are arming taste not when the glistens speak not when the people listens stop thine ear against the singer from the red gold keep thy ﬁnger adventures among books https heart and hand and eye easy live and quiet the rhymes unlearned clung to my memory they would sing themselves to on the way to school or and about the age of ten probably without quite understanding them i had chosen them kind of motto in life tune to murmur along the fallentis semita vitæ this seems queer idea small boy but it must be confessed it takes all sorts to make world some are soldiers from the cradle some merchants some orators nothing but love of books was the gift given to by the fairies it was probably derived from forebears on both sides of my family one great reader the other considerable collector of books which remained with us and were all tried persevered with or abandoned in turn by student who has not blanched before the epigoniad about the age of four i learned to read by simple process i had heard the elegy of cock robin till i knew it by rote and i picked out the letters and words which compose that classic till i could read it myself earlier than that robinson crusoe had been read aloud to in an abbreviated form doubt i remember the pictures of robinson ﬁnding the footstep in the sand and dance of cannibals and the parrot but somehow i have never read robinson since it is pleasure to come the ﬁrst books which vividly impressed were naturally fairy tales and about robert bruce william wallace and rob roy at that time these little tracts could be bought penny apiece i can still see bruce in full armour and wallace in kilt discoursing across burn and rob roy slipping from the soldier s horse into the stream they did not then awaken precocious patriotism boy of ﬁve is more at home in fairyland than in his own country the sudden appearance of the white cat queen after her head was cut of f the ﬁendish malice of the yellow dwarf the strange cake of crocodile eggs and millet seed which the mother of the princess frutilla made the fairy of the things all fresh and astonishing but certainly to be credited are my ﬁrst memories of romance one story of white serpent with woodcut of that mysterious reptile i neglected to secure probably want of penny and i have regretted it ever since one never sees those chap books now the white serpent in spite of all research remains introuvable it was lost chance and fortune does not forgive nobody ever interfered with these or indeed with any other studies of ours at that time long they were not prosecuted on sundays the ﬁghtingest parts of the bible and the apocrypha and stories like that of the witch of endor were sabbatical literature read in huge old illustrated bible how i advanced from the fairy tales to shakespeare what stages there were on the there must have been thing that memory can not recover nursery legend tells that i was wont to arrange six open books on six chairs and go from one to the others perusing them by turns doubt this was what people call desultory reading but i did not hear the criticism till later and then too often my comfort memory holds picture more vivid than most of small boy reading the midsummer night s dream by ﬁrelight in room where candles were lit and some one touched the piano and young man and girl were playing chess the shakespeare was volume of kenny meadows edition there are fairies in it and the fairies seemed to come out of shakespeare s dream into the music and the ﬁrelight at that moment i think that i was happy it seemed an enchanted glimpse of eternity in paradise nothing resembling it remains with out of all the years we went from the border to the south of england when the number of my years was six and in england we found another paradise circulating library with brown greasy printed odd volumes of shakespeare and of the arabian how their stained pages come before the eyes pleasure and the puzzle of them what did the lady in the geni s glass box want with the merchants what meant all these conversations between the fat knight and ford in the merry wives it was delightful but in parts it was difﬁcult fragments of the tempest and of other plays remain stranded in adventures among books https from these readings ferdinand and miranda at chess cleopatra cufﬁng the messenger the asp in the basket of ﬁgs the friar and the apothecary troilus on the ilian walls vision of cassandra in white muslin with her hair down people forbid children to read this or that i am sure they need not and that even in our infancy the magician shakespeare brings us nothing worse than world of beautiful visions half realised in the egyptian wizard s little pool of ink only the pure can see the visions and in shakespeare s magic mirror children see only what is pure among other books of that time i only recall kind of sunday novel naomi or the last days of who indeed could get the and the man who cried on the battlements woe woe to myself and to jerusalem i seem to hear him again when boys break the hum of london with yells of the latest disaster we left england in year went back to scotland and awoke it were to know the glories of our birth we lived in scott s country within four miles of abbotsford and so far we had heard nothing of it i remember going with one of the maids into the cottage of kinsman of hers carpenter delightful place where there was sawdust where our ﬁrst were fashioned rummaging among the books of course i found some cheap periodical with verses in it the lines the baron of smaylhome rose with day he spurred his courser on without stop or stay down the rocky way that leads to rustic was spread us with scones and honey not to be neglected but they were neglected till we had learned the sable score of ﬁngers four remains on that board impressed and evermore that lady wore covering on her we did not know nor ask the poet s name children probably say very little about what is in their minds but that unhappy knight sir richard of coldinghame and the priest with his chamber in the east and the moody baron and the lady have dwelt in our mind ever since and hardly need to be revived by looking at the eve of soon after that we were told about sir walter how great he was how good how like napoleon his evil destiny found him at last and he wore his heart away honour s sake and we were given the lay and the lady of the it was my father who ﬁrst read t am shanter to which i confess i did not care at that time preferring to take witches and bogies with great seriousness it seemed if burns were triﬂing with noble subject but it was in summer sunset beside window looking out on ettrick and the hill of the three brethren s cairn that i ﬁrst read with the dearest of all friends the stag at eve had drunk his ﬁll where danced the moon on monan s rill and deep his midnight lair had made in lone glenartney s hazel then opened the gates of romance and with we drove the chase few were the stragglers following far that reached the lake of vennachar and when the brig of turk was won the foremost horseman rode adventures among books https that time months there was usually little volume of scott in one s pocket in company with the miscellaneous collection of boy s treasures scott certainly took his fairy folk seriously and the mauth dog was rather disagreeable companion to small boy in wakeful hours 1 after this kind of introduction to sir walter after learning one s ﬁrst lessons in history from the t ales of grandfather nobody one hopes can criticise him in cold blood or after the manner of mr leslie stephen who is not sentimental scott is not an author like another but our earliest known friend in letters of course we did not ask who shakespeare was nor inquire about the private history of madame d aulnoy scott peopled us the rivers and burnsides with his reivers the fairy queen came out of eildon hill and haunted carterhaugh at newark tower we saw the embattled portal arch whose ponderous grate and massy bar had oft rolled back the tide of war just at foulshiels on yarrow we beheld the very rooﬂess cottage whence mungo park went forth to trace the waters of the niger and at oakwood the tower of the wizard michael scott probably the ﬁrst novel i ever read was read at elgin and the story was jane this tale was creepy one boy of nine and rochester was mystery john bore but the lonely little girl in her despair when something came into the room and her days of starvation at school and the terrible ﬁrst rochester were not to be forgotten they abide in one s recollection with red indian s ghost who carried rusty ruined gun and whose acquaintance was made at the same time i fancy i was rather an industrious little boy and that i had minded my lessons and satisﬁed my know i was reading pinnock s history of rome till the wicked day of destiny came and i felt call and underwent process which may be described the opposite of the call came from dickens pickwick was brought into the house from that hour it was all over ﬁve or six years with anything like industry and i read pickwick in convulsions of mirth i dropped pinnock s rome good i neglected everything printed in latin in fact everything that one was understood to prepare one s classes in the school whither i was now sent in edinbur gh there living rather lonely small boy in the house of an aged relation i found the waverley novels the rest is transport conscientious tutor dragged through the latin grammar and constitutional dislike to being beaten on the hands with leather strap ur ged to acquire certain amount of elementary erudition but year i was young hermit living with scott in the w averleys and the border minstrelsy with pope and prior and translation of ariosto with lever and dickens david copperﬁeld and charles malley longfellow and mayne reid dumas and in brief with every kind of light literature that i could lay my hands upon carlyle did not escape i vividly remember the helpless rage with which i read of the flight to varennes in his work on french novelists mr saintsbury speaks of disagreeable little boy in french romance who found scott assommant stunningly stupid this was very odious little boy it seems i have not read his adventures and he came he deserved to bad end other and better boys i learn ﬁnd scott slow extraordinary boys perhaps ivanhoe was ﬁrst favourite of yore you can not beat front boeuf the assault on his castle the tournament other tournament need apply sir arthur conan doyle greatly daring has attempted to enter the lists but he is mere ralph the hospitaller next i think in order of delight came quentin durward especially the hero of the scar whose name thackeray could not remember quentin s uncle then the black dwarf and dugald our dear rittmeister i could not read rob roy then nor later nay not till i was forty now di vernon is the lady the queen of ﬁction the peerless the brave the tender and true the wisdom of the authorities decided that i was to read more novels but an observer remarked i don t see what is the use of preventing the boy from reading novels he s just reading don juan this was so manifestly adventures among books https that the ban on novels was tacitly withdrawn or was permitted to become dead letter they were far more enjoyable than byron the worst that came of this was the suggestion of young friend whose life had been he had served in the crimea with the bashi i should master the writings of edgar poe i not think that the black cat and the fall of the house of usher and the murders in the rue mor gue are very good reading boy who is not peculiarly intrepid many bad hour they gave haunting especially with fear of being prematurely buried and of waking up before breakfast to ﬁnd myself in cofﬁn of all the books i devoured in that year poe is the only author whom i wish i had reserved later consideration and whom i can not conscientiously recommend to children i had already enjoyed sip of thackeray reading at venture in v anity fair about the battle of waterloo it was not like lever s accounts of battles but it was enchanting however vanity fair was under taboo it is not easy to say why but mr thackeray himself informed small boy whom he found reading v anity fair under the table that he had better read something else what harm can the story to child he reads about waterloo about fat jos about little geor ge and the pony about little rawdon and the and is happy and unharmed leaving my hermitage and going into the very dif ferent and very disagreeable world of master s house i was lucky enough to ﬁnd charming library there most of thackeray was on the shelves and thackeray became the chief enchanter henry kingsley says boy reads him and thinks he knows all about life i not think that the mundane parts about lady kew and her wiles about ethel and the marquis of farintosh appealed to one or enlightened one ethel was mystery and not an interesting mystery though one used to copy doyle s pictures of her with the straight nose the impossible eyes the impossible waist it was not ethel who captivated us it was clive s youth and art it was the painter it was jolly f and his address to the maid about the lobster ﬁner ﬁsh mary my dear i have never seen does not this solve the vexed question whether lobsters are ﬁsh in the french sense then the rose and the ring came out it was worth while to be twelve years old when the christmas books were written by dickens and thackeray i got hold of the rose and the ring i know and of the christmas carol when they were damp from the press king valoroso and bulbo and angelica were even more delightful than scrooge and tiny tim and trotty veck one remembers the fairy monarch more vividly and the wondrous array of from which he sipped was it right nantes going on sipping i am sorry to say even after v aloroso was himself but of all thackeray s books i suppose pendennis was the favourite the delightful marryat had entertained us with peter simple and brien how good their ﬂight through france is with mesty and mr midshipman easy with jacob faithful mr thackeray s favourite and with snarleyyow but marryat never made us wish to run away to sea that did not seem to be one s vocation but the story of pen made one wish to run away to literature to the temple to streets where brown the famous reviewer might be seen walking with his wife and umbrella the writing of poems up to pictures the beer with warrington in the mornings the suppers in the these were the alluring things not society and lady rockminster and lord steyne well one has run away to literature since but where is the matutinal beer where is the where are warrington and foker and f i have never met them in this living world though brown the celebrated reviewer is familiar to and also mr sydney scraper of the oxford and cambridge club perhaps exist perhaps there are cakes and ale in the life literary and f may take his walks by the round pond but one never encounters these rarities and bungay and bacon are longer the innocent and ignorant rivals whom thackeray drew they not give those wonderful parties miss bunnion has become quite conventional percy popjoy has abandoned letters mr wenham does not toady mr wagg does not joke any more the literary life is very like any other in london or is it that we not see it aright not having the eyes of genius well life on the ocean wave too may not be so desirable it seems in marryat s novels so many adventures among books https whom he tempted into the navy has discovered the best part of the existence of man of letters is his looking forward to it through the spectacles of titmarsh one can never say how much one owes to who was friend of literature who kept houseful of books and who was himself graceful scholar and an author while he chose to write of poetic and humorous genius such was the master who wrote the day dreams of schoolmaster mr d arcy wentworth thompson to whom in this place i am glad to confess my gratitude after all these many years while we were deep in the history of pendennis we were also being dragged through the commentaries of caius julius cæsar through the latin and greek grammars through xenophon and the eclogues of virgil and depressing play of euripides the i can never say how much i detested these authors who taken in small doses are far indeed from being attractive horace to lazy boy appears in his odes to have nothing to say and to say it in the most frivolous and vexatious manner then cowper s task or paradise lost with notes seems arid enough to i remember reading ahead in cowper instead of attending to the lesson and the his observations on public schools were not uninteresting but the whole english work of those days was repugnant one s english education was all got out of school to greek years it seemed mere vacuous terror one invented one s self all the current ar guments against compulsory what was the use of it who ever spoke in it who could ﬁnd any sense in it or any interest language with such cruel superﬂuities middle voice and dual language whose verbs were so fantastically irregular looked like barbaric survival mere plague and torment so one thought till homer was opened before us elsewhere i have tried to describe the vivid delight of ﬁrst reading homer delight by the way which augustine failed to appreciate most boys not wholly immersed in dulness felt it i think to myself one homer was the real beginning of study one had tried him when one was very young in pope and had been bafﬂed by pope and his artiﬁcial manner his fairs and homer seemed better reading in the absurd crib which mr buckley wrote bohn s series hector and ajax in that disguise were great favourites horatius on the bridge or the younger tarquin scott by the way must have made one furious and consistent legitimist in reading the lays of ancient rome my sympathies were with the expelled kings at least with him who fought so well at lake regillus titus the youngest tarquin too good such valerius struck at titus and lopped of f half his crest but titus stabbed valerius span deep in the breast i ﬁnd on the mar gin of my old copy in schoolboy s hand the words w ell done the jacobites perhaps my politics have never gone much beyond this sentiment but this is digression from homer the very sound of the hexameter that long inimitable roll of the most various music was enough to win the heart even if the words were not understood but the words proved unexpectedly easy to understand full they are of all nobility all tenderness all courage courtesy and romance the morte d arthur itself which about this time fell into our hands was not so dear the odyssey though boy to read sir thomas malory is to ride at adventure in enchanted forests to enter haunted chapels where light shines from the graal to ﬁnd by lonely mountain meres the magic boat of sir galahad after once being initiated into the mysteries of greece by homer the work at greek was longer tedious herodotus was charming and humorous and thucydides his account of the sicilian expedition and its ending was one of the very adventures among books https in literature which almost if not quite brought tears into one s eyes few passages indeed have done that and they are curiously discrepant the ﬁrst book that ever made cry of which feat i was horribly ashamed was uncle tom s cabin with the death of eva topsy s friend then it was trying when colonel newcome said adsum and the end of socrates in the phaedo moved one more than seemed these and passage in the history of skalagrim lamb s tail and i said the ruin of the athenians in the syracusan bay i have read these chapters in an old french version derived through the italian from latin translation of thucydides even in this far descended form the tale keeps its pathos the calm grave stamp of that tragic telling can not be worn away by much handling by long time by the many changes of human speech others too says nicias in that fatal speech all was done that men may and all was done in vain having achieved what men may have borne what men this is the very burden of life and the last word of tragedy now all is vain courage wisdom piety the bravery of lamachus the goodness of nicias the brilliance of alcibiades all are expended all wasted nothing of that brave venture abides except torture defeat and death play not poem of individual fortunes is so moving this ruin of people modern story can stir us with all its eloquence like the brief gravity of this ancient history nor can we ﬁnd at the last any wisdom more wise than that which bids us what men may and bear what men must such are the lessons of the greek of the people who tried all things in the morning of the world and who still speak to us of what they tried in words which are the sum of human gaiety and gloom of grief and triumph hope and despair the world since their day has but followed in the same round which only seems new has only made the same experiments and failed with the same failure but less gallantly and less gloriously one s adventures among books ended not long after winning the friendship of homer and thucydides of lucretius and catullus one s application was far too desultory to make serious and accurate scholar i confess to having learned the classical languages it were by accident the sake of what is in them and with provokingly imperfect accuracy cricket and trout occupied far too much of my mind and my time christopher north and walton and thomas tod stoddart and the moor and the loch were my holiday reading and i not regret it philologists and ireland scholars are not made so but you can in way fashion scholar out of casual and inaccurate intelligence the true scholar is one whom i envy almost much i respect him but there is kind of mental where accents and verbal niceties are concerned which can not be sharpened into true scholarship yet even those afﬂicted in this way and with the malady of being idle careless little boys the ancient classics have value which there is substitute there is charm in ﬁnding common humanity our puzzles our cares our joys in the writings of men severed from us by race religion speech and half the gulf of historical other literary pleasure can equal then there is to be added the university preacher observed the pleasure of despising our who not know doubtless in that there is great consolation it would be interesting were it possible to know what proportion of people really care poetry and how the love of poetry came to them and grew in them and where and when it stopped modern poets whom one meets are apt to say that poetry is not read at all byron s murray ceased to publish poetry in 1830 just when tennyson and browning were striking their preludes probably mr murray was wise in his generation but it is also likely that many persons even now are attached to poetry though they certainly not buy contemporary verse how did the passion come to them how long did it stay when did the muse say to myself i have remarked poetry came with sir walter scott one read shakespeare child rather in kind of dream of fairyland and enchanted isles than with any distinct consciousness that one was occupied adventures among books https next to scott with came longfellow who pleased one more reﬂective and tenderly sentimental while the reﬂections were not so deep to be puzzling i remember how hiawatha came out when one was boy and how delightful was the free forest life and minnehaha and paupukkeewis and nokomis one did not then know that the same charm with yet fresher dew upon it was to meet one later in the but at that time one had conscious pleasure in poetic style except in such ringing verse scott s and campbell s in his patriotic pieces the pleasure and enchantment of style ﬁrst appealed to at about the age of ﬁfteen when one read the ﬁrst so all day long the noise of battle rolled among the mountains by the winter sea until king arthur s table man by man had fallen in l yonnesse about their previously one had only heard of mr tennyson name when child i was told that poet was coming to house in the highlands where we chanced to be poet named tennyson is he poet like sir walter scott i remember asking and was told he was not like sir walter hearing more of him i was prowling among the books in an ancient house rambling old place with where i found tupper and could not get on with proverbial philosophy next i tried tennyson and instantly new light of poetry dawned new music was audible new god came into my medley of pantheon god never to be dethroned men scarcely know how beautiful ﬁre is shelley says i am convinced that we scarcely know how great poet lord tennyson is use has made him too familiar the same hand has raised the table round again that has written the sacred book of friendship that has lulled us with the magic of the lotus eaters and the melody of t he has made us move like his own among world of ghosts and feel ourselves the shadows of he has enriched our world with conquests of romance he has recut and reset thousand ancient gems of greece and rome he has roused our patriotism he has stirred our pity there is hardly human passion but he has pur ged it and ennobled it including this of truly the laureate remains the most various the sweetest the most exquisite the most learned the most virgilian of all english poets and we may pity the lovers of poetry who died before tennyson came here may end the desultory tale of desultory bookish boyhood it was not in nature that one should not begin to rhyme one s self but those exercises were seldom even written down they lived little while in memory which has lost them long ago i remember that i tried some of my attempts on my dear mother who said much what dryden said to cousin swift y will never be poet decision in which i straightway acquiesced to rhyme is one thing to be poet quite another good deal of mortiﬁcation would be avoided if young men and maidens only kept this obvious fact well posed in front of their vanity and their ambition in these bookish memories i have said nothing about religion and religious books various reasons but unlike other scots of the pen i got harm from the shorter catechism of which i remember little and neither then nor now was or am able to understand single sentence some precocious metaphysicians comprehended and stood aghast at justiﬁcation sanctiﬁcation adoption and ef fectual calling these apparently were necessary processes in the scottish spiritual life but we were not told what they meant nor were we distressed by sense that we had not passed through them from most children one trusts calvinism ran like water of f duck s back unlucky were they who ﬁrst absorbed and later were compelled to get rid of the shorter catechism one good thing if more these memories may accomplish young men especially in america write to and ask to recommend course of distrust adventures among books https reading people who really care books read all of them there is other course let this be reply other answer shall they get from the inquiring young men i i people talk in novels about the delights of ﬁrst love one may venture to doubt whether everybody exactly knows which was his or her ﬁrst love of men or women but about our ﬁrst loves in books there can be mistake they were and remain the dearest of all after boyhood the bloom is of f the literary rye the ﬁrst parcel of these garrulities ended when the author left school at about the age of seventeen one s literary equipment seems to have been then almost complete it ever will be one s tastes deﬁnitely formed one s favourites already chosen long we live we hope to read but we never can recapture the ﬁrst ﬁne careless besides one begins to write and that is fatal my own ﬁrst essays were composed at other boys not long ago the gentleman who was then our english master wrote to informing he was my earliest public and that he had never credited my younger brother with the essays which that unscrupulous lad i speak of him but brotherly was accustomed to present his consideration on leaving school at seventeen i went to leonard s hall in the university of andrews that is the oldest of scotch universities and was founded by papal bull leonard s hall after having been hospitium pilgrims home old ladies about 1500 and college in the university was now kind of cross between master s house at school and before 1750 college we had more liberty than schoolboys less than english under graduates in the scotch universities the men live scattered in lodgings and only recently at andrews have they begun to dine together in hall we had common roof common dinners wore scarlet gowns possessed football and cricket clubs and started of course kind of weekly magazine it was only manuscript af fair and was profusely illustrated the only time in my life i was now an editor under editor who kept up to my work and cut out my ﬁne passages the editor s duty was to write most of the write essays reviews of books by the professors very severe novels short stories poems translations also to illustrate these and to fag his friends copy and drawings deplorable ﬂippancy seems far one remembers to have been the chief characteristic of the and an abundant use of the supernatural these were the days of lord lytton s strange story which i continue to think most satisfactory romance inspired by lord l ytton and aided by the university library i read cornelius agrippa trithemius petrus abano michael scott and struggled with iamblichus and plotinus these are really but disappointing writers it soon became evident enough that the devil was not to be raised by their prescriptions that the philosopher s stone was beyond the reach of the amateur iamblichus is particularly obscure and tedious to any young beginner i would recommend petrus abano the most adequate and gruesome of the school real deevilry and pleesure while in the wilderness of plotinus there are many beautiful passages and lofty speculations two winters in the northern university with the seamy side of school life left behind among the kindest of sellar ferrier the society of the warden mr rhoades and of many dear old friends are the happiest time in my life this was true literary leisure even if it was not too well employed and the religio loci should be liberal education in itself we had debating hope i am now given an attack on the character of sir william wallace latro quidam the chronicler calls him certain but i am ever writing about inaccurately too the scotch critics declare farewell we cried dear city of youth and dream eternally dear and sacred here we ﬁrst made acquaintance with mr browning guided to his works by parody which lady wrote in our little magazine mr browning was not popular poet in his admirers were few little people but they were not then in the later mood of reverence they did not awfully question the oracles in after years they read adventures among books https they applauded on occasion they mocked the book by which mr browning was best known was the two green volumes of men and in these i still think is the heart of his genius beating most strenuously and with an immortal vitality perhaps this its compass is the collection of poetry the most various and rich of modern english times almost of any english times but just mr fitzgerald cared little what lord tennyson wrote after 1842 so i have never been able to feel quite the same enthusiasm mr browning s work after men and he seems to have more inﬂuence though that inﬂuence is vague on persons who chieﬂy care thought than on those who chieﬂy care poetry i have met lady who had read the ring and the book often the lotus eaters not once among such students are mr browning s disciples of the inner court i dwell but in the court of the gentiles while we who attempt more or less consciously imitated the manner of lord tennyson mr swinburne mr rossetti such imitations of mr browning are uncommonly scarce he is lucky enough not to have had the seed of his ﬂower stolen and sown everywhere once again the people called it but the other new poet of these days was mr clough who has many under graduate qualities but his peculiar wistful scepticism in religion had then inﬂuence on such of us were still happily in the ages of faith anything like doubt comes less of reading perhaps than of the sudden necessity which in almost every life puts belief on her trial and cries an examination of the creeds hitherto held upon authority and by dint of use and wont in dif ferent way one can hardly care mr matthew arnold boy till one has come under the inﬂuence of oxford so mr browning was the only poet added to my pantheon at andrews though macaulay then was admitted and appeared to be more the true model of prose writer than he seems in the light of later reﬂection probably we all have period of admiring carlyle almost exclusively college essays when the essayist cares his work are generally based on one or the other then they recede into the background their thought we can not ever remain disciples we begin to see how much that looks like thought is really the expression of temperament and how individual thing temperament is how each of us must construct his world himself or be content to wait an answer and synthesis in that far divine event to which the whole creation so one in these high matters i must be content masterless man swearing by philosopher unless he be the imperial stoic of the hardy heart marcus aurelius antoninus perhaps nothing in education encourages this incredulity about masters of thought like the history of philosophy the professor of moral philosophy ferrier was famous metaphysician and scholar his lectures on the history of greek philosophy were an admirable introduction to the subject afterwards pursued in the original authorities at oxford mr ferrier was an exponent of other men s ideas so fair and persuasive that in each new school we thought we had discovered the secret we were physicists with thales and that company of gallant gentlemen whom sydney smith confessed his lack of admiration we were now empedocleans now believers in heraclitus now in socrates now in plato now in aristotle in each lecture our professor set up new master and gently disintegrated him in the next amurath to amurath succeeds mr green used to say at oxford he himself became an amurath sultan of thought even before his apotheosis the guide of that bewildered cler gyman robert elsmere at oxford when one went there one found mr green already in the position of leader of thought and of young men he was tutor of balliol and lectured on aristotle and of him eager youth said in the words of omar khayyam he knows he knows what was it that mr green knew where was the secret to mind already sceptical about masters it seemed that the secret apart from the tutor s noble simplicity and rare elevation of character was knack of translating john and aristotle alike into terminology which we then believed to be hegelian hegel we knew not in the original german but in lectures and in translations reasoning adventures among books https inadequate premises it seemed to that hegel had invented evolution before mr darwin that his system showed so to speak the spirit at work in evolution the something within the wheels but this was only personal impression made on mind which knew darwin and physical speculations in general merely in the vague popular way mr green s pupils could generally write in his own language more or less and could envisage things we said then from his point of view to this was believed probably without cause to be useful in examinations one i could never take it much more seriously never believed that the absolute the oxfor d spectator said had really been got into corner the absolute has too often been apparently cornered too often has escaped from that situation somewhere in an old notebook i believe i have portrait in pencil of mr green he wrestled at lecture with aristotle with the notion with his chair and table perhaps he was the last of that remarkable series of men who may have begun with wycliffe among whom newman s is famous name that were successively accepted at oxford knowing something esoteric possessing shrewd guess at the secret none the less i still came out wiser than i all of these masters and teachers made their mark probably won their hold in the ﬁrst place by dint of character not of some peculiar views of theology and philosophy doubtless it was the same with socrates with buddha to be like them not to believe with them is the thing needful but the younger we are the less perhaps we see this clearly and we persuade ourselves that there is some mystery in these men s possession some piece of knowledge some method of thinking which will lead us to certainty and to peace alas their secret is incommunicable and there is more philosophic than there is royal road to the city this may seem digression from adventures among books into the book of human life but while much of education is still orally communicated by lectures and conversations many thoughts which are to be found in books greek or german reach us through the hearing there are many pupils who can best be taught in this way but one if there be aught that is desirable in book i then now preferred if i could to go to the book it yet it is odd that one remembers so little of one s under graduate readings apart from the constant study of the ancient classics which might not be escaped of these the calm wisdom of aristotle in moral thought and in politics made perhaps the deepest impression probably politicians are the last people who read aristotle s the work is indeed apt to disenchant one with political life it is melancholy to see the little greek states running the regular oligarchy tyranny democracy in all its degrees the ultimate democracy of plunder lawlessness license of women children and slaves and then tyranny again or subjection to some foreign power in politics too there is secret of success of the happy life all there is such road to the city either democratic or royal this is the lesson which aristotle s polities impresses on us this and the impossibility of imposing ideal constitutions on mankind whate er is best administered is these are some of the impressions made at oxford by the studies of the schools the more or less inevitable curricoolum the scotch gentleman pronounced the word but at oxford most men the regular work of the schools is only small part of the literary education people read in dif ferent degrees according to their private tastes there are always few men at least who love literary studies their own sake regardless of lectures and of in my own time i really believe you could know nothing which might not pay in the schools and prove serviceable in examinations but good deal depended on being able to use your knowledge by way of literary illustration perhaps the cleverest of my own juniors since very well known in letters did not use his own special vein even when he had the chance in writing answers to questions in examinations hence his academic success was much below his deserts my own part i remember my tutor saying don t adventures among books https if you were writing penny paper alas it was prediction cruel but yet sin was at my own college we had to write weekly essays alternately in english and latin this might have been good literary training but i fear the essays were not taken very seriously the chief object was to make the late learned dr scott bound on his chair by paradoxes but nobody ever succeeded he was experienced in trash what may be called unacademic literature there were not many essays in that art there have been very literary generations when corydon and thyrsis lived in oxford if it had been great country house so corydon confessed probably many of the poems by mr matthew arnold and many of mr swinburne s early works were under graduate poems later generation produced love in idleness very pleasing volume but the gods had not made us poetical in those days i remember picking up in the union room pretty white quarto atalanta in calydon by swinburne only once had i seen mr swinburne s name before signing brief tale in once w eek atalanta was revelation there was new and original poet here balliol man too in my own mind atalanta remains the best the most beautiful the most musical of mr swinburne s many poems he instantly became the easily parodied model of under graduate versiﬁers swinburnian prize poems even were attempted without success yet we had not seen mr matthew arnold s verses i fell in love with them one long vacation and never fell out of love he is not and can not be the poet of the wide world but his charm is all the more powerful over those whom he attracts and subdues he is the one oxford poet of oxford and his scholar gypsy is our l at this time he was professor of poetry but alas he lectured just at the hour when wickets were pitched on cowley marsh and i never was present at his discourses at his humorous prophecies of england s fate which are coming all too true so many weary lectures had to be attended could not be cut that we abstained from lectures of supererogation so to speak the rest there was literary movement among contemporary under graduates they read the schools and they rowed and played cricket we had poets except the stroke of the corpus boat mr bridges and he concealed his courtship of the muse corpus is small college but mr bridges pulled its boat to the proud place of second on the river was the head boat and even did corpus bump but the triumph was brief made changes in its crew got new ship drank the foaming grape and bumped corpus back i think they went head next year but not that year thus mr bridges kingsley advises was doing noble deeds not dreaming them at that moment there existed periodical entirely devoted to verse but nobody knew anybody who wrote in it comic journal was started i remember the pride with which when freshman i received an invitation to join its councils an artist i was to the caricatures of all things now methought i shall meet the oxford wits of whom i have read but the wits were unutterably disappointing and the whole thing died early and not lamented only one piece of academic literature obtained and deserved success this was the oxfor d spectator most humorous little periodical in shape and size like addison s famous journal the authors were mr reginald copleston now bishop of colombo mr humphry ward and mr nolan great athlete who died early there have been good periodicals since many amusing things occur in the echoes fr om the oxfor d magazine but the spectator was the ﬂower of academic journals when i look back to my own experience says the spectator i ﬁnd one scene of all oxford most deeply engraved upon the mindful tablets of my and yet not scene but fairy compound of smell and sound and sight and thought the wonderful scent of the meadow air just above ifﬂey on hot may evening and the gay colours of twenty boats along the shore the poles all stretched out from the bank to set the boats clear and the sonorous cries of ten seconds more all down from the green bar ge to the lasher and yet that unrivalled moment is only typical of all the term the various elements of beauty and pleasure are concentrated adventures among books https life at oxford is not all beauty and pleasure things go wrong somehow life drops her happy mask but this has nothing to with books about books however i have not many more confessions that i care to make man s old self is so far away that he can speak about it and its adventures almost if he were speaking about another who is dead after taking one s degree and beginning to write little publication the topic has tendency to become much more personal my last under graduate literary discoveries were of france and the renaissance accidentally ﬁnding out that i could read french i naturally betook myself to balzac if you read him straight on without dictionary you begin to learn good many words the literature of france has been much more popular in england lately but thirty years agone it was somewhat neglected there does seem to be something in french poetry which fails to please the german paste in our mr matthew arnold disciple of beuve never could appreciate french poetry has even remarked that the french language is nearly incapable of poetry we can not ar gue in such matters where all depends on the taste and the ear our ancestors like the author of the faery queen translated and admired du bellay and ronsard to some critics of our own time this taste seems modish af fectation one i have ever found an original charm in the lyrics of the pleiad and have taken great delight in hugo s amazing variety of music in the romance of alfred musset in the beautiful cameos of gautier what is poetical if not the song of roland the only true national epic since homer what is frank natural verse if not that of the old pastour elles where is there naïveté of narrative and unconscious charm if not in aucassin et nicolette in the long normally developed literature of france so variously rich we ﬁnd the nearest analogy to the literature of greece though that of england contains greater masterpieces and her verse falls more winningly on the ear france has shakespeare and milton we have molière and song of one star differs from another in glory but it is fortunate moment when this planet of france swims into our ken many of our generation saw it ﬁrst through mr swinburne s telescope heard of it in his criticisms and are grateful to that watcher of the skies even if we not share all his transports there then arose at oxford out of old french and old oak and old china school or it was æsthetic and an early purchaser of william morris s wall papers it existed ten or twelve years before the public caught on they say to these delights but except one or two of the masters the school were only playing at æsthetics and laughing at their own performances there was more fun than fashion in the cult which was later revived developed and gossiped about more than enough to writer now dead and then ﬁrst met i am specially bound in late mr m lennan mr m lennan had the most acute and ingenious of minds which i have encountered his writings on early marriage and early religion were revelations which led on to others the topic of folklore and the development of custom and myths is not generally attractive to be sure only few people seem interested in that spectacle so full of development of all human institutions from fairy tales to democracy in beholding it we learn how we owe all things humanly speaking to the people and to genius the natural people the folk has supplied us in its unconscious way with the stuf f of all our poetry law ritual and genius has selected from the mass has turned customs into codes nursery tales into romance myth into science ballad into epic magic mummery into gor geous ritual the world has been educated but not man would have trained and taught it he led us by way we knew not led and is leading us we know not whither we follow in fear the student of this lore can look back and see the long trodden way behind him the winding tracks through marsh and forest and over burning sands he sees the caves the camps the villages the towns where the race has tarried shorter times or longer strange places many of them and strangely haunted desolate dwellings and inhospitable but the scarce visible tracks conver ge at last on the beaten ways the ways to that city whither mankind is wandering and which it may never win we have adventures among books https of purpose which we know not sense of will working we would not have worked to hidden end this is the lesson i think of what we call folklore or anthropology which to many seems trivial to many seems dull it may become the most attractive and serious of the sciences certainly it is rich in strange curiosities like those mystic stones which were ﬁngered and arrayed by the pupils in that allegory of novalis i am not likely to regret the accident which brought up on fairy tales and the inquisitiveness which led to examine the other fragments of antiquity but the poetry and the signiﬁcance of them are apt to be hidden by the enormous crowd of details only late we ﬁnd the true meaning of what seems like mass of fantastic savage eccentricities i very well remember the moment when it occurred to soon after taking my degree that the usual ideas about some of these matters were the reverse of the truth that the common theory had to be inverted the notion was in the air it had already ﬂashed on mannhardt probably but like the white knight in alice i claimed it my own these reminiscences and reﬂections have now been produced far 1872 or thereabouts and it is not my intention to pursue them further nor to speak of any living contemporaries who have not won their way to the classical in writing of friends and teachers at oxford i have not ventured to express gratitude to those who still live still teach still are the wisest and kindest friends of the hurrying generations it is silence not of thanklessness but of respect and devotion about or juniors by many have instructed consoled strengthened and amused us we must also be silent chapter ii recollections of rober t louis stevenson tusit ala we spoke of rest in fairy hill of the north but he far from the ﬁrths of the east and the racing tides of the west sleeps in the sight and the sound of the inﬁnite southern sea weary and well content in his grave on the vaëa crest tusitala the lover of children the teller of tales giver of counsel and dreams wonder world s delight looks er the labour of men in the plain and the hill and the sails pass and repass on the sea that he loved in the day and the night winds of the west and the east in the rainy season blow heavy with perfume and all his fragrant woods are wet winds of the east and the west they wander to and fro bear him the love of the lands he loved and the long regret once we were kindest he said when leagues of the limitless sea flowed between us but now that range of the reﬂuent tides sunders us each from each yet nearer we seem to be when only the unbridged stream of the river of death divides before attempting to give any reminiscences of mr stevenson it is right to observe that reminiscences of him can best be found in his own works in his essay on child s play and in his child s garden of verse he gave to the world his vivid recollections of his imaginative infancy in other essays he spoke of his boyhood his health his dreams his methods of work and study the silverado squatters reveals part of adventures among books https in america the parisian scenes in the wrecker are inspired by his sojourn in french bohemia his journeys are recorded in t ravels with donkey and an inland voyage while his south sea sketches which appeared in periodicals deal with his oceanic adventures he was the most autobiographical of authors with an egoism nearly complete and to us delightful the egoism of montaigne thus the proper sources of information about the author of kidnapped are in his delightful books john s own john dr holmes says may be very unlike his neighbour s john but in the case of mr stevenson his louis was very similar to my louis i mean that he presents his personality to the world in his writings even so did that personality appear to in our intercourse the man i knew was always boy sing song of the lad that is gone he wrote about prince charlie but in his own case the lad was never like keats and shelley he was and he looked of the immortally young he and i were at school together but i was an elderly boy of seventeen when he was lost in the crowd of gytes the members of the lowest form are called like all scotch people we had vague family connection of his i fancy married an aunt of my own called her beauty the flower of so we had both heard but these things were before our day lady of my kindred remembers carrying stevenson about when he was rather peevish baby and i have seen beautiful photograph of him like one of raf fael s children taken when his years were three or four but i never had heard of his existence till in 1873 i think i was at mentone in the interests of my health here i met mr sidney colvin now of the british museum and with mr colvin stevenson he looked in my eyes he always did look more like lass than lad with rather long smooth oval face brown hair worn at greater length than is common lar ge lucid eyes but whether blue or brown i can not remember if brown certainly light brown on appealing to the authority of lady i learn that brown was the hue his colour was triﬂe hectic is not unusual at mentone but he seemed under his big blue cloak to be of slender yet agile frame he was like nobody else whom i ever met there was sort of uncommon celerity in changing expression in thought and speech his cloak and tyrolese hat he would admit the innocent impeachment were decidedly dear to him on the frontier of italy why should he not the italians it would have been well if i could have imitated the wearing of the cloak i shall not deny that my ﬁrst impression was not wholly favourable here i thought is one of your æsthetic young men though very clever what the talk was about i not remember probably of books mr stevenson afterwards told that i had spoken of monsieur paul victor ﬁne writer but added that he was not british mr stevenson himself to my surprise was unable to walk beyond very short distance and it soon appeared he thought his thread of life was nearly spun he had just written his essay ordered south the ﬁrst of his published works his pentland rising pamphlet was unknown boy s performance on reading ordered south i saw at once that here was new writer writer indeed one who could what none of us nous autr es could rival or approach i was instantly sealed of the tribe of louis an admirer devotee fanatic if you please at least my taste has never altered from this essay it is plain enough that the author is so common in youth but with better reason than many have thought himself doomed most of us have gone through that the millevoye phase but who else has shown such wise and gay acceptance of the apparently inevitable we parted i remember little of our converse except shrewd and hearty piece of encouragement given by my junior who already knew so much more of life than his senior will ever he ran forth to embrace life like lover his motto was never lucy ashton vacant heart and hand and eye easy live and quiet adventures among books https stevenson came presently to visit at oxford i make hand of reminiscences i remember nothing about what we did or said with one exception which is not going to be published i heard of him writing essays in the portfolio and the cornhill those delightful views of life at so brave so real so vivid so wise so exquisite which all should know how we looked r at the end of an article and how devout was our belief how happy our pride in the young one about 1878 i think i was now slave of the quill myself i received brief note from stevenson introducing to the person whom in his essay on his old college magazine he called glasgow what his real name was whence he came whence the money came i never knew was going to start weekly tory paper would i contribute came to see mr stevenson has described him not i would have described him like mr bill sikes s dog i have the christian peculiarity of not liking dogs are not of my s paper london was to start next week he had writer of political leading articles would i leader but i was not in favour of lord l ytton s afghan policy how could i tory leader well i did thing with citations from aristophanes i found presently some other scribes what paper that was i have heard that paid in handfuls of gold in handfuls of nobody ever read london or advertised in it or heard of it it was full of the most wonderfully clever verses in old french forms they were it afterwards appeared by mr henley mr stevenson himself astonished and delighted the public of london that is the contributors by his new arabian nobody knew about them but ourselves fortunate few poor died and mr henley became the editor i may not name the contributors the ﬂower of the young lions elderly lions now there is new race but one lion distinguished and learned lion said already that ﬁction not essay was mr stevenson s ﬁeld well both ﬁelds were his and i can not say whether i would be more sorry to lose virginibus puerisque and studies of men and books or t reasure island and with the decease of pactolus dried up in its mysterious sources london struggled and disappeared stevenson was in town now and again at the old saville club in saville row which had the tiniest and blackest of here or somewhere he spoke to of an idea of tale man who was two men i said w illiam wilson by edgar poe and declared that it would never but his brownies in vision of the night showed him central scene and he wrote jekyll and my friend of these days and of all days mr charles longman sent the manuscript in very commonplace london at p i began to read it arriving at the place where utterson the lawyer and the butler wait outside the doctor s room i threw down the manuscript and ﬂed in hurry i had taste solitude any more the story won its great success partly by dint of the moral whatever that may be more by its terrible lucid visionary power i remember mr stevenson telling at this time that he was doing some regular crawlers this purist had boyish habit of slang and i think it was he who called julius cæsar the howlingest cheese who ever one of the crawlers was thrawn janet after w andering willie s tale but certainly after it to my taste it seems the most wonderful story of the supernatural in our language stevenson had an inﬁnite pleasure in boisgobey montépin and of course gaboriau there was nothing of the cultured person about him concerning novel dear to culture he said that he would die by my side in the last ditch proclaiming it the worst ﬁction in the world i make haste to add that i have only known two men of letters free mr stevenson not only from literary jealousy but from the writer s natural if exaggerated distaste work which though in his own line is very dif ferent in aim and method from his own i not remember another case in which he dispraised any book i remember his observations on novel then and now very popular but not to his taste nor indeed by any means impeccable though stirring his censure and praise were both just from his occasional ﬁne ef forts the author of this romance he said should have cleared away acres of brushwood of inef fectual matter it was so doubt adventures among books https spoken of would be ready to acknowledge but he was an improviser of genius and mr stevenson was conscious artist of course we did by means always agree in literary estimates two people but when certain his line in one stupidly set up rivals of his the person who was most irritated was not he but his equally magnanimous contemporary there was thought of rivalry or competition in either mind the younger romancists who arose after mr stevenson went to samoa were his friends by correspondence from them who never saw his face i hear of his sympathy and encouragement every writer knows the special temptations of his tribe they were temptations not even felt i believe by mr stevenson his heart was far too high his nature was in every way generous his hand was open it is in thinking of these things that one feels afresh the greatness of the world s loss good heart is much more than style writes one who knew him only by way of letters it is trivial reminiscence that we once plotted boisgobesque story together there was prisoner in muscovite dungeon we ll extract information from him i said how with but the mere suggestion of such process was terribly distasteful to him not that i really meant to go to these extreme lengths we never of course could really have worked together and his maladies increasing he became more and more wanderer living at bournemouth at davos in the grisons ﬁnally all know in samoa thus though we corresponded not unfrequently i never was of the inner circle of his friends among men there were school or college companions or companions of paris or fontainebleau cousins like mr stevenson or stray senior like mr sidney colvin from some of them or from mr stevenson himself i have heard tales of the wild prince and that he and friend travelled utterly without baggage buying shirt where shirt was needed is fact and the incident is used in the wrecker legend says that once he and friend did possess bag and also nobody ever knew why lar ge bottle of scent but there was room the bottle in the bag so mr stevenson spilled the whole contents over the other man s head taking him unawares that nothing might be wasted i think the tale of the endless staircase in the wrecker is founded on fact so are the stories of the atelier which i have heard mr stevenson narrate at the oxford and cambridge club nocturnal adventure in the manner of the new arabian nights learned critic already spoken of must be consulted it is not my story in paris at café i remember that mr stevenson heard frenchman say the english were cowards he got up and slapped the man s face monsieur vous m avez frappé said the gaul ce qu il parait said the scot and there it ended he also told that years ago he was present at play i get what play in paris where the moral hero exposes woman with history he got up and went out saying to himself what play what people ah monsieur vous êtes bien jeune said an old french gentleman like right scot mr stevenson was fond of our auld ally of france to whom our country and our exiled kings owed so much i rather vaguely remember another anecdote he missed his train from edinbur gh to london and his sole portable property was return ticket meerschaum pipe and volume of mr swinburne s poems the last he found unmarketable the pipe i think he made merchandise of but somehow his provender the day s journey consisted in one bath bun which he could not adventures among books https trivial tales illustrate period in his life and adventures which i only know by rumour our own acquaintance was to great degree literary and bookish perhaps it began with slight aversion but it seemed like madeira to be ripened and improved by his long sea voyage and the news of his death taught at least the true nature of the af fection which he was destined to win indeed our acquaintance was like the friendship of wild singing bird and of punctual domesticated fowl laying its daily article the of the citizens he often wrote to from samoa sometimes with news of native manners and folklore he sent the luck of some strange island which he bought at great price after parting with its luck or fetish shell in curious wooden box the island was unfortunate and was ravaged by measles i occasionally sent out books needed mr stevenson s studies of which more will be said but i must make it plain that in the body we met but rarely his really intimate friends were mr colvin and mr baxter who managed the practical side of his literary business between them mr henley in partnership with whom he wrote several plays his cousin mr stevenson and among other literati gosse mr austin dobson mr saintsbury mr walter pollock knew him well the best portrait of mr stevenson that i know is by sir richmond and is in that gentleman s collection of contemporaries with the efﬁgies of mr holman hunt mr william morris browning and others it is unﬁnished owing to an illness which stopped the sittings and does not show the subject at his best physically speaking there is also brilliant slight sketch almost caricature by mr sargent it represents mr stevenson walking about the room in conversation the people i have named or some of them knew mr stevenson more intimately than i can boast of doing unlike each other opposites in dozen ways we always were united by the love of letters and of scotland our dear country he was patriot yet he spoke his mind quite freely about burns about that apparent want of heart in the poet s amours which our countrymen not care to hear mentioned well perhaps some reasons it had to be mentioned once and so more of it stevenson possessed more than any man i ever met the power of making other men fall in love with him i mean that he excited passionate admiration and af fection so much so that i verily believe some men were jealous of other men s place in his liking i once met stranger who having become acquainted with him spoke of him with touching fondness and pride his fancy reposing it seemed in fond contemplation of so much genius and charm what was so taking in him and how is one to analyse that dazzling surface of pleasantry that changeful shining humour wit wisdom recklessness beneath which beat the most kind and tolerant of hearts people were fond of him and people were proud of him his achievements it were sensibly raised their pleasure in the world and to them became parts of themselves they warmed their hands at that centre of light and heat it is not every success which has these beneﬁcent results we see the successful sneered at decried insulted even when success is deserved very little of all this hardly aught of all this i think came in stevenson s way after the beginning when the praises of his earliest admirers were irritating to dull scribes he found the critics fairly kind i believe and often enthusiastic he was so much his own severest critic that he probably paid little heed to professional reviewers in addition to his rathillet and other mss which he destroyed he once in the highlands long ago lost portmanteau with batch of his writings alas that he should have lost or burned anything king s chaf f says our country proverb is better than other folk s i have remembered very little or very little that i can write and about our last meeting when he was so near death in appearance and so full of can i speak his courage was strong rock not to be taken or subdued when unable to utter single word his pencilled remarks to his attendants were pithy and extremely characteristic this courage and spiritual vitality made one hope that he would if he desired it live adventures among books https voltaire that reed among oaks there were of course in so rare combination of characteristics some which were not equally to the liking of all he was highly original in costume but his photographs are familiar the point does not need elucidation life was drama to him and he delighted like his own british admirals to things with certain air he observed himself i used to think he observed others and saw himself in every part he played there was nothing of the cabotin in this consciousness it was the unextinguished childish passion playing at things which remained with him i have theory that all children possess genius and that it dies out in the generality of mortals abiding only with people whose genius the world is forced to recognise mr stevenson illustrates and perhaps partly suggested this private philosophy of mine i have said very little i have skill in reminiscences art to bring the living aspect of the man before those who never knew him i faintly seem to see the eager face the light nervous ﬁgure the ﬁngers busy with rolling cigarettes mr stevenson talking listening often rising from his seat standing walking to and fro always full of vivid intelligence wearing mysterious smile i remember one pleasant dark afternoon when he told many tales of strange adventures narratives which he had heard about murderous lonely inn somewhere in the states he was good to hear to read i not recollect much of that delight in discussion in controversy which he shows in his essay on conversation where he describes i believe mr henley burley and mr symonds he had great pleasure in the talk of the late professor fleeming jenkin which was both various and copious but in these noctes coenaeque deum i was never partaker in many topics such angling golf cricket whereon i am willingly dif fuse stevenson took interest he was very fond of boating and sailing in every kind he hazarded his health by long expeditions among the fairy isles of ocean but he was not british sportsman though his measure of strength good pedestrian friend of the open air and of all who live and toil therein to his literary likings they appear in his own confessions he revelled in dickens but about i would rather have talked to somebody else to my amazement he was of those i think who ﬁnd thackeray he takes you into garden and then pelts you with things mr stevenson on the other hand had free admiration of mr geor ge meredith he did not so easily give the longueus and lazinesses of scott scot should he read french much greek only in translations literature was of course his ﬁrst love but he was actually an advocate at the scottish bar and such had his name on brazen door once he was competitor chair of modern history in edinbur gh university he knew the romantic side of scottish history very well in his novel catriona the character of james mohr macgregor is wonderfully divined once i read some unpublished letters of catriona s unworthy father written when he was selling himself spy and lying he spied to the hanoverian usurper mr stevenson might have written these letters james mohr they might be extracts from in turning over old jacobite pamphlets i found gotten romance of prince charles s hidden years and longed that mr stevenson should retell it there was treasure an authentic treasure there were real spies real assassin real or reported rescue of lovely girl from ﬁre at strasbour g by the prince the tale was to begin sur le pont d avignon young scotch exile watching the rhone thinking how much of it he could cover with salmon ﬂy thinking of the tay or beauly to him enter another shady tramping exile blairthwaite murderer and so it was to run on the author s fancy might lead him with alan breck and the master characters at last in unpublished mss i found an actual master of ballantrae highland majestically paid spy of england all these papers i sent out to samoa too late the novel was to have been dedicated to and that chance of immortality is gone with so much adventures among books https stevenson s last letters to myself were full of his concern common friend of ours who was very depressed himself mr stevenson wrote to this should i not mention mr james payn consoling gaiety i attributed his depression to any cause but his own health of which he rarely spoke he lamented the ﬁfth act of life he at least had long hopeless years of diminished force to bear i have known man in whom the manly virtues of kindness courage sympathy generosity helpfulness were more beautifully conspicuous than in mr stevenson man so much is not too strong so many and such various people he was unique in character in literary genius chapter iii rab s friend to say what ought to be said concerning dr john brown man should have known him well and long and should remember much of that old generation of scotchmen to whom the author of rab and his friends belonged but that generation has departed one by one these wits and scholars of the north these epigoni who were not indeed of the heroes but who had seen and remembered scott and wilson have passed away aytoun and carlyle and dr burton and last dr brown are gone sir theodore martin alone is left in her memoir of dr historian of scotland and author of the hunter burton remarks that in her husband s later days only dr john brown and professor blackie remained of all her husband s ancient friends and coevals of all who remembered lockhart and hogg and their times but many are left who knew dr brown far better and more intimately than the author of this notice i can hardly say when i ﬁrst became acquainted with him probably it was in my childhood ever since i was boy certainly i used to see him at intervals especially in the christmas vacations but he seldom moved from edinbur gh except in summer which he frequently passed in the country house of certain friends of his whose af fection made much of the happiness of his latest years and whose unfailing kindness attended him in his dying hours living always in scotland dr brown was seen but rarely by his friends who resided in england thus though dr brown s sweetness of disposition and charm of manner his humour and his unfailing sympathy and encouragement made one feel toward him to familiar friend yet of his actual life i saw but little and have few reminiscences to contribute one can only speak of that singular geniality of his that temper of goodness and natural tolerance and af fection which scotsmen best know is not universal among the scots our race does not need to pray like the mechanic in the story that providence will give us good conceit of but we must acknowledge that the scotch temper is critical if not captious ar gumentative inclined to look at the seamy side of men and of their performances and to dwell on imperfections rather than on merits and virtues an example of these blemishes of the scotch disposition carried to an extreme degree in the nature of man of genius is of fered to the world in the writings and reminiscences of mr carlyle now john brown was at the opposite pole of feeling he had mawkish toleration of things and people intolerable but he preferred not to turn his mind that way his thoughts were with the good the wise the modest the learned the brave of times past and he was eager to catch reﬂection of their qualities in the characters of the living of all with whom he came into contact he was example almost optimistic in his estimate of the work of young people in art or literature from everything that was beautiful or good from summer day by the tweed or from the eyes of child or from the humorous saying of friend or from treasured memories of old scotch worthies from recollections of his own childhood from experience of the stoical heroism of the poor he seemed to extract matter pleasant thoughts of men and the world and nourishment his own great and gentle nature i have never known any man to adventures among books https men seemed so dead and men living he gave his genius to knowing them and to making them better known and his unselﬁshness thus became not only great personal virtue but great literary charm when you met him he had some good story or some story of goodness to both came alike to him and his humour was unfailing his kindness there was in his face singular charm blended it were of the expressions of mirth and of patience being most sensitive to pain well to pleasure he was an exception to that rule of rochefoucauld nous avons tous assez force pour supporter les maux d autrui 2 he did not bear easily the misfortunes of others and the evils of his own lot were heavy enough they saddened him but neither illness nor his poignant anxiety others could sour nature so unselﬁsh he appeared not to have lost that anodyne and consolation of religious hope which had been the strength of his forefathers and was his best inheritance from remarkable race of scotsmen wherever he came he was welcome people felt glad when they had encountered him in the streets of edinbur gh where almost every one knows every one by he was at least joyously received by the children and the dogs by the people of every family friend has kindly shown letter in which it is told how dr brown s love of dogs his interest in old dandy which was attached to him was evinced in the very last hours of his life but enough has been said in general terms about the character of the beloved physician dr brown was called in edinbur gh and brief account may be given in some detail of his life and ways john brown was born in biggar one of the gray little towns in the pastoral moorlands of southern scotland these towns have great beauty that they should be admired by strangers but the natives scott said to washington irving are attached to their gray hills and to the tweed so beautiful where man s greed does not pollute it that the border people are all in love with it tyro in homer loved the divine enipeus we hold it far the fairest of the ﬂoods that run upon the how dear the border scenery was to dr john brown and how well he knew and could express its legendary magic its charm woven of countless ancient spells the music of old ballads the sorcery of old stories may be understood by readers of his essay on minchmoor 3 the father of dr brown was the third in lineage of ministers of the sect called seceders to explain who the seceders were it would be necessary to explore the sinking morasses of scotch ecclesiastical history the minister was proud of being not only seceder but bur he inherited to be brief the traditions of most and most spirited set of men too much bent it may appear to us on establishing delicate distinctions of opinions but certainly most true to themselves and to their own ideals of liberty and of faith dr brown s had been shepherd boy who taught himself greek that he might read the new testament who walked his folded sheep in the buy the precious volume in andrews and who ﬁnally became teacher of much repute among his own people of dr brown s father he himself wrote most touching and beautiful account in his letter to john cairns this essay contains perhaps the very ﬁnest passages that the author ever penned his sayings about his own childhood remind one of the manner of lamb without that curious fantastic touch which is of the essence of lamb s style the following lines example are revelation of childish psychology and probably may be applied with almost much truth to the childhood of our race children are long of seeing or at least of looking at what is above them they like the ground and its ﬂowers and stones its red sodgers and birds and all its queer things their world is about thr ee feet high and they are more often stooping than gazing up i know i was past ten before i saw or cared to see the ceilings of the rooms in the manse at biggar i have often thought that the earliest fathers of our race in so many ways were in this and worshipped not the phenomena of the heavens but objects more on level with their queer things of their world in this essay on his father brown has written lines about child s ﬁrst knowledge of death adventures among books https noteworthy steele s famous passage about his father s death and his own conscious grief and anger brown describes scottish funeral of his own he saw it with the eyes of boy of ﬁve years old while his younger brother baby of few leaped up and crowed with joy at the strange crowding horsemen the coaches and the nodding plumes of the hearse then to my surprise and alarm the cofﬁn resting on its bearers was placed over the dark hole and i watched with curious eye the unrolling of those neat black bunches of cords which i have often enough seen since my father took the one at the head and also another much smaller springing from the same point his which he had caused to be placed there and unrolling it put it into my hand i twisted it ﬁrmly round my ﬁngers and awaited the result the burial men with their real ropes lowered the cofﬁn and when it rested at the bottom it was too far down to see it the grave was made very deep he used afterwards to tell us that it might hold us all my father ﬁrst and abruptly let his cord drop followed by the rest this was too much i now saw what was meant and held on and ﬁxed my ﬁst and feet and i believe my father had some difﬁculty in forcing open my small ﬁngers he let the little black cord drop and i remember in my misery and anger seeing its open end disappearing in the 4 the man who wrote this and many another passage true and tender might surely have been famous in ﬁction if he had turned his powers that way he had imagination humour pathos he was always studying and observing life his last volume especially is like collection of fragments that might have gone toward making work in some ways not inferior to the romances of scott when the third volume of essays was published in the spring of his last year reviewer who apparently had personal knowledge of dr brown asked why he did not write novel he was by that time over seventy years of age and though none guessed it within few weeks of his death what he might have done had he given himself to literature only it is impossible to guess but he caused so much happiness and did so much good in that gentle profession of healing which he chose and which brought him near to many who needed consolation more than physic that we need not get his deliberate choice literature had only his horae subsecivae he said subseciva quaedam tempora quae ego perir non patior cicero writes shreds and waste ends of time which i suf fer not to be the kind of life which dr brown s father and his people lived at biggar the austere life of work and of thought intensely bent on the real aim of existence on god on the destiny of the soul is perhaps rare now even in rural scotland we are less obedient than of old to the motto of that ring found on magus moor where archbishop shairp was murdered remember upon dethe if any reader has not yet made the acquaintance of dr brown s works one might counsel him to begin with the letter to john cairns the fragment of biography and autobiography the description of the fountainheads from which the genius of the author ﬂowed in his early boyhood john brown was educated by his father man who from his son s affectionate description seems to have conﬁned ﬁery and romantic genius within the channels of seceder and bur gher theology when the father received call to the rose street secession church in edinbur gh the son became pupil of that ancient scottish seminary the high school where scott was taught not much latin and greek worth mentioning scott was still alive and strong in those days and dr brown describes how he and his school companions would take of f their hats to the shirra he passed in the streets though lame he was nimble and all rough and alive with power had you met him anywhere else you would say he was liddesdale store farmer come of gentle blood stout blunt carle he says of himself with the swing and stride and the eye of man of the lar ge sunny air all about him on his broad and stooping shoulders was set that head which with shakespeare s and bonaparte s is the best known in all the scott was then living in 39 castle street i not adventures among books https the many pilgrims whom one meets moving constantly in the direction of melrose and abbotsford have thought of making pilgrimage to castle street and to the grave there of scott s dear old friend dog camp of dr brown s schoolboy days one knows when bob ainslie and i were coming up inﬁrmary street from the high school our heads together and our arms intertwisted only lovers and boys know how or why concerning the doctor s character he has left it on record that he liked shouted bob and was of f and so was i both of us all hot praying that it might not be over before we were up dogs like ﬁghting old isaac w atts not walton says they delight in it and the best of all reasons and boys are not cruel because they like to see the ﬁght this is very dif ferent thing from love of making dogs and this was the most famous of all the old irish brehons settled the laws of that sport and gravely decided what was to be done if child interfered or an idiot or woman or this was the in which rab ﬁrst was introduced to his historian six years passed after this battle and dr brown was medical student and clerk at minto hospital how he renewed his acquaintance there and in what sad circumstances with rab and his friends it is superﬂuous to tell every one who reads at all has read that story and most readers not without tears medical student in edinbur gh dr brown made the friendship of mr syme the famous sur friendship only closed by death i only saw them once together very long time ago and then from the point of view of patient these occasions are not agreeable and patients like the old cock which did not crow when plucked are apt to be very much absorbed but dr brown s attitude toward the man whom he regarded with the reverence of disciple well with the af fection of friend was very remarkable when his studies were over brown practised year assistant to sur geon in chatham it must have been when he was at chatham that curious event occurred many years later charles dickens was in edinbur gh reading his stories in public and was dining with some edinbur gh people dickens began to speak about the panic which the cholera had caused in england how ill some people had behaved contrast he mentioned that at chatham one poor woman had died deserted by every one except young physician some one however ventured to open the door and found the woman dead and the young doctor asleep overcome with the fatigue that mastered him on his patient s death but quite untouched by the general panic why that was dr john brown one of the guests observed and it seems that thus early in his career the doctor had been setting an example of the courage and charity of his profession after year spent in chatham he returned to edinbur gh where he spent the rest of his life busy partly with his art of healing partly with literature he lived in rutland street near the railway station by which edinbur gh is approached from the west and close to princes street the chief street of the town separated by green valley once loch from the high castle rock it was the room in which his friends were accustomed to see dr brown and room full of interest it was in his long life the doctor had gathered round him many curious relics of artists and men of letters drawing of dog by turner i remember particularly and copy of don juan in the ﬁrst edition with byron s manuscript notes dr brown had great love and knowledge of art and of artists from turner to leech and he had very many friends among men of letters such mr ruskin and mr thackeray brown himself was clever designer of rapid little grotesques rough sketches of dogs and men one or two of them are engraved in the little paper covered booklets in which some of his essays were separately which he was used to present to people who came to see him and who were interested in all that he did i remember some vivacious grotesques which he drew one of my brothers when we were schoolboys these little things were carefully treasured by boys who knew dr brown and found him friendly and capable of sustaining conversation on the points of dandy dinmont terrier and other mysteries important to youth he was taste which he inherited from his father who began collecting books when he was twelve and was collecting to his last adventures among books https last time i ever saw dr brown year before his death he was kind enough to lend one of the rarest of his treasures poems by mr ruskin probably mr ruskin had presented the book to his old friend in other way were it easy to procure writings which the author withdrew from publication if indeed they ever were properly speaking published thus dr brown was all things to all men and to all boys he had word every one poor people say and word to the point he was much at home with the shepherd on the hills or with the angler between hollylea and clovenfords with the dusty or the doggy young border yeoman or the child who asked him to draw her picture or the friend of genius famous through all the world thackeray when he spoke he seldom did of divine three volumes of essays are all that dr brown has left in the way of compositions light but imperishable literary baggage his studies are usually derived from personal experience which he reproduced with singular geniality and simplicity or they are drawn from the tradition of the elders the reminiscences of scotch people who themselves had listened attentively to those who went before them since scott these ancient ladies with wonderful memories have had such attentive listener or appreciative reporter dr brown his paper called mystiﬁcations narrative of the pranks of miss stirling graham is brief vivid record of the clever and quaint society of scotland sixty years ago scotland or at least scottish society is now only english little narrower little prouder sometimes even little duller but old people of position spoke the old scotch tongue sixty years ago and were full of wonderful genealogies full of reminiscences of the 45 and the adventures of the jacobites the very last echoes of that ancient world are dying now from memory like the wide reverberations of that gun which miss nelly macw illiam heard on the day when prince charles landed and which resounded strangely all through scotland the children of this generation one fears will hardly hear of these old raids and duels risings and rebellions by oral tradition handed down unbroken through aunts and grandmothers scott reaped full late harvest of the memories of clannish and feudal scotland dr brown came later gleaner and gathered these stirring tales of jacobite family which are published in the last volume of his essays when he was an observer not hearer only brown chieﬂy studied and best wrote of the following topics passages and characters of humour and pathos which he encountered in his life and profession children dogs border scenery and in life and science under one or other of these categories all his best compositions might be arranged the most famous and most exquisite of all his works in the ﬁrst class is the unrivalled rab and his friends study of the stoicism and tenderness of the lowland character worthy of scott in minor way the little paper on jeems the door in dissenting house of the lord is interesting to scotch people though it must seem rather curious revelation to all others her last is another study of the honesty that survived in starving and outcast scotch girl when all other virtues we commonly reckon virtue had gone before her character to some place where let us hope they may rejoin her if we are to suf fer the vices which have abandoned us may we not get some credit the virtues that we have abandoned but that once were ours in some heaven paved with bad resolutions unfulﬁlled the black dwarf s bones is sketch of the misshapen creature from whom scott borrowed the character that gives name to one of his minor border stories the real black dwarf david ritchie he was called among men was fond of poetry but hated burns he was polite to the fair but classed mankind at lar ge with his favourite aversions ghosts fairies and robbers there was this of human about the black dwarf that he hated folk that are aye gaun to dee and never the village beauties were wont to come to him judgment of paris on their charms and he presented each with ﬂower which was of ﬁxed value in his standard of things beautiful one kind of rose the prize of the most fair he only gave thrice paris could not have done his dooms more courteously and if he had but made judicious use of rose lily and lotus prizes he might have pleased all the three goddesses troy still might be standing and the lofty house of king adventures among books https dr brown s papers on children that called pet marjorie holds the highest place perhaps certain passages are wrote too sentimentally marjorie fleming herself remarked about the practice of many authors but it was difﬁcult to be perfectly composed when speaking of this wonderful little girl whose af fection was warm her humour and genius were precocious infant phenomena are seldom agreeable but marjorie was so humorous so so kind that we cease to regard her an intellectual her memory remains sweet and blossoming in its dust like that of little penelope boothby the child in the mob cap whom sir joshua painted and who died very soon after she was thus made immortal it is superﬂuous to quote from the essay on marjorie fleming every one knows about her and her studies isabella is teaching to make simme colings nots of interrigations peorids commoes here is shakespearian criticism of which few will deny the correctness macbeth is pretty composition but awful again i never read sermons of any kind but i read novelettes and my t om jones and gray s elegy in country churchyard are both excellent and much spoke of by both sex particularly by the her calvinistic belief in unquestionable ﬁre and brimston is unhesitating but the young theologian appears to have substituted unquestionable there is something humorous in the alteration if marjorie refused to be put of f with an excellent family substitute ﬁre and brimstone and demanded the unquestionable article other being genuine please observe trade mark among dr brown s contributions to the humorous study of dogs rab of course holds the same place marjorie among his sketches of children but if his queen mary s child garden the description of the little garden in which mary stuart did not play when child is second to marjorie so our dogs is good second to perhaps dr brown never wrote anything more mirthful than his description of the sudden birth of the virtue of courage in toby comic but cowardly mongrel cur of low degree toby was in the way of hiding his culinary bones in the small gardens before his own and the neighbouring doors mr scrymgeour two doors of f bulky choleric torvo vultu by law of contrast great cultivator of ﬂowers and he had often scowled toby into all but existence by stamp of his foot and glare of his eye one day his gate being open in walks toby with huge bone and making hole where scrymgeour had two minutes before been planting some precious slip the name of which on paper and on stick toby made very light of substituted his bone and was engaged covering it or thinking he was covering it up with his shovelling nose when spied him through the inner glass door and was out upon him like the assyrian with terriﬁc gowl i watched them instantly toby made at him with roar too and an eye more torve than scrymgeour s who retreating without reserve fell prostrate there is reason to believe in his own lobby toby contented himself with proclaiming his victory at the door and returning ﬁnished his at his leisure the enemy who had scuttled behind the glass door glared at him from this moment toby was an altered dog pluck at ﬁrst sight was lord of all that very evening he paid visit to leo next door s dog big tyrannical bully and coward to him toby paid visit that very evening down into his den and walked about much to say come on macduf f but macduf f did not come this story is one of the most amazing examples of instant change of character on record and disproves the sceptical remark that one was ever converted except and colonels in the army i am sorry to say that dr brown was too fond of dogs to be very much attached to cats i never heard him say anything against cats or indeed against anybody but there are passages in his writings which tend to show that when young and thoughtless he was not far from regarding cats the higher he tells story of ghazi puss so to speak victorious cat which entrenched in drain defeated three dogs with severe loss and ﬁnally escaped unharmed from her enemies adventures among books https brown s family gloried in the possession of dandy dinmont named john pym whose cousin auld pepper belonged to one of my brothers dr brown was much interested in pepper dog whose family pride was only matched by that of the mother of candide and at one time threatened to result in the extinction of this branch of the house of pepper brown had remarked and my own observations conﬁrm it that when dandy is not game his apparent lack of courage arises from kindness of among dr brown s landscapes one may call his descriptions of scenery and of the ancient historical associations with scotch scenery minchmoor is the most important he had always been great lover of the tweed the walk which he commemorates in minchmoor was taken if i am not mistaken in company with principal shairp professor of poetry in the university of oxford and author of one of the most beautiful of tweedside songs modern bush aboon traquair and what saw ye there at the bush aboon traquair or what did ye hear that was worth your heed i heard the cushie croon thro the gowden afternoon and the quair burn singing doon to the vale there is in the country of scott pleasanter walk than that which dr brown took in the summer afternoon within few miles many places famous in history and ballad may be visited the road by which montrose s men ﬂed from philiphaugh ﬁght traquair house with the bears on its gates on the portals of the baron of bradwardine williamhope where scott and mungo park the african explorer parted and went their several ways from the crest of the road you see all the border hills the maiden paps the eildons cloven in three the dunion the windbur g and so to the distant cheviots and smailholm tower where scott lay when child and clapped his hands at the ﬂashes of the lightning haud sine dis animosus infans like horace from the crest of the hill you follow dr brown into the valley of yarrow and the deep black pools now called the dowie dens and so through the pomp of cultivated nature wordsworth says to the railway at selkirk passing the plain where janet won back tamlane from the queen of the fairies all this country was familiar to dr brown and on one of the last occasions when i met him he was living at hollylea on the tweed just above ashestiel scott s home while he was happy and prosperous before he had the unhappy thought of building abbotsford at the time i speak of dr brown had long ceased to write and his health suf fered from attacks of melancholy in which the world seemed very dark to him i have been allowed to read some letters which he wrote in one of these intervals of depression with his habitual unselﬁshness he kept his melancholy to himself and though he did not care society at such times he said nothing of his own condition that could distress his correspondent in the last year of his life everything around him seemed to brighten he was unusually well he even returned to his literary work and saw his last volume of collected essays through the press they were most favourably received and the last letters which i had from him spoke of the pleasure which this success gave him three editions of his book john leech and other essays were published in some six weeks all seemed to go well and one might even have hoped that with renewed strength he would take up his pen again but his strength was less than we had hoped cold settled on his lungs and in spite of the most affectionate nursing he grew rapidly weaker he had little suf fering at the end and his mind remained unclouded man of letters could be more widely regretted he was the friend of all who read his books even to people who only met him once or twice in life he seemed to become dear and familiar in one of his very latest writings on thackeray s death dr brown told people what some of them needed and still need to be told how good kind and thoughtful others was our great greatest master of ﬁction i venture to think since scott some of the lines dr brown wrote of thackerary might be applied to himself he adventures among books https fresh with that abounding silvery hair and his young almost infantile face face very pale and yet radiant in his last years and mildly lit up with eyes full of kindness and softened by sorrow in his last year swinburne wrote to dr brown this sonnet in which there seems something of the poet s prophetic gift and voice sounds of welcome home beyond the north wind lay the land of old where men dwelt blithe and blameless clothed and fed with joy s bright raiment and with love s sweet bread the whitest ﬂock of earth s maternal fold none there might wear about his brows enrolled light of lovelier fame than rings your head whose lovesome love of children and the dead all men give thanks i far of f behold dear dead hand that links us and light the blithest and benignest of the night the night of death s sweet sleep wherein may be star to show your spirit in present sight some happier isle in the elysian sea where rab may lick the hand of chapter iv oliver wendell holmes never but once did i enjoy the privilege of meeting the author of elsie venner wendell holmes it was at dinner given by mr lowell and of conversation with dr holmes i had very little he struck being wonderfully erect active and vivacious his great age he spoke perhaps i should not chronicle this impression spoke much and freely but rather if he were wound up to speak so to up i mean by sense of duty to himself and kindness to strangers who were naturally curious about so man in his aspect there was certain dryness and altogether his vivacity his ceaselessness and kind of equability of tone in his voice reminded of what homer says concerning the old men around priam above the gate of troy how they chirped like cicalas on summer day about the matter of his talk i remember nothing only the manner remains with and mine may have been false impression or the manner may have been accidental and of the moment or again manner appropriate conversation with strangers each coming up one after the other to view respectfully so great lion among his friends and intimates he was probably dif ferent man with tone other and more reposeful he had long weary task before him then to talk his way ever courteous alert attentive through part of london season yet when it was all over he seems to have enjoyed it being man who took pleasure in most sorts of experience he did not af fect that one time with such sense of pleasure mr lowell lowell whom i knew so much better and who was so big strong humorous kind learned friendly and delightfully natural holmes too was delightful companion and i have merely tried to make sort of photographic at him in single casual moment one of myriads of such moments turning to dr holmes s popular distinct from his professional writings one is reminded one often is of the change which seems to come over some books the reader grows older many books are to one now what they always were some like the waverley novels and shakespeare grow better on every fresh reading there are books which ﬁlled in boyhood or in youth with sort of admiring rapture and delighted wonder at their novelty their strangeness freshness greatness thus homer and the best novels of thackeray and of fielding the plays of molière and adventures among books https poems of all the real poets moved this astonishment of admiration and being read again they move it still on dif ferent level one may say much about books so unlike each other those of poe and of sir thomas browne of swift and of charles lamb there are again other books which caused this happy emotion of wonder when ﬁrst perused long since but which so longer i am not much surprised to ﬁnd charles kingsley s novels among them in the case of dr holmes s books i am very sensible of this disenchanting ef fect of time and experience the professor at the breakfast table and the novels came into my hands when i was very young in green unknowing they seemed extraordinary new fantasies of wisdom and wit the reﬂections were such surprised by their depth the illustrations dazzled by their novelty and brilliance probably they will still be fortunate with young readers and i am to be pitied i hope rather than blamed if i can not like the wise recapture the ﬁrst ﬁne careless by this time of course one understands many of the constituents of dr holmes s genius the social historical ancestral and professional elements thereof now it is the business of criticism to search out and illustrate these antecedents and it seems very odd and unlucky thing that the results of this knowledge when acquired should sometimes be partial disenchantment but we are not disenchanted at all by this kind of science when the author whom we are examining is great natural genius like shakespeare or shelley keats or scott such natures bring to the world far more than they receive far our means of knowing what they receive are concerned the wind of the spirit that is not of this earth nor limited by time and space breathes through their words and thoughts and deeds they are not mere combinations however deft and subtle of known atoms they must continually delight and continually surprise custom can not stale them like the laws in sophocles age can never lull them to sleep their works when they are authors never lose hold on our fancy and our interest far my own feelings and admiration can inform dr holmes though most interesting and amiable and kindly man and writer was not of this class an essayist delineator of men and morals an unassuming philosopher with light friendly wit he certainly does not hold one example addison does the old spectator makes smile pleases tickles diverts now even more than when i lay on the grass and read it by tweedside boy when the trout were sluggish in the early afternoon it is only personal fact that dr holmes read in the same old seasons with so much pleasure and admiration and surprise longer af fects in the old way carlyle on the other hand in his frederick which used to seem rather long now entertains far more than ever but i am well aware that this is mere subjective estimate that dr holmes may really be great genius i was wont to think him criticism is only part of our impressions the opinion of mature experience rule ought to be sounder than that of youth in this case i can not but think that it is sounder holmes was new englander and born in what he calls the brahmin caste the class which in england before the sailing of the may flower and ever since had always been literary and highly educated i like books i was born and bred among them he says and have the easy feeling when i get into their presence that has among he is fond of books and above all of old old medical works of portents and prodigies such those of wierus new england owing to its famous college harvard and its steady maintenance of the literary and learned tradition among the cler gy was naturally the home of the earliest great american school of writers these lowell ticknor prescott hawthorne and so many all received the same sort of education europeans of letters used to receive they had not started printers devils adventures among books https reporters or playwrights the stage but were academic it does not matter much how genius rural butcher or an apothecary or clerk of writer to the signet still the new englanders were academic and classical new england has by this time established tradition of its literary origin and character her children are sons of the puritans with their independence their narrowness their appreciation of comfort their hardiness in doing without it their singular scruples of conscience their sense of the awfulness of sin their accessibility to superstition we can read of the later new englanders in the making among the works of cotton mather his father increase mather and the doctrinal judge sewall who so manfully confessed and atoned his mistake about the salem witches these men or many of them were calvinists according to the standard of their day day lasting from say the restoration to cotton mather in particular is erudite full of literary visionary credulous to an amusing degree but he is really british baxter or his scottish correspondent and counterpart wodrow the sons or grandsons of these men gained the war of independence of this they are naturally proud and the circumstance is not infrequently mentioned in dr holmes s works their democracy is not roaring modern democracy but that of the cultivated middle classes their stern calvinism slackened into many isms but left kind of religiosity behind it one of dr holmes s mouthpieces sums up his whole creed in the two words pater noster all these hereditary inﬂuences are consciously made conspicuous in dr holmes s writings in hawthorne in hawthorne you see the old horror of sin the old terror of conscience the old dread of witchcraft the old concern about conduct converted into æsthetic sources of literary pleasure of literary ef fects physician and man of science dr holmes added abundant knowledge of the new sort and apt unexpected bits of science made popular analogies and illustrations afforded by science are frequent in his works thus in elsie venner and in the guardian angel heredity is his theme he is always brooding over the thought that each of us is so much made up of earlier people our ancestors who bequeath to us so many disagreeable madness disease emotions tricks of gesture doubt these things are bequeathed but all in such new proportions and relations that each of us is himself and nobody else and therefore had better make up his mind to be himself and himself responsible all this doctrine of heredity still so dimly understood dr holmes derives from science but in passing through his mind that of new englander conscious of new england s past science takes stain of romance and superstition elsie venner through an experience of her mother s inherits the nature of the serpent so the novel is far from common life the tale of mélusine or any other echidna the fantasy has its setting in commonplace new england environment and thus recalls hawthorne less subtle and concentrated but much more humorous the heroine of the guardian angel again exposes character in layers it were each stratum of consciousness being inherited from dif ferent others red indian she has many personalities like the queer women we read about in french treatises on hysterics and nervous diseases these stories are fairy tales of science by man of science who is also humourist and has touch of the poet and of the old fathers who were afraid of witches the blend is singular enough and not without its originality of fascination though man of science dr holmes apparently took an imaginative pleasure in all shapes of superstition that he could muster i must quote passage from the professor at the breakfast table peculiarly illustrative of his method and his ways of half accepting the abnormally just enough pleasure like sir walter scott connected with the extract is curious anecdote i think i am little superstitious there were two things when i was boy that diabolised my imagination mean that gave distinct apprehension of formidable bodily shape which prowled round the neighbourhood where i was born and bred the ﬁrst was series of marks called the devil s these were adventures among books https sand in the pastures where grass grew where even the blackberry the dewberry our southern neighbours call it in prettier and more shakespearian language did not spread its clinging creepers where even the pale dry everlasting could not grow but all was bare and blasted the second was mark in one of the public buildings near my home college dormitory named after colonial governor i not think many persons are aware of the existence of this mark having been said about the story in print it was considered very desirable the sake of the institution to hush it up in the corner and on the level of the third or fourth storey there are signs of breach in the walls mended pretty well but not to be mistaken considerable portion of that corner must have been carried away from within outward it was an unpleasant af fair and i not care to repeat the particulars but some young men had been using sacred things in profane and unlawful way when the occurrence which was variously explained took place the story of the appearance in the chamber was i suppose invented afterwards but of the injury to the building there could be question and the zigzag line where the mortar is little thicker than before is still distinctly visible the queer burnt spots called the devil s footsteps had never attracted attention before this time though there is evidence that they had not existed previously except that of the late miss goody so called who was positive on the subject but had strange horror of referring to an af fair of which she was thought to know something i tell you it was not so pleasant little boy of impressible nature to go up to bed in an old house with untenanted locked upper chambers and most ghostly garret devil s footsteps in the ﬁelds behind the house and in front of it the patched dormitory where the unexplained occurrence had taken place which startled those godless youths at their mock devotions so that one of them was epileptic from that day forward and another after dreadful season of mental conﬂict took to religion and became renowned his ascetic sanctity it is pity that dr holmes does not give the whole story instead of hinting at it similar tale is told at brazenose college and elsewhere now take along with dr holmes s confession to grain of superstition this remark on and explanation of the curious coincidences which thrust themselves on the notice of most people excuse return to my story of the commonstable young fellows being always hungry and tea and dry toast being the meagre fare of the evening meal it was trick of some of the boys to impale slice of meat upon fork at dinner and stick the fork holding it beneath the table so that they could get it at the dragons that guarded this table of the hesperides found out the trick at last and kept sharp missing forks knew where to ﬁnd one if it was not in its place now the odd thing was that after waiting so many years to hear of this college trick i should hear it mentioned second time within the same hours by college youth of the present generation strange but true and so it has happened to and to every person often and often to be hit in rapid succession by these twinned facts or thoughts if they were linked like i was going to leave the simple reader to wonder over this taking it an unexplained marvel i think however i will turn over furrow of subsoil in it the explanation is of course that in great many thoughts there must be few coincidences and these instantly arrest our attention now we shall probably never have the least idea of the enormous number of impressions which pass through our consciousness until in some future life we see the photographic record of our thoughts and the stereoscopic picture of our actions now my dear friends who are putting your hands to your foreheads and saying to yourselves that you feel little confused if you had been waltzing until things began to whirl slightly round you is it possible that you not clearly apprehend the exact connection of all i have been saying and its bearing on what is now to come listen then the number of these living elements in our bodies illustrates the adventures among books https of our thoughts the number of our thoughts accounts those frequent coincidences spoken of these coincidences in the world of thought illustrate those which we constantly observe in the world of outward now the of mark twain some years ago mark twain published in harper s magazine an article on mental telegraphy he illustrated his meaning by story of how he once wrote long letter on complicated subject which had popped into his head between asleep and awake to friend on the other side of america he did not send the letter but by return of post received one from his friend now i ll tell you what he is going to say said mark twain read his own unsent epistle aloud and then opening his friend s despatch proved that they were essentially identical this is what he calls mental telegraphy others call it t elepathy and the term is merely descriptive now on his own showing in our second extract dr holmes should have explained coincidences like this purely the work of chance and i rather incline to think that he would have been right but mark twain in his article on mental telegraphy cites dr holmes story of how he once after dinner his letters came in felt constrained to tell propos des bottes the story of the last challenge to judicial combat in england 1817 he then opened newspaper directed to him from england the sporting t imes and therein his eyes lighted on an account of this very af thornton s challenge to battle when he was accused of murder in according to mark twain holmes was disposed to accept mental telegraphy rather than mere chance the cause of this coincidence yet the anecdote of the challenge seems to have been favourite of his it occurs in the professor in the ﬁfth section perhaps he told it pretty frequently probably that is why the printed version was sent to him still he was little staggered by the coincidence there was enough of cotton mather in the man of science to give him pause the form of dr holmes s best known books the set concerned with the and over the teacups is not very fortunate much conversation at breakfast is weariness of the ﬂesh we want to eat what is necessary and then to go about our work or play if american citizens in could endure these long palavers they must have been very unlike the hasty feeders caricatured in martin macaulay may have monologuised thus at his breakfast parties in the albany but breakfast parties are unregrettable parcel of things lost the monologues or dialogues were published serially in the atlantic monthly but they have had vitality and vogue far beyond those of the magazine causerie some of their popularity they may owe to the description of the other boarders and to the kind of novel which connects the fortunes of these personages but it is impossible an englishman to know whether these american types are exactly drawn or not their fortunes not strongly interest one though the sculpin patriotic deformed bostonian with his grandmother s ring she was hanged witch very original and singular creation the real interest lies in the wit wisdom and learning the wit now and then seems rather in the nature of one might give examples but to so seems and ungrateful there are some very perishable puns the learning is not so recher ché it appeared when we knew nothing of cotton mather and robert calef the author of book against the persecution of witches calef of course was in the right but i can not give him refusing to see lady known to mr mather who ﬂoated about in the air that she did so was good reason hanging or burning number of parishioners but did she ﬂoat and if so how mr calef said it would be miracle so he declined to view the performance his logic was thin though of familiar description of all old things at all events dr holmes was fond he found america scarcely aired new and raw devoid of history and of associations the tiber has voice it whispers to the piers of the pons ælius even more full of meaning than my charles adventures among books https the piles of west boston doubt this is common sentiment among americans occasionally like hawthorne they sigh an historical atmosphere and then when they come to europe and get it they not like it and think schenectady new york better it is not easy to understand what ailed hawthorne with europe he was extremely caustic in his writings about that continent and discontented our matrons were so stout and placid that they irritated him indeed they are little heavy in hand still there are examples of agreeable slimness even in this poor old country fond he was of the historical past mr holmes remained loyal to the historical present he was not one of those americans who are always censuring england and always hankering after her he had none of that irritable feeling which made great contemporary of his angrily declare that he could endure to hear y mariners of england sung because of his own country s successes some time ago they were gallant and conspicuous victories of the american frigates we not grudge them fair ﬁght should leave rancour above all in the victors and dr holmes s withers would have been unwrung by campbell s ditty he visited england in youth and ﬁfty years later on the anniversary of the american defeat at bunker s hill june 17 dr holmes got his degree in the old cambridge he received degrees at edinbur gh and at oxford in his hundred days in europe he says very little about these historic cities the men at oxford asked did he come in the one hoss shay the name of his most familiar poem in the lighter vein the whole visit to england pleased and wearied him he likened it to the shass caffy of mr henry the ﬁllip at the end of the long banquet of life he went to see the derby he was fond of horses of racing and in sportsmanlike way of boxing he had the great boldness once audax juventa to write song in praise of that comfortable the prudery of many americans about the juice of the grape is thing very astonishing to temperate briton an admirable author who wrote an account of the old convivial days of an american city found that reputable magazines could not accept such degrading historical record there was nonsense about dr holmes his poems were mainly occasional verses friendly meetings or humorous like the celebrated one horse shay of his serious verses the nautilus is probably too familiar to need quotation noble fancy is nobly and tunefully pleasing cultivated and so forth are adjectives not dear to poets to say sublime or magical or strenuous of dr holmes s muse would be to exaggerate how far he maintained his scholarship i am not certain but it is odd that in his preface to the guardian angel he should quote from jonathan edwards the younger story which he might have cited aristotle were i to choose one character out of dr holmes s creations my favourite it would be frequent correspondent of his and of immortal gifted hopkins never was minor poet more kindly and genially portrayed and if one had to pick out three of his books the best worth reading they would be the professor elsie venner and the guardian they have not the impeccable art and distinction of the house of the seven gables and the scarlet letter but they combine fantasy with living human interest and with humour with sir thomas browne and dr john brown may we not add dr weir mitchell holmes excellently represents the physician in humane letters he has left blameless and most amiable memory unspotted by the world his works are full of the savour of his native soil naturally without straining after americanism and they are national not local or provincial he crossed the great gulf of years between the central age of american literary time of hawthorne and our own time and like nestor he reigned among the third generation far the world knows the shadow of literary quarrel never fell on him he was without envy or jealousy incurious of his own place never vain petulant or severe he was even too and the worst thing i have heard of him is that he could never say to an autograph hunter adventures among books https v morris s poems enough said the pupil of the wise imlac you have convinced that man can be the study of mr william morris s poems in the new collected edition 5 has convinced that man or at least man can be critic i read mr morris s poems thanks to the knightly honours conferred on the bard of penrhyn there is now ambiguity to mr morris but it is not the book only that i read the scroll of my youth is unfolded i see the dear place where ﬁrst i perused the blue closet the old faces of old friends ﬂock around old chaf f old laughter old happiness and revive andrews oxford come before the mind s eye with many place that s in sad case where joy was wont afore oh minstrel burne sings these voices faces landscapes mingle with the music and blur the pictures of the poet who enchanted us certain hours passed in the paradise of youth reviewer who ﬁnds himself in this case may well frankly confess that he can more criticise mr morris dispassionately than he could criticise his old self and the friends whom he shall never see again till he meets them beyond the sphere of time and sin and grief s control serene in changeless prime of body and of to write of one s own adventures among books may be to provide anecdotage more or less trivial more or less futile but at least it is to write historically we know how books have af fected and af fect ourselves our bundle of prejudices and tastes of old impressions and revived sensations to judge books dispassionately and impersonally is much more it is practically impossible our own tastes and experiences must more or less modify our verdicts what we will however the effort must be made to say that at certain age in certain circumstances an individual took much pleasure in the life and death of jason the present of college friend is certainly not to criticise the life and death of there have been three blossoming times in the english poetry of the nineteenth century the ﬁrst dates from wordsworth coleridge scott and later from shelley byron keats by 1822 the blossoming time was over and the second blossoming time began in with young mr tennyson and mr browning it broke forth again in 1842 and did not practically cease till england s greatest laureate sang of the crossing of the but while tennyson put out his full strength in 1842 and mr browning rather later in bells and pomegranates men and women the third spring came in 1858 with mr morris s defence of guenevere and ﬂowered till mr swinburne s atalanta in calydon appeared in 1865 followed by his poems of mr rossetti s book of 1870 belonged in date of composition mainly to this period in 1858 when the defence of guenevere came out mr morris must have been but year or two from his under graduateship every one has heard enough about his companions mr burne jones mr rossetti canon dixon and the others of the old oxfor d and cambridge magazine where mr morris s wonderful prose fantasies are buried why should they not be revived these strangely coloured and magical dreams literature i prefer them vastly above mr morris s later romances in the hollow land above news from nowhere mr morris and his friends were active in the fresh dawn of new romanticism mediæval and catholic revival with very little catholicism in it the most part this revival is more innerly the scotch say more intimate more earnest than the lar ger and more genial if more adventures among books https by scott the painful doubt the scepticism of the ages of faith the dark hours of that epoch its fantasy cruelty luxury less than its colour and passion inform morris s ﬁrst poems the fourteenth and the early ﬁfteenth century is his in the defence of guenevere he is not under the inﬂuence of chaucer whose narrative manner without one grain of his humour inspires the life and death of jason and the earthly in the early book the rugged style of mr browning has left mark there are cockney rhymes too such short rhyming to but on the whole mr morris s early manner was all his own nor has he ever returned to it in the ﬁrst poem the queen s apology is this passage listen suppose your time were come to die and you were quite alone and very weak yea laid while very mightily the wind was rufﬂing up the narrow streak of river through your broad lands running well suppose hush should come then some one speak one of these cloths is heaven and one is hell now choose one cloth ever which they be i will not tell you you must somehow tell of your own strength and mightiness here see yea yea my lord and you to ope your eyes at foot of your familiar bed to see great god s angel standing with such dyes not known on earth on his great wings and hands held out two ways light from the inner skies showing him well and making his commands seem to be god s commands moreover too holding within his hands the cloths on wands and one of these strange was blue wavy and long and one cut short and red man could tell the better of the two after shivering you said god help heaven s colour the blue and he said perhaps you then would roll upon your bed and cry to all good men that loved you well ah christ if only i had known known there was nothing like that before in english poetry it has the bizarr erie of new thing in beauty how far it is really beautiful how can i tell how can i discount the personal bias only i know that it is unfor gettable again galahad speaks i saw one sitting on the altar throne whose face man could say he did not know and though the bell still rang he sat alone with raiment half half white snow such things made their own special inef faceable impact leaving the arthurian cycle mr morris entered on his especially sympathetic the gloom and sad sunset glory of the late fourteenth century the age of froissart and wicked wasteful wars to froissart it all seemed one magniﬁcent pageant of knightly and kingly fortunes he only murmurs great pity the death of knight or adventures among books https of town it is rather the pity of it that mr morris sees the hearts broken in corner in sir peter harpedon s end or beside the haystack in the here is picture like life of what befell hundred times lady alice la barde hears of the death of her knight alice can you talk faster sir get over all this quicker ﬁx your eyes on mine i pray you and whate er you see still go on talking fast unless i fall or bid you stop squire i pray your pardon then and looking in your eyes fair lady say i am unhappy that your knight is dead take heart and listen let tell you all we were ﬁve thousand goodly and scant ﬁve hundred had he in that hold his rotten sandstone walls were wet with rain and fell in lumps wherever stone hit yet three days about the barriers there the deadly glaives were gather d laid across and push d and pull d the fourth our engines came but still amid the crash of falling walls and roar of bombards rattle of hard bolts the steady ﬂash d and still stream d out geor ge s banner and the seven swords and still they cried st geor ge guienne until their walls were ﬂat jericho s of old and our rush came and cut them from the the astonishing vividness again of the tragedy told in gef fray teste noire is like that of vision in magic mirror or crystal ball rather than like picture suggested by printed words shameful death has the same enchanted kind of presentment we look through magic casement opening on the foam of the old waves of war poems of pure fantasy unequalled out of coleridge and poe are the wind and the blue each only lives in fantasy motives and facts and story are unimportant and out of view the pictures arise distinct unsummoned spontaneous like the faces and places which are ﬂashed on our eyes between sleeping and waking fantastic too but with more of recognisable human setting is golden wings which to slight degree reminds one of théophile gautier s château souvenir the apples now grow green and sour upon the mouldering castle wall before they ripen there they fall there are banners on the tower the draggled swans most eagerly eat the green weeds trailing in the moat inside the rotting leaky boat you see slain man s stif fen d these with the sailing of the sword are my own old favourites there was nothing like them before nor will be again mr morris after several years of silence abandoned his early manner doubt it was not manner to persevere in but happily in mood and moment never to be or return mr morris did ﬁll fresh page in english poetry with these imperishable fantasies they were absolutely neglected by adventures among books https public but they found few staunch friends indeed i think of guenevere fitzgerald did of tennyson s poems before but this of course is purely personal probably purely capricious estimate criticism may aver that the inﬂuence of rossetti was strong on mr morris before perhaps so but we read mr morris ﬁrst the world read the lay before christabel and my own preference is mr morris it was after eight or nine years of silence that mr morris produced in 1866 or 1867 the life and death of young men who had read guenevere hastened to purchase it and of course found themselves in contact with something very unlike their old favourite mr morris had told classical tale in decasyllabic couplets of the chaucerian sort and he regarded the heroic age from mediæval point of view at all events not from an historical and archæological point of view it was natural in mr morris to envisage the greek heroic age in this way but it would not be natural in most other writers the poem is not much shorter than the odyssey and long narrative poems had been out of fashion since the lord of the isles 1814 all this was little disconcerting we read jason and read it with pleasure but without much of the more essential pleasure which comes from magic and distinction of style the peculiar qualities of keats and tennyson and virgil are not among the gifts of mr morris people say of scott in his long poems so it may be said of mr morris he does not furnish many quotations does not glitter in jewels ﬁve words in jason he entered on his long career narrator poet retelling the immortal primeval stories of the human race in one guise or another the legend of jason is the most widely distributed of romances the north american indians have it and the samoans and the samoyeds well all peoples this tale told brieﬂy by pindar and at greater length by apollonius rhodius and in the orphica mr morris took up and handled in single and objective way his art was always pictorial but in jason and later he described more and was less apt it were to ﬂash picture on the reader in some incommunicable way in the covers of the ﬁrst edition were announcements of the earthly paradise that vast collection of the world s old tales retold one might almost conjecture that jason had originally been intended part of the earthly paradise and had outgrown its limits the tone is much the same though the criticism of life is less formally and explicitly stated mr morris came at last to criticism of it would not have satisﬁed mr matthew arnold and it did not satisfy mr morris the burden of these long narrative poems is vanitas vanitatum the ﬂeeting perishable unsatisfying nature of human existence the dream rounded by the lesson drawn is to make life full and beautiful may be by love and adventure and art the hideousness of modern industrialism was oppressing to mr morris that hideousness he was doing his best to relieve and redeem by poetry and by all the many arts and crafts in which he was master his narrative poems are indeed part of his industry in this ﬁeld he was not born to slay monsters he says the idle singer of an empty day later he set about slaying monsters like jason or unlike jason scattering dragon s teeth to raise forces which he could not lay and could not direct i shall go further into politics or agitation and i say this much only to prove that mr morris s criticism of life and prolonged wistful dwelling on the thought of death ceased to satisfy himself his own later part poet and an ally of socialism proved this to be true it seems to follow that the peculiarly level lifeless decorative ef fect of his narratives which remind us rather of glorious tapestries than of pictures was longer wholly satisfactory to himself there is plenty of charmed and delightful reading jason and the earthly paradise are literature the castle of indolence but we miss strenuous rendering of action and passion these mr morris had rendered in the defence of guinevere now he gave us something dif ferent something beautiful but something deﬁcient in dramatic vigour apollonius rhodius is doubt much of adventures among books https literary writer of epic in an age of criticism he dealt with the tale of jason and conceivably he may have borrowed from older minstrels but the medea of apollonius rhodius in her love her tenderness her regret home in all her maiden words and ways is undeniably character more living more human more passionate and more sympathetic than the medea of mr morris i could almost wish that he had closely followed that classical original the ﬁrst true love story in literature in the same way i prefer apollonius s spell soothing the dragon much terser and more somniferous than the spell put by mr morris into the lips of medea scholars will ﬁnd it pleasant to compare these passages of the alexandrine and of the london poets brick out of the vast palace of jason we may select the song of the nereid to morris is always happy with his nymphs and nereids i know little set thick with lily and with rose where i would wander if i might from dewy dawn to dewy night and have one with wandering and though within it birds sing and though pillared house is there and though the apple boughs are bare of fruit and blossom would to god her feet upon the green grass trod and i beheld them before there comes murmur from the shore and in the place two fair streams are drawn from the purple hills afar drawn down unto the restless sea the hills whose ﬂowers ne er fed the bee the shore ship has ever seen still beaten by the billows green whose murmur comes unceasingly unto the place which i cry which i cry both day and night which i let slip all delight that maketh both deaf and blind careless to win unskilled to ﬁnd and quick to lose what all men seek yet tottering i am and weak still have i left little breath to seek within the jaws of death an entrance to that happy place to seek the unfor gotten face once seen once kissed once rest from anigh the murmuring of the jason is practically very long tale from the earthly paradise the earthly paradise is an immense treasure of shorter tales in the manner of mr morris reverted an hour to his fourteenth century period when london was this is poetic license many plague found mediæval london abominably dirty celt himself doubt with the celt s proverbial way of being impossibilium cupitor morris was in full sympathy with his breton squire who in the reign of edward sets forth to seek the earthly paradise and the land where death never comes much more dramatic i venture to think than any passage of jason is that where the dreamy seekers of dreamland breton and northman encounter the stout king edward whose kingdom is of this world action and fantasy are met and the wanderers explain the nature of their quest one of them speaks of death in many form and of the ﬂight from death adventures among books https his words nigh made weep but while he spoke i noted how mocking smile just broke the thin line of the prince s lips and he who carried the armoury puffed out his cheeks and whistled low but the king smiled and said can it be so i know not and ye twain are such ﬁnd the things whereto old kings must needs be blind you the world is not who once had dreams of one great victory wherein that world lay vanquished by my throne and now the victor in so many an one find that in asia alexander died and will not live again the world is wide you i say narrow space betwixt the four walls of ﬁghting place poor man why should i stay thee live thy ﬁll of that fair life wherein thou seest ill but fear of that fair rest i hope to win one day when i have pur ged of my sin farewell it yet may hap that i king shall be remembered but by this one thing that on the morn before ye crossed the sea ye gave and took in common talk with but with this ring keep memory with the morn breton and thou northman by this horn remember who am of odin s all this encounter is passage of high invention the adventures in anahuac are such bishop erie may have achieved when he set out to ﬁnd vinland the good and came back more whether he was or was not remembered by the aztecs quetzalcoatl the tale of the wanderers was mr morris s own all the rest are of the dateless heritage of our race fairy tales coming to us now softly breathed through the ﬂutes of the grecians now told by sagamen of iceland the whole performance is astonishingly equable we move on high tableland where tall peaks of parnassus are to be climbed once more literature has narrator on the whole much more akin to spenser than to chaucer homer or sir walter humour and action are not so prominent contemplation of pageant reﬂected in fairy mirror but mr morris has said himself about his poem what i am trying to say death have we hated knowing not what it meant life have we loved through green leaf and through sere though still the less we knew of its intent the earth and heaven through countless year on year slow changing were to us but curtains fair hung round about little room where play weeping and laughter of man s empty day morris had shown in various ways the strength of his sympathy with the heroic sagas of iceland he had rendered one into verse in the earthly paradise above all grettir the strong and the volsunga he had done into english prose his next great poem was the story of sigurd poetic rendering of the theme which is to the north what the tale of troy is to greece and to all the world mr morris took the form of the story which is most archaic and bears most birthmarks of its savage version of the v olsunga not the german shape of the he showed extraordinary skill especially in making human and intelligible the story of regin otter fafnir and the dwarf andvari s adventures among books https it was reidmar the ancient begat and now was he waxen old and covetous man and king and he bade and i built him hall and golden glorious house and thereto his sons did he call and he bade them be evil and wise that his will through them might be wrought then he gave unto fafnir my brother the soul that feareth nought and the brow of the hardened iron and the hand that may never fail and the greedy heart of king and the ear that hears wail but next unto otter my brother he gave the snare and the net and the longing to wend through the and wade the highways wet and the foot that never resteth while aught be left alive that hath cunning to match man s cunning or might with his might to strive and to the least and the youngest what gift the slaying of ease save the grief that remembers the past and the fear that the future sees and the hammer and and the living coal of ﬁre and the craft that createth semblance and fails of the heart s desire and the toil that each dawning quickens and the task that is never done and the heart that longeth ever nor will look to the deed that is won thus gave my father the gifts that might never be taken again far worse were we now than the gods and but little better than men but yet of our ancient might one thing had we left us still we had craft to change our semblance and could shift us at our will into bodies of the or fowl or ﬁshes cold belike ﬁxèd semblance we had in the days of old till the gods were waxen busy and all things their form must take that knew of good and evil and longed to gather and but when we turn to the passage of the éclair cissement between sigurd and brynhild that most dramatic and most modern moment in the ancient tragedy the moment where the clouds of savage fancy scatter in the light of hopeless human love then i must confess i prefer the simple brief prose of mr morris s translation of the v olsunga to his rather periphrastic paraphrase every student of poetry may make the comparison himself and decide himself whether the old or the new is better again in the ﬁnal ﬁght and massacre in the hall of atli i can not but prefer the slaying of the wooers at the close of the odyssey or the last ﬁght of roland at roncesvaux or the prose version of the v all these are the work of men who were war well smiths here is passage from the murder grim and great so he saith in the midst of the foemen with his war reared on high but all about and around him goes up bitter cry from the iron men of atli and the bickering of the steel sends roar up to the and the niblung war reel behind the steadfast gunnar but lo have ye seen the corn while yet men grind the sickle by the wind streak overborne when the sudden rain sweeps downward and summer groweth black and the smitten roareth neath the driving thunder so before the hogni shrank the champions of the east his great voice shook the timbers in the hall of atli s feast there he smote and beheld not the smitten and by nought were his edges stopped he smote and the dead were thrust from him hand with its shield he lopped there met him atli s marshal and his arm at the shoulder he shred three swords were upreared against him of the best of the kin of the dead and he struck of f head to the rightward and his sword through throat adventures among books https but the third stroke fell on his and he stooped to the ruddy dust and uprose the ancient giant and both his hands were wet red then was the world to his eyen his hand to the labour he set swords shook and fell in his pathway huge bodies leapt and fell harsh grided shield and war like the bell and the war ran together and man his brother knew and the dead men loaded the living he went the war through and man gainst man was huddled till sword rose to smite and clear stood the glorious hogni in an island of the ﬁght and there ran river of death twixt the niblung and his foes and therefrom the terror of men and the wrath of the gods i admit that this does not af fect does the ﬁgure of odysseus raining his darts of doom or the courtesy of roland when the blinded oliver smites him by mischance and indeed the keeping of the stair by umslopogaas appeals to more vigorously strenuous picture of war to be just to mr morris let us give his rendering of part of the slaying of the wooers from his translation of the odyssey and en the word he uttered he drew his keen sword out brazen on each side shearing and with fearful shout rushed on him but odysseus that very while let ﬂy and smote him with the arrow in the breast the pap hard by and drove the swift shaft to the liver and adown to the ground fell the sword from out of his hand and doubled he hung above the board and staggered and whirling he fell and the meat was scattered around and the double cup moreover and his forehead smote the ground and his heart was wrung with torment and with both feet spurning he smote the and over his eyen did the cloud of darkness ﬂoat and then it was amphinomus who drew his whetted sword and fell on making his onrush gainst odysseus the glorious lord if perchance he might get him but telemachus him forewent and cast of the brazen war from behind him therewith sent amidmost of his shoulders that drave through his breast and out and clattering he fell and the earth all the breadth of his forehead there is need to say more of mr morris s close to the letter of the greek he usually keeps but where are the sur ge and thunder of homer apparently we must accent the penultimate in amphinomus if the line is to scan i select passage of peaceful beauty from book but all about that cavern there grew blossoming wood of alder and of poplar and of cypress savouring good and fowl therein were wont to roost and be owls were there and falcons and crows of the sea and deeds of the sea they deal with and thereof they have care but round the hollow cavern there spread and ﬂourished fair vine of garden breeding and in its grapes was glad and four

he the tears he was pouring downward yet gazed er the untilled this is close enough to the greek but and ﬂowing on in or der four ways they thence did get is not precisely musical why is hermes the flitter but i have often ventured to remonstrate against these archaistic peculiarities which to some extent mar our pleasure in mr morris s translations in his version of the rich virgilian measure they are especially out of place the æneid is rendered with roughness which might better beﬁt translation of ennius thus the reader of mr morris s poetical translations has in his hands versions of almost literal closeness and what is extremely rare versions of poetry by poet but his acquaintance with early english and icelandic has added to the poet strain of the philologist and his english in the odyssey still more in the æneid is occasionally more archaic than the greek of 900 so at least it seems to reader not unversed in attempts to ﬁt the classical poets with an english rendering but the true test is in the appreciation of the lovers of poetry in general to them to all who desire the restoration of beauty in modern life mr morris has been benefactor almost without example indeed were adequate knowledge mine mr morris s poetry should have been criticised only part of the vast industry of his life in many crafts and many arts his place in english life and literature is unique

descriptions of scenery the more romantic the better and usually drawn entirely from her inner consciousness her heroines write sonnets which never but once are sonnets and other lyrics on every occasion with his usual generosity scott praised her landscape and her lyrics but indeed they are sir walter said of hemans too poetical and probably they were skipped even by her contemporary devotees the castles of athlin and dunbayne frankly not permit themselves to be read and it was not till 1790 with sicilian romance that radclif fe found herself and her public after reading with breathless haste through sicilian romance and the romance of the forest in single day it would ill become to speak lightly of radclif fe like catherine morland i love this lady s tender yet terriﬁc fancy radclif fe does not always keep on her highest level but we must remember that her last romance the italian is by far her best she had been feeling her way to this pitch of excellence and when she had attained to it she published more the reason is uncertain she became woman s rights woman and wrote the female advocate not novel scott thinks that she may have been annoyed by her imitators or by her critics against whom he defends her in an admirable passage to be cited later meanwhile let us follow radclif fe in her upward course the sicilian romance appeared in 1790 when the author s age was the book has treble attraction it contains the germ of northanger abbey and the germ of jane eyre germ of byron like joseph andrews northanger abbey began parody of radclif fe and developed into real novel of character so too byron s gloomy scowling adventurers with their darkling past are mere repetitions in rhyme of radclif fe s schedoni this is so obvious that when discussing radclif fe s schedoni scott adds in note parallel passages from byron s giaour sir walter did not mean to mock he merely compared two kindred spirits the noble poet kept on the business still and broke into octosyllabics borrowed from scott his descriptions of miscreants borrowed from radclif fe sicilian romance has its scene in the palace of ferdinand ﬁfth marquis of mazzini on the northern coast of sicily the time is about 1580 but there is nothing in the manners or costume to indicate that or any other period such local colour was unknown to radclif fe to clara reeve in horace walpole however character goes so far in the mediæval way to say by my the marquis mazzini had one son and two daughters by his ﬁrst amiable consort supposed to be long dead when the story opens the son is the original of henry tilney in northanger abbey and in general tilney does catherine morland recognise modern marquis of mazzini but the marquis s wife to be sure is not dead like the ﬁrst rochester she is concealed about the back premises and in jane eyre it is her movements and those of her gaolers that produce mystery and make the reader suppose that the place is it is of course only the mystery and the machinery of radclif fe that miss brontë adapted these passages in jane eyre have been censured but it is not easy to see how the novel could without them radclif fe s tale entirely depends on its machinery her wicked marquis having secretly immured number one has now new and beautiful number two whose character does not bear inspection this domestic position number two we know was declined by the austere virtue of jane eyre phenomena begin in the ﬁrst chapter of sicilian romance mysterious lights wander about uninhabited parts of the castle and are vainly investigated by adventures among books https son of the marquis this hippolytus the chaste loved all in vain by the reigning marchioness is adored by and adores her stepdaughter julia jealousy and revenge are clearly indicated but in chasing mysterious lights and ﬁgures through mouldering towers ferdinand gets into the very undesirable position of david balfour when he climbs in the dark the broken turret stair in his uncle s house of shaws in kidnapped here is fourth author indebted to radclif fe her disciples are miss austen byron miss brontë and mr louis stevenson ferdinand began the ascent he had not proceeded very far when the stones of step which his foot had just quitted gave way and dragging with them those adjoining formed chasm in the staircase that terriﬁed even ferdinand who was left tottering on the suspended half of the steps in momentary expectation of falling to the bottom with the stone on which he rested in the terror which this occasioned he attempted to save himself by catching at kind of beam which suspended over the stairs when the lamp dropped from his hand and he was left in total can anything be more amazing horrid above all there are mysterious ﬁgures in and about the tower radclif fe s lamps always fall or are blown out in the nick of time an expedient already used by clara reeve in that very mild but once popular ghost story the old english baron 1777 all authors have such favourite devices and i wonder how many ﬁghts mr stanley weyman s heroes have fought from the cellar to their favourite tilting ground the roof of strange house ferdinand hung on to the beam an hour when the ladies came with light and he scrambled back to solid earth in his next nocturnal research sullen groan arose from beneath where he stood and when he tried to force door there are scores of such weird doors in radclif fe groan was repeated more hollow and dreadful than the ﬁrst his courage forsook him wonder of course he could not know that the author of the groans was in fact his mother immured by his father the wicked marquis we need not follow the narrative through the darkling crimes and crumbling galleries of this terrible castle on the north coast of sicily everybody is always gazing in silent terror and all the locks are rusty savage and dexterous banditti play prominent part and the imprisoned ferdinand did not hesitate to believe that the moans he heard came from the restless spirit of the murdered della working hypothesis could seem more plausible but it was erroneous radclif fe does not deal in single avowed ghost she ﬁnally explains away by normal causes everything that she does not get to explain at the most she indulges herself in premonitory dream on this point she is true to common sense without quite adopting the philosophy of david hume i not say that spirits have appeared she remarks but if several discreet unprejudiced persons were to assure that they had seen should not be bold or proud enough to reply it is impossible but hume was bold and proud enough he went further than radclif fe scott censures radclif fe s employment of explanations he is in favour of boldly avowing the use of supernatural machinery or of leaving the matter in the vague in the appearance of the wraith of the dying alice to ravenswood but in radclif fe s day common sense was so tyrannical that the poor lady s romances would have been excluded from families if she had not provided normal explanations of her groans moans voices lights and wandering ﬁgures the in the castle ﬁnally brings julia to door whose bolts strengthened by desperation she forced there was lady in the room who after steadily gazing on julia suddenly exclaimed my daughter and fainted away julia being about seventeen and madame mazzini her mamma having been immured ﬁfteen years we observe in this recognition the force of the maternal instinct the wicked marquis was poisoned by the partner of his iniquities who anon stabbed herself with poniard the virtuous julia marries the chaste hippolytus and says the author in reviewing this story we perceive singular and striking instance of moral adventures among books https also remark the futility of locking up an inconvenient wife fabled to be defunct in one s own country house had mr rochester in jane eyre studied the sicilian romance he would have shunned an obsolete system inconvenient at best and apt in the long run to be disastrous in the romance of the forest 1791 radclif fe remained true to mr stanley weyman s favourite period the end of the sixteenth century but there are historical characters or costumes in the story and all the persons far language and dress go might have been alive in the story runs thus one la motte who appears to have fallen from dissipation to swindling is on the ﬁrst page discovered ﬂying from paris and the law with his wife in carriage lost in the dark on moor he follows light and enters an old lonely house he is seized by rufﬁans locked in and expects to be murdered which he knows that he can not stand he is timid by nature in fact rufﬁan puts pistol to la motte s breast with one hand while with the other he drags along beautiful girl of eighteen swear that you will convey this girl where i may never see her more exclaims the bully and la motte with the young lady is taken back to his carriage if you return within an hour you will be welcomed with brace of bullets is the rufﬁan s parting threat so la motte madame la motte and the beautiful girl drive away la motte s one desire being to ﬁnd retreat safe from the police of an of fended justice is this not very original striking and af fecting situation provocative too of the utmost curiosity fugitive from justice in strange small dark ancient house is seized threatened and presented with young and lovely female stranger in this opening we recognise the hand of master genius there must be an explanation of proceedings so highly unconventional and what can the reason be the reader is empoigné in the ﬁrst page and eagerly follows the ﬂight of la motte also of peter his coachman an attached comic and familiar domestic after few days the party observe in the recesses of gloomy forest the remains of gothic abbey they enter by the light of ﬂickering lamp they penetrate horrible recesses discover room handsomely provided with trapdoor and determine to reside in dwelling so congenial though la motte judiciously remarks not in all respects strictly after few days la motte ﬁnds that somebody is inquiring him in the nearest town he seeks and explores the chambers under the trapdoor here he ﬁnds in lar ge you suppose he ﬁnds it was human skeleton yet in this awful vicinity he and his wife with adeline the fair stranger conceal themselves the brave adeline when footsteps are heard and ﬁgure is beheld in the upper rooms accosts the stranger his keen eye presently detects the practicable trapdoor he raises it and the cowering la motte recognises in the dreaded own son who had sought him out of ﬁlial affection already madame la motte has become jealous of adeline especially her husband is oddly melancholy and apt to withdraw into glade where he mysteriously disappears into the recesses of genuine gothic sepulchre this to the watchful eyes of wife is proof of faithlessness on the part of husband the son louis really falls in love with adeline madame la motte becomes doubly unkind to her and adeline now composes quantities of poems to night to sunset to the nocturnal gale and so on in this uncomfortable situation two strangers arrive in terriﬁc thunderstorm one is young the other is marquis on seeing this nobleman la motte s limbs trembled and ghastly paleness overspread his countenance the marquis was little less agitated and was at ﬁrst decidedly hostile la motte implored what the marquis who in fact owned the abbey and had shooting lodge not far of f was molliﬁed they all became rather friendly and adeline asked la motte about the stories of hauntings and murder said to have been at some time committed in the abbey la motte said that the marquis could have connection with such fables still there was the adventures among books https adeline had conceived ﬂame theodore the young ofﬁcer who accompanied his colonel the marquis on their ﬁrst visit to the family theodore who returned her passion had vaguely warned her of an impending danger and then had failed to keep tryst with her one evening and had mysteriously disappeared then unhappy adeline dreamed about prisoner dying man cofﬁn voice from the cofﬁn and the appearance within it of the dying man amidst torrents of blood the chamber in which she saw these visions was most vividly represented next day the marquis came to dinner and though r eluctantly consented to pass the night adeline therefore was put in new bedroom disturbed by the wind shaking the mouldering tapestry she found concealed door behind the arras and suite of rooms one of which was the chamber of her dr eam on the ﬂoor lay rusty dagger the bedstead being touched crumbled and disclosed small roll of manuscripts they were not washing bills like those discovered by catherine morland in northanger abbey returning to her own chamber adeline heard the marquis professing to la motte passion herself conceive her horror silence then reigned till all was sudden noise and confusion the marquis ﬂying in terror from his room and insisting on instant departure his emotion was powerfully displayed what had occurred radclif fe does not say but horror whether caused by conscience ill at ease or by events of terriﬁc and supernatural kind is plainly indicated in daylight the marquis audaciously pressed his unholy suit and even of fered marriage hollow mockery he was well known to be already married man the scenes of adeline s ﬂight capture retention in an elegant villa of the licentious noble renewed ﬂight rescue by theodore with theodore s arrest and wounding of the tyrannical marquis are all of breathless interest radclif fe excels in narratives of romantic escapes topic always thrilling when well handled adeline herself is carried back to the abbey but la motte who had rather not be villain if he could avoid it enables her again to secure her freedom he is clearly in the power of the marquis and his life has been unscrupulous but he retains traces of better things adeline is now secretly conveyed to peaceful valley in savoy the home of the honest peter the coachman who accompanies her here she learns to know and value the family of la luc the kindred of her theodore by romantic coincidence and in the adorable scenery of savoy she throws many ballad to the moon la motte on the discovery of adeline s ﬂight was cast into prison by the revengeful marquis in fact soon after settling in the abbey it had occurred to la motte to commence highwayman his very ﬁrst victim had been the marquis and during his mysterious retreats to tomb in glade in the forest he had in short been contemplating his booty jewels which he could not convert into ready money consequently when the marquis ﬁrst entered the abbey la motte had every reason alarm and only paciﬁed the vindictive aristocrat by yielding to his cruel schemes against the virtue of adeline happily la motte witness appeared at his trial who cast lurid light on the character of the marquis that villain to be plain had murdered his elder brother the skeleton of the abbey and had been anxious to murder it was added his own natural is adeline his hired felons however placed her in convent and later rather than kill her on which the marquis insisted simply thrust her into the hands of la motte who happened to pass by that way we saw in the opening of this romance thus in making love to adeline his daughter the marquis was unconsciously in an awkward position on further examination of evidence however things proved otherwise adeline was not the natural daughter of the marquis but his niece the legitimate daughter and heiress of his brother the skeleton of the abbey the found by adeline in the room of the rusty dagger added documentary evidence it was narrative of the suf ferings of her father later the skeleton written by him in the abbey where he was imprisoned and stabbed and where his bones were discovered by la motte the hasty nocturnal ﬂight of the marquis from the abbey is thus accounted he had probably been the victim of terriﬁc hallucination representing his murdered brother whether it was veridical or merely subjective radclif fe does not decide rather than face the outraged justice of his country the marquis after these adventures among books https poison la motte was banished and adeline now mistress of the abbey removed the paternal skeleton to the vault of his theodore and adeline were united and virtuously resided in villa on the beautiful banks of the lake of geneva such is the romance of the forest ﬁction in which character is subordinate to plot and incident there is an attempt at character drawing in la motte and in his wife the hero and heroine are not distinguishable from julia and hippolytus but radclif fe does not aim at psychological niceties and we must not blame her withholding what it was part of her purpose to give the romance of the forest was so far inﬁnitely the most thrilling of modern english works of ﬁction every reader felt the force says scott from the sage in his study to the family group in middle life and nobody felt it more than scott himself then young gentleman of nineteen who when asked how his time was employed answered i read civil law he did read radclif fe and in the betrothed followed her example in the story of the haunted chamber where the heroine faces the spectre attached to her ancient family the mysteries of udolpho radclif fe s next and most celebrated work is not in the judgment of this reader at least her masterpiece the booksellers paid her what scott erroneously calls the unprecedented sum of the romance and they must have made proﬁtable bar gain the public says scott rushed upon it with all the eagerness of curiosity and rose from it with unsated i arise with thoroughly sated appetite from the mysteries of the book sir walter saw is the romance of the forest raised to higher power we have similar and similarly situated heroine cruelly detached from her young man and immured in howling wilderness of brigand castle in the apennines in place of the marquis is miscreant on larger and more ferocious scale the usual mysteries of voices lights secret passages and innumerable doors are provided regardless of economy the great question which i shall not answer is what did the black v eil conceal not the bones of laurentina catherine morland supposed here is emily s adventure with the veil she paused again and then with timid hand lifted the veil but instantly let it that what it had concealed was picture and before she could leave the chamber she dropped senseless on the ﬂoor when she recovered her recollection horror occupied her countless mysteries coagulate around this veil and the reader is apt to be disappointed when the awful curtain is withdrawn but he has enjoyed several hundred pages the pleasures of anticipation pedantic censor may remark that while the date of the story is 1580 all the virtuous people live in an idyllic fashion like creatures of rousseau existing solely landscape and the af fections writing poetry on nature animate and inanimate including the common bat and drawing in water colours in those elegant avocations began and in these after an interval of adventures amazing horrid concluded the career of emily radclif fe keeps the many entangled threads of her complex web well in hand and incidents which puzzle you at the beginning fall naturally into place before the end the character of the heroine s silly vain unkind and unreasonable aunt is vividly designed that emily should mistake the corse of moustached bandit that of her aunt is an incident hard to defend valancourt is not an ordinary spotless hero but sows his wild oats and reaps the usual harvest and annette is good sample of the usual soubr ette when one has said that the landscapes and bandits of this romance are worthy of poussin and salvator rosa from whom they were probably translated into words not much remains to be added sir walter after repeated perusals considered udolpho step beyond radclif fe s former work high that had justly advanced her but he admits that persons of mean judgment preferred the romance of the with these amateurs i would be ranked the ingenuity and originality of the romance are greater our friend the skeleton is better than that thing which was behind the black veil the escapes of adeline are more thrilling than the escape of emily and the romance is not nearly so long not nearly so prolix adventures among books https roof and crown of radclif fe s work is the italian 1797 which she received 6 the scene is naples the date about 1764 the topic is the thwarted loves of vivaldi and ellena the villain is the admirable schedoni the prototype of byron s lurid characters the italian is an excellent novel the prelude the dark and vaulted gateway is not unworthy of hawthorne who i suspect had studied radclif fe the theme is more like theme of this world than usual the parents of young noble might well try to prevent him from marrying an unknown and penniless girl the marchese vivaldi only adopts the ordinary paternal measures the marchesa and her confessor the schedoni go far assassination the casuistry by which schedoni brings the lady to this pass while representing her the originator of the scheme is really subtle and the scenes between the pair show an extraordinary advance on radclif fe s earlier art the mysterious monk who counteracts schedoni remains an unsolved mystery to but of that i not complain he is good the dweller in the catacombs who haunts miriam in hawthorne s marble the inquisition its cells and its tribunals are coloured when some great painter dips his pencil in the gloom of earthquake and the comic valet paulo who insists on being locked up in the dungeons of the inquisition merely because his master is there reminds one of samuel weller he is neapolitan samivel the escapes are radclif fe s most exciting escapes and to say that is to say good deal poetry is not written or not often by the heroine the scene in which schedoni has his dagger raised to murder ellena when he discovers that she is his daughter is of new grand and powerful character scott while it is even more satisfactory to learn later that ellena was not schedoni s daughter after all why radclif fe having reached such pitch of success never again published novel remains more mysterious than any of her mysteries scott justly remarks that her censors attacked her by showing that she does not possess the excellences proper to style of composition totally dif ferent from that which she has this is the usual way of reviewers tales that fascinated scott fox and sheridan which possess charms the learned and unlearned the grave and gay the gentleman and clown not deserve to be dismissed with sneer by people who have never read them following horace walpole in some degree radclif fe paved the way scott byron maturin lewis and charlotte brontë just miss burney ﬁlled the gap between smollett and miss austen radclif fe in short kept the lamp of romance burning much more steadily than the lamps which in her novels are always blown out in the moment of excited apprehension by the night wind walking in the dank corridors of haunted abbeys but mark the cruelty of an intellectual parent horace walpole was radclif fe s father in the spirit yet on september 4 1794 he wrote to lady ossory i have read some of the descriptive verbose tales of which your ladyship says i was the patriarch by several mothers miss reeve and radclif fe

thomas stoddar is t like that lead contains her it were too gross to rib her cerecloth in the obscure shakespear edinburgh printed henr y const able edinbur gh and hurst chance london mdcccxxxi this is my rare book and it is rare an excellent good reason will be shown but ﬁrst of the author mr thomas tod stoddart was born in he died in through all his pilgrimage of years and ten his rod and staf

izaak of scottish ﬁshers and he sleeps according to his desire like scott within hearing of the tweed his memoir published by his daughter in stoddart s angling songs blackwood is an admirable biography quo ﬁt ut omnis votiva pateat veluti descripta tabella v ita senis but it is with the young tom stoddart the poet of twenty not with the old angling sage that we have to miss stoddart has discreetly republished only the angling songs of her father the pick of them being classical in their way now mr arnold writes two desires toss about the poet s feverish blood one drives him to the world without and one to the young stoddart s two desires were poetry and ﬁshing he began with poetry at the age of ten his whole desire was to produce an immortal tragedy blood and battle were the powers with which he worked and with meaner tool every other dramatic form he it is curious to think of the schoolboy the born romanticist labouring at these things while gérard nerval and victor hugo and théophile gautier and pétrus borel were boys of the same ambitions and with much the same romantic tastes stoddart had luckily another love besides the muse w ith the spring and the may ﬂy the dagger dipped in gore paled before the supple rod and the dainty finally the rod and midge prevailed wee dour hooks are the thing mouse body and laverock but before he quite abandoned all poetry save ﬁshing ditties he wrote and published the volume whose we have printed the death the lad who drove home from an angling expedition in hearse had an odd way of combining his amusements he lived among

older or younger none of these certainly not wilson nor hogg nor aytoun were friends of the romantic school illustrated by keats and shelley none of them probably knew much of gautier nerval borel le lycanthrope and the other boys in that boyish movement of it was only stoddart unconsciously in sympathy with paris and censured by his literary friends who produced the one british romantic work of the title itself shows that he was partly laughing at his own performance he has the mockery of les jeunes france in him well the wormy and obituary joys of la comédie la mort the little book came out inspired by all the christopher north wrote four years later in blackwood s magazine tardy review he styled it an ingeniously absurd poem with an ingeniously absurd title written in strange sort of style between the weakest of shelley and the strongest of barry the book fell dead from the press far more dead than omar nay misfortune pursued it miss stoddart kindly informs and it was doomed to the ﬂames the remainder the bulk of the edition was returned to the poet in sheets and by him was deposited in garret the family had cook one betty descendant perhaps of that unhappy betty or elizabeth barnes cook of mr warburton somerset herald who burned among other quartos shakespeare s henry henry and king true to her inherited instincts mr stoddart s betty slowly relentlessly through

biblioclastic dead have diverse pains to brook they break afﬂiction s bread with betty barnes the cook the author of the bird bride sings miss stoddart had just informed of this disaster which left one almost hopeless of ever owning copy of the death wake when i found brown paper parcel among many that contained s minor poetry with the author s compliments and lo in this unpromising parcel was the volume ever since one was small boy reading stoddart s scottish angler and old blackwood s one had pined sight of the necromaunt and here clean in its pure purple mantle of smooth cloth lay the

caricatures of skulls and while the bear sonnet to the author and lyric in doggerel surely this is indeed literary curiosity the sonnet runs thus wormy thomas stoddart who inheritest rich thoughts and

uncumbersome to the nicest hand in the format of an elzevir bound in black morocco and adorned with tooled that is ungilt skulls and crossbones it has lost the with the date but retains the frontispiece engraved by huret saint augustine in his mitre and other episcopal array with quill in his hand sits under ﬂood of inspiring sunshine the dumpy book has been much read was at some time the property of mr john philips and bears one touching manuscript note of which more hereafter it is i presume copy of the translation by sir toby matthew the author of the preface declares with truth that the translator hath consulted so closely and earnestly with the saint that he seemeth to have lighted his torch att his ﬁre and to speak in the best and most signiﬁcant english what and how he would have done had he understood our there can be better english version of this famous book in which saint augustine tells the story of his eager and passionate youth tossed about by the contending tides of love human and divine reading it with mundane curiosity we may half regret the space which he gives to theological metaphysics and his brief tantalising glimpses of what most interests us common life of men when the church was becoming mistress of the world when the old religions were dying of allegory and moral interpretations and occult dreams but even so saint augustine s interest in himself in the very obscure origins of each human existence in the psychology of infancy and youth in school disputes and magical pretensions his ardent af fections his exultations and his faults make his memoirs immortal among the unveilings of the spirit he has studied babies that he may know his dark beginnings and the seeds of grace and of evil then by degrees i began to ﬁnd where i was and i had certain desires to declare my will to those by whom it might be executed but i could not it therefore would i be tossing my arms and sending out certain cryes and when they obeyed not i would fall into rage and that not against such were my adventures among books https servants but against my elders and my betters and i would revenge myself upon them by he has observed that infants begin to laugh ﬁrst sleeping and then shortly waking curious note but he does not ask wherefore the sense of humour or the expression of it comes to children ﬁrst in their slumber of what babies dream and what the nested swallows chirrup to each other in their sleep such have i understood that such infants are i could know and such have i been told that i was by them who brought up though even they may rather be accounted not to know than to know these one thing he knows that even infancy is subject to from the womb we are touched with evil myselfe have seene and observed some little child who could not speake and yet he was all in an envious kind of wrath looking pale with bitter countenance upon his foster in an envious kind of wrath is it not the motive of half our politics and too much of our criticism such is man s inborn nature not to be cured by laws or reforms not to be washed out of his veins though blood be shed like rain and tears like an infant can not endure companion to feed with him in fountain of milk which is richly abounding and overﬂowing although that companion be wholly destitute and can take other food but this is the original sin inherited innate unacquired this are babes long to suf fer the famous or infamous preacher declared where or at what time was i ever innocent he cries and hears answer from the dark backward and abysm of the life then the saint describes child s learning to speak how he amasses verbal tokens of things having tamed and it were broken my mouth to the pronouncing of and so i began to launch out more deeply into the tempestuous trafﬁque and society of tempestuous enough he found or made child of pagan father and christian saint monica the saint of motherhood the past generations had chalked out certain laborious ways of learning and perhaps saint augustine never gave the ﬂogging plagosus orbilius of his boyhood long before his day he had found out that the sorrows of children and their joys are less serious than the sorrows of mature age is there lord any man of so great mind that he can think lightly of those racks and hooks and other torments the avoiding whereof men pray unto thee with great fear from one end of the world to the other that he can make sport at such doe most sharply inﬂict these things upon them our parents laughed at the torments which we children susteyned at our master s hands can we suppose that monica laughed or was it only the heathen father who approved of roughing it being yet childe i began to beg thy ayde and succour and i did loosen the knots of my tongue in praying thee and i begged being yet little one with little devotion that i might not be beaten at the one is reminded of tom tulliver who gave up even praying that he might learn one part of his work please make mr say that i am not to the saint admits that he lacked neither memory nor wit but he took delight in the plays and toys of men are called business yet when children fall unto them the same men punish yet the schoolmaster was more fed upon by rage if beaten in any little question of learning than the boy if in any match at ball i had been maistered by one of my he aspired proudly to be victorious in the matches which he made and i seriously regret to say that he would buy match and pay his opponent to lose when he could not win fairly he liked romances also to have myne eares scratched with lying fables lazy idle boy like him who dallied with rebecca and rowena in the holidays of charter house saint augustine like sir walter scott at the university of edinbur gh was the greek both of these great men to their sorrow and loss absolutely and totally declined to learn greek but what the reason was why i hated the greeke language while i was taught it being child i not yet the saint was far from being alone in that distaste and he who writes loathed greek like he came to homer latin the saint loved except when reading writing and casting of accounts was taught in latin which i held not lesse paynefull or penal than the very greeke adventures among books https dido s death who made herselfe away with the sword he declares and even so the saying that two and two makes foure was an ungrateful song in mine ears whereas the wooden horse full of armed men the burning of troy and the very ghost of creusa was most delightful spectacle of vanity in short the saint was regular clever sportive and wilful creature he was fond most boys of the mythical tales and that i was accounted to be towardly boy meanwhile he does not record that monica disliked his learning the foolish dear old heathen that ﬂood of hell boyhood gave place to youth and allowing the vanity of there can be little doubt that the youth of saint augustine was une jeunesse orageuse and what was that wherein i took delight but to love and to be there was ever much sentiment and af fection in his amours but his soul could not distinguish the beauty of chast love from the muddy darkness of lust streams of them did confusedly boyl in his african veins w ith restless kind of weariness he pursued that other self of the platonic dream neglecting the love of god oh how late art thou come my joy the course of his the bar we should him from home to carthage where he rapidly got the pure counsels of his mother old wife s and we delighted in doing ill not only the pleasure of the fact but even the af fection of even monica it seems justiﬁed the saying every woman is at heart marriage would have been his making saint augustine says but she desired not even that so very much lest the cloggs of wife might have hindered her hopes of in the meantime the reins were loosed to beyond yet the sin which he regrets most bitterly was nothing more dreadful than the robbery of an orchard pears he had in plenty none the less he went with band of roisterers and pillaged another man s pear tree i loved the sin not that which i obtained by the same but i loved the sin there lay the sting of it they were not even unusually excellent pears peare tree ther was neere our vineyard heavy loaden with fruite which tempted not greatly either the sight or tast to the shaking and robbing thereof certaine most wicked youthes whereof i was one went late at night we carried away huge burthens of fruit from thence not our owne eating but to be cast before the oh moonlit night of africa and orchard by these wild seabanks where once dido stood oh laughter of boys among the shaken leaves and sound of falling fruit how you live alone out of so many nights that man remembers carthage is destroyed indeed and forsaken of the sea yet that one hour of summer is to be unfor gotten while man has memory of the story of his past nothing of this to be sure is in the mind of the saint but long remorse this great sin which he earnestly analyses nor is he so penitent but that he is clear and ﬁnds the spring of his in the sense of humour it was delight and laughter which tickled us even at the very hart to ﬁnd that we were upon the point of deceiving them who feared such thing from us and who if they had known it would earnestly have procured the contrary saint augustine admits that he lived with fast set people say the depravers or destroyers though he loved them little whose actions i ever did abhor that is their destruction of others amongst whom i yet lived with kind of shameless in short the club of that day numbered reluctant saint among its members it was christian gospel but the hortensius of cicero which won him from this perilous society it altered my af fection and made address my prayers to thee lord and gave other desires and purposes than i had before all vain hopes did instantly grow base in myne eyes and i did with an incredible heat of adventures among books https towards the immortality of thus it was really saint tully and not the mystic call of tolle lege that converted augustine diverting the current of his life into the channel of righteousness how was i kindled then oh my god with desire to ﬂy from earthly things towards there now remained only the choice of road saint augustine dates his own conversion from the day of his turning to the strait christian orthodoxy even the platonic writings had he known greek would not have satisﬁed his desire where was that charity that buildeth upon the foundation of humility which is christ jesus these pages of the platonists carried not in them this countenance of tears of confession and that sacriﬁce of thine which is an afﬂicted spirit contrite and humbled heart the salvation of thy people the spouse the city the pledge of thy holy spirit the cup of our redemption man doth there thus express himself shall not my soul be subject to god of him is my salvation he is my god and my salvation my protectour i shall never be moved man doth there once call and say to him come unto all you that labour the heathen doctors had not the grace which saint augustine instinctively knew he grace of humility nor the comfort that is not from within but from without to these he aspired let us follow him on the path by which he came within their inﬂuence but let us not get that the guide on the way to the city was kind clever wordy vain old marcus tullius cicero it is to the city that all our faces should be set if we knew what belongs to our peace thither we cast fond hopeless backward glances even if we be of those whom tertullian calls saint satan s here in augustine we meet man who found the of the few who have found it of the few who have won that love which is our only rest it may be worth while to follow him to the journey s end the treatise of cicero then inﬂamed augustine to the loving and seeking and ﬁnding and holding and inseparably embracing of wisdom itself wheresoever it yet when he looked wisdom in the christian scriptures all the literary man the rhetorician in him was repelled by the simplicity of the style without going further than mr pater s book marius the epicurean and his account of apuleius an english reader may learn what kind of style learned african of that date found not too simple but cicero rather than apuleius was augustine s ideal that verbose and sonorous eloquence captivated him it did the early scholars when learning revived augustine had dallied little with the sect of the manichees which appears to have grieved his mother more than his wild life but she was comforted by vision when she found herself in wood and met glorious young man who informed her that where she was there should her son be curious it is to think that this very semblance of glorious young man haunts the magical dreams of heathen red indians advising them where they shall ﬁnd game and was beheld in such ecstasies by john tanner white man who lived with the indians and adopted their religion the greeks would have called this appearance hermes even in this guise odysseus met him in the oak wood of circe s isle but augustine was not yet in his mother s faith he still taught and studied rhetoric contending its prizes but declining to be aided by certain wizard of his acquaintance he had entered competitor t ragicall poeme but was too sportsmanlike to seek victory by art necromantic yet he followed after astrologers because they used sacriﬁces and did not pretend to consult spirits even the derision of his dear friend nebridius could not then move him from those absurd speculations his friend died and his whole heart was darkened mine eyes would be looking him in all places but they found him not and i hated all things because they told news of he fell into an extreme weariness of life and less fear of death he lived but by halves having lost dimidium animae suae and yet dreaded death lest he might chance to have wholy dyed whome i extremely so he returned to carthage change and sought pleasure in other friendships but blessed is the man that loves thee and his friend in thee and his adventures among books https thee he only never loseth dear friend to whom all men are dear his sake who is never here on the mar gin of the old book beside these thoughts so beautiful if so helpless like all words to console some reader long dead has written pray your poor servant and again pray your poor doubtless some catholic reader himself bereaved is imploring the prayers of dear friend dead and sure we need their petitions more than they need ours who have left this world of temptation and are at peace after this loss saint augustine went to rome his ambition ur ging him perhaps but more his disgust with the violent and riotous life of students in carthage to leave his mother was difﬁcult but i lyed to my mother yea such mother and so escaped from her and now he had dangerous sickness and afterwards betook himself to converse with the orthodox example at milan with saint ambrose in milan his mother would willingly have continued in the african pagan wine and food to the graves of the dead but this saint ambrose forbade and she obeyed him him she did extremely af fect the regard of my spirituall from milan his friend alipius preceded him to rome and there was damnably delighted with the gladiatorial combats being made drunk with delight in augustine followed him to rome and there lost the girl of his heart so that my heart was wounded that the very blood did follow the lady had made vow of eternal chastity having left with son by her but he fell to new love the old one was departed and yet the ancient wound pained him still after more desperate and dogged manner haer et letalis arundo by these passions his conversion was delayed the carnal and spiritual wills ﬁghting against each other within him give chastity and continency lord he would pray but not give it yet and perhaps this is the frankest of the confessions of saint augustine in the midst of this war of the spirit and the ﬂesh behold i heard voyce if it had been of some boy or girl from some house not farre of f uttering and often repeating these words in kind of singing voice tolle lege t olle lege take up and read take up and so he took up testament and opening it at random after the manner of his virgilian lots read not in surfeiting and wantonness not in causality and uncleanness with what follows neither would i read any further neither was there any cause why i saint augustine does not perhaps mean us to understand his translator does that he was miraculously he knew what was right perfectly well before the text only clinched resolve which he has found it very hard to make perhaps there was triﬂe of superstition in the matter we never know how superstitious we are at all events henceforth i neither desired wife nor had i any ambitious care of any worldly he told his mother and monica rejoiced believing that now her prayers were answered such is the story of the conversion of saint augustine it was the maturing of an old purpose and long deferred much stranger stories are told of bunyan and colonel gardiner he gave up rhetoric another man was engaged to sell words to the students of milan being now converted the saint becomes less interesting except adventures among books https of his mother s death and of that ecstatic converse they held she and i alone leaning against window which had prospect upon the garden of our lodging at they came on that which is and heard the vast pulsations of the and whilest we thus spake and panted towards the divine we grew able to take little taste thereof with the whole strife of our hearts and we sighed profoundly and left there conﬁned the very top and ﬂower of our souls and spirits and we returned to the noyse of language again where words are begun and then monica fell sick to death and though she had ever wished to lie beside her husband in africa she said lay this body where you will let not any care of it disquiet you only this i entreat that you will remember at the altar of the lord wheresoever you but upon the ninth day of her sickness in the year of her age and the of mine that religious and pious soul was dischar ged from the prison of her body the grief of augustine was not less keen it seems than it had been at the death of his friend but he could remember how she related with great dearness of af fection how she never heard any harsh or unkind word to be darted out of my mouth against her and to this consolation was added who knows what of conﬁdence and tenderness of certain hope or kind of deadness perhaps that may lighten the pain of heart very often tried and inured to every pain it is certain that this green wound was green and grievous briefer time than the agony of his earlier sorrows he himself so earnest in analysing his own emotions is perplexed by the short date of his tears and his sharpest grief let him read it who will and interpret it it pleaseth so with the death of monica we may leave saint augustine the most human of books the confessions now strays into theology of all books that which it most oddly resembles to my fancy at least is the poems of catullus the passion and the tender heart they have in common and in common the war of ﬂesh and spirit the shameful inappeasable love of lesbia or of the worldly life so delightful and dear to the poet and to the saint so despised in other moods conquered and victorious again among the battles of the war in our members the very words in which the veronese and the bishop of hippo described the pleasure and gaiety of an early friendship are almost the same and we feel that born four hundred years later the lover of lesbia the singer of sirmio might actually have found peace in religion and exchanged the earthly the heavenly love chapter ix smollett the great english novelists of the eighteenth century turned the course of english literature out of its older channel her streams had descended from the double peaks of parnassus to irrigate the enamelled ﬁelds and elegant parterres of poetry and the drama the critics of the period might have said but richardson fielding smollett and sterne diverted the waters from poetry and plays into the region of the novel whither they have brought down copious alluvial deposit modern authors little but till this fertile delta the drama is now in the desert poetry is drug and ﬁction is literature among the writers who made this revolution smollett is personally the least well known to the world despite the great part which autobiography and confessions play in his work he is always talking about himself and introducing his own experiences but there is little evidence from without his extant correspondence is scanty he was not in johnson s circle much less was he in that of horace walpole he was not adventures among books https and probably he has long ceased to be popular author about 1780 the vendors of children s books issued abridgments of t om jones and pamela clarissa and joseph andrews adapted to the needs of infant minds it was curious enterprise certainly but the booksellers not seem to have produced every boy s roderick random or peregrine pickle the smollett in short is less known than fielding and sterne even thackeray says but word about him in the english humorists and he has place in the series of english men of what we know of smollett reveals thoroughly typical scot of his period scot of the species absolutely opposed to sir pertinax macsycophant and rather akin to the species of robert burns rather akin we may say smollett like burns was humorist and in his humour far from dainty he was personal satirist and satirist far from chivalrous like burns too he was poet of independence like burns and even more than burns in time of patronage he was recalcitrant against patrons but unlike burns he was farouche to an extreme degree and unlike burns he carried very far his prejudices about his gentrice his gentle birth herein he is at the opposite pole from the great peasant poet two potent characteristics of his country were at war within him there was ﬁrst the belief in gentrice in natural dif ference of kind between men of coat armour and men without it thus roderick random the starving cadet of line of small lairds accepts the almost incredible and devotion of strap merely his due prince charles could not have taken the devotion of henry goring or of neil maceachain more entirely matter of course involving consideration in return than roderick took the unparalleled of his barber friend and scott has remarked on this contemptuous and ungrateful selﬁshness and has contrasted it with the relations of tom jones and partridge of course it is not to be assumed that smollett would have behaved like roderick when ﬁnding the ﬁre in my apartment almost extinguished i vented my fury upon poor strap whose ear i pinched with such violence that he roared hideously with pain to be sure roderick presently felt unspeakable remorse foamed at the mouth and kicked the chairs about the now strap had rescued roderick from starvation had bestowed on him hundreds of pounds and had carried his baggage and dined on his leavings but strap was not gently born smollett would not probably have acted thus but he did not consider such conduct thing out of nature on the other side was smollett s scottish spirit of independence early 1515 james ingles chaplain of mar garet tudor wrote to adam williamson y know the use of this country the man hath more words than the master and will not be content except he know the master s counsel there is order among strap had the instinct of feudal loyalty to descendant of laird but smollett boasts that being at the time about twenty and having burdened nobleman with his impossible play the regicide resolved to punish his barbarous indif ference and actually discarded my he was not given to booing in the sense of bowing but had of all known scots the most canty conceit himsel these qualities with violence of temper which took the form of beating people when on his travels can not have made smollett popular character he knew his faults he shows in the dedication of ferdinand count fathom to himself i have known you triﬂing superﬁcial and obstinate in dispute meanly jealous and awkwardly reserved rash and haughty in your resentment and coarse and lowly in your he could it is true on occasion give even where he had not been wronged and could compensate in milder moods the ﬁerce attacks made in hours when he was meanly yet in early life at least he regarded his own roderick random modest and meritorious struggling nobly with the difﬁculties which beset friendless orphan especially from the selﬁshness envy malice and base indif ference of roderick himself is in fact the incarnation of the basest selﬁshness in one of his adventures he is guilty of that extreme infamy which the d artagnan of the three musketeers and of the memoirs committed and which the d artagnan of le vicomte bragelonne took shame to himself while engaged in virtuous adventures among books https not only behaves like vulgar debauchee but pursues the meanest arts of the who is ready to marry any woman her money such is the modest and meritorious orphan and mankind now carries its base indif ference so far that smollett s biographer hannay says if roderick had been hanged i my part should have heard the tidings unmoved smollett obviously died without realising how nearly the hero who was in some sort portrait of himself came to being carlyle in 1758 being in london found smollett much of humorist and not to be put out of his way humorist here means an overbearingly eccentric person such smollett who lived much in society of literary dependants was apt to become but carlyle also found that though smollett described so well the characters of rufﬁans and proﬂigates he did not resemble them dr robertson the historian expressed great surprise at his polished and agreeable manners and the great urbanity of his he was handsome in person his portrait shows but his nervous system was exceedingly irritable and subject to passion he says in the latin account of his health which in 1763 he drew up the physician at montpellier though when he chose he could behave like man of breeding and though he undeniably had warm heart his wife and daughter he did not always choose to behave well except dr moore his biographer he seems to have had few real friends during most of his career to persons whom he chose to regard his enemies he was beyond measure rancorous and dangerous from his ﬁrst patron lord l yttelton to his last he pursued them with unscrupulous animosity if he did not mean actually to draw portraits of his grandfather his cousins his and the apothecary whose gallipots he roderick random he left the originals who suggested his characters in very awkward situation assuredly he did entertain spite against his grandfather and many of the incidents in roderick random were autobiographical the public readily inferred that others were founded on fact the outlines of smollett s career are familiar though gaps in our knowledge occur perhaps they may partly be ﬁlled up by the aid of passages in his novels plays and poems in these at all events he describes conditions and situations through which he himself may or must have passed born in 1721 he was younger son of archibald younger son of sir james smollett of bonhill house on the now polluted leven between loch lomond and the estuary of the clyde smollett s father made an imprudent marriage the grandfather provided small but competent provision him and his family during his own life the father archibald died the grandfather left nothing to the mother of tobias and her children but they were assisted with scrimp decency by the heirs hence the attacks on the grandfather and cousins of roderick random but later smollett returned to kinder feelings in some ways tobias resembled his old grandsire about 1710 that gentleman wrote memoir of his own life hence we learn that he in childhood like roderick random was regarded clog and burden and was neglected by his father by his thus tobias had not only his own early poverty to resent but had hereditary grudge against fortune and the base indif ference of the old gentleman was lodged with very hard and penurious people at glasgow university he rose in the world and was good presbyterian whig but had liberty to help to forfeit james ii the puir child his son james iii and viii if he was really such was innocent and it were hard to anything that would touch the son the father s the old gentleman therefore though member of parliament evaded attending the ﬁrst parliament after the union i had freedom to it because i understood that the great business to be agitated therein was to make laws abjuring the pretender which i could not go in with being always of opinion that it was hard to impose oaths on people who had not freedom to take this was uncommonly liberal conduct in whig and our smollett though jacobite was in distinct and courageous sympathy with jacobite scotland indeed he was adventures among books https burns or his own lismahago these were times we must remember in which scottish patriotism was more than mere historical sentiment scotland was inconceivably poor and scots in england were therefore ridiculous the country had so far gained very little by the union and the union was detested even by scottish whig earls it is recorded by moore that while at the dumbarton grammar school smollett wrote verses to the memory of wallace of whom he became an early admirer having read blind harry s translation of the latin poems of john blair chaplain to that hero there probably never were any such latin poems but smollett began with the same burns he had the attachment of scot to his native stream the leven which later he was to celebrate now if smollett had credited roderick random with these rural poetical and patriotic tastes his hero would have been much more human and amiable there was much good in smollett which is absent in random but some reason probably because scotland was unpopular after the smollett merely describes the woes ill usage and retaliations of roderick that he suf fered random did is to the last degree improbable he had fair knowledge of latin and was not destitute of greek while his master mr love bore good character both humanity and scholarship he must have studied the classics at glasgow university where he was apprenticed to mr gordon sur geon gordon again was an excellent man appreciated by smollett himself in after days and the odious potion of roderick random must like his rival crab have been merely fancy sketch of meanness hypocrisy and proﬂigacy perhaps the good sur geon became the victim of that one continued string of epigrammatic sarcasms such mr colquhoun told ramsay of ochtertyre smollett used to play of f on his companions which talents could judging by dr carlyle s memoirs this intolerable kind of display was not unusual in caledonian conversation but it was not likely to make tobias popular in england thither he went in 1739 with very little money and very lar ge assortment of letters of recommendation whether his relatives intended to compensate the scantiness of the one by their profusion in the other is uncertain but he has often been heard to declare that their liberality in the last article was the smolletts were not kinless loons they had connections but who in scotland had money tobias had passed his medical examinations but he rather trusted in his tragedy the tragical were its results the author inspired by geor ge buchanan s latin history of scotland smollett had produced play in blank verse on the murder of james that boy even scottish boy should have an overweening passion this unlucky piece that he should expect by such work to climb step on fortune s ladder is nowadays amazing ten years he clung to it modiﬁed it polished improved it and then published it in 1749 after the success of roderick twice he told the story of his theatrical mishaps and disappointments which were such occur to every writer the stage he wailed over them in roderick random in the story of mr melopoyn he prolonged his cry in the preface to the regicide and probably the noble whom he lashed very indecently in his two satires advice 1746 reproof 1747 and in roderick random was the patron who could not get the tragedy acted first in 1739 he had patron whom he then he went to the west indies and returning in 1744 he lugged out his tragedy again and fell foul again of patrons actors and managers what befell him was the common fate people did not probably hasten to read his play managers and supercilious peers postponed that entertainment or at least the noblemen could not make the managers accept it if they did not want it our taste dif fers so much from that of the time which admired home s douglas and the regicide was so often altered to meet objections that we can scarcely criticise it of course it is absolutely unhistorical of course it is empty of character and replete with fustian and ineffably tedious but perhaps it is not much worse than other luckier tragedies of the age naturally lover calls his wounded lady the bleeding fair naturally she exclaims celestial powers protect my father shower upon dies adventures among books https her adorer answers so may our mingling souls to bliss supernal wing our dies we are reminded alas my bom dies bastes he would have said the piece if presented must have been damned but smollett was so angry with one patron lord l yttelton that he burlesqued the poor man s dirge on the death of his wife he was so angry with garrick that he dragged him into roderick random marmozet later obliged by garrick and giving l yttelton he wrote respectfully about both but in 1746 in advice he had assailed the proud lord who smiles gracious lie and the varnished rufﬁans of the because tobias s play was unacted people who tried to aid him were liars and rufﬁans and great deal worse in his satire in his ﬁrst novel smollett char ges men of high rank with the worst of unnamable crimes pollio and lord strutwell whoever they may have been were probably recognisable then and were undeniably libelled though they did not appeal to jury it is improbable that sir john cope had ever tried to oblige smollett his ignoble attack on cope after that unfortunate general had been fairly and honourably acquitted of incompetence and cowardice was then wholly disinterested cope is courtier ape appointed then pug aghast ﬂed faster than the wind nor deign d in miles to look behind while every band orders bleat in vain and fall in slaughtered heaps upon the plain of preston pans nothing could be more remote from the truth or more unjustly cruel smollett had not here even the excuse of patriotism sir john cope was butcher cumberland in fact the poet s friend is not wrong when in reproof he calls smollett ﬂagrant the world was out of joint the cadet of bonhill both before and after his very trying experiences ship sur geon the managers would not accept the this was reason good why smollett should try to make little money and notoriety by penning satires they are ﬁerce and pointless but smollett was poor and he was angry he had the examples of pope and swift before him which far truculence went he could imitate above all it was then the ﬁxed belief of men of letters that some peer or other ought to aid and support them and peer did support smollett obviously they were varnished he erred he would not err now times and ways of going wrong are changed but at best how dif ferent are his angry couplets from the lofty melancholy of johnson s satires smollett s small sum of money did not permit him long to push the fortunes of his tragedy in 1739 and his very lar ge assortment of letters of recommendation they only procured him the post of sur geon s mate in the cumberland of the line here he saw enough of the horrors of naval life enough of misery brutality and mismanagement at carthagena 1741 to supply materials the salutary and sickening pages on that theme in roderick he also saw and appreciated the sterling qualities of courage simplicity and generosity which he has made immortal in his bowlings and trunnions it is part of novelist s business to make one half of the world know how the other half lives and in this province smollett anticipated dickens he left the service soon he could when the beaten ﬂeet was reﬁtting at jamaica in that isle he seems to have practised doctor and he married or was betrothed to miss lascelles who had adventures among books https and far from valuable property the real date of his marriage is obscure more obscure are smollett s resources on his return to london in houses in downing street can never have been cheap but we ﬁnd mr smollett sur geon in downing street westminster and in 1746 he was living in may fair not region slender purses his tragedy was now bringing in nothing but trouble to himself and others his satires can not have been lucrative dweller in may fair he could not support himself like his mr melopoyn by writing ballads street singers probably he practised in his profession in count fathom he makes his adventurer purchase an old chariot which was new painted the occasion and likewise hire footman this equipage though much more expensive than his ﬁnances could bear he found absolutely necessary to give him chance of employment walking physician was considered an obscure pedlar chariot smollett insists was necessary to every raw sur geon while bob sawyer s expedient of being called from church was already vieux jeu in the way of advertisement such things had been injudiciously in this passage of fathom s adventures smollett proclaims his insight into methods of getting practice physician must ingratiate himself with apothecaries and ladies maids or acquire interest enough to have an inﬁrmary erected by the voluntary subscriptions of his here smollett denounces hospitals which encourage the vulgar to be idle and dissolute by opening an asylum to them and their families from the diseases of poverty and this is odd morality one who suf fered from the base indif ference of he ought to have known that poverty is not vice which the poor are to be blamed and that intemperance is not the only other cause of their diseases perhaps the unfeeling passage is mere paradox in the style of his own lismahago with or without chariot it is probable that tobias had not an insinuating style or good bedside manner friends to support hospital his renown he had none but somehow he could live in may fair and in 1746 could meet dr carlyle and stewart son of the provost of edinbur gh and other scots at the golden ball in cockspur street there they were enjoying frugal supper and little punch when the news of culloden arrived carlyle had been whig volunteer he probably was happy enough but stewart whose father was in prison grew pale and left the room smollett and carlyle then walked home through secluded streets and were silent lest their speech should bewray them scots john bull quoth smollett is haughty and valiant he was abject and cowardly on the black wednesday when the highlanders were at derby weep caledonia weep he had written in his tragedy now he wrote mourn hapless caledonia scott has quoted from graham of gartmore the story of smollett s writing verses while gartmore and others were playing cards he read them what he had written the tears of scotland and added the last verse on the spot when warned that his opinions might give of fence yes spite of thine insulting foe my sympathising verse shall ﬂow the t ears are better than the ode to ann probably smollett but the courageous author of the tears of scotland had manifestly broken with patrons he also broke with rich the manager at covent garden whom he had written an opera libretto he had failed doctor and dramatist nor satirist had he succeeded yet he managed to wear wig and sword and to be seen in good men s company perhaps his wife s little fortune supported him till in 1748 he produced roderick it is certain that we never ﬁnd smollett in the deep distresses of dr johnson and goldsmith novels were now in vogue pamela was recent joseph andrews was yet more recent clarissa harlowe had just appeared and fielding was publishing t om smollett too tried his hand and at last he succeeded his ideas of the novel are of fered in his preface the novel him is department of satire the most entertaining and universally to smollett roderick random seemed an improving work où le didacticisme va t il nicher adventures among books https declares arose in ignorance vanity and superstition and declined into the ludicrous and then cervantes converted romance to purposes far more useful and entertaining by making it assume the sock and point out the follies of ordinary romance was to revive again some twenty years after its funeral oration was thus delivered smollett himself he professedly follows the plan of le sage in gil blas plan old petronius arbiter and the golden ass of apuleius but he gives more place to compassion so not to interfere with generous indignation which ought to animate the reader against the sordid and vicious disposition of the contrast to sordid vice we are to admire modest merit in that exemplary orphan mr random this gentleman is north briton because only in north britain can poor orphan get such an education roderick s birth and character require and other reasons now roderick the schoolmaster gave himself concern about the progress i made but should endeavour with god s help to prevent my future it must have been at glasgow university then that roderick learned greek very well and was pretty far advanced in the mathematics and here he must have used his genius the belles lettr es in the interest of his amorous complexion by lampooning the rivals of the young ladies who admired him such are the happy beginnings accompanied by practical jokes of this interesting model smollett s heroes one conceives were intended to be ﬁne though not faultless young fellows men not plaster images brave generous but roderick ﬁnds once when examining his conscience pure from serious stains on that important faculty to us these heroes often appear better than rufﬁans peregrine pickle example rather excels the infamy of ferdinand count fathom in certain respects though ferdinand is professedly often the object of our detestation and abhorrence and is left in very bad but humphrey clinker shows in by means hopeless way yet throughout smollett regarded himself moralist writer of improving tendencies one who lashed the vices of the he was by means wholly mistaken but we should probably wrong the eighteenth century if we accepted all smollett s censures entirely deserved the vices which he lashed are those which he detected or fancied that he detected in people who regarded modest and meritorious scottish orphan with base indif ference unluckily the greater part of mankind was guilty of this crime and consequently was capable of everything enough has probably been said about the utterly distasteful ﬁgure of smollett s hero in chapter lx we ﬁnd him living on the resources of strap then losing all strap s money at play and then i bilk my taylor that is roderick orders several suits of new clothes and sells them what they will fetch meanwhile strap can live honestly anywhere while he has his ten ﬁngers roderick rescues himself from poverty by engaging with his uncle in the slave trade we are apt to consider this commerce infamous but in 1763 the evangelical director who helped to make cowper castaway wrote to the slaver s profession it is indeed accounted genteel employment and is usually very proﬁtable though to it did not prove so the lord seeing that lar ge increase of wealth could not be good the reverend gentleman had doubtless often time us to go time us to go and when we d got the hatches down twas time us to go roderick apart from black ivory is aided by his uncle and his long lost father the base world in the persons of strap thompson the uncle mr sagely and other people treats him inﬁnitely better than he deserves his very love always in smollett is only an animal appetite vigorously insisted upon by the author by natural reaction scott much he admired smollett introduced his own blameless heroes and even thackeray could only hint at the defects of youth in thackeray is accused of making his good people stupid or too simple or eccentric and otherwise contemptible smollett went further strap model of benevolence is ludicrous and coward even bowling has the stage eccentricities of the sailor mankind was certain in the long run to adventures among books https more amiable and worthy of respect our inclinations scott says are with the and tom jones whose libertinism one particular omitted is perhaps rendered but too amiable by his good to be sure roderick does befriend reclaimed in her worst need but why make her the conﬁdante of the vir ginal narcissa why reward strap with her hand fielding decidedly scott insists places before us heroes and especially heroines of much higher well more pleasing character than smollett was able to but the deep and fertile genius of smollett af forded resources sufﬁcient to make up these deﬁciencies if fielding had superior taste the palm of more brilliancy of genius more inexhaustible richness of invention must in justice be awarded to smollett in comparison with his sphere that in which fielding walked was limited the second part of scott s parallel between the men whom he considered the greatest of our novelists qualiﬁes the ﬁrst smollett s invention was not richer than fielding s but the sphere in which he walked the circle of his experience was much wider one division of life they knew about equally well the category of rakes adventurers unhappy authors people of the stage and ladies without reputations in every degree there were conditions of higher society of english rural society and of clerical society which fielding by birth and education knew much better than smollett but smollett had the advantage of his early years in scotland then little known japan with the nautical multitude from captain to loblolly boy he was intimately familiar with the west indies he was acquainted and he later resided in paris and travelled in flanders so that he had more experience certainly if not more invention than fielding in roderick random he used scottish local colour very little but his life had furnished him with surprising wealth of strange inns were we must believe the favourite home of adventures and smollett could ring endless changes on mistakes about bedrooms none of them is so innocently diverting the af fair of mr pickwick and the lady in yellow but the absence of that innocence which heightens mr pickwick s distresses was welcome to admirers of what lady mary wortley montagu calls gay she wrote from abroad in 1752 there is something humorous in random that makes believe that the author is fielding kinsman her ladyship did her cousin little justice she did not complain of the morals of r random but thought pamela and clarissa likely to more general mischief than the works of lord rochester probably r random did little harm his career is too obviously ideal too many ups and downs occur to him and few orphans of merit could set before themselves the ideal of bilking their tailors gambling by way of profession dealing in the slave trade and wheedling heiresses the variety of character in the book is vast in mor gan we have an excellent ﬁery welshman of the stage type the dif ferent minor miscreants are all vividly designed the eccentric lady author may have had real original miss snapper has much vivacity wit the french adventures in the army are in their rude barbaric way forecast of barry lyndon s and generally both scott and thackeray owe good deal to smollett in the way of suggestions smollett s extraordinary love of dilating on noisome smells and noisome sights that intense af fection the physically nauseous which he shared with swift is rather less marked in roderick than in humphrey clinker and the adventures of an the scenes in the marshalsea must have been familiar to dickens the terrible history of miss williams is hogarth s harlot s progress done into unsparing prose smollett guides us at brisk pace through the shady and brutal side of the eighteenth century his vivacity is unﬂagging that of his disagreeable rattle of hero the passion usually understood love is to be sure one of which he seems to have conception he regards woman much greedy person might regard sirloin of beef or at least plate of ortolans at her marriage bride is dished up that is all thus this gay writing longer makes us gay in reading peregrine pickle and humphrey clinker man may ﬁnd himself laughing aloud but hardly in adventures among books https roderick the fun is of the cruel primitive sort arising merely from the contemplation of somebody s painful discomﬁture bowling and rattlin may be regarded with af fectionate respect but roderick has only physical courage and vivacity to recommend him whether smollett in flaubert s deliberate way purposely abstained from moralising on the many scenes of physical distress which he painted or whether he merely regarded them without emotion has been debated it seems more probable that he thought they carried their own moral it is the most sympathetic touch in roderick s character that he writes thus of his miserable crew of slaves our ship being freed from the disagreeable lading of negroes to whom indeed i had been miserable slave since our leaving the coast of guinea i began to enjoy smollett was physician and had the pitifulness of his profession though we see how casually he makes random touch on his own unwonted benevolence people had not begun to know the extent of their own brutality in the slave trade but smollett probably did know it if curious prophetic letter attributed to him and published more than twenty years after his death be genuine he had the strongest opinions about this form of commercial enterprise but he did not wear his heart on his sleeve where he wore his irritable nervous system it is probable enough that he felt the victims of poverty neglect and oppression despite his remarks on hospitals keenly dickens we might regard his of fensively ungrateful roderick purely dramatic exhibition of young man if his other heroes were not bad or worse if their few redeeming qualities were not stuck on in patches and if he had omitted his remark about roderick s modest on the other hand the good side of matthew bramble seems to be drawn from smollett s own character and if that be the case he can have had little sympathy with his own humorous barry l yndons scott and thackeray leaned to the favourable view smollett his nervous system apart was manly and kindly regards plot roderick random is mere string of picturesque adventures it is at the opposite pole from t om jones in the matter of construction there is reason why it should ever stop except the convenience of printers and binders perhaps we lay too much stress on the somewhat mechanical art of fielding was then setting the ﬁrst and best english example of craft in which the very greatest authors have been weak or of which they were careless smollett was always rather more incapable or rather more indif ferent in than greater men in our day of royalties and gossip about the gains of authors it would be interesting to know what manner and size of cheque smollett received from his publisher the celebrated mr osborne we not know but smollett published his next novel on commission printed the author so probably he was not well satisﬁed with the pecuniary result of roderick thereby says dr moore he acquired much more reputation than money so he now published the regicide by subscription that method of publication being then more reputable than it has been thought since 1797 of the regicide and its unlucky preface enough or more has been said the public sided with the managers not with the meritorious orphan the sake of pleasure or of new experiences or of economy smollett went to paris in 1750 where he met dr moore later his biographer the poetical dr akenside and an affected painter he introduced the poet and painter into peregrine pickle and makes slight use of group of exiled jacobites including mr hunter of burnside in 1750 there were jacobites enough in the french capital all wondering very much where prince charles might be and quite unconscious that he was their neighbour in convent in the rue dominique though moore does not say so he is provokingly economical of detail we may presume that smollett went wandering in flanders does peregrine pickle it is curious that he should introduce capucin jew and damsel all in the ghent diligence when we know that prince charles did live in ghent with the miss walkenshaw did go about disguised capucin and was tracked by jewish spy while the other spy young glengarry styled himself but all those events occurred about year after the novel was published in adventures among books https that date smollett had got an degree from aberdeen university and after returning from france he practised year or two at bath but he could not expect to be successful among fashionable invalids and in humphrey clinker he make matthew bramble give such an account of the bath waters zola might envy he was still trying to gain ground in his profession when in march 1751 mr wilson published the ﬁrst edition of peregrine pickle the author unnamed i have never seen this ﬁrst edition which was very curious and smollett in his preface to the second edition talks of the art and industry that were used to stiﬂe him in the birth by certain booksellers and he now reformed the manners and corrected the expressions removed or modiﬁed some passages of personal satire and held himself exempt from the numerous shafts of envy rancour and revenge that have lately both in private and public been levelled at his who were these base and pitiless dastards probably every one who did not write favourably about the book perhaps smollett suspected fielding whom he attacks in several parts of his works treating him kind of jonathan wild and an associate with thieves why smollett thus misconducted himself is problem unless he was either meanly jealous or had taken of fence at some remarks in fielding s newspaper smollett certainly began the war in the ﬁrst edition of peregrine he made kind of palinode to the trading justice later other people of his kind have done point in peregrine pickle easily assailed was the long episode about lady of quality the beautiful lady vane whose memoirs smollett introduced into his tale horace walpole found that she had omitted the only feature in her career of which she had just reason to be proud the number of her lovers nobody doubted that smollett was paid casting his mantle over lady vane moreover he might expect success of scandal the roman clef is always popular with but its authors can hardly hope to escape rebuke it was not till 1752 that lady mary wortley montagu in italy received peregrine with other fashionable pompey the little the parish girl eleanora s adventures the life of theresa constantia phipps the adventures of loveil and so on most of them contained portraits of real people and doubt most of them were therefore successful but where are they now lady mary thought lady vane s part of peregrine more instructive to young women than any sermon that i know she regarded fielding with congreve the only original of her age but fielding had to write bread and that is the most contemptible way of getting she did not at this time even know smollett s name but she admired him and later calls him my dear this lady thought that fielding did not know what sorry fellows his tom jones and captain booth were not near so sorry peregine pickle were they this gentleman is far more atrocious rufﬁan than roderick random none the less peregrine is smollett s greatest work nothing is so rich in variety of character scene and adventure we are carried along by the swift and copious volume of the current carried into very queer places and into the oddest miscellaneous company but we can not escape from smollett s vigorous grasp sir walter thought that roderick excelled its successor in ease and simplicity and that smollett s sailors in pickle border on doubt they the eccentricities of hawser trunnion are exaggerated and pipes is less subdued than rattlin though always delightful but trunnion absolutely makes one laugh out aloud whether he is criticising the sister of mr gamaliel pickle in that gentleman s presence at or riding to the altar with his squadron of sailors tacking in an unfavourable gale or being run away into pack of hounds and clearing hollow road over waggoner who views him with unspeakable terror and mr winkle an equestrian is not more entirely acceptable to the mind than trunnion we may speak of caricature but if an author can make us sob with laughter to criticise him solemnly is ungrateful except fielding occasionally and smollett and swift and sheridan and the authors of the rovers one does not remember any writers of the eighteenth century who quite upset the gravity of the reader the scene of the pedant s dinner after the manner of adventures among books https does not seem to myself so comic the adventures of trunnion while the bride is at the altar and the bridegroom is tacking and veering with his convoy about the ﬁelds one sees how the dinner is done with knowledge of athenæus juvenal petronius and horace many men could have written this set piece but trunnion is quite inimitable he is child of humour and of the highest spirits like mr weller the elder till scott created mause headrig caledonian had ever produced anything except tam shanter that could be pendant to trunnion his pathos is possibly just triﬂe overdone though that is not my own opinion dear trunnion he makes overlook the gambols of his detestable protégé the hero that scoundrel is not an impossible caricature of an obstinate vain cruel libertine peregrine was precisely the man to fall in love with emilia pour le bon motif and then attempt to ruin her though she was the sister of his friend by devices worthy of lovelace at his last and lowest stage peregrine s overwhelming vanity swollen by facile conquests would inevitably have degraded him to this abyss the intrigue was only the worst of those infamous practical jokes of his in which smollett takes cruel and unholy delight peregrine in fact is hero of naturalisme except that his ﬁts of generosity are mere patches daubed on and that his reformation is farce in which modern naturaliste would have disdained to indulge emilia in her scene with peregrine in the bouge to which he has carried her rises much above smollett s heroines and we could like her if she had never given behaviour which was beneath pardon peregrine s education at winchester bears out lord elcho s description of that academy in his lately published memoirs it was apt to develop peregrines and lord elcho himself might have furnished smollett with suitable adventures there can be doubt that cadwallader crabtree suggested sir malachi malagrowther to scott and that hatchway and pipes taking up their abode with peregrine in the fleet gave hint to dickens sam weller and mr pickwick in the same abode that peregrine does far excel joseph andrews and amelia scott declares few modern readers will admit the world could much better without peregrine than without joseph while amelia herself alone is study greatly preferable to the whole works of smollett such at least is the opinion of declared worshipper of that peerless lady yet peregrine is kind of odyssey of the eighteenth century an epic of humour and of adventure in february 1753 smollett obliged the town with his adventures of ferdinand count fathom cosmopolitan swindler and adventurer the book is smollett s barry lyndon yet his hero does not tell his own story but is perpetually held up dreadful example there is none of thackeray s irony none of his subtlety here is really bad man foreigner too smollett seems to say not be misled oh maidens by the wiles of such count impetuous youth play not with him at billiards basset or gleek fathers on such rogue shut your doors collectors handle not his nefarious antiques let all avoid the path and shun the example of ferdinand count fathom such is smollett s sermon but after all ferdinand is hardly worse than roderick or peregrine the son of terrible old sutler and robber and slayer of wounded men ferdinand had to live by his wits and he was hardly less scrupulous after all than peregrine and roderick the daubs of casual generosity were not laid on and that is all the dif ference sophia western was mistaken miss jenny cameron so ferdinand was arrested prince charles who in fact caused much inconvenience to harmless travellers people were often arrested the pretender s son abroad well in england the life and death of ferdinand s mother shot by wounded hussar in her moment of victory make perhaps the most original and interesting part of this hero s adventures the rest is much akin to his earlier novels but the history of rinaldo and monimia has passage not quite alien to the vein of radclif fe some remarks in the ﬁrst chapter show that smollett felt the censures on his brutality and lowness and he promises to seek that goal of perfection where nature is castigated almost even to still life where decency divested of all substance hovers about like fantastic shadow adventures among books https never reached that goal and even the shadow of decency never haunted him so to make him afraid with any amazement smollett avers that he has had the courage to call in question the talents of and so is char ged with insolence rancour and scurrility of all these things and of worse he had been guilty his of fence had never been limited to calling in question the talents of persons who had been unsuccessful in getting his play represented remonstrance merely irritated tobias his new novel was but fainter echo of his old novels panorama of scoundrelism with the melodramatic fortunes of the virtuous monimia foil if read it is read sketch of manners or want of manners the scene in which the bumpkin squire rooks the accomplished fathom at hazard in paris is prettily conceived and smollett s indignation at the british system of pews in church is edifying but when monimia appears to her lover he weeps at her tomb and proves to be phantom but warm and substantial monimia capable of being dished up like any other smollettian heroine the reader is sensibly annoyed tobias un romantique is absolutely too absurd not here oh tobias are haunts meet smollett s next novel sir launcelot greaves was not published till 1761 after it had appeared in numbers in the british magazine this was sixpenny serial published by newbery the years between 1753 and 1760 had been occupied by smollett in quarrelling getting imprisoned libel editing the critical review writing his history of england translating or adapting old translations of don quixote and driving team of literary hacks whose labours he superintended and to whom he gave weekly dinner these exploits are described by dr carlyle and by smollett himself in humphrey clinker he did not treat his vassals with much courtesy or consideration but then they expected such treatment we have right to talk of his doings method literary sweating like recent biographer of smollett not to speak of the oddly mixed metaphor we not know what smollett s relations to his retainers really were an editor he had to see his contributors the work of others he may have recommended reader to publishers others may have made transcripts him or translations that smollett sweated men or sucked their blood or both seems crude way of saying that he found them employment nobody says that johnson sweated the persons who helped him in compiling his dictionary or that mr jowett sweated the friends and pupils who aided him in his translation of plato authors have perfect right to procure literary assistance especially in learned books if they pay it and acknowledge their debt to their allies on the second point smollett was probably not in advance of his age sir launcelot greaves is according to chambers sorry specimen of the genius of the author and mr oliphant smeaton calls it decidedly the least popular of his novels while scott astonishes us by preferring it to jonathan certainly it is inferior to roderick random and to peregrine pickle but it can not be so utterly unreal the adventures of an i one venture to prefer sir launcelot to ferdinand count smollett was really trying an experiment in the fantastic just mr anstey guthrie transfers the mediæval myth of venus and the ring or the arabian tale of the geni or djinn into modern life so smollett transferred don quixote his hero young baronet of wealth and of benevolent and generous temper is crossed in love though not mad he is eccentric and commences scott and others object to his armour and say that in his ordinary clothes and with his purse he would have been more successful in righting wrongs certainly but then the comic fantasy of the armed knight arriving at the and jangling about the lanes among the astonished folk of town and country would have been lost smollett is certainly less unsuccessful in wild fantasy than in the ridiculous romantic scenes where the substantial phantom of monimia disports itself the imitation of the knight by the nautical captain crowe an excellent smollettian mariner is entertaining and sir launcelot s crusty sancho is pleasant variety in squires the various forms of oppression which the knight resists are of historical interest also is the contested election between rustic tory and smooth ministerialist sincerely attached to the protestant succession in detestation of popish an abjured and an outlawed pretender adventures among books https heroine aurelia darrel is more of lady and less of luxury than perhaps any other of smollett s women but how smollett makes love t ea was called the lovers were seated he looked and languished she ﬂushed and faltered all was doubt and delirium fondness and ﬂutter all was gas and gaiters said the insane lover of nickleby with equal delicacy and point scott says that smollett when on visit to scotland used to write his chapter of copy in the before the post went out scott was very capable of having the same thing happen to himself sir launcelot is hurriedly but vigorously written the fantasy was not understood smollett intended it to be and the book is blotted usual with loathsome medical details but people in madame du def fand s circle used openly to discuss the same topics to the confusion of horace walpole the hero of this book is generous gentleman the most of it is kind and manly and the humour provocative of an honest laugh it is by means to be despised while the manners if caricatured are based on fact it is curious to note that in sir launcelot greaves we ﬁnd character ferret who frankly poses strugforlifeur daudet s strugforlifeur had heard of darwin mr ferret had read hobbes learned that man was

in nothing and was ready to be w oman who our ancestors could be just advanced we are smollett went on compiling and supporting himself by his compilations and those of his vassals in 1762 he unluckily edited paper called the briton in the interests of lord bute the briton was silenced by wilkes s north briton smollett lost his last patron he fell ill his daughter died he travelled angrily in france and italy his t ravels show the choleric nature of the man and he was especially blamed not admiring the venus medici modern taste enlightened by the works of better period of greek art has come round to smollett s opinions but in his own day he was regarded vandal and heretic in 1764 he visited scotland and was warmly welcomed by his kinsman the laird of bonhill in 1769 he published the adventures of an atom stupid foul and scurrilous political satire in which lord bute having been his patron was lashed in smollett s usual style in 1768 smollett left england ever he desired consulship but consulship was found him which is not surprising he died at monte nova near leghorn in september others say october he had ﬁnished humphrey clinker which appeared day or two before his death thackeray thought humphrey clinker the most laughable book that ever was written certainly nobody is to be envied who does not laugh over the epistles of winifred jenkins the book is too well known analysis the family of matthew bramble are on their travels with his nephew and niece young melford and l ydia melford with miss jenkins and the squire s tart greedy and amorous old maid of sister tabitha bramble this lady s persistent amours and mean avarice scarcely strike modern readers amusing smollett gave aspects of his own character in the choleric kind benevolent matthew bramble

impression of smollett s virtues none has so few of his less amiable qualities with the cadet of bonhill outworn with living and with labour died the burly brawling picturesque old english novel of humour and of the road we have nothing notable in this manner before the arrival of mr pickwick an exception will scarcely be made in the interest of richard cumberland who scott says has occasionally become disgusting when he meant to be already walpole had begun the new gothic romance and the castle of otranto with miss burney s novels was to lead up to radclif fe and scott to miss edgeworth and miss austen chapter x thaniel hawthorne says somewhere that it is impossible to speak of the german perhaps he would not have allowed us to talk of the american classics american literature is too nearly contemporary time has not tried it but if america possesses classic author and i am not denying that she may have several that author is decidedly hawthorne his renown is unimpeached his

he never used at all on others he would dream and dream till the persons in the situations became characters and the thing was evolved into story thus he may have invented such problem this the ef fect of great sudden sin on simple and joyous nature and thence came all the substance of the marble faun t ransformation the original and germinal idea would naturally divide itself into another the protozoa reproduce themselves another idea was the ef fect of nearness to the great crime on pure and spotless nature hence the character of hilda in the preface to the scarlet letter hawthorne shows us how he tried by reﬂection and dream to warm the vague persons of the ﬁrst mere notion or hint into such life characters in romance inherit while he was in the civil service of his country in the custom house at salem he could not this he needed freedom he was dismissed by political opponents from ofﬁce and instantly he was himself again and wrote his most popular and perhaps his best book the evolution of his work was from the prime notion which he confessed that he loved best when strange to the short story and thence to the full and rounded novel all his work was leisurely all his language was picked though not with af fectation he did not strive to make style out of the use of odd words or of familiar words in odd places almost always he looked kind of spiritual medium seen through which his romances like the old manse in which he dwelt had not quite the aspect of belonging to the material the spiritual medium which he liked he was partly born into and partly he created it the child of race which came from england robust and puritanic he had in his veins the blood of those judges who burned witches and persecuted quakers his fancy is much inﬂuenced by the old fanciful traditions of providence of witchcraft of haunting indian magic scott s is inﬂuenced by legends of foray and feud by ballad and song and old wives tales and records of conspiracies tragic adventures and border wars like scott hawthorne lived in phantasy which returned to the romantic past wherein his ancestors had been notable men it is commonplace but an inevitable commonplace to add that he was ﬁlled with the idea of heredity with the belief that we are all only new combinations of our fathers that were before us this has been made into kind of doctrine by zola in the long series of his novels hawthorne treated it with more delicate and serener art in the house of the seven it is curious to mark hawthorne s attempts to break away from the man that heredity and circumstance and the divine gift of genius had made him he naturally haunts the mouldering lodges of the past but when he came to england where such lodges are abundant he was and he knew that long past with mysteries dark places malisons curses historic wrongs was the proper atmosphere of his art but kind of conscientious desire to be something other than something more ordinary and him thank heaven that his chosen atmosphere was rare in his native land he grumbled at it when he was in the midst of it he grumbled in england and how he grumbled in rome he permitted the american eagle to make her nest in his bosom with the customary inﬁrmity of temper that characterises this unhappy fowl he says in his essay the custom the general truculency of her attitude seems to threaten mischief to the inof fensive community of europe and especially of england and italy adventures among books https hawthorne travelled too late when his habits were too much ﬁxed it does not become englishmen to be angry because voyager is annoyed at not ﬁnding everything familiar and customary in lands which he only visits because they are strange this is an inconsistency to which english travellers are particularly prone but it is in hawthorne s case perhaps another instance of his conscientious attempts to be what he was not very much like other people his unexpected explosions of puritanism perhaps are caused by the sense of being too much himself he speaks of the squeamish love of the beautiful if the love of the beautiful were something unworthy of an citizen in some arts in painting and sculpture his taste was very far from being at home his italian journals especially prove in short he was an artist in community long most inartistic he could not what many of us ﬁnd very could not take beauty with gladness it comes neither shrinking from it immoral nor getting girlishly drunk upon it in the æsthetic fashion and screaming over it in an intoxication of surprise his tendency was to be rather shy and afraid of beauty pleasant but not immaculately respectable acquaintance or perhaps he was merely deferring to saxon public opinion possibly he was trying to wean himself from himself and from his own genius when he consorted with odd amateur socialists in and when he mixed at concord with the queer mortals most of whom took upon themselves to be important agents of the world s destiny yet were simple bores of very intense water they haunted mr emerson they haunted shelley and hawthorne had to see much of them but they neither made convert of him nor irritated him into resentment his kindness to the unfortunate miss delia bacon an early believer in the nonsense about bacon and shakespeare was model of manly and generous conduct he was indeed an admirable character and his goodness had the bloom on it of courteous and kindly nature that loved the muses but one has ventured to hint the development of his genius and taste was hampered now and then apparently by desire to put himself on the level of the general public and of their ideas this at least is how one explains to oneself various remarks in his prefaces journals and this may account the moral allegories which too weirdly haunt some of his short early pieces edgar poe in passage full of very honest and praise found fault with the allegorical business hutton from whose literary essays i borrow poe s opinion says poe boldly asserted that the conspicuously ideal scaf foldings of hawthorne s stories were but the monstrous fruits of the bad transcendental atmosphere which he breathed so but i hope this way of putting it is not poe ideal scaf foldings are odd enough but when scaffoldings turn out to be fruits of an atmosphere and monstrous fruits of bad transcendental atmosphere the brain reels in the fumes of mixed metaphors let him mend his pen cried poe get bottle of visible ink come out from the old manse cut alcott and in fact write about things less impalpable mr mallock s heroine preferred to be loved in more human sort of way hawthorne s way was never too ruddily and robustly human perhaps even in the scarlet letter we feel too distinctly that certain characters are moral conceptions not warmed and wakened out of the allegorical into the real the persons in an allegory may be real enough bunyan has proved by examples but that culpable cler gyman mr arthur dimmesdale with his lar ge white brow his melancholy eyes his hand on his heart and his general resemblance to the high church curate in thackeray s our street is he real to he seems very unworthy to be hester s lover she is beautiful woman of ﬂesh and blood mr dimmesdale was not only immoral he was unsportsmanlike he had more pluck than his miserable passion was degraded by its brevity how could he see this woman s disgrace seven long years and never pluck up heart either to share her shame or peccar forliter he is lay ﬁgure very cleverly but somewhat conventionally made and painted the vengeful husband of hester roger chillingworth is mr casaubon stung into jealous anger but his attitude watching ever by dimmesdale tormenting him and yet in his conﬁdence and ever unsuspected reminds one of conception dear to dickens he uses it in adventures among books https where mr micawber of all people plays this trick on uriah heep he uses it in hunted down he was about using it in edwin drood he used it old martin and pecksnif f in martin the person of roger chillingworth and his conduct are little too melodramatic hawthorne s genius in dickens s manner too is hawthorne s long sarcastic address to judge pyncheon in the house of the seven gables the judge sits dead in his chair with his watch ticking in his hand occasionally chance remark reminds one of dickens this example he is talking of lar ge black old books of divinity and of their successors tiny books elzevirs perhaps these little old volumes impressed if they had been intended very lar ge ones but had been unfortunately blighted at an early stage of their this might almost deceive the elect piece of the true boz their widely different talents did really intersect each other where the perverse the grotesque and the terrible dwell to myself the house of the seven gables has always appeared the most beautiful and attractive of hawthorne s novels he actually gives us love story and condescends to pretty heroine the curse of maule s blood is good old romantic idea terribly handled there is more of lightness and of cobwebby dusty humour in hepzibah pyncheon the decayed lady shopkeeper than hawthorne commonly cares to display you care the ﬁrst lover the photographer s young man it may be conventional prejudice but i seem to see him going about on tricycle and i don t think him the right person phoebe perhaps it is really the beautiful gentle oppressed clif ford who haunts one s memory most kind of tragic and thwarted harold skimpole how pleasant how delightful he murmured but not if addressing any one w ill it last how balmy the atmosphere through that open window an open window how beautiful that play of sunshine those ﬂowers how very fragrant that young girl s face how cheerful how blooming ﬂower with the dew on it and sunbeams in the dewdrops this comparison with skimpole may sound like an unkind criticism of clifford s character and place in the is only chance note of chance resemblance indeed it may be that hawthorne himself was aware of the resemblance an individual of clif ford s character he remarks can always be pricked more acutely through his sense of the beautiful and harmonious than through his and he suggests that if clifford had not been so long in prison his æsthetic zeal might have eaten out or ﬁled away his af this was what befell harold in prisons often coavinses the judge pyncheon of the tale is also masterly study of swaggering respectability and then in addition to all the poetry of his style and the charm of his haunted air hawthorne favours us with brave conclusion of the good sort the old sort they come into money they marry they are happy ever after this is doing things handsomely though some of our modern novelists think it coarse and degrading hawthorne did not think so and they are not exactly better artists than hawthorne yet he too had his economies which we resent i not mean his not telling us what it was that roger chillingworth saw on arthur dimmesdale s bare breast to leave that vague is quite legitimate but what had miriam and the spectre of the catacombs done who was the spectre what did he want to have told all this would have been better than to ﬁll the novel with padding about rome sculpture and the ethics of art the silly saying runs the people has right to know about miriam and her ghostly acquaintance 10 but the marble faun is not of hawthorne s best period beautiful are hundred passages in the tale beautiful passages are common in his prose gold in the richest quartz how excellent are his words on the ﬁrst faint but certain breath of autumn in the air felt perhaps early in july and then came autumn with his immense burthen of apples dropping them continually from his overladen shoulders he trudged keats might have written so of autumn in the keats had been writing adventures among books https are geniuses more sunny large and glad than hawthorne s none more original more surefooted in his own realm of moonlight and twilight chapter xi the p aradise of poets we were talking of love constancy the ideal who ever loved like the poets cried lady violet lebas her pure pale cheek ﬂushing ah if ever i am to love he shall be singer tenors are popular very said lord walter i mean poet she answered witheringly near them stood mr witham the author of heart s chords ah said he that reminds i have been trying to catch it all the morning that reminds of my tell us your dream murmured lady violet lebas and he told it it was through an unfortunate but pardonable blunder said mr witham that i died and reached the paradise of poets i had indeed published volumes of verse but with the most blameless motives other poets were continually sending theirs and i could not admire them and did not like to reply by critical remarks i simply printed some rhymes the purpose of sending them to the gentlemen who favoured with theirs i always wrote on the quotation from the iliad about giving copper in exchange gold and the few poets who could read greek were gratiﬁed while the others probably thought compliment was intended nothing could be less culpable or pretentious but through some mistake on the part of charon i was drafted of f to the paradise of poets outside the golden gate number of shadows were waiting in dif ferent attitudes of depression and languor bavius and maevius were there still complaining of cliques railing at horace mere rhymer of society and at virgil plagiarist t ake away his cribs from homer and apollonius rhodius quoth honest maevius and what is there left of him i also met society of gentlemen in greek costume of various ages from minstrel with tortoiseshell lyre in his hand to an elegant of the age of pericles they all consorted together talking various dialects of aeolic ionian attic greek and so forth which were plainly not intelligible to each other i ventured to ask one of the company who he was but he with sweep of his hand said w are homer when i expressed my regret and surprise that the golden gate had not yet opened so distinguished though collective an artist my friend answered that according to fick peppmüller and many other learned men they were homer but an impostor from chios has got in somehow he said they don t pay the least attention to the germans in the paradise of at this moment the golden gates were thrown apart and fair lady in an early italian costume carrying laurel in her hand appeared at the entrance all the shadows looked up with an air of weary expectation like people waiting their turn in doctor s she beckoned to however and i made haste to follow her the words charlatan y poet in variety of languages greeted by way of farewell from the shadows the renowned laura if i am not mistaken i ventured to remark recognising her indeed from the miniature in the laurentian library at florence she bowed and i began to ask her adorer adventures among books https excuse said laura we glided down mossy path under the shade of trees particularly dear to poets excuse but the sonneteer of whom you speak is one whose name i can not bear to mention his conduct with burns s clarinda his heartless infatuation you astonish i said in the paradise of they are poets answered the lady then slightly raising her voice of silver beautiful appearance in toga drew near she cried catullo mio the greeting between these accomplished ghosts was too kindly to leave room doubt to the ardour of their af fections will you my catullus murmured laura explain to this poet from the land of fogs any matters which to him may seem puzzling and unfamiliar in our paradise the veronese with charming smile took my hand and led to shadowy arbour whence we enjoyed prospect of many rivers and mountains in the poets heaven among these i recognised the triple crest of the eildons grongar hill cithaeron and etna while the waters of the mincius ﬂowed musically between the banks and braes bonny doon to join the tweed blithe ghosts were wandering by in all varieties of apparel and i distinctly observed dante s beatrice leaning loving on the arm of sir philip sidney while dante was closely engaged in conversation with the lost lenore celebrated by mr edgar allan poe in what can my knowledge of the paradise of poets be serviceable to you sir said catullus he ﬂung himself at the feet of laura on the velvet grass i am disinclined to seem impertinently curious i answered but the ladies in this fair smiling the gods made them poetical not generally replied catullus indeed if you would be well with them i may warn you never to mention poetry in their hearing they never cared it while on earth and in this place it is topic which the prudent carefully avoid among ladies to tell the truth they have had to listen to far too much poetry and too many discussions on the caesura there are indeed few lady few sappho example indeed i can not recall any other at this moment the result is that phaon of all the shadows here is the most distinguished by the fair he was not poet you know he got in on account of sappho who adored him they are estranged now of you interest deeply i answered and now will you kindly tell why these ladies are here if they were not poets the women that were our ideals while we dwelt on earth the women we loved but never won or at all events never wedded they whom we sighed while in the arms of recognised and legitimate af fection have been chosen by the olympians to keep us company in paradise then wherefore i interrupted i see robert burns loitering with that lady in ruf f i make s cassandra and why is the incomparable clarinda inseparable from petrarch and miss patty blount pope s ﬂame from the syrian meleager while his heliodore is manifestly devoted to mr emerson whom by the way i am delighted if rather surprised to see here ah said catullus you are among us poets will be poets and sooner have they attained their desire and dwelt in the company of their earthly ideals than they feel strangely yet irresistibly drawn to another so it was in life so it will ever be ideal can survive daily companionship and fortunate is the poet who did not marry his ﬁrst love far that goes i answered most of you were highly favoured indeed i not remember any poet whose ideal was his wife or whose ﬁrst love led him to the altar adventures among books https i was not marrying man myself answered the veronese few of us were myself horace were all and lesbia i said this in low voice laura was weaving bay into chaplet and inattentive to our conversation poor lesbia said catullus with suppressed sigh how i misjudged that girl how cruel how causeless were my reproaches and wildly rending his curled locks and laurel crown he ﬂed into thicket whence there soon arose the melancholy notes of the ausonian he is incorrigible said laura very coldly and she deliberately began to tear and toss away the fragments of the chaplet she had been weaving i shall never break him of that habit of versifying but they are all is there nobody here said i who is happy with his but has exchanged ideals with some other poet there is one she said he comes of northern tribe and in his he never rhymed upon his unattainable lady or if rhyme he did the accents never carried her name to the ears of the vulgar look she pointed to the river at our feet and i knew the mounted ﬁgure that was riding the ford with lady beside him like the fairy queen surely i had read of her and knew she whose blue eyes their secret told though shaded by her locks of they are dif ferent i know not why they are constant said laura and rising with an air of chagrin she disappeared among the boughs of the trees that bear her name unhappy hearts of poets i mused light things and sacred they are but even in their paradise and among their chosen with every wish fulﬁlled and united to their beloved they can not be at rest thus moralising i wended my way to crag whence there was wide prospect certain poets were standing there looking down into an abyss and to them i joined myself ah i can not bear it said voice and he turned away his brow already clearing his pain already gotten i beheld the august form of shakespeare marking my curiosity before it was expressed he answered the unuttered question that is sight pagans he said and may give them pleasure but my paradise were embittered if i had to watch the sorrows of others and their torments however well deserved the others are gazing on the pur gatory of critics and he passed from and i joined the ionian father of the rest who with countenance of unspeakable majesty was seated on throne of rock between the mantuan virgil of the laurel crown hugo sophocles milton lovelace tennyson and shelley at their feet i beheld in vast and gloomy hall many an honest critic many an erudite commentator an army of reviewers some were condemned to roll logs up insuperable heights whence they descended thundering to the plain others were set to impositions and i particularly observed that the homeric commentators were obliged to write out the iliad and odyssey in their complete shape and were always driven by ﬁends to the task when they prayed the bare charity of being permitted to leave out adventures among books https others fearful to narrate were torn into many fragments they had made of these immortal epics others such aristarchus were spitted on their own critical signs of disapproval many reviewers were compelled to read the books which they had criticised without perusal and it was terrible to watch the agonies of the worthy pressmen who were set to this unwonted task may we not be let of f with the preface they cried in piteous accents may we not glance at the table of contents and be done with it but the presiding demons who had been examiners in the bodily life drove them remorseless to their toils among the condemned i could not but witness with sympathy the punishment reserved translators the translators of virgil in particular were vast and motley assemblage of most respectable men bishops were there from gawain douglas downwards judges in their ermine professors cler gymen civil servants writhing in all the tortures that the blank verse the anapaestic measure the metre of the lay of the last minstrel the heroic couplet and similar devices can inﬂict all these men had loved virgil though not wisely and now their penance was to hear each other read their own that must have been more than they could bear said lady violet yes said mr witham i should know down i fell into tartarus with crash and writhed among the why asked lady violet because i have translated theocritus mr witham said lady violet did you meet your ideal woman when you were in the paradise of poets she yet walks this earth said the bard with too signiﬁcant bow lady violet turned coldly away witham was never invited to the blues name of lord azure s place in kent the poet is shut out of paradise chapter xii p aris and helen the ﬁrst name in romance the most ancient and the most enduring is that of argive helen during three thousand years fair women have been born have lived and been loved that there might be song in the ears of men of later time but compared to the renown of helen their glory is dim cleopatra who held the world s fate in her hands and lay in the arms of cæsar mary stuart maria v erticor dia whose sake northern novelist tells peasants have lain awake sorrowing that she is dead agnes sorel fair rosamond la belle stuart the pompadour and the parabère can still enchant us from the page of history and chronicle zeus gave them beauty which naturally rules even strength itself to quote the greek orator on the mistress of them all on her who having never lived can never die the daughter of the swan while helen enjoys this immortality and is the ideal of beauty upon earth it is curious to reﬂect on the modernité of her story the oldest of the love stories of the world in homer we ﬁrst meet her the fairest of women in the song of the greatest of poets it might almost seem if homer meant to justify by his dealing with helen some of the most recent theories of literary art in the iliad and odyssey the tale of helen is without adventures among books https and without an end like frieze on greek temple she crosses the stage ﬁgure familiar to all the poet s audience clearly did not need to be told who helen was nor anything about her youth the famous judgment of paris the beginning of evil to achaeans and ilian men is only mentioned once by homer late and in passage of doubtful authenticity of her reconciliation to her wedded lord menelaus not word is said of her end we are told more than that her and him mansion in elysium is where falls not hail or rain or any snow we leave her happy in argos smile on her lips gift in her hands we met her in troy beautiful adored despite her guilt sweet in her repentance in her unvexed argive home women seldom mention her in the epic but with horror and anger men never address her but in gentle courtesy what is her secret how did she leave her home with by love by magic or driven by the implacable aphrodite homer is silent on all of these things these things doubtless were known by his audience in his poem helen moves thing of simple grace courtesy and kindness save when she rebels against her doom after seeing her lover ﬂy from her husband s spear had we only homer by far our earliest literary source we should know little of the romance of helen should only know that lawless love brought ruin on troy and sorrow on the achaeans and this is thrown out with moral comment without praise or blame the end we learn was peace and beauty was reconciled to life there is explanation dénouement and we know how much dénouement and explanations hampered scott and shakespeare from these trammels homer is free god is free from mortal limitations all this manner of telling manner so ancient so akin in practice to recent theories of what art should be and what art seldom is perhaps never is in modern hands modern enough again is the choice of married woman the heroine of the earliest love tale apollonius rhodius sings and man has ever sung so well of maiden s love virgil of widow s homer of love that has deﬁed law blindly obedient to destiny which dominates even zeus once again helen is not very young girl ungallant chronologists have attributed to her i know not what age we think of her about the age of the venus of milo in truth she was ageless and homer never describes her beauty we only see it reﬂected in the eyes of the old men white and weak cicalas but hers is loveliness to turn an old man it is marvel they say that her sake trojans and achaeans slay each other she was embroidering at vast web working in gold and scarlet the sorrows that her sake befell mankind when they called her to the walls to see paris ﬁght menelaus in the last year of the war there she stands in raiment of silvery white her heart yearning her old love and her own city already her thought is far from paris was her heart ever with paris that is her secret very old legend mentioned by the bishop of thessalonica eustathius tells us that paris magically beguiled her disguised in the form of menelaus her lord uther beguiled ygerne she sees the son of priam play the dastard in the ﬁght she turns in wrath on aphrodite who would lure her back to his arms but to his arms she must go the daughter of zeus was violence is put upon beauty it is soiled or seems soiled in its way through the world helen ur ges paris again into the war he has heart invincibly light and gay shame does not weigh on him not every man is valiant every day he says yet once engaged in battle he bears him bravely and his arrows rain death among the achaeans what homer thinks of paris we can only guess his beauty is the bane of ilios but homer gives so much to beauty in the end of the iliad helen sings the immortal dirge over hector the stainless knight with thy loving kindness and thy gentle adventures among books https the odyssey she is at home again playing the gracious part of hostess to odysseus s wandering son pouring into the bowl the magic herb of egypt which brings forgetfulness of sorrow the wandering son of odysseus departs with gift his bride to wear upon the day of her desire memorial of the hands of helen the beautiful hands that in troy or argos were never idle of helen from homer we know more grace penitence in exile peace at home these are the portion of her who set east and west at war and ruined the city of priam of the ashen spear in the strange legend preserved by servius the commentator on virgil who tells us that helen wore red star whence fell gouts of blood that vanished ere they touched her swan s neck so all the blood shed her sake leaves helen stainless of homer s helen we know more the later greek fancy playing about this form of beauty wove myriad of new fancies or disinterred from legend old beliefs untouched by homer helen was the daughter of the is was later explained of zeus in the shape of swan her loveliness even in childhood plunged her in many adventures theseus carried her of f her brothers rescued her all the princes of achaea competed her hand having ﬁrst taken an oath to avenge whomsoever she might choose her husband the choice fell on the correct and honourable but rather inconspicuous menelaus and they dwelt in sparta beside the eurotas in hollow of the rifted then from across the sea came the beautiful and fatal paris son of priam king of troy child paris had been exposed on the mountains because his mother dreamed that she brought forth ﬁrebrand he was rescued and fostered by shepherd he tended the ﬂocks he loved the daughter of river god œnone then came the naked goddesses to seek at the hand of the most beautiful of mortals the prize of beauty aphrodite won the golden apple from the queen of heaven hera and from the goddess of war and wisdom athena bribing the judge by the promise of the fairest wife in the world incident is more frequently celebrated in poetry and art to which it lends such gracious opportunities paris was later recognised of the royal blood of troy he came to lacedaemon on an embassy he saw helen and destiny had its way concerning the details in this most ancient we learn nothing from homer who merely makes paris remind helen of their bridal night in the isle of cranaë but from homer we learn that paris carried of f not only the wife of menelaus but many of his treasures to the poet of the iliad the psychology of the wooing would have seemed simple matter like the later he would have shown us paris beside helen aphrodite standing near accompanied by the ﬁgure of homer always escapes our psychological problems by throwing the weight of our deeds and misdeeds on god or goddess or on destiny to have ﬂed from her lord and her one child hermione was not in keeping with the character of helen homer draws it her repentance is almost christian in its expression and repentance indicates consciousness of sin and of shame which helen frequently professes thus she at least does not like homer in his chivalrous way throw all the blame on the immortals and on destiny the cheerful acquiescence of helen in destiny makes part of the comic element in la belle hélène but the mirth only arises out of the incongruity between parisian ideas and those of ancient greece helen is freely and bitterly blamed in the odyssey by penelope chieﬂy because of the ruinous consequences which followed her ﬂight still there is one passage when penelope prudently hesitates about recognising her returned lord which makes it just possible that legend chronicled by eustathius was known to homer the tale already mentioned that paris beguiled her in the shape of menelaus the incident is very old in the story of zeus and amphitryon and might be used whenever lady s character needed to be saved but this anecdote on the whole is inconsistent with the repentance of helen and is not in homer s manner the early lyric poet stesichorus is said to have written harshly against helen she punished him by blindness and he indited palinode explaining that it was not she adventures among books https to troy but woman fashioned in her likeness by zeus out of mist and light the real helen remained safely and with honour in egypt euripides has made this idea which was calculated to please him the groundwork of his helena but it never had strong hold on the greek imagination modern fancy is pleased by the picture of the in troy greeks and trojans dying phantasm shadows we are and shadows we concerning the later feats and the death of paris homer says very little he slew achilles by an in the scaean gate and prophecy was fulﬁlled he himself fell by another shaft perhaps the poisoned shaft of philoctetes in the fourth or ﬁfth century of our late poet quintus smyrnaeus described paris s journey in quest of healing spell to the forsaken œnone and her refusal to aid him her death on his funeral pyre quintus is poet of extraordinary merit his age and scarcely deserves the reproach of laziness afﬁxed on him by lord tennyson on the whole homer seems to have kind of liking the beautiful paris later art represents him bowman of girlish charms wearing phrygian cap there is late legend that he had son corythus by œnone and that he killed the lad in moment of jealousy ﬁnding him with helen and failing to recognise him on the death of paris perhaps by virtue of the custom of the levirate helen became the wife of his brother deïphobus how her reconciliation with menelaus was brought about we not learn from homer who in the odyssey accepts it fact the earliest traditional hint on the subject is given by the famous cof fer of cypselus work of the seventh century which pausanias saw at olympia in here on band of ivory was represented among other scenes from the tale of troy menelaus rushing sword in hand to slay helen according to stesichorus the army was about to stone her after the fall of ilios but relented amazed by her beauty of her later life in lacedaemon nothing is known on really ancient authority and later traditions vary the spartans showed her sepulchre and her shrine at therapnae where she was worshipped herodotus tells us how helen goddess appeared in her temple and healed deformed child making her the fairest woman in sparta in the reign of ariston it may perhaps be conjectured that in sparta helen occupied the place of local aphrodite in another late story she dwells in the isle of leuke shadowy bride of the shadowy achilles the mocking lucian in his vera historia meets helen in the fortunate islands whence she elopes with one of his companions again the sons of menelaus by concubine were said to have driven helen from sparta on the death of her lord and she was murdered in rhodes by the vengeance of polyxo whose husband fell at troy but among all these inventions that of homer stands out helen and menelaus not die they are too near akin to zeus they dwell immortal not among the shadows of heroes and of famous ladies dead and gone but in elysium the paradise at the world s end unvisited by storms beyond these voices there is it is plain that the tale of paris and helen must to modern readers seem meagre to greece in every age the main interest lay not in the passion of the beautiful pair but in its consequences the clash of europe and asia the deaths of kings the ruin wrought in their homes the consequent fall of the great and ancient achaean civilisation to the greeks the trojan war was what the crusades are in later history in the crusades the west assailed the east an ideal not to recover the holy sepulchre of our religion but to win back the living type of beauty and of charm perhaps ere the sun grows cold men will more believe in the crusades an historical fact than we in the siege of troy in sense very obvious sense the myth of helen is parable of hellenic history they sought beauty and they found it they bore it home and with beauty their bane wherever helen went she brought calamity in this type of all the famous and peerless ladies of old days of cleopatra and of adventures among books https romance and poetry have nothing less plausible than the part which cleopatra actually played in the history of the world world well lost by mark antony her sake the ﬂight from actium might seem much mere poet s dream the gathering of the achaeans at aulis if we were not certain that it is truly chronicled from the earliest times even from times before homer whose audience is supposed to know all about helen the imagination of greece and later the imagination of the civilised world has played around helen devising about her all that possibly could be devised she was the daughter of zeus by nemesis or by leda or the daughter of the swan or child of the changeful moon brooding on the formless and she could speak in the voices of all women hence she was named echo and we might fancy that like the witch of the brocken she could appear to every man in the likeness of his own ﬁrst love the ancient egyptians either knew her or invented legends of her to amuse the inquiring greeks she had touched at sidon and perhaps astaroth is only her sidonian name whatever could be told of beauty in its charm its perils the dangers with which it surrounds its lovers the purity which it retains unsmirched by all the sins that are done beauty s sake could be told of helen like golden cup paul victor says she was carried from lips to lips of heroes but the gold remains unsullied and unalloyed to heaven she returns again to heaven which is her own and looks down serenely on men slain and women widowed and sinking ships and burning towns yet with death she gives immortality by her kiss and paris and menelaus live because they have touched the lips of helen through the grace of helen whom he fell sarpedon s memory endures and achilles and memnon the son of the morning and troy is more imperishable than carthage or rome or corinth though helen burnt the topless towers of in one brief passage marlowe did more than all poets since stesichorus or at least since the epithalamium of theocritus the glory of helen roman poets knew her best an enemy of their fabulous ancestors and in the æneid virgil s hero draws his sword to slay her through the middle ages in the romances of troy she wanders shining shadow of the ideally fair like guinevere who so often recalls her in the arthurian romances the chivalrous mediæval poets and the celts could understand better than the romans the philosophy of the world well lost love modern poetry even in goethe s second part of faust has not been very fortunately inspired by helen except in the few lines which she speaks in the dream of fair i had great beauty ask thou not my william morris s helen in the earthly paradise charms at the time of reading but perhaps leaves little abiding memory the helen of t roilus and cressida is not one of shakespeare s immortal women and mr rossetti s ballad is fantastic and somewhat false in romantic pastiche where euripides twice failed in the t roades and the helena it can be given to few to succeed helen is best left to her earliest known minstrel who can recapture the grace the tenderness the melancholy and the charm of the daughter of zeus in the odyssey and iliad the sightless eyes of homer saw her clearest and helen was best understood by the wisdom of his unquestioning simplicity if to prove how entirely though so many hands paltered with her legend helen is homer s alone there remains great or typical work of greek art which represents her beauty and the breasts from which were modelled cups of gold the service of the gods we have only paintings on vases or work on gems which though graceful is conventional and might represent any other heroine polyxena or eriphyle helen from the hands of phidias or scopas has survived to our time and the grass may be growing in therapnae over the shattered remains of her only adventures among

setting suns chapter xiii enchanted cigarettes to dream over literary projects balzac says is like smoking enchanted cigarettes but when we try to tackle our projects to make them real the enchantment disappears we have to till the soil to sow the seed to gather the leaves and then the cigarettes must be manufactured while there may be market them after all probably most people have enjoyed the fragrance of these enchanted cigarettes and have brooded over much which they will never put on paper here are some of the ashes of the weeds of my delight of romances whereof single line is written or is likely to be written of my earliest novel i remember but little i know there had been wreck and that the villain who was believed to be drowned came home and made himself disagreeable i know that the heroine s mouth was not too lar ge regular beauty in that respect she was original all heroines are d i know not why it is expected of them i know she was melancholy and merry it would not surprise to learn that she drowned herself from canoe but the villain never descended to crime the ﬁrst lover would not fall in love the heroine s own af fections were provokingly disengaged and the whole af fair came to dead stop want of plot perhaps considering modern canons of ﬁction this might have been very successful novel it was entirely devoid of incident or interest and consequently was good deal like real life real life appears to many cultivated authors on the other hand all the characters were ﬂippant this would never have done and i not regret novel which had not even name the second story had plot quantities of plot nothing but plot it was to have been written in collaboration with very great novelist who far we went conﬁned himself to making objections this novel was stopped not that my friend would ever have gone on by called back which anticipated part of the idea the story was entitled where is rose and the motto rosa quo locorum sera moratur the characters 1 rose young lady of quality 2 the russian princess her friend need i add that to meet public demand her name was vera 3 young man engaged to rose 4 charles his friend 5 an enterprising person named the whiteley of crime the universal provider of iniquity in fact he anticipated sir arthur doyle s professor moriarty the rest were detectives old ladies mob and wealthy young colonial larrikin neither my friend nor i was fond of describing love scenes so we made the heroine disappear in the second chapter and she never turned up again till chapter the last after playing in comedy at the house of an earl rosa and vera entered her brougham soon afterwards the brougham drew up empty at rose s own door where was rose traces of her were found of all places in the haunted house in berkeley square which is not haunted any longer after that rose was long sought in vain this brieﬂy is what had occurred russian detective wanted vera who to be sure was nihilist to catch vera he made an alliance with the whiteley of he was man who would destroy parish register or ge will or crack crib or break up meeting or burn house or kidnap rightful heir or manage personation or issue amateur or what you please thinking to kill two adventures among books https one stone he carried of f rose her diamonds and vera his friend the muscovite police ofﬁcial lodging them both in the haunted house but there he and the russian came to blows and in the confusion vera made her escape while rose was conveyed vera to siberia not knowing how to dispose of her the russian police consigned her to nunnery at the mouth of the obi her lover in yacht found her and got friendly nun to give her some narcotic known to the samoyeds it was the old truc of the friar in romeo and at the mouth of the obi they not bury the dead but lay them down on platforms in the open air rose was picked up there by her lover accompanied by chaperon of course was got on board the steam yacht and all went well i get what happened to the whiteley of after him i still rather was humorous rufﬁan something could be made of the whiteley of something has been made by the author of sherlock in yet another romance gentleman takes his friend in country place to see his betrothed the friend who had only come into the neighbourhood that day is found dead next morning hanging to tree gipsies and others are suspected but the lover was the murderer he had been priest in south america and the lady was catholic who knew not of his orders now the friend fell in love with the lady at ﬁrst sight on being introduced to her by the lover the two men walked home the friend threatened to reveal the lover s would be fatal to his hopes they quarrelled parted and the lassoed his friend the motive i think is an original one and not likely to occur to the ﬁrst comer the inventor is open to of fers the next novel based on dream was called in search of what is qrart i decline to divulge this secret beyond saying that qrart was product of the civilisation which now sleeps under the snows of the pole it was an article of the utmost value to humanity farther i not intend to commit myself the bride of god was one of the characters the next novel is at present my favourite cigarette the scene is partly in greece partly at the parthian court about crassus is the villain the heroine was an actress in one of the wandering greek companies splendid strollers who played at the indian and asiatic courts the story ends with the representation of the bacchae in parthia the head of pentheus is carried by one of the bacchae in that drama behold it is not mask but the head of crassus and thus conveys the ﬁrst news of the roman defeat obviously this is novel that needs great deal of preliminary study much indeed another story will deal with the icelandic discoverers of america mr kipling however has taken the wind out of its sails with his sketch the finest story in the there are all the marvels and portents of the eyrbyggja saga to draw upon there are skraelings to ﬁght and why should not karlsefni s son kill the last mastodon and quetzalcoatl be the god of the aztecs after that romance on the intrigues to make charles edward king of poland sounds commonplace but much might be made of that too if the right man took it in hand believe there are plenty of stories left waiting the man who can tell them i have said it before but i say it again if i were king i would keep court ofﬁcials mr stanley weyman mr mason mr kipling and others to tell my own stories i know the kind of thing which i like from the discovery of qrart to that of the french gold in the burn at loch arkaig or in the wood by the lochside that murray of broughton mentions another cigarette i have the adventures of poet poet born in puritan village of massachusetts about hawthorne could have told my story and how my friend was driven into the wilderness and lived among the red men i think he was killed in an attempt to warn his countrymen of an indian raid i think his poems have hole through them and blood on the leaves they were in carew s best manner these adventures among books https tale hawthorne might have told the tale of an excellent man whose very virtues by some baneful moral chemistry corrupt and ruin the people with whom he comes in contact i not mean by goading them into the opposite extremes but rather something like moral jettatura this needs great deal of subtlety and what is to become of the hero is he to plunge into vice till everybody is virtuous again it wants working out i have omitted after all schoolboy historical romance explaining why queen elizabeth was never married scottish paper of fered prize story of queen mary stuart s reign i did not get the did not deserve it but my story ran thus you must know that queen elizabeth was singularly like darnley in personal appearance what so natural that disguised page her majesty should come spying about the court of holyrood darnley sees her walking out of queen mary s room he thinks her an hallucination discovers that she is real challenges her and they ﬁght at faldonside by the tweed shakespeare holding elizabeth s horse elizabeth is wounded and is carried to the kirk of field and laid in darnley s chamber while darnley goes out and makes love to my rural heroine the lady of fernilee kerr that night bothwell blows up the kirk of field elizabeth and all darnley has only one resource borrowing the riding habit of the rural heroine the lady of fernilee he ﬂees across the border and the rest of his life personates queen elizabeth that is why elizabeth who was darnley hated mary so bitterly on account of the kirk of field affair and that is why queen elizabeth was never married on shakespeare s sonnets were obviously cast the young man whom shakespeare admired so and ur ged to marry this romance did not get the prize the anachronism about shakespeare is worthy of scott but i am conceited enough to think it deserved an honourable mention enough of my own cigarettes but there are others of more fragrant weed who will end the novel of which byron only wrote chapter who bulwer l ytton is dead ﬁner opening one more mysteriously stirring you can nowhere read and the novel in letters which scott began in 1819 who shall ﬁnish it or tell us what he did with his fair venetian courtezan character so much out of sir walter s way he tossed it was but an enchanted gave us the fortunes of nigel in its place i want both we can not call up those who left half told these stories in happier world we shall listen to their endings and all our dreams shall be coherent and concluded meanwhile without trouble and expense and disappointment and reviews we can all smoke our cigarettes of fairyland would that many people were content to smoke them peacefully and did not rush on pen paper and ink chapter xiv stories and st from stra th ver we have had drought three weeks during whole week this northern strath has been sunny the riviera is expected to be the streams can be crossed kelts are plunging in the pools but even kelts will not look at ﬂy now by way of pleasant change an icy north wind is blowing with gusts of snow not snow enough to swell the loch that feeds the river but just enough snow the tourist said of the water in the river styx to swear by or at the field announces that duke who rents three rods on neighbouring river has not yet caught one salmon the acrimoniously democratic mind may take comfort in that intelligence but if the weather will not improve duke it is not likely to change mere person of letters thus the devotee of the muses is driven back by stress of climate upon literature and there is nothing in the lodge to read he is compelled to write now certainly one would not lack material if only one were capable of the art of ﬁction the genesis of novels and stories is topic little studied but i am inclined to believe adventures among books https the pearls in the mussels of the river ﬁction is beautiful disease of the brain something an incident or an experience or reﬂection gets imbedded incrusted in the properly constituted mind and becomes the nucleus of pearl of romance mr marion crawford in recent work describes his hero who is novelist at work this young gentleman by series of faults or misfortunes has himself become centre of harrowing emotion two young ladies to each of whom he has been betrothed are weeping out their eyes him or are kneeling to heaven with despairing cries or are hardening their hearts to marry men whom they not care the hero s aunt has committed crime everybody in fact is in despair when an idea occurs to the hero indif ferent to the sorrows of his nearest and dearest he sits down with his notion and writes like person possessed he has the proper kind of brain the nucleus has been dropped into it the pearl begins to grow and to assume prismatic hues so he is happy and even the angler might be happy if he could write novel in the absence of salmon unluckily my brain is not capable of this æsthetic malady and to save my life or to milk ﬁne warm cow rain the zulus say i could not write novel or even short story about the short story they call it with capital letters our critical american cousins have much to say its germ one fancies is usually an incident or mere anecdote according to the nature of the author s brain this germ becomes either the pearl of brief conte or the seed of stately tree in three volumes an author of experience soon ﬁnds out how he should treat his material one writer informs that given the idea the germinal idea it is easy him to make novel out of it easy and much more satisfactory and remunerative others like guy maupassant example seem to ﬁnd their strength in brevity in cutting down not in amplifying in selecting and reducing not in allowing other ideas to group themselves round the ﬁrst other characters to assemble about those who are essential that seems to be really the whole philosophy of this matter concerning which so many words are expended the growth of the germinal idea depends on the nature of an author s may excel in expansion or in reduction he may be economical and out of an anecdote may spin the whole cocoon of romance or he may be extravagant and give capable idea away in the briefest form possible these ideas may come to man in many ways we said from dream from fragmentary experience most experiences in life are fragmentary from hint in newspaper from tale told in conversation not long ago example i heard an anecdote out of which guy maupassant could have made the most ghastly the most squalid and the most supernaturally moving of all his contes indeed that is not saying much he did not excel in the supernatural were it written in french it might lie in my lady s chamber and times go nobody would be shocked but by our curious british conventions this tale can not be told in an english book or magazine it was not in its tendency immoral those terrible tales never are the events were rather calculated to frighten the hearer into the paths of virtue when mr richard cameron the founder of the cameronians and the godfather of the cameronian regiment was sent to his parish he was bidden by mr peden to put to the tails of his congregation this vigorous expression was well ﬁtted to describe the conte which i have in my mind i rather wish i had it not and which is not to be narrated here nor in english combination of pity and terror it seemed to unmatched in the works of the modern fancy or in the horrors of modern experience whether in experience or in imagination it had its original source but even the english authors who plume themselves on their audacity or their realism or their contempt the young person would not venture this little romance much less then is timidly uncorrect likely to tempt mr mudie with the conte it is one of two tales both told true which one would like to be able to narrate in the language of molière the other is also very good and has wonderful scene with corpse and chapelle ar dente and young lady it is historical and of the last generation but one even our frozen strath here has its modern legend which may be told in english and out of which i am sure novelist could make good short story or pleasant adventures among books https of romance what is the mysterious art by which these things are done what makes the story seem real rich with life actual engrossing it is the secret of genius of the novelist s art and the writer who can not practise the art might well try to discover the philosopher s stone or to harp ﬁsh out of the water however let tell the legend simply may be and it was told to the strath runs due north the river ﬂowing from great loch to the northern sea all around are low undulating hills brown with heather and lonely almost the sahara on the horizon to the south rise the mountains ben this and ben that real mountains of beautiful outline though higher than some three thousand feet before the country was divided into moors and forests tenanted by makers of patent corkscrews and boilers of patent soap before the rivers were distributed into beats marked of f by white and red posts there lived over to the south under the mountains sportsman of athletic frame and adventurous disposition his name i have gotten but we may call him dick lindsay it is told of him that he once found poacher in the forest and being unable to catch the intruder ﬁred his riﬂe not at him but in his neighbourhood whereon the poacher deliberately kneeling down took long shot at dick how the duel ended and whether either party ﬂew ﬂag of truce history does not record at all events one stormy day in late september dick had stalked and wounded stag on the hills to the of the strath here if only one were novelist one could weave several pages of valuable copy out of the stalk the stag made the strath here and dick who had gillie but was an independent sportsman of the old school pursued on foot plunging down the low hills the stag found the ﬂooded river before him black and swollen with rain he took the water crossing by the big pool which looked almost like little loch tempestuous under north wind blowing up stream and covered with small white vicious crests the stag crossed and staggered up the bank where he stood panting it is not humane thing to leave deer to die slowly of riﬂe bullet and dick reaching the pool hesitated not but threw of f his clothes took his skene between his teeth plunged in and swam the river all naked he was he cut the stag s throat in the usual manner and gralloched him with all the skill of bucklaw this was very well and very well it would be to add description of the stag at bay but i never happened to see stag at bay i omit all that dick had achieved success but his clothes were on one side of roaring river in spate and he and the dead stag were on the other there was chance of fording the stream and there was then bridge he did not care to swim back the excitement was out of him he was trembling with cold and afraid of cramp mother man in wilderness with ﬂood between him and his raiment was in pitiable position it did not occur to him to ﬂay the stag and dress in the hide and indeed he would have been frozen before he could have accomplished that task so he reconnoitred there was nobody within sight but one girl who was herding cows now naked man with knife and bedabbled with blood to address young woman on lonely moor is delicate business the chances were that the girl would ﬂee like startled fawn and leave dick to walk just he was to the nearest farmhouse about mile away however dick had to risk it he lay down so that only his face appeared above the bank and he shouted to the maiden when he had caught her attention he brieﬂy explained the unusual situation then the young woman behaved like trump or like highland nausicaa students of the odyssey will remember how odysseus simply clad in leafy bough of tree made supplication to the s daughter and how she befriended him even if dick had been reader of homer which is not probable there were trees within convenient reach and he could not adopt the leafy covering of odysseus you sit still if you move an inch before i give you the word i ll leave you where you are said miss mary she then cast her plaid over her face marched up to the bank where dick was crouching and shivering dropped her ample plaid over him and sped away towards the farmhouse when she had reached its shelter and was giving adventures among books https of the adventure dick set forth like primeval highlander the covering doing duty both plaid and kilt clothes of some kind were provided him at the cottage rickety old boat was fetched and he and his stag were rowed across the river to the place where his clothes lay that is all but if one were dealer in romance much play might be made with the future fortunes of the sportsman and the maiden happy fortunes or unhappy in real life the lassie drew up with shepherd lad miss jenny denison has it married him and helped to populate the strath dick history tells more of his adventures nor is it alleged that he ever again visited the distant valley or beheld the face of his highland nausicaa now if one were romancer this mere anecdote probably would rest lovely pearl in the brain and slowly mature in the oyster till it became novel properly handled the incident would make very agreeable ﬁrst chapter with the aid of scenery botany climate and remarks on the manners and customs of the red deer stolen from john or the stuarts d albanie then probably one would reﬂect on the characters of mary and of richard mary must have parents of course and one would make them talk in scottish probably she already had lover how should she behave to that lover there is plenty of room speculation in that problem to dick is he to be lothario or lover pour le bon motif what are his distinguished family to think of the love af fair which would certainly ensue in ﬁction though in real life nobody thought of it at all are we to end happily with marriage or marriages or are we to wind all up in the pleasant pessimistic realistic fashionable modern way is mary to drown the baby in the muckle pool is she to suf fer the penalty of her crime at inverness or happy thought shall we not make her discarded rival lover meet dick in the hills on sunny day and they not taking hint from facts to ﬁght duel with riﬂes i see dick lying with bullet in his brow on the side of corrie his blood crimsons the snow an eagle stoops from the sky that makes pretty picturesque conclusion to the unwritten romance of the strath another anecdote occurs to good i think short story but capable also of being dumped down in the middle of long novel it was in the old coaching days border squire was going north in the coach alone at village he was joined by man and young lady their purpose was manifest they were runaway couple bound gretna green they had not travelled long together before the young lady turning to the squire said vous parlez français monsieur he did speak was plain that the bridegroom did to the end of the journey that remarkable lady conducted lively and af fectionate conversation with the squire in french manifestly he had only to ask and receive but alas he was an unadventurous plain gentleman he alighted at his own village he drove home in his own dogcart the fugitive pair went forward and the gretna blacksmith united them in holy matrimony the rest is silence i would give much to know what that young person s previous history and adventures had been to learn what befell her after her wedding to understand in brief her conduct and her motives were i novelist maupassant or meredith the muse from whatsoever quarter she chose would enlighten about all and i would enlighten you but i can only marvel only throw out the hint only deposit the grain of sand the nucleus of romance in some more fertile brain indeed the topic is much more puzzling than the right conclusion my highland romance in that case fancy could ﬁnd certain obvious channels into one or other of which it must ﬂow but i see channels the lives of these three queerly met people in the coach rule fancies are capable of being arranged in but few familiar patterns so that it seems hardly worth while to make the arrangement but he who looks at things thus will never be writer of stories nay even of the slowly unfolding tale of his own existence he may weary the combinations therein have all occurred before it is in hackneyed old story that he is living and you and yet to act on this knowledge is to make bad affair of our little life we must try our best to take it seriously and so of adventures among books https mr stevenson says man must view his very triﬂing enterprise with gravity that would beﬁt the cares of empire and think the smallest improvement worth accomplishing at any expense of time and industry the book the statue the sonata must be gone upon with the unreasoning good faith and the unﬂagging spirit of children at their play that is true that is the worst of it the man the writer over whom the irresistible desire to mock at himself his work his puppets and their fortunes has power will never be novelist the novelist must make believe very much he must be in earnest with his characters but how to be in earnest how to keep the note of disbelief and derision out of the memorial ah there is the difﬁculty but it is difﬁculty of which many authors appear to be insensible perhaps they suf fer from such temptations chapter xv the superna tural in fiction it is truism that the supernatural in ﬁction should general rule be left in the vague in the creepiest tale i ever read the horror lay in there was ghost you may describe ghost with all the most hideous features that fancy can eyes red staring hair forked tail and what you the reader only laughs it is wiser to make if you were going to describe the spectre and then break of f exclaiming but pen can describe memory thank heaven can recall the horror of that hour so writers rule prefer to leave their terror usually styled the thing entirely in the dark and to the frightened fancy of the student thus on the whole the treatment of the supernaturally terrible in ﬁction is achieved in two ways either by actual description or by adroit suggestion the author saying like cabmen i leave it to yourself sir there are dangers in both methods the description if attempted is usually overdone and incredible the suggestion is apt to prepare us too anxiously something that never becomes real and to leave us disappointed examples of both methods may be selected from poetry and prose the examples in verse are rare enough the ﬁrst and best that occurs in the way of suggestion is of course the mysterious lady in she was most beautiful to see like lady of far who was she what did she want whence did she come what was the horror she revealed to the night in the bower of christabel then drawing in her breath aloud like one that shuddered she unbound the cincture from beneath her breast her silken robe and inner vest dropt to her feet and full in view behold her bosom and half her sight to dream of not to tell shield her shield sweet christabel and then what her words mean thou knowest and wilt know this mark of my shame this seal of my sorrow what was sight to dream of not to tell coleridge never did tell and though he and mr gilman said he knew wordsworth thought he did not know he raised spirit that he had not the spell to lay in adventures among books https of poets has he discovered the secret we only know that the mischief whatever it may have been was wrought sorrow and shame can this be the lady who knelt at the old oak tree star hath set star hath risen geraldine since arms of thine have been the lovely lady s prison geraldine one hour was 11 if coleridge knew why did he never tell and yet he maintains that in the very ﬁrst conception of the tale i had the whole present to my mind with the wholeness less than with the liveliness of vision and he expected to ﬁnish the three remaining parts within the year the year was 1816 the poem was begun in 1797 and ﬁnished far it goes in if coleridge ever knew what he meant he had time to get the chances are that his indolence or his getfulness was the making of christabel which remains masterpiece of supernatural suggestion description it sufﬁces to read the ancient mariner these marvels truly are speciosa miracula and unlike southey we believe we read y have selected passage fertile in unmeaning miracles lamb wrote to southey 1798 but have passed by ﬁfty passages miraculous the miracles they lamb appears to have been almost alone in appreciating this masterpiece of supernatural description coleridge himself shrank from his own wonders and wanted to call the piece poet s it is bad bottom the weaver s declaration that he is not lion but only the scenical representation of lion what new idea is gained by this title but one subversive of all the tale should force upon its truth lamb himself was forced by the temper of the time to declare that he disliked all the miraculous part of it if it were not all miraculous wordsworth wanted the mariner to have character and profession perhaps would have liked him to be gardener or butler with an excellent character in fact the love of the supernatural was then at so low an ebb that certain mr marshall went to sleep while the ancient mariner was reading and the book was mainly bought by seafaring men deceived by the title and supposing that the ancient mariner was nautical treatise in verse then coleridge succeeds with the supernatural both by way of description in detail and of suggestion if you wish to see failure try the ghost the moral but not affable ghost in wordsworth s it is blasphemy to ask the question but is the ghost in hamlet quite success we not see and hear little too much of him macbeth s airy and viewless dagger is really much more successful by way of suggestion the stage makes ghost visible and familiar and this is one great danger of the supernatural in art it is apt to insist on being too conspicuous did the ghost of darius in æschylus frighten the athenians probably they smiled at the imperial spectre there is more discretion in cæsar s i think it is the weakness of mine eyes that shapes this monstrous apparition says brutus and he lays very great stress on the brief visit of the appearance want of this discretion alexandre dumas s ghosts in the corsican brothers are failures they make themselves too common and too cheap like the spectre in oliphant s novel the wizard s this indeed is the crux of the whole adventure if you paint your ghost with too heavy hand you raise laughter not fear if you touch him too lightly you raise unsatisﬁed curiosity not fear it may be easy to shudder but it is difﬁcult to teach shuddering in prose good example of the over vague is miriam s mysterious shadow of the t ransformation or the marble hawthorne should adventures among books https us more or less to be sure his contemporaries knew what he meant knew who miriam and the spectre were the dweller in the catacombs now powerfully excites curiosity and when that curiosity is unsatisﬁed we feel aggrieved vexed and suspect that hawthorne himself was puzzled and knew more than his readers he has in other tales he to throw the right atmosphere about this being he is vague in the wrong way whereas geor ge sand in les dames v ertes is vague in the right way we are left in les dames v ertes with that kind of curiosity which persons really engaged in the adventure might have felt not with the irritation of having secret kept from us in t in w andering willie s tale in redgauntlet the right atmosphere is found the right note is struck all is vividly real and yet if you close the book all melts into dream again scott was almost equally successful with described horror in the tapestried chamber the idea is the commonplace of haunted houses the apparition is described minutely bur glar might have been and yet we not mock but shudder we read then on the other side of the scene outside the closed door of the vanished dr jekyll in mr stevenson s apologue they are waiting on the threshold of the chamber whence the doctor has the chamber tenanted by what voice comes from the room sir said poole looking utterson in the eyes was that my master s voice friend man of af fairs and person never accused of being fanciful told that he read through the book to that point in lonely highland chateau at night and that he did not think it well to ﬁnish the story till next morning but rushed to bed so the passage seems and successful by dint of suggestion on the other side perhaps only scotsmen brought up in country places familiar from childhood with the terrors of cameronian myth and from childhood apt to haunt the lonely churchyards never stirred since the year of the great plague choked the soil with the dead perhaps they only know how much shudder may be found in mr stevenson s thrawn the black smouldering heat in the hills and glens that are commonly so fresh the aspect of the man the tempter of the brethren we know them and we have enough of the old blood in us to be thrilled by that masterpiece of the described supernatural it may be only local success it may not much af fect the english reader but it is of sure appeal to the lowland scot the ancestral covenanter within us awakens and is terriﬁed by his ancient fears perhaps it may die out in positive power of learning to shudder to us it descends from very long ago from the far forefathers who dreaded the dark and who half starved and all untaught saw spirits everywhere and scarce discerned waking experience from dreams when we are all perfect positivist philosophers when thousand generations of nurses that never heard of ghosts have educated the thousand and ﬁrst generation of children then the supernatural may fade out of ﬁction but has it not grown and increased since wordsworth wanted the ancient mariner to have profession and character since southey called that poem dutch piece of work since lamb had to pretend to dislike its miracles why science becomes more have men and women become more and more fond of old follies and more pleased with the stirring of ancient dread within their veins the visible world is measured mapped tested weighed we seem to hope more and more that world of invisible romance may not be far from us or at least we care more and more to follow fancy into these airy regions et inania r egna the supernatural has not ceased to tempt romancers like alexandre dumas usually to their destruction more rarely in oliphant s beleaguered city to such success they not ﬁnd in the world of daily occupation the ordinary shilling tales of hypnotism and mesmerism are vulgar trash enough and yet i can believe that an impossible romance if the right man wrote it in the right mood might still win us from the newspapers and the stories of shabby love and cheap remorses and commonplace failures but it needs moments this adventures among books https xvi an old scottish

care to be well informed and ﬁrst gave it to the world in volume will never guess what in the present work he of fers us the devil of glenluce enlar ged with several remarkable additions from an eye and ear adventures among books https person of undoubted honesty sinclair recommends its usefulness refuting probably mr sinclair got the story or had it put of f on him rather through one campbell student of philosophy in glasgow the son of gilbert campbell weaver of glenluce in galloway the scene in our own time of mysterious murder campbell had refused alms to alexander agnew bold and sturdy beggar who when asked by the judge whether he believed in god answered he knew god but salt meal and in consequence of the refusal of alms the stirs ﬁrst the stirs are ghostly disturbances they commenced with whistling in the house and out of it such children use to make with their small slender glass about the middle of november says mr sinclair the foul fiend came on with his extraordinary observe that he takes the foul fiend entirely granted and that he never tells us the date of the original quarrel and the early agitation stones were thrown down the chimney and in at the windows but nobody was hurt naturally gilbert campbell carried his tale of sorrow to the parish minister this did not avail him his warp and threads were cut on his loom and even the clothes of his family were cut while they were wearing them at night something tugged the blankets of f their beds favourite old spiritual trick which was played if i remember well on roman emperor according to suetonius poor campbell had to remove his and send his children to board out to try whom the trouble did most follow after this all was quiet perhaps might be expected and quiet all remained till son named thomas was brought home again then the house was twice set on ﬁre and it might have been enough to give thomas beating on the other hand campbell sent thomas to stay with the minister but the troubles continued in the old way at last the family became so accustomed to the devil that they were more afraid to keep up the clash chatter with the foul fiend than to speak to each other they were like the wesleys who were so familiar with the ﬁend jef frey that haunted their home the minister with few of the gentry heard of their unholy friendship and paid campbell visit at their ﬁrst coming in the devil says quum literarum is good these are the ﬁrst words of the latin rudiments which scholars are taught when they go to the grammar school then they all prayed and voice came from under the bed w ould you know the witches of glenluce the voice named few including one long dead but the minister with rare good sense remarked that what satan said was not evidence let it be remarked that the lad tom had that very day come back with the minister the fiend then of fered terms give spade and shovel and depart from the house seven days and i will make grave and lie down in it and trouble you hereon campbell with scottish caution declined to give the devil the value of straw the visitors then hunted after the voice observing that some of the children were in bed they found nothing and then the novelists say strange thing there appeared naked hand and an arm from the elbow down beating upon the ﬂoor till the house did shake again the fiend next exclaimed that if the candle were put out he would appear in the shape of let it be observed that now the ﬁrst time we learn that all the scene occurred in the appearance of ﬂoating balls of ﬁre is frequent if we may believe the current reports at spiritualistic séances but what strange tale is mr sinclair s he lets slip an expression which shows that the investigators were in one room the but while the fiend was diverting himself in the other room the ben the fiend nobody going ben next chaf fed gentleman who wore fashionable brimmed hat whereupon he presently imagined that he felt pair of shears going about his hat but there was such matter the voice asked piece of bread which the others were eating and said the maid gave him crust in the morning this she denied but admitted that something had clicked piece of bread out of her adventures among books https séance ended the devil slapping safe portion of the children s bodies with sound resembling applause after many months of this really annoying conduct poor campbell laid his case before the presbyters in 1655 thirty years before the date of publication so solemn humiliation was actually held all through the bounds of the synod but to little purpose did glenluce sit in sackcloth and ashes the good wife s plate was snatched away before her very eyes and then thrown back at her in similar stirs described by catholic missionary in peru soon after pizarro s conquest the cup of an indian chief was lifted up by an invisible hand and set down empty in that case too stones were thrown by the devil of glenluce and what was the end of it all mr sinclair has not even taken the trouble to inquire it seems by some conjuration or other the devil suf fered himself to be put away and gave the weaver habitation the weaver has been very odd man that endured so long these marvellous this is the tale which mr sinclair of fers without mentioning his authority he complains that dr henry more had plagiarised it from his book of hydrostatics two points may be remarked first modern psychical inquirers are more particular about evidence than mr sinclair not nothing we live in an age of science next the stories of these stirs are always much the same everywhere in glenluce at tedworth where the drummer came in peru in wesley s house in heroic iceland when glam the vampire rode the it is curious to speculate on how the tradition of making themselves little nuisances in this particular manner has been handed down among children if we are to suppose that children the trick last autumn farmer s house in scotland was annoyed exactly the weaver s home was and that within quarter of mile of man of science the mattress of the father was tenanted by something that wriggled like snake the mattress was opened nothing was found and the disturbance began again soon the bed was restored to its place this occurred when the farmer s children had been sent to distance one can not but be perplexed by the problem which these tales suggest almost bare of evidence they are their great number their wide dif fusion in many countries and in times ancient and modern may establish some substratum of truth scott mentions case in which the imposture was detected by sherif f s ofﬁcer but recent anecdote makes almost distrust the detection some english people having taken country house in ireland were vexed by the usual rappings and all the rest of the business they sent to dublin two detectives who arrived on their ﬁrst night the lady of the house went into room where she found one of the policemen asleep in his chair being lively person she rapped twice or thrice on the table he awakened and said ah so i suspected it was hardly worth while madam to bring us so far and next day the worthy men withdrew in dudgeon but quite convinced that they had discovered the agent in the hauntings but they had not on the other hand scott who had seen one ghost if not two and had heard warning states that miss anne robinson managed the stockwell disturbances by tying horsehairs to plates and light articles which then demeaned themselves if possessed here we have vera causa demonstrable cause of stirs and it may be inferred that all the other historical occurrences had similar origin we have then only to be interested in the persistent tradition in accordance with which mischievous persons always exactly the same sort of thing but this is mere example of the identity of human nature it is curious to see how mr sinclair plumes himself on this devil of glenluce moliminous rampier against irreligion this one relation is worth all the price adventures among books https be given the the price i have given the volume is ten golden guineas and perhaps the foul thief of glenluce is hardly worth the money i believe if the obdurest atheist among men would seriously and in good earnest consider that relation and ponder all the circumstances thereof he would presently cry out dr of physick did hearing story less considerable i believe i have been in the wrong all the this be sinclair is also believer in the woodstock devils on which scott founded his novel he does not give the explanation that giles sharp alias joseph collins of oxford alias funny joe was all the devil in that af fair scott had read the story of funny joe but could never remember whether it exists in separate collection or where it is to be looked indif ferent to evidence mr sinclair confutes the obdurest atheists with the pied piper of hamelin with the young lady from howells letters whose house like rahab s was on the city wall and with the ghost of the major who appeared to the captain he had promised and scolded him not keeping his sword clean he also gives us major weir at full length convincing us that william erskine said the major was disgusting fellow most ungentlemanlike character scott on the other hand remarked long before w averley if i ever were to become writer of prose romances i think i would choose major weir if not my hero at least an agent and leading one in my he admitted that the street where the major lived was haunted by woman twice the common length but why should we set him down an ungentlemanly fellow readers of mr sinclair will understand the reason very well and it is not necessary nor here even possible to justify erskine s opinion by quotations sufﬁce it that by virtue of his enchanted staf f which was burned with him the major was enabled to commit evil not to be named yea even to reconcile man and wife when at his sister who was hanged had redgauntlet s mark on her brow and one may marvel that scott does not seem to have remembered this coincidence there was seen an exact shaped nails in her wrinkles terrible enough i assure you to the stoutest beholder most modern readers will believe that both the luckless major and his sister were religious maniacs poverty solitude and the superstition of their time were the true demon of major weir burned at the stake in april perhaps the most singular impression made by satan s invisible world discovered is that in sinclair s day people who did not believe in bogies believed in nothing while people who shared the common creed of christendom were capable of believing in everything atheists are common ghosts in his marvellous relations and the very wizards themselves were often atheists have said that scott himself had seen one ghost if not two and heard the ghost was seen near ashestiel on an open spot of hillside please to observe it was before dinner the anecdote is in gillis s recollections of sir walter scott the vision of lord byron standing in the great hall of abbotsford is described in the demonology and witchcraft scott alleges that it resolved itself into great coats shawls and plaids hallucination but lockhart remarks life ix 141 that he did not care to have the circumstance discussed in general the stirs in abbotsford during the night when his architect bullock died in london are in lockhart pp the noise resembled men hard at work putting up boards and furniture and nothing can be more certain than that there was nobody on the premises at the the noise unluckily occurred twice april 28 and 29 1818 and lockhart does not tell us on which of these two nights mr bullock died such is the casualness of ghost lockhart adds that the coincidence made strong impression on sir walter s mind he did not care to ascertain the point in his own mental constitution where incredulity began to waver according to his friend mr adventures among books https xvii the boy humble student of savage life i have found it necessary to make researches into the manners and customs of boys boys are not what vain people supposes if you meet them in the holidays you ﬁnd them af fable and full of kindness and good qualities they will condescend to your weakness at they will aid you in your selection of and to be brief will behave with much more than the civility of tame zulus or red men on missionary settlement but boys at school and among themselves left to the wild justice and traditional laws which many generations of boys have evolved are entirely dif ferent beings they resemble that polynesian prince who had rejected the errors of polytheism those of an extreme sect of primitive seceders weeks at time this prince was known to be steady but every month or so he disappeared and his subjects said he was lying of to adopt an american idiom he felt like brandy and water he also felt like wearing clothes and generally rejecting his new conceptions of duty and decency in fact he had good bout of savagery and then he returned to his tall hat his varnished boots his and his edifying principles the life of small boys at school before they get into coats and the upper is often mere course of f relapse into native savagery with its laws and customs if any one has so far gotten his own boyhood to think this description exaggerated let him just fancy what our comfortable civilised life would be if we could become boys in character and custom let us suppose that you are elected to new club of which most of the members are strangers to you you enter the doors the ﬁrst time when two older members who have been gossiping in the hall pounce upon you with the exclamation hullo here s new fellow you fellow what s your name you reply let us say i don t believe it it s such rum name what s your father perhaps you are constrained to answer duke or more probably solicitor in the former case your friends bound up into the howling here s new fellow says his father is duke let s take the cheek out of and they take it out with umbrellas slippers and other sur gical instruments or in the latter case your parent being solicitor they reply then your father must be beastly cad all solicitors are sharks my father says so and he knows how many sisters have you the new member answers four any of them married how awfully awkward by this time perhaps luncheon is ready or the evening papers come in and you are released moment you sneak up into the library where you naturally expect to be entirely alone and you settle on sofa with novel but an old member bursts into the room spies new fellow and puts him through the usual catechism he ends with how much tin have you got you answer twenty pounds or whatever the sum may be perhaps you had contemplated playing whist v ery well fork it out you must give dinner all new fellows must and you are not going to begin by being stingy beast thus addressed your friend is big bald man who looks mischievous you fork out all your ready money and your new friend goes of f to consult the cook meanwhile you shed blooming tear homer says and go home now does any man call this state of society civilisation would life be worth living whatever one s religious consolations on these terms of course not and yet this picture is not overdrawn sketch of the career of some new boy at some schools new or old the existence of small schoolboy is in other respects not unlike that of an outsider in lawless brotherhood the irish playfully call their murder clubs the small boy is in the society but not of it far any beneﬁts go he has to ﬁeld out and i admit that the discipline is salutary while other boys bat other boys commit the faults and compel him to copy out the ﬁve hundred lines of with which their sins are visited other boys enjoy the pleasures of football while the small boy has to run vaguely about never within ﬁve yards of the ball big boys reap adventures among books https of paperchases the small boy gets lost in the bitter weather on the open moors or perhaps in one historical case is frozen to death within measurable distance of the school playground and the worst of it is that member of the great school secret society the small boy can never complain of his wrongs or divulge the name of his tormentors it is in this respect that he resembles harmless fellow dragged into the coils of an anarchist inner he is exposed to all sorts of wrongs from his neighbours and he can only escape by turning informer by breaking the most sacred law of his society losing all social status and probably obliging his parents to remove him from school life at school among the celtic peoples turns on the belief that law and authority are natural enemies against which every one is banded the chapter of bullying among boys is one on which man enters with reluctance boys are on the whole such good fellows and so full of ﬁne unsophisticated qualities that the mature mind would gladly turn away its eyes from beholding their iniquities even cruel bully does not inevitably and invariably develop into bad man he is let us hope only passing through the savage stage in which the torture of prisoners is recognised institution he has perhaps too little imagination to understand the pain he causes very often bullying is not physically cruel but only perverted sort of humour such kingsley in hypatia recognised among his favourite goths i remember feeble foolish boy at school feeble he certainly was and was thought foolish who became the subject of much humorous bullying his companions used to tie thin thread round his ear and attach this to bar at such height that he could only avoid breaking it by standing on tiptoe but he was told that he must not break the thread to avoid infringing this commandment he put himself to considerable inconvenience and af forded much enjoyment to the spectators men of middle age rather early middle age remember the two following species of bullying to which they were subjected and which perhaps are obsolescent tall stools were piled up in pyramid and the victim was seated on the top near the roof of the room the other savages brought him down from this bad eminence by hurling other stools at those which supported him or the victim was made to place his hands against the door with the ﬁngers outstretched while the young tormentors played at the chinese they threw knives that is to say at the door between the apertures of the ﬁngers and rule they hit the ﬁngers and not the door these diversions i know to be correctly reported but the following pretty story is perhaps myth at one of the most famous public schools praepostor or monitor or boy having authority heard in the room above his own he went up and found big boy and little boy they denied having any pistol the monitor returned to his studies again was sure he heard shot went up and found the little boy dead the big boy had been playing the william tell trick with him and had hit his head instead of the apple that is the legend whether it be true or false all boys will agree that the little victim could not have escaped by complaining to the monitor death before dishonour but the side not so seamy of this picture of school life is the extraordinary power of honour among boys of course the laws of the secret society might well terrify puerile informer but the sentiment of honour is even more strong than fear and will probably outlast the very disagreeable circumstances in which it was developed people say bullying is not what it used to be the much abused monitorial system has this in it of good that it enables clever and kindly boy who is high up in the school to stop the cruelties if he hears of them of much bigger boy who is low in the school but he seldom hears of them habitual bullies are very cunning and i am acquainted with instances in which they carry their victims of f to lonely torture cells so to speak and deserted places ﬁt the sport some years ago small boy after long course of rope in dens revealed the abominations of some naval cadets there was not much sympathy with him in the public mind and perhaps his case was not well managed but it was made clear that whereas among men an unpopular person is only spoken evil of behind his back an unpopular small boy among boys is made to suffer in more direct and very unpleasant way adventures among books https of us leave school with the impression that there was good deal of bullying when we were little but that the institution has died out the truth is that we have grown too big to be bullied and too to bully ourselves when i left school i thought bullying was an extinct art like encaustic painting before it was rediscovered by sir william richmond but distinguished writer who was small boy when i was big one has since revealed to the most abominable cruelties which were being practised at the very moment when i supposed bullying to have had its day and ceased to be now the small boy need only have mentioned the circumstances to any one of score of big boys and the tormentor would have been ﬁrst thrashed and then probably expelled friend of my own was travelling lately in wild and hilly region on the other side of the world let us say in the mountains of the moon in mountain tavern he had thrust upon him the society of the cook very useless young man who astonished him by references to one of our universities and to the enjoyments of that seat of learning this youth who was made cook and very bad cook too because he could nothing else had been expelled from lar ge english school and he was expelled because he had felled bully with and had expressed his readiness to it again now there was doubt that this cook in the mountain inn was very unserviceable young fellow but i wish more boys who have suf fered things literally unspeakable from bullies would try whether force in the form of paving stone is really remedy the catholic author of recent book schools by raleigh chichester is very hard on protestant schools and thinks that the catholic system of constant watching is remedy bullying and other evils with their upper half glazed might have their uses he says and he does not see why boy should not be permitted to complain if he is roasted like tom brown before lar ge ﬁre the boys at one catholic school described by colonel raleigh chichester are never without surveillance of some this is true of most french schools and any one who wishes to understand the consequences there may read the published confessions of usher or spy more degraded and degrading life than that of the wretched pion it is impossible to imagine in an english private school the system of espionnage and tale bearing when it exists is probably not unlike what mr anstey describes in vice v ersâ but in the catholic schools spoken of by colonel raleigh chichester the surveillance may be he says that of parent an aid to the boys in their games rather than the religious question between catholics and protestants has essential connection with the subject protestant school might and grimstone s did have bearers possibly catholic school might exist without parental surveillance that system is called by its foes police by its friends paternal system but fathers don t exercise the paternal system themselves in this country and we may take it granted that while english society and religion are they are surveillance at our lar ge schools will be impossible if any one regrets this let him read the descriptions of french schools and schooldays in balzac s louis lambert in the memoirs of maxime du camp in any book where frenchman speaks his mind about his youth he will ﬁnd spying of course among the ushers contempt and hatred on the side of the boys unwholesome and cruel punishments total lack of healthy exercise and he will hear of holidays spent in premature excursions into forbidden and shady quarters of the town doubt the best security against bullying is in constant occupation there can hardly in spite of master geor ge osborne s experience in v anity fair be much bullying in an open big boys too with good hearts should not only stop bullying when they come across it but make it their business to ﬁnd out where it exists exist it will more or less despite all precautions while boys are is are passing through modiﬁed form of the savage state there is curious fact in the boyish character which seems at ﬁrst sight to make good the opinion that private education at home is the true method before they go out into school life many little fellows of nine or so are extremely original imaginative and almost poetical they are fond of books fond of nature and if you can win adventures among books https will tell you all sorts of pretty thoughts and fancies which lie about them in their infancy i have known little boy who liked to lie on the grass and to people the alleys and glades of that miniature forest with fairies and dwarfs whom he seemed actually to see in kind of vision but he went to school he instantly won the hundred yards race boys under twelve and he came back young barbarian interested in the theory of touch at football curious in the art of bowling and more capable than you or i of seeing fairies in green meadow he was caught up into the air of the boy s world and his imagination was in abeyance season this is common enough thing and rather melancholy spectacle to behold one is tempted to believe that school causes the loss of good deal of genius and that the small boys who leave home poets and come back barbarians have been wasted but on the other hand if they had been kept at home and encouraged the chances are that they would have blossomed into infant phenomena and nothing better the awful infancy of john stuart mill is standing warning mr mill would probably have been much happier and wiser man if he had not been precocious linguist economist and philosopher but had passed through healthy stage of indif ference to learning and speculation at public school look again at the childhood of bishop thirlwall his primitiae were published by samuel tipper london 1808 when young connop was but eleven years of age his indiscreet father launched this slender bark he says and it sailed through three editions between 1808 and young thirlwall was taught latin at three years of age and at four read greek with an ease and ﬂuency which astonished all who heard at seven he composed an essay on the uncertainty of human life but his taste poetry was not discovered till later his sermons some forty occupy most of the little volume in which these primitiae were collected he was especially concerned about sabbath desecration i confess observes this sage of ten when i look upon the present and past state of our public morals and when i contrast our present luxury dissipation and depravity with past frugality and virtue i feel not merely sensation of regret but also of terror the result of the the late revolution in france he adds has af forded us remarkable lesson how necessary religion is to state and that from deﬁciency on that head arise the chief evils which can befall society he then bids us remember that the nebuchadnezzar who may destroy our israel is near at hand though it might be difﬁcult to show how nebuchadnezzar destroyed israel to the uncertainty of life he remarks that edward vi died in his minority and disappointed his subjects to whom he had promised happy of this infant s sermons just many the articles it may be said that they are in way inferior to other examples of this class of literature but sermons are among the least scarce and rare of human essays and many parents would rather see their boy patiently acquiring the art of at school than moralising on the uncertainty of life at home some one having presented to the young author copy of verses on the trite and familiar subject of the ploughboy he replied with an ode on the potboy bliss is not always join d to wealth nor dwells beneath the gilded roof poverty is bliss with health of that my potboy stands the volume ends with this determination still shall i seek apollo s shelt ring ray to cheer my spirits and inspire my lay if any parent or guardian desires any further information about les enfans devenus célèbr es par leurs écrits he will ﬁnd it in work of that name published in paris in the learned scioppius published works at sixteen which deserved and adventures among books https the admiration of du maurier asserts that at the age of ﬁfteen grotius pleaded causes at the bar at eleven meursius made orations and harangues which were much admired at ﬁfteen alexandre le jeune wrote anacreontic verses and less excusably commentary on the institutions of gaius grevin published tragedy and two comedies at the age of thirteen and at ﬁfteen louis stella was professor of greek but one reads grevin now nor stella nor alexandre le jeune and perhaps their time might have been better occupied in being soaring human boys than in composing tragedies and commentaries monsieur le duc maine published in 1678 his œuvr es d un auteur sept ans royal example to be avoided by all boys these and several score of other examples may perhaps reconcile us to the spectacle of puerile genius fading away in the existence of the common british schoolboy who is nothing of poet and still less of jurisconsult the british authors who understand boys best are not those who have written books exclusively about boys there is canon farrar example whose romances of boyish life appear to be very popular but whose boys somehow are not real boys they are too good when they are good and when they are bad they are not perhaps too bad that is impossible but they are bad in the wrong way they are bad with mannish and conscious vice whereas even bad boys seem to sin less consciously and after ferocious fashion of their own of the boys in t om brown it is difﬁcult to speak because the rugby boy under arnold seems to have been of peculiar species contemporary pupil was asked when an under graduate what he conceived to be the peculiar characteristic of rugby boys he said after mature reﬂection that the differ entia of the rugby boy was his moral now the characteristic of the ordinary boy is his want of what is called moral thoughtfulness he lives in simple obedience to school traditions these may compel him at one school to speak in peculiar language and to persecute and beat all boys who are slow at learning this language at another school he may regard dislike of the manly game of football the sin with which heaven heads the count of on the whole this notion seems useful protest against the prematurely artistic beings who ﬁll their studies with photographs of greek fragments vases etchings by the newest etcher bits of china oriental rugs and very curious old brass candlesticks the challenge cup soon passes away from the keeping of any house in public school where bunthorne is popular and imitated character but when we reach æsthetic boys we pass out of the savage stage into hobbledehoyhood the bigger boys at public schools are often terribly advanced and when they are not at work or play they are vexing themselves with the riddle of the earth evolution agnosticism and all that kind of thing latin verses may not be what conservatives fondly deem them and even cricket may it is said become too absorbing pursuit but either or both are better than precocious freethinking and sacriﬁce on the altar of the beautiful big boy who is tackling haeckel or composing virelais in playtime is doing himself good and is worse than useless to the society of which he is member the small boys who are the most ardent of either despise him or they allow him to address them in chansons r oyaux and respond with trebles in triolets at present great many boys leave school pass three years or four at the universities and go back masters to the place where some of their old schoolfellows are still pupils it is through these very young masters perhaps that advanced speculations and tastes get into schools where however excellent in themselves they are rather out of place indeed the very young master though usually earnest in his work must be sage indeed if he can avoid talking to the elder boys about the problems that interest him and so forcing their minds into precocious attitudes the advantage of eton boys used to be perhaps is still that they came up to college absolutely destitute of ideas and guiltless of reading anything more modern than virgil thus their intellects were quite fallow and they made astonishing progress when they bent their fresh and unwearied minds to study but too many boys now leave school with settled opinions derived from the very latest thing out from the newest german pessimist or american socialist it may however be ar gued adventures among books https of these sorts are like measles and that it is better to take them early and be done with them ever while schools are reformed and latin grammars of the utmost ingenuity and difﬁculty are published boys on the whole change very little they remain the beings whom thackeray understood better than any other writer thackeray who liked boys so much and was so little blind to their defects i think he exaggerates their habit of lying to masters or if they lied in his day their character has altered in that respect and they are more truthful than many men ﬁnd it expedient to be and they have given up ﬁghting the old battles between berry and biggs or dobbin and cuf f major are things of the glorious past big boys don t ﬁght and there is whisper that little boys kick each other s shins when in wrath that practice can hardly be called an improvement even if we not care ﬁsticuf fs perhaps the gloves are the best peacemakers at school when all the boys by practice in boxing know pretty well whom they can in friendly way lick they are less tempted to more crucial experiments without the but even the ascertainment of one s relative merits with the gloves hurts good deal and one may thank heaven that the fountain of youth described by pontus tyarde is not common beverage by drinking this liquid says the old frenchman one is insensibly brought back from old to middle age and to youth and boyhood but one would prefer to stop drinking of the fountain before actually being reduced to boy s estate and passing once more through the tumultuous experiences of that period and of these not having enough to eat is by means the least common the evidence to execrable dinners is rather dispiriting and one may end by saying that if there is worse fellow than bully it is master who does not see that his boys are supplied with plenty of wholesome food he at least could not venture like distinguished headmaster to preach and publish sermons on boys life its schoolmaster who has boarders is and thereby makes his income but he need not keep hotel which would be dispraised in guide books dinners are branch of school economy which should not be left to the wives of schoolmasters
