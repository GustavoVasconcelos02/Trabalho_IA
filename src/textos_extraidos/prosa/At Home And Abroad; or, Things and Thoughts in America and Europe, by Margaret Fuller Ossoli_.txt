ofﬁce of the district court of the district of massachusetts pref ace there are at least three classes of persons who travel in our own land and abroad the ﬁrst and largest in number consists of those who having eyes see not and ears hear not anything which is proﬁtable to be remembered crossing lake and ocean passing over the broad prairies of the new world or the classic ﬁelds of the old though they look on the virgin soil sown thickly with ﬂowers by the hand of god or on scenes memorable in man history they gaze heedlessly and when they return home can but tell us what they ate and drank and where slept more this and matters of like import are all which they have cared in their wanderings those composing the second class travel more intelligently they visit scrupulously all places which are noted either the homes of literature the abodes of art or made classic by the pens of ancient genius accurately they mark the distance of one famed city from another the size and general appearance of each they see many possible of celebrated pictures and works of art and mark carefully dimensions age and all details concerning them men too whom the world regards great men whether because of wisdom poesy warlike achievements or of wealth and station they seek to take by the hand and in some degree to know at least to note their appearance demeanor and mode of life writers belonging to this class of travellers are not to be undervalued returning home they can give much useful information and tell much which all wish to hear and know though their narratives are chieﬂy circumstantial and every year circumstances change such recitals lessen constantly in value but there is third class of those who journey who see indeed the outward and observe it well they too seek localities where art and genius dwell or have painted on canvas or sculptured in marble their memorials they become acquainted with the people both famed and obscure of the lands which they visit and in which time they abide their hearts throb they stand on places where great deeds have been done with whose dust perhaps is mingled the sacred ashes of men who fell in the warfare truth and freedom warfare begun early in the world history and not yet ended but they much more than this there is though in different sense from what ancient pagans fancied genius or guardian spirit of each scene each stream and lake and country and this spirit is ever speaking but in tone which only the attent ear of the noble and gifted can hear and in language which such minds and hearts only can understand with vision which needs miracle to make it prophetic they see the destinies which nations are shaping themselves and note the deep meaning of passing events which only make others wonder beneath the mask of mere externals their eyes discern the character of those whom they meet and refusing to accept popular judgment in place of truth they see often the real relation which men bear to their race and age and observe the facts by pg iv pg v at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https to determine whether such men are great only because of circumstances or by the irresistible power of their own minds when such narrate their journeyings we have what is valuable not few years only but because of its philosophic and suggestive spirit what must always be useful the reader of the following pages it is believed will decide that margaret fuller deserves to rank with the latter class of travellers while not neglectful of those details which it is well to learn and remember twelve years ago she journeyed in company with several friends on the lakes and through some of the western states returning she published volume descr ibing this journey which seems worthy of republication it seems so because it rather gives an idea of western scenery and character than enters into statements which would be all erroneous now beside this it is much record of thoughts well things and those thoughts have lost none of their signiﬁcance now it gives us also knowledge of indian character and impressions respecting that much injured and fast vanishing race which justice to them makes it desirable should be remembere the friends of madame ossoli will be glad to make permanent this additional proof of her sympathy with all the oppressed matter whether that oppression ﬁnd embodiment in the indian or the african the american or the european the second part of the present volume gives my sister impressions and observations during her european journey and residence in italy this is done through letters which originally appeared in the new york tribune but have never before been gathered into book form there may be degree of incompleteness sometimes perhaps inaccuracy in these letters which are inseparable attendants upon letter during journey or amid exciting and warlike scenes none can lament more than i that their writer lives not to revise them some errors too were doubtless made in the original printing of these letters owing to her handwriting not being easily read by those who were not familiar with it and very probably some such errors may have escaped my notice in the revision especially many emendations must be conjectural the original manuscript not now existing there is one fact however which gives this part of the volume high value madame ossoli was in rome during the most eventful period of its modern history she was almost the only american who remain ed there during the italian revolution and the siege of the city her marriage with the marquis ossoli who was captain of the civic guard and active in the republican councils and army and her own ardent love of freedom and sacriﬁces it brought her into immediate acquaintance with the leaders in the revolutionary army and made her cognizant of their plans their motives and their characters unsuccessful time has been that struggle freedom it was yet noble one and its true history should be known in this country and in all lands that justice may be done to those who sacri ﬁced much some even life in behalf of liberty her peculiar ﬁtness to write the history of this struggle is well expressed by greeley in his introduction to one of her volumes recently of italy last struggle liberty and light he says she might not merely say with the grattan of ireland kindred effort half century earlier i stood by its cradle i followed its hearse she might fairly claim to have been portion of its incitement its animation its informing soul she bore more than woman part in its conﬂicts and its perils and the bombs of that ruthless army which false and traitorous government impelled against the ramparts of republican rome could have stilled voice more eloquent in its exposures heart more lofty in its deﬁance of the villany which so wantonly drowned in blood the hopes while crushing the dearest rights of people than those of mar garet fuller inadequate indeed are these letters memorial and vindication of that struggle in comparison with the history which madame ossoli had written and which perished with pg vi pg vii at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https but well they deserve to be preserved the record of clear and hearted eyewitness of and participator in this effort to establish new and better roman republic in one respect they have an interest higher than would the history they were written during the struggle and show the ﬂuctuations of hope and animated those most deeply interested i have thought it right to leave unchanged all expressions of her opinion and feeling even when it is evident from the letters themselves that these were gradually somewhat modiﬁed by ensuing events especially did this change occur in regard to the pope whom she at ﬁrst regarded in common with all lovers of freedom in this and other lands with hopefulness which was doomed to cruel disappointment she was however never moment deceived to his character his heart she believed kindly and good his intellect of low order his views to reform narrow intending only what is partial temporary and alleviating never permanent vital reform which should remove the cause of the ills on account of which his people groaned really to elevate and free italy it was necessary to remove the yoke of ecclesiastical and political thraldom to this formed part of his plans his very nature he was incapable of so great purpose the expression in her letters of this opinion when most people hoped better things was at ﬁrst censured doing injustice to pius ix but alas events proved the impulses of his heart to be in subjection to the prejudices of his mind and that mind to be weaker than even she had deemed it with views narrow she had feared the third part of this volume contains some letters to friends which were never written the public eye but are necessary to complete far can now be done the narrative of her residence abroad some few of these have already appeared in her memoirs work i can not too warmly recommend to those who would know my sister character many more of her letters may be there found equally worthy of perusal but not so necessary to complete the history of events in italy the fourth part contains the details of that shipwreck which caused mourning not only in the hearts of her kindred but of the many who knew and loved her these with some poems commemorative of her character and eventful death form sad but ﬁtting close to book which records her european journeyings and her voyage to home which proved to be not in this land where were waiting warm hearts to bid her welcome but one in land yet freer better than this where she can be less loved by the angels by our saviour and the inﬁnite father after the copy this volume had been sent to the press it was found necessary to omit some portions of the work in the republication too much matter had been furnished volume of reasonable size the editor made these omissions with much reluctance but the desire to bring record of madame ossoli journeyings within the compass of one volume outweighed that reluctance he believes the omissions have been made in such way not materially to diminish its value especially most which has been omitted will ﬁnd place in another volume he hopes soon to issue containing portion of the miscellaneous writings of madame ossoli all of these omissions that are important occur in the summer on the lakes it being thought better to omit from portion of the work which had previously been before the public in book form the episodical nature of that work too enabled the editor to make omissions without in any way marring its unity these omissions when other than mere verbal ones consist of extracts from books which she read in relation to the indians an account of and translation from the seeress of prevorst german work which had not then but has since been translated into english and republished in this country few extracts from letters and poems sent to her by friends while she was in the west one of which poems has been since publish ed elsewhere by its author and the story of marianna great portion of which may be found in my sister memoirs and also lines to edith short poem marianna and lines to edith will probably be republished in another volume from the letters of madame ossoli in parts ii and iii omissions have been made other than verbal or when pertaining to triﬂing incidents having only temporary interest nothing in any portion of the book recording my sister own observations or opinions has been omitted or changed the reader too will notice that pg viii pg ix pg x at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https affecting the unity of the narrative is here wanting the volume even gaining in that respect by the omission of extracts from other writers and of story and short poem not connected in any regard with western life in conclusion the editor would express the sincere hope that this volume may not only be of general interest but inspire its readers with an increased love of republican institutions and an earnest purpose to seek the removal of every national wrong which hinders our beloved country from being perfect example and hearty helper of other nations in their struggles liberty may it something also to remove misapprehension of the motives character and action of those noble patriots of italy who strove though time vainly to make their country free and to deepen the sympathy which every true american should feel with faithful men everywhere who by art are seeking to reﬁne by philanthropic

since you are to share with such may be made on the pages of my life during this summer wanderings i should not be quite silent to this magniﬁcent prologue to the yet unknown drama yet i like others have little to say where the spectacle is once great enough to ﬁll the whole life and supersede thought giving us only its own presence it is good to be here is the best the simplest expression that occurs to the mind we have been here eight days and i am quite willing to go away so great sight soon satisﬁes making us content with itself and with what is less than itself our desires once realized haunt us again less readily having lived one day we would depart and become worthy to live another we have not been fortunate in weather there can not be too much or too warm sunlight this scene and the skies have been lowering with cold unkind winds my nerves too much braced up by such an atmosphere not well bear the continual stress of sight and sound here there is escape from the weight of perpetual creation all other forms and motions come and go the tide rises and recedes the wind at its mightiest moves in gales and gusts but here is really an incessant an indefatigable motion awake or asleep there is escape still this rushing round you and through you it is in this way i have most felt the grandeur eternal if not inﬁnite at times secondary music rises the cataract seems to seize its own rhythm and sing it over again so that the ear and soul are roused by double vibration this is some effect of the wind causing echoes to the thundering anthem it is very sublime giving the effect of spiritual repetition through all the spheres pg 3 pg 4 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https i ﬁrst came i felt nothing but quiet satisfaction i found that draw ings the panorama had given clear notion of the position and proportions of all objects here i knew where to look everything and everything looked i thought it would long ago i was looking from with friend at one of the ﬁnest sunsets that ever enriched this world little cowboy trudging along wondered what we could be gazing at after spying about some time he found it could only be the sunset and looking too moment he said approvingly that sun looks well enough speech worthy of shakespeare cloten or the infant mercury up to everything from the cradle you please to take it even such familiarity worthy of jonathan our national hero in prince palace or stumping he boasts to have done up the vatican stairs into the pope presence in my old boots i felt here it looks really well enough i felt and was inclined you suggested to give my approbation to the one object in the world that would not disappoint but all great expression which on superﬁcial survey seems so easy well so simple furnishes after while to the faithful observer its own standard by which to appreciate it daily these proportions widened and towered more and more upon my sight and i got at last proper foreground these sublime distances before coming away i think i really saw the full wonder of the scene after while it so drew into itself to inspire an undeﬁned dread such i never knew before such may be felt when death is about to usher us into new existence the perpetual trampling of the waters seized my senses i felt that other sound however near could be heard and would start and look behind foe i realized the identity of that mood of nature in which these waters were poured down with such absorbing force with that in which the indian was shaped on the same soil continually upon my mind came unso ught and unwelcome images such never haunted it before of naked savages stealin g behind with uplifted tomahawks again and again this illusion recurred and even after i had thought it over and tried to shake it of f i could not help starting and looking behind picture the falls can only be seen from the british side there they are seen in their veils and at sufﬁcient distance to appreciate the magical effects of these and the light and shade from the boat you cross the effects and contrasts are more melodramatic on the road back from the whirlpool we saw them reduced picture with delight but what i liked best was to sit on table rock close to the great fall there all power of observing details all separate consciousness was quite lost once just i had seated myself there man came to take his ﬁrst look he walked close up to the fall and after looking at it moment with an air if thinkin g how he could best appropriate it to his own use he spat into it this trait seemed wholly worthy of an age whose love of utility is such that the prince puckler muskau suggests the probability of men coming to put the bodies of their dead parents in the ﬁelds to fertilize them and of country such dickens has described but these will not i hope be seen on the historic page to be truly the age or truly the america little leaven is leavening the whole mass other bread the whirlpool i like very much it is seen to advantage after the great falls it is so sternly solemn the river can not look more imperturbable almost sullen in its marble green than it does just below the great fall but the slight circles that mark the hidden vorte x seem to whisper mysteries the thundering voice above could not proclaim meaning untold ever it is fearful too to know you look that whatever has been swallowed by the cataract is like to rise suddenly to light here whether uprooted tree or body of man or bird pg 5 pg 6 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https rapids enchanted far beyond what i expected they are so swift that they cease to seem so you can think only of their beauty the fountain beyond the moss islands i discovered myself and thought it some time an accidental beauty which it would not to leave lest i might never see it again after i found it permanent i returned many times to watch the play of its crest in the little waterfall beyond nature seems she often does to have made study some larger design she delights in this sketch within sketch dream within dream wherever we see it the lines of the great buttress in the fragment of stone the hues of the waterfall copied in the ﬂowers that star its bordering mosses we are delighted all the lineaments become ﬂuent and we mould the scene in congenial thought with its genius people complain of the buildings at niagara and fear to see it further deformed i can not sympathize with such an apprehension the spectacle is capable of swallowing up all such objects they are not seen in the great whole more than an earthworm in wide ﬁeld the beautiful wood on goat island is full of ﬂowers many of the fairest love to homage here the and are in bloom now the former white pink green purple copying the rainbow of the fall and ﬁt to make garland its presiding deity when he walks the land they are of imperial size and shaped like stones diadem of the i did not raise one green tent without ﬁnding ﬂower beneath and now farewell niagara i have seen thee and i think all who come here must in some sort see thee thou art not to be got rid of easily the stars i will be here again beneath some ﬂooding july moon and sun owing to the absence of light i have seen the rainbow only two or three times by day the lunar bow not at all however the imperial presence needs not its crown though illustrated by it general porter and jack downing were not unsuitable ﬁgures here the former heroically planted the bridges by which we cross to goat island and the genius has punished his temerity with deafness which must i think have come upon him when he sunk the ﬁrst stone in the rapids jack seemed an acute and entertaining representative of jonathan come to look at his great water he told us all about the americanisms of the spectacle that is to say the battles that have been fough t here it seems strange that men could ﬁght in such place but temple can still the personal griefs and strifes in the breasts of its visitors less strange is the fact that in this neighborhood an eagle should be chained plaything when child i used often to stand at window from which i could see an eagle chained in the balcony of museum the people used to poke at it with sticks and my childish heart would swell with indignation i saw their insults and the mien with which they were borne by the its eye was dull and its plumage soiled and shabby yet in its form and attitude all the king was visible though sorrowful and dethroned i never saw another of the family till when passing through the notch of the white mountains at that moment glowing before us in all the panoply of sunset the driver shouted look there and following with our eyes his ﬁnger we saw soaring slow in majestic poise above the highest summit the bird of jove it was glorious sight yet i know not that i felt more on seeing the bird in all its natura l freedom and royalty than when imprisoned and insulted he had ﬁlled my early thoughts with the byronic silent rages of misanthropy now again i saw him captive and addressed by the vulgar with the langu age they seem to ﬁnd most appropriate to such occasions of thrusts and blows silently his head averted he ignored their existence plotinus or sophocles might that of modern reviewer probably he listened to the voice of the cataract and felt that congeni al powers ﬂowed free and was consoled though his own wing was broken the story of the recluse of niagara interested little it is wonderful that men not oftener attach their lives to localities of great beauty when once deeply penetrated pg 7 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https will let themselves so easily be borne away by the general stream of things to live anywhere and anyhow but there is something ludicrous in being the hermit of place unlike francis in his where none but the stars and rising sun ever saw him there is also guide to the falls who wears his title labelled on his hat otherwise indeed one might soon think of asking gentleman usher to point out the moon yet why should we wonder at such when we have commentaries on shakespeare and harmonies of the gospels and now you have the little all i have to write can it interest you to one who has enjoyed the full life of any scene of any hour what thoughts can be recorded about it seem like the commas and semicolons in the paragraph stops yet i suppose it is not so to the absent at least i have read things written about niagara music and the like that interested once i was moved by greenwood remark that he could not realize this marvel till opening his eyes the next morning after he had seen it his doubt to the possibility of its being still there taught him what he had exper ienced i remember this now with pleasure though or because it is exactly the opposite to what i myself felt all greatness affects different minds each in its own particular kind and the variations of testimony mark the truth of i will here add brief narrative of the experience of another being much better than anything i could write because more simple and individual now that i have left this and the emotions it excited are past it seems not so much like profanation to analyze my feelings to recall minutely and accurately the effect of this manifestation of the eternal but one should go to such scene prepared to yield entirely to its inﬂuences to forget one little self and one little mind to see miserable worm creep to the brink of this falling world of waters and watch the trembling of its own petty bosom and fancy that this is made alone to act upon him i rode up to the neighborhood of the falls solemn awe imperceptibly stole over and the deep sound of the rapids prepared my mind the lofty emotions to be experienced when i reached the hotel i felt strange indifference about seeing the aspiration of my life hopes i lounged about the rooms read the upon the walls looked over the register and ﬁnding the name of an acquaintance sent to see if he was still there what this hesitation arose from i know not perhaps it was feeling of my unworthiness to enter this temple which nature has erected to its god at last slowly and thoughtfully i walked down to the bridge leading to goat island and when i stood upon this frail support and saw quarter of mile of tumbling rushing rapids and heard their everlasting roar my emotions overpowered choking sensation rose to my throat thrill rushed through my veins my blood ran rippling to my ﬁngers ends this was the climax of the effect which the falls produced upon neither the american nor the british fall moved did these rapids the magniﬁcence the sublimity of the latter i was prepared by descriptions and by paintings when i arrived in sight of them i merely felt ah yes here is the fall just i have seen it in picture when i arrived at the terrapin bridge i expected to be overwhelmed to retire trembling from this giddy eminenc and gaze with unlimited wonder and awe upon the immense mass rolling on and on but somehow or other i thought only of comparing the effect on my mind with what i had read and heard i looked short time and then with almost feeling of disappointment turned to go to the other points of view to see if i was not mistaken in not feeling any surpassing emotion at this sight but from the foot of biddle stairs and the middle of the river and from below the table rock it was still barren barren all pg 8 pg 9 pg 10 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https with my stupidity in feeling most moved in the wrong place i turned away to the hotel determined to set off buffalo that afternoon but the stage did not go and after nightfall there was splendid moon i went down to the bridge and leaned over the parapet where the boiling rapids came down in their might it was grand and it was also gorgeous the yellow rays of the moon made the broken waves appear like auburn tresses twining around the black rocks but they did not inspire before i felt foreboding of mightier emotion to rise up and swallow all others and i passed on to the terrapin bridge everything was changed the misty apparition had taken off its colored crown which it had worn by day and bow of silvery white spanned its summit the moonlight gave poetical indeﬁniteness to the distant parts of the waters and while the rapids were glancing in her beams the river below the falls was black night save where the reﬂection of the sky gave it the appearance of shield of blued steel gaping tourists loitered eyeing with their glasses or sketching on cards the hoary locks of the ancient all tended to harmonize with the natural grandeur of the scene i gazed long i saw how here mutability and unchangeableness were united i surveyed the conspiring waters rushing against the rocky ledge to overthrow it at one mad plunge till like toppling ambition themselves they fall on t other side expanding into foam ere they reach the deep channel where they creep submissively away then arose in my breast genuine admiration and humble adoration of the being who was the architect of this and of all happy were the ﬁrst discoverers of niaga ra those who could come unawares upon this view and upon that whose feelings were entirely their own with what gusto does father hennepin describe this great downfall of water this vast and prodigious cadence of water which falls down after surprising and astonishing manner insomuch that the universe does not afford its parallel is true italy and swedeland boast of some such things but we may well say that they be sorry patterns when compared with this of which we now speak footnote b return somewhat avails in one regard the mere sight of beauty without the union of feeling therewith carried away in memory it hangs there in the lonely hall picture and may some time its message i trust it may be so in my case i saw every object far more clearly than if i had been moved and ﬁlled with the presence and my recollections are equally distinct and vivid extracted from manuscript notes of this journey left by margaret chapter ii the apaw grove scene steamboa to leave coming on passengers bustling their boys persecuting everybody with their newspapers and and huddled up in forlorn corner behind large heavy rain falling water water everywhere after niagara one would like dry strip of existence and at any rate it is quite enough to have it under foot without having it overhead in this way ah not abuse the gentle element it is hardly possible to have too much of it and indeed if i were obliged to choose amid the four it would be the one in which i could bear conﬁnement best you would make pretty undine to be sure pg 11 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https nay i only offered myself triton boisterous triton of the sounding shell you i suppose would be salamander rather that is too equivocal position whether in modern mythology or hoffman tales i should choose to be gnome

talk if you had always lived in that wild unproﬁtable element you are so fond of where all things glitter and nothing is gold all show and substance my people work in the secret and their works praise them in the open light they remain in the dark because only there such marvels could be bred you call them mean they not spend their energies on their own growth or their own play but to feed the veins of mother earth with permanent splendors very dif ferent from what she shows on the surface think of passing life not merely in heaping together but making gold of all dreams that of the alchemist is the most poetical he looked at the ﬁnest symbol gold says one of our friends is the hidden light of the earth it crowns the mineral wine the vegetable order being the last expression of vital ener gy have you paid your passage yes and in gold not in shells or pebbles really wise gnome would scoff at the water the beautiful water the spirit of man is like the water and like the air and ﬁre less yes but not like the earth this creature chosen dwelling the earth is spirit made fruitful and its heartbeats are told in gold and wine oh it is shocking to hear such sentiments in these times i thought that bacchic energy of yours was long since repressed i have only learned to mix water with my wine and stamp upon my gold the heads of kings or the hieroglyphics of worship but since i have learnt to mix with water let hear what you have to say in praise of your favorite from water venus was born what more would you have it is the mother of beauty the girdle of earth and the marriage of nations without any of that poetry it is enough i think that it is the great artist turning all objects that approach it to picture true object that touches it whether it be the cart that ploughs the wave weed or the boat or plank that rides upon it but is brought at once from the demesne of coarse utilities into that of picture all trades all callings become picturesque by the water side or on the water the soil the slovenliness is washed out of every calling by its touch all are picturesque are poetical their very slang is poetry the reasons that are complex pg 12 pg 13 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https the reason is that there can be plodding groping words and motions on my water there are on your earth there is time chance them where all moves so rapidly though so smoothly everything connected with water must be like itself forcible but clear that is why is so poetical there is word everything and every act and thing and an act every word seamen must speak quick and bold but also with utmost precision they can not reef and brace other than in homeric dialect steamboat bell rings but i must say quick what

the wet the chill and steamboat smell in their new world of novels next day when we stopped at cleveland the storm was just clearing up ascending the bluff we had one of the ﬁnest views of the lake that could have been wished the varying depths of these lakes give to their surface great variety of coloring and beneath this wild sky and changeful light the waters presented kaleidoscopic variety of hues rich but mournful i admire these bluffs of red crumbling earth here land and water meet under very different auspices from those of the coast to which i have been accustomed there they meet tenderly to challenge and proudly to refuse though not in fact repel but here they meet to mingle are always rushing together and changing places new creation takes place beneath the eye the weather grew gradually clearer but not bright yet we could see the shore and appreciate the extent of these noble waters coming up the river clair we saw indians the ﬁrst time they were camped out on the bank it was twilight and their blanketed forms in listless groups or stealing along the bank with lounge and stride so different in its wildness from the rudeness of the white settler gave the ﬁrst feeling that i really approached the west the people on the boat were almost all seeking their fortunes they had brought with them their habits of calculation their cautious manners their love of polemics it grieved to hear these immigrants who were to be the fathers of new race all from the old man down to the little girl talking not of what they should but of what they should get in the new scene it was to them prospect not of the unfolding nobler energies but of more ease and larger accumulation it wearied too to hear trinity and unity discussed in the poor narrow doctrinal way on these free waters but that will soon cease there is not time this clash of opinions in the west where the clash of material interests is so noisy they will need the spirit of religion more than ever to guide them but will ﬁnd less time than before its doctrine this change was to who am tired of the war of words on these subjects and believe it only sows the wind to reap the whirlwind refreshing but i argue nothing from it there is nothing real in the freedom of thought at the west is from the position of men lives not the state of their minds so soon they have time unless they grow better meanwhile they will cavil and criticise and judge other men by their own standard and outrage the law of love every way just they with us we reached mackinaw the evening of the third day but to my great disappoi ntment it was too late and too rainy to go ashore the beauty of the island though seen under the most unfavorable circumstances did not disappoint my but i shall see it to more purpose on my return the day has passed dully cold rain preventing us from keeping out in the air my thoughts have been dwelling on story told when we were off detroit this morning by and whose moral beauty touched profoundly pg 14 pg 15 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https some years ago said my father and mother stopped to dine at detroit short time before dinner my father met in the hall captain friend of his youthful days he had loved extremely did many who knew him and had not been surprised to hear of the distinction and popular esteem which his wide knowledge talents and noble temper commanded he went onward in the world was every way ﬁtted to succeed his aims were high but not too high his powers suggested by an instinct of his own capacities not by an ideal standard drawn from culture though steadfast in his course it was not to overrun others his wise was less them than himself he was thoroughly the gentleman gentle because manly and was striking instance that where there is strength sincere courtesy there is need of other adaptation to the character of others to make one way freely and gracefully through the crowd my father was delighted to see him and after short parley in the hall will dine together he cried we shall have time to tell all our stories hesitated moment then said wife is with mine with said my father well they too will have an opportunity of getting acquainted and can entertain one another if they get tired of our college stories acquiesced with grave bow and shortly after they all met in the oom my father was much surprised at the appearance of he had heard that his friend married abroad but nothing further and he was not prepared to see the calm digniﬁed with woman on his arm still hands ome indeed but whose coarse and imperious expression showed low habits of mind her exaggerated dress and gesture did of education nor could there be greater contrast to my mother who though understanding her claims and place with the certainty of lady was soft and retiring in an uncommon degree however there was time to wonder or fancy they sat down and engaged in conversation without much vivacity but with his usual ease the ﬁrst quarter of an hour passed well enough but soon it was observable that was drinking glass after glass of wine to an extent few gentlemen did even then and soon that she was actually excited by it before this her manner had been brusque if not contemptuous towards her new acquaintance now it became towards my mother especially quite rude presently she took up some slight remark made by my mother which though it did not naturally mean anything of the sort could be twisted into some reﬂection upon england and made it handle ﬁrst of vulgar sarcasm and then upon my mother defending herself with some surprise and gentle dignity hurled upon her volley of abuse beyond billingsgate my mother confounded by scenes and ideas presented to her mind equally new and painful sat trembling she knew not what to tears rushed into her eyes my father less distressed yet unwilling to outrage the feelings of his friend by doing or saying what his indignation prompted turned an appealing look on p never he often said was the painful expression of that sight effaced from his mind it haunted his dreams and disturbed his waking thoughts sat with his head bent forward and his eyes cast down pale but calm with ﬁxed expression not merely of patient woe but of patient shame which it would not have been thought possible that noble countenance to wear said my father became him at other times he was handsome but then beautiful though of beauty saddened and abashed spiritual light borrowed from the worldly perfection of his mien that illustration by contrast which the penitence of the magdalen does from the glowing earthliness of her charms seeing that he preserved silence while grew still more exasperated my father rose and led his wife to her own room half an hour had passed in painful and wondering surmises when gentle knock was heard at the door and entered equipped journey are just going he said and holding out his hand but without looking at them give pg 16 pg 17 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https they each took his hand and silently pressed it then he went without word more some time passed and they heard now and then of he passed from one army station to another with his uncongenial companion who became it was said constantly more degraded whoever mentioned having seen them wondered at the chance which had yoked him to such woman but yet more at the silent fortitude with which he bore it many blamed him enduring it apparently without efforts to check her others answered that he had probably made such at an earlier period and ﬁnding them unavailing had resigned himself to despair and was too delicate to meet the scandal that with such resistance such woman could of fer must attend formal separation but my father who was not in such haste to come to conclusions and substitute some plausible explanation the truth found something in the look of at that trying moment to which none of these explanations offered key there was in it he felt fortitude but not the fortitude of the hero religious submission above the penitent if not enkindled with the enthusiasm of the martyr i have said that my father was not one of those who are ready to substitute specious explanations truth and those who are thus abstinent rarely lay their hand on thread without making it clew such man like the dexterous weaver lets not one color go till ire ﬁnds that which matches it in the pattern keeps on weaving but chooses his shades and my father found at last what he wanted to make out the pattern himself he met lady who had been intimate with both himself and in early days and ﬁnding she had seen the latter abroad asked if she knew the circumstances of the marriage circumstances of the act which sealed the misery of our friend i know she said much in the dark any one about the motives that led to it were quite intimate with in london and he was our most delightful companion he was then in the full ﬂower of the varied accomplishments which set off his ﬁne manners and digniﬁed character joined towards those he loved with certain soft willingness which gives the desirable chivalry to man none was more clear of choice where his personal affections were not touched but where they were it cost him pain to say on the slightest occasion i have thought this must have had some connec tion with the mystery of his misfortunes day he called on and without any preface asked if i would be present next day at his marriage i was so surprised and so unpleasantly surprised that i did not at ﬁrst answer word we had been on terms so familiar that i thought i knew all about him yet had never dreamed of his having an attachment and though i had never inquir ed on the subject yet this reserve where perfect openness had been supposed and really on my side existed seemed to kind of treachery then it is never pleasant to know that heart on which we have some claim is to be given to another we can not tell how it will affect our own relations with person it may strengthen or it may swallow up other affections the crisis is hazardous and our ﬁrst thought on such an occasion is too often ourselves least mine was seeing silent he repeated his question to whom said i are you to be married that he replied i can not tell you he was moment silent then continued with an impassive look of cold that affected with strange sadness the name of the person you will hear of course at the time but more i can not tell you i need however the presence not only of legal but of respectable and friendly witnesses i have hoped you and your husband would this kindness will you something in his manner made it impossible to refuse i answered before i knew i was going to speak w will and he left i will not weary you with telling how i harassed myself and my husband who was however scarce less interested with doubts and conjectures sufﬁce it that next morning came and took us in carriage to distant church we had just entered the porch when cart such fruit and vegetables are brought to market in drove up pg 18 pg 19 at home and abroad or things and

handsome yet something in her expression displeased the moment i looked upon her meanwhile the ceremony was going on and at its close introduced us to the bride and we all went to the door good by fanny said the elderly woman the replied without any token of affection or emotion the woman got into the cart and drove away that time i saw but little of or his wife i took our mutual friends to see her and they were civil to her his sake curiosity was very much excited but entirely bafﬂed one of course dared speak to on the subject and other means could be found of solving the riddle treated his wife with grave and kind politeness but it was always obvious that they had nothing in common between them her manners and tastes were not at that time gross but her character showed itself hard and material she was fond of riding and spent much time so her style in this and in dress seemed the opposite of but he indulged all her wishes while himself he plunged into his own pursuits time he seemed if not happy not positively unhappy but after few years fell into the habit of drinking and then such scenes you witnessed grew frequent i have often heard of them and always that sat you describe him his head bowed down and perfectly silent all through whatever might be done or whoever be present and always his aspect has inspired such sympathy that person has questioned him or resented her insults but merely got out of the way soon possible and long penance said my father after some minutes musing an hour of passion probably his only error that your explanation said the lady improbable might err but not be led beyond himself i know that his cool gray eye and calm complexion seemed to say so but different story is told by the lip that could tremble and showed what ﬂashes might pierce those deep blue heavens and when these beings swerve aside it is to fall down precipice their narrow path lies over such but he was not one to sin without making brave atonement and that it had become holy one was written on that downcast brow the fourth day on these waters the weather was milder and brighter so that we could now see them to some purpose at night the moon was clear and the ﬁrst time from the upper deck i saw one of the great steamboats come majestically up it was glowing with lights looking and sagacious in its heavy motion it seemed dowager queen and this motion with its solemn pulse and determined sweep becomes these smooth waters especially at night much the dip of the the long billows of the ocean but it was not so soon that i learned to appreciate the lake scenery it was only after daily and careless familiarity that i entered into its beauty nature always refuses to be seen by being stared at like bonaparte she dischar ges her face of all expression when she catches the eye of impertinent curiosity ﬁxed on her but he who has gone to sleep in childish ease on her lap or leaned an aching brow upon her breast seeking there comfort with full trust from mother will see all mother beauty in the look she bends upon him later i felt that i had really seen these regions and shall speak of them again in the afternoon we went on shore at the manitou islands where the boat stops to wood one lives here except the steamboats i had thought of such position from its mixture of profound solitude with service to the great world pg 20 pg 21

aid of such assertions that he sometimes yields to the temptation of making out story they admitted however what from my feelings i was sure of that he is true to the spirit of the scene and that far better view can be got from him than from any source at present existing of the indian tribes of the far west and of the country where their inheritance lay murray travels i read and was charmed by their accuracy and clear broad tone he is the only englishman that seems to have traversed these regions man simply not john bull he deserves to belong to an aristocracy he showed his title to it more when left without guide in the wildern ess than he can at the court of victoria he has himself poetic force at description but it is easy to make images from his hints yet we believe the indian can not be locked at truly except by poetic eye the pawnees doubt are such he describes them ﬁlthy in their habits and treacherous in their character but some would have seen and seen truly more beauty and dignity than he does with all his manliness and fairness of mind however his one ﬁne old man is enough to redeem the rest and is perha ps tire relic of better day phocion among the pawnees schoolcraft algic researches is valuable book though worse use could hardly have been made of such ﬁne material had the mythological or hunting stories of the indians been written down exactly they were received from the lips of the narrators the collection could not have been surpassed in interest both the wild charm they carry with them and the light they throw on peculiar modiﬁcation of life and mind it is though the incidents have an air of originality and pertinence to the occasion that gives us conﬁdence that they have not been altered the phraseology in which they were expressed has been entirely set aside and the ﬂimsy graces common to the style of annuals and souvenirs substituted the spartan brevity and sinewy grasp of indian speech we can just guess what might have been there we can detect the ﬁne proportions of the brave whom the bad taste of some white patron has arranged in coat hat and pantaloons the few stories jameson wrote out though to these also sentimental air has been given offend much less in that way than is common in this book what would we not give completely faithful versio n of some among them yet with all these drawbacks we can not doubt from

read some the ﬁrst some the second time with increased interest now that i was to meet such people he received his materials from though the books are pleasing from their grace and luminous arrangement yet with the exception of the tour to the prairies they have stereotype air they lack the breath the glow the charming minute traits of living presence his scenery is only ﬁt to be glanced at from dioramic distance his indians are academic ﬁgures only he would have made the best of pictures if he could have used his own eyes studies and sketches it is his success is wonderful but inadequate mckenney tour to the lakes is the dullest of books yet faithful and quiet and gives some facts not to be met with everywhere i also read collection of indian anecdotes and speeches the worst compiled and arranged book possible yet not withou t clews of some value all these books i read in anticipation of on lake superior far the pictured rocks and though i was afterwards compelled to give up this project they aided in judging of what i subsequently saw and heard of the indians in chicago i ﬁrst saw the beautiful they were in their glory the ﬁrst ten days we were there the golden and the ﬂowers the ﬂower i was taught afterwards by an indian girl to call wickapee and she told too that its splendors had useful side it was used by the indians remedy an illness to which they were subject beside these brilliant ﬂowers which gemmed and gilt the grass in sunny afternoon drive near the blue lake between the low and the narrow beach stimulated whether sensuously by the optic nerve unused to so much gold and crimson with such tender green or symbolically through some meaning dimly seen in the ﬂowers i enjoyed sort of exultation never felt before and the ﬁrst drive amid the ﬂowers gave anticipation of the beauty of the prairies at ﬁrst the prairie seemed to speak of the very desolation of dulness after sweeping over the vast monotony of the lakes to come to this monotony of land with all around limitless horizon walk and walk and run but never climb oh it was too dreary any but hollander to bear how the eye greeted the approach of sail or the smoke of steamboat it seemed that anything so animated must come from better land where mountains gave religion to the scene the only thing i liked at ﬁrst to was to trace with slow and unexpecting step the narrow margin of the lake sometimes heavy swell gave it expression at others only its varied coloring which i found more admirable every day and which gave it an air of mirage instead of the vastness of ocean then there was grandeur in the feeling that i might continue that walk if i had any mode of conveyance to save fatigue hundreds of miles without an obstacle and without change but after i had ridden out and seen the ﬂowers and observed the sun set with that calmness seen only in the prairies and tire cattle winding slowly to their homes in the island groves peaceful of sights began to love because i began to know tire scene and shrank longer from the encircling vastness it is always thus with the new form of life we must learn to look at it by its own standard at ﬁrst doubt my accustomed eye kept saying if the mind did not what distant mountains what valleys but after while i would ascend the roof of the house where we lived and pass many hours needing sight but the moon reigning in the heavens or starlight falling upon the lake till all the lights were out in the island grove of men beneath my feet and felt nearer heaven that there was nothing but this pg 25 pg 26 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https still reception on the earth towering mountains deep nothing but plain earth and water bathed in light sunset seen from that place presented most generally ﬂaky clouds of the softest serenity one night star shot madly from its sphere and it had fair chance to be seen but that serenity could not be astonished yes it was peculiar beauty that of those sunsets and moonlights on the levels of chicago which chamouny or the trosachs could not make notwithstanding all the attractions i thus found out by degrees on the ﬂat shores of the lake i was delighted when i found myself really on my way into the country an excursion of two or three weeks we set forth in strong wagon almost large and with the look of those used elsewhere transporting caravans of wild beasts loaded with everything we might want in case nobody would give it to us buying and selling were longer to be counted on pair of strong horses able and willing to force their way through and amid stumps and guide equally admirable marshal and companion who knew by heart the country and its history both natural and artiﬁcial and whose clear hunter eye needed neither road nor goal to guide it to all the spots where beauty best loves to dwell add to this the ﬁnest weather and such country i had never seen even in my dreams although these dreams had been haunted by wishes just such one and you may judge whether years of dulness might not by these bright days be redeemed and sweetness be shed over all thoughts of the west the ﬁrst day brought us through woods rich in the and lupine and plains whose soft expanse was continually touched with expression by the slow moving clouds which sweep over with their shadows and beneath the surface rolls and ﬂuctuates to the eye dark hollows seem to glide along and chase the sunny ridges to the banks of the fox river sweet and graceful stream we readied geneva just in time to escape

are cut in every direction it is this new country large and handsome dwelling but round it are its barns and with cattle and poultry these however in the framework of wood have very picturesque and pleasing effect there is that mixture of culture and rudeness in the aspect of things which gives feeling of freedom not of confusion i wish it were possible to give some idea of this scene viewed by the earliest freshness of dewy dawn this habitation of man seemed like nest in the grass so thoroughly were the buildings and all the objects of human care harmonized with what was natural the tall

to vanish from eyes which look too much on shops and streets and the vulgarities of city parties next day we crossed the river we ladies crossed on little from which we could look down the stream and see the wagon pass over at the ford black thunder cloud was coming up the sky and waters heavy with expectation the motion of the wagon with its white cover and the laboring horses gave just the due interest to the picture because it seemed if they would not have time to cross before the storm came on however they did get across and we were mile or two on our way before the violent shower obliged us to take refuge in solitary house upon the prairie in this country it is pleasant to stop to go on to lose your way to ﬁnd it the variety in the population gives you chance fresh entertainment in

wear lovelier aspect than earth did this afternoon after the clearing up of the shower we traversed the blooming plain unmarked by any road only the friendly track of wheels which bent not broke the

castles seem to have been burnt the enclosures taken down but the velvet lawns the ﬂower the stately parks scattered at graceful intervals by the decorous hand of art the frequent deer and the peaceful herd of cattle that make picture of the plain all suggest more of the masterly mind of man than the prodigal but careless motherly love of nature especially is this true of the rock river

buttress arch and clustered columns along the face of such crumbling rocks swallows nests are clustered thick cities and eagles and deer not disdain their summits one morning out in the boat along the base of these rocks it was amusing and affecting too to see these swallows put their heads out to look at us there was something very hospitable about it if man had never shown himself tyrant near

desirable in its independence its beautiful retirement and means of beneﬁt to others his park his he found already prepared he had only to make an avenue through it this brought us to the house by drive which in the heat of noon seemed long though afterwards in the cool of morning and evening delightful this is that part of the world large and commodious dwelling near it stands the in where its master lived while it was building very ornamental accessory in front of the house was lawn adorned by the most graceful trees few of these had been taken out to give full view of the river gliding through banks such i have described on this bend the bank is high and bold so from the house or the lawn the view was very rich and commanding but if you descended ravine at the side to the water edge you found there long walk on the narrow shore with wall above of the richest hanging wood in which they said the deer lay hid i never saw one but often fancied that i heard them rustling at daybreak by these bright clear waters stretching out in such smiling promise where sound broke the deep and blissful seclusio n unless now and then this rustling or the splash of some ﬁsh little gayer than the others it seemed not necessary to have any better heaven or fuller expression of love and freedom than in the mood of nature here then leaving the bank you would walk far and yet farther through long grassy paths full of the most brilliant also the most delicate ﬂowers the brilliant are more common on the prairie but both kinds loved this place amid the grass of the lawn with profusion of wild strawberries we greeted also familiar love the scottish harebell the gentlest and most touching form of the ﬂower world the master of the house was absent but with kindness beyond thanks had offered

there was peculiar charm in coming here where the choice of location and the unobtrusive good taste of all the arrangements showed such intelligent appre ciation of the spirit of the scene after

willing to give the labor requisite to insure any valuable use of the instrument but out here where the ladies have so much less leisure it is still less desirable add to this they never know how to tune their own instruments and persons seldom visit them who can so these pianos are constantly out of tune and would spoil the ear of one who began by having any the guitar or some portable

night after night it rose in cloudless sky above this majestic sea the heat was excessive so that there was pg 51 pg 52 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret

waters which then seemed boundless the most picturesque objects to be seen from chicago on the inland side were the lines of hoosier wagons these rude farmers the large ﬁrst product of the soil travel leisurely along sleeping in their wagons by night eating only what they bring with them in the town they observe the same plan and trouble luxurious hotel board and lodging here they look like foreign peasantry and contrast well with the many germans dutch and irish in the country it is very pretty to see them prepared to camp out at night their horses taken out of harness and they lounging under the trees enjoying the evening meal on the it is ﬁne to see the great boats come panting in from their rapid and marvellous journey especially at night the motion of their lights is very majestic when the favorite boats the great western and illinois are going out the town is thronged with people from the south and farther west to go in them these moonlight nights i would hear the french rippling and ﬂuttering familiarly amid the rude ups and downs of the hoosier dialect at the hotel table were daily to be seen new faces and new stories to be learned and any one who has large acquaintance may be pretty sure of meeting some of them here in the course of few days at chicago i read again philip van artevelde and certain passages in it will always be in my mind associated with the deep sound of the lake heard in the night i used to read short time at night and then open the blind to look out the moon would be full upon the lake and the calm breath pure light and the deep voice harmonized

whom this world is mere spectacle or ﬂeeting shadow not great solemn game to be played with good heed its stakes are of eternal value yet who if his own play be true heeds not what he loses by the falsehood of others man who hives from the past yet knows that its honey can but moderately avail him whose comprehensive eye scans the present neither infatuated by its golden lures nor chilled by its many ventures who possesses prescience the wise man must but not so far to be driven mad by the gift which discerns there is such man america the thought which ur ges her on will be expressed now

return were granted i have ﬁxed my attention almost exclusively on the picturesque beauty of this region it was so new so inspiring but i ought to have been more interested in the housekeeping of this magniﬁcen t state in the education she is giving her children in their prospects illinois is at present of reproach among the nations the careless prodigal course by which in early youth she has endangered her honor but you can not look about you there without seeing that there are resources abundant to retrieve and soon to retrieve far greater errors if they are only directed with wisdom would that the simple maxim that honesty is the best policy might be laid to heart that sense of the true aim of life might elevate the tone of politics and trade till public and private honor became identical that the western man in that crowded and exciting life pg 53 pg 54 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https develops his faculties so fully might not forget that better part which could not be taken from him that the western woman might take that interest and acquire that light the education of the children which she alone has leisure this is indeed the great problem of the place and time if the next generation be well prepared their work ambitious of good and skilful to achieve it the children of the present settlers may be leaven enough the mass constantly increasing by immigration and how much is this needed where those rude foreigners can so little understand the best interests of the land they seek bread and shelter it would be happiness to aid in this good work and interweave the white and golden threads into the fate of illinois it would be work worthy the devotion of any mind in the little that i saw was large proportion of intelligence activity and kind feeling but if there was much serious laying to heart of the true purposes of life it did not appear in the tone of conversation having before the illinois i ﬁnd there mentioned visionary one of the men i should think of able to be truly valuable settler in new and great country birkbeck of england since my return i have read his journe y to and letters from illinois i see nothing promised there that will not surely belong to the man who knows how to seek it birkbeck was an enlightened philanthropist the rather that he did not wish to sacriﬁce himself to his but to beneﬁt them with all he had and was and wished he thought all the creatures of divine love ought to be happy and ought to be good and that his own soul and his own life were not less precious than those of others indeed that to keep these healthy was his only means of healthy inﬂuence but his aims were altogether generous freedom the liberty of law not license not indolence work himself and children and all men but under genial and poetic inﬂuences were his aims how different from those of the new settlers in general and into his mind so long ago shone steadily the two thoughts now so prevalent in thinking and aspiring minds of resist not evil and every man his own priest and the heart the only true church he has lost credit sagacity from accidental circumstances it does not appear that his position was ill chosen or his means disproportioned to his ends had he been sustained by funds from england he had right to expect but through the proﬂigacy of near relative commissioned to collect these dues he was disappointed of them and his paper protested and credit destroyed in our cities before he became aware of his danger still though more slowly and with more difﬁculty he might have succeeded in his designs the english farmer might have made the english settlement model good methods and good aims to all that region had not death prematurely

given by friend expressing in fair picture the character of the man birkbeck was returning from the seat of government whither he had been on public business and was accompanied by his son bradford

swelling of the stream mr b horse was unwilling to plunge into the water so his son offered to go ﬁrst and he followed bradford horse had just gained footing on the opposite shore when he looked back and perceived his father was dismounted struggling in the water and carried down by the current birkbeck could not swim bradfor d could so he dismounted and plunged into the stream to save his father he got to him before he sunk held him up above water and told him to take hold of his collar and he would swim ashore with him did so and bradford exerted all his strength to stem the current and reach the shore at point where they could land but encumbered by his own clothing and his father weight he made progress when perceived this he with his characteristic calmness and resolution gave up his hold of his son and motioning to him to save himself resigned himself to his fate his son reached the shore but was too much overwhelmed by his loss to leave it he was found by some travellers many hours after seated on the margin of the stream with his face in his hands stupeﬁed with grief the body was found and on the countenance was the sweetest smile and bradford said so he smiled upon when he let go and pushed away from him many men can choose the right and best on great occasion but not many can with such ready and serene decision lay aside even life when that is right and best

of the lake is here bold bluff eighty feet in height from its summit is enjoyed noble outlook on the lake little narrow path winds along the edge of the lake below i liked this walk much this high wall of rich earth garlanded on its crest with trees the long ripples of the lake coming up to my feet here standing in the shadow i could appreciate better its magniﬁcent changes of color which are the chief beauties of the but these are indescribable it was ﬁne to ascend into the lighthouse above this bluff and thence watch the thunder clouds which so frequently rose over the lake or the great

dearly loved friends at the next station to those who have neither business nor friends it sometimes gives desolating sense of insigniﬁcance the town promises to be some time ﬁne one it is so well

saw evidently transplanted from the most reﬁned circles to be met in this country there are lures enough in the west people of all kinds enthusiast and the cunning man the naturalist and the lover who

worn the night they pass in rude shantees in particular quarter of the town then walk off into the country mothers carrying their infants the fathers leading the little children by the hand seeking home where their hands may maintain them one morning we set off in their track and travelled day journey into this country fair yet not in that part which i saw comparable in my eyes to the rock river region rich ﬁelds proper grain alternate with oak openings they are called bold various and beautiful were the features of the scene but i saw not those majesti c sweeps those boundless distances those heavenly ﬁelds it was not the same world neither did we travel in the same delig htful manner we were now in nice carriage which must not go off the road fear of breakage with regular coachma n whose chief care was not to tire his horses and who had taste entering ﬁelds in pursuit of or tempting some strange in search of whatever might befall it was pleasant but almost tame new england but charming indeed was the place where we stopped it was in the vicinity of chain of lakes and on the bank of the loveliest little stream called the bark river whic h ﬂowed in rapid amber brightness through ﬁelds and dells and stately knolls of most poetic beauty the little where we slept with its ﬂower in front disturbed the scene more than stray lock on the fair cheek the hospitality of that

and i grieve to say less near the rock river the ﬁend who has every liberty to tempt the happy in this world appeared in the shape of mosquitos and allowed us bodily to enjoy our mental peace one day we ladies gave under the guidance of our host to visiting all the beauties of the adjacent lakes silver and pine lakes on the shore of nomabbin had formerly been one of the ﬁnest indian villages our host said that once he was lying there beneath the bank he saw tall indian standing at gaze on the knoll he lay long time curious to see how long the ﬁgure would maintain its absorption but at last his patience yielded and in moving he made slight noise the indian saw him gave wild snorting sound of indignation and pain and strode away what feelings must consume their hearts at such moments i scarcely see how they can forbear to shoot the white man where he stands but the power of fate is with the white man and the indian feels it this same gentleman told of his travelling through the wilderness with an indian guide he had with him bottle of spirit which he meant to give him in small quantities but the indian once excited wanted the whole at once i would not said give it him i thought if he got really drunk there was an end to his services guide but he persisted and at last tried to take it from i was not armed he was and twice strong but i knew an indian could not resist the look of white man and i ﬁxed my eye steadily on his he bore it moment then his eye fell he let go the bottle i took his gun and threw it to distance after few moments pause i told him to go and fetch it and left it in his hands from that moment he was quite obedient even servi le all the rest of the way this gentleman though in other respec ts of most kindly and liberal heart showed the aversion that the white man soon learns to feel the indian on whom he encroaches the aversion of the injurer him he has degraded after telling the anecdo of his seeing the indian gazing at the seat of his former home thing human feelings the most trying and which one would think would have awakened soft in the present owner of that fair hill which contained the exile the bones of his dead the ashes of his hopes he observed they can not be prevented from straggling back here to their old haunts i wish they could they ought not to be permitted to drive away our game our game heavens the same gentleman showed on slight occasion the true spirit of sportsman or perhaps i might say of man when engaged in any kind of chase showing us some antlers he said this one belonged to majestic creature but this other was the beauty i had been lying long time at watch when at last i heard them come crackling along i lifted my head cautiously they burst through the trees the ﬁrst was magniﬁcent fellow but then i saw coming one the prettiest the most graceful i ever beheld was something so soft and beseeching in its look i chose him at once took aim and shot him dead you see the antlers are not very lar ge it was young but the prettiest creature in the course of this morning drive we visited the gentlemen on their ﬁshing party they hailed us gayly and rowed ashore to show us what ﬁne booty they had disappointment there dull work on the beautiful point of land from which we ﬁrst saw them lived contented woman the only one i heard of out there she was english and said she had seen so much pg

gentle their labors disproportioned to their strength if not to their patience and while their husbands and brothers enjoyed the country in hunting or ﬁshing they found themselves conﬁned to comfortless and laborious life but it need not be so long this afternoon driving about on the banks of these lakes we found the scene all of one kind of loveliness wide graceful wood s and then these ﬁne sheets of water with ﬁne points of land jutting out boldly into them it was lovely but not striking or peculiar all woods suggest pictures the europe an forest with its long glades and green sunny dells naturally suggested the ﬁgures of armed knight on his proud steed or maiden decked in gold and pearl pricking along them on palfrey the green dells of weary palmer sleeping there beside the spring with his head upon his wallet our minds familiar with such ﬁgures peop le with them the new england woods wherever the sunlight falls down longer than usual wherever cleared spot has lain still enough the trees to look friendly with their exposed sides cultivated by the light and the grass to look velvet warm and be embroidered with ﬂowers these western woods suggest different kind of ballad the indian legends have often an air of the wildest solitude has the one lowell has put into verse in his late volume but i did not see those wild woods only such suggest to little romances of love and sorrow like this gunhilda maiden sat beneath the tree her pale cheeks be and she sigheth heavily from forth the wood into the light hunter strides with carol light and glance so bold and bright he careless stopped and eyed the maid why weepest thou he gently said i love thee well be not afraid he takes her hand and leads her on she should have waited there alone he was not her chosen one he leans her head upon his breast she knew was not her home of rest but ah she had been sore distrest the sacred stars looked sadly down the parting moon appeared to frown to see thus dimmed the diamond crown then from the thicket starts deer the huntsman seizing on his spear cries maiden wait thou here she sees him vanish into night she starts from sleep in deep af fright it was not her own true knight though but in dream gunhilda failed though but fancied ill assailed pg 64 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https she but fancied fault bewailed yet thought of day makes dream of night she is not worthy of the knight the inmost altar burns not bright if loneliness thou canst not bear can not the dragon venom dare of the pure meed thou

d us but we resolved to try if we could not visit it before it came on we crossed wide ﬁeld on foot and found the indians amid the trees on shelving bank just we reached them the rain began to fall in torrents with frequent thunderclaps and we had to take refuge in their lodges these were very small being temporary use and we crowded the occupants much among whom were several sick on the damp ground or with only ragged mat between them and it but they showed all the gentle courtesy which marks their demeanor towards the stranger who stands in any need though it was obvious that the visit which inconvenienced them could only have been caused by the most impertinent curiosity they made us comfortable their extreme poverty permitted they seemed to think we would not like to touch them sick girl in the lodge where i was persisted in moving so to give the dry place woman with the sweet melancholy eye of the race kept off the children and wet dogs from even the hem of my garment without their ﬁres smouldered and black kettles hung over them on sticks smoked and seethed in the rain an old indian stood with arms folded looking up to the heavens from which the rain clashed and the thunder reverberated his air was that is more romanesque than roman the indian ponies much excited kept careering through the wood around the encampment and now and then halting suddenly would thrust in their intelligen t though amazed faces if to ask their masters when this awful pother would cease and then after moment rush and trample off again at last we got away well wetted but with picturesque scene memory at house where we stopped to get dry they told us that this wandering band of pottawattamies who had returned on visit either from homesickness or need of relief were extremely destitute the women had been there to see if they could barter food their with which they club their hair behind into form not unlike grecian knot they seemed indeed to have neither food utensils clothes nor bedding nothing but the ground the sky and their own strength little wonder if they drove of f the game part of the same band i had seen in milwaukee on begging dance the effect of this was wild and grotesque they wore much paint and feather indians without paint are poor coots said gentleman who had been great deal with and really liked them and i like the effect of the paint on them it reminds of the gay fantasies of nature with them in milwaukie was chief the ﬁnest indian ﬁgure i saw more than six feet in height erect and of sullen but grand gait and gesture he wore blanket which fell in large folds from his shoulders to his feet did not join in the dance but slowly strode about through the streets ﬁne sight not but real roman he looked unhappy but listlessly unhappy if he felt it was of use to strive or resist while in the neighborhood of these lakes we visited also foreign settlement of great interest here were minds it seemed to comprehend the trust of their new life and if pg 65 pg 66 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https can only stand true to them will derive and bestow great beneﬁts therefrom but sad and sickening to the enthusiast who comes to these shores hoping the tranquil enjoyment of intellectual blessings and the pure happiness of mutual love must be part of the scene that he encounters at ﬁrst he has escaped from the heartlessness of courts to encounter the vulgarity of the mob he has secured solitude but it is lonely deserted solitude amid the abundance of nature he can not from petty but insuperable obstacles procure long time comforts or home but let him come sufﬁciently armed with patience to learn the new spells which the new dragons require and this can only be done on the spot he will not ﬁnally be disappointed of the promised treasure the mob will resolve itself into men yet crude but of good dispositions and capable of good character the solitude will become sufﬁciently enlivened and home grow up at last from the rich sod in this transition state we found one of these homes we approached it seemed the very eden which earth might still afford to pair willing to give up the hackneyed pleasures of the world better and more intimate communion with one another and with beauty the wild road led through wide beautiful woods to the wilder and more beautiful shores of the ﬁnest lake we saw on its waters glittering in the morning sun few indians were paddling to and fro in their light canoes on one of those fair knolls i have so often mentioned stood the cottage beneath trees which stooped if they yet felt brotherhood with its flowers waved birds ﬂuttered round all had the sweetness of happy seclusion all invited to cry to those who inhabited it all hail ye happy ones but on entrance to those evidently rich in personal beauty talents love and courage the aspect of things was rather sad sickness had been with them death care and labor these had not yet blighted them but had turned their gay smiles grave it seemed that hope and joy had given place to resolution how much too was there in them worthless in this place which

would feel the weight of each moment it passed seeing the album full of drawings and verses which bespoke the circle of elegant and affectionate intercourse they had left behind we could not but see

around very strange was this vision of an exalted and sensitive existence which seemed to invade the next sphere in contrast with the spontaneous instinctive life so healthy and so near the ground i had been surveying this was the german book entitled the seeress of concerning the inward life of man and the projection of world of spirits into ours communicated by justinus kerner this book published in germany some twelve years since and which called forth there plenteous dews of admiration plente ous of jeers and scorns i never saw mentioned in any english publication till some year or two since then playful but not sarcastic account of it in the dublin magazine so far excited my curiosity that i procured the book intending to read it so soon i should have some leisure days such this journey has af forded kerner its author is man of distinction in his native land both physician and thinker though always on the side of reverence marvel and mysticism he was known to only through two or three little poems of his in catholic legends which i much admired the ﬁne sense they showed of the beauty of symbols he here gives biography mental and physical of one of the most

till 1847 after this volume was chapter vi mackina reception of of indian duties toward this race late at night we reached this island of mackinaw so famous its beauty and to which i proposed visit of some length it was the last week in august at which time large representation from the chippewa and ottawa tribes are here to receive their annual payments from the american government their habits make travelling easy and inexpensive to them neither being oblig ed to wait steamboats or write to see whether hotels are full they come hither by thousands and those thousands in families secure of accommodation on the beach and food from the lake to make long holiday out of the occasion there were near two thousand encamped on the island already and more arriving every day our boat came in the captain had some rockets let off this greatly excited the indians and their yells and wild cries resounded along the shore except the momentary ﬂash of the rockets it was perfectly dark and my sensations i walked with stranger to strange hotel through the midst of these shrieking savages and heard the pants and snorts of the departing steamer which carried away all my companions were somewhat of the dismal sort though it was pleasant too in the way that everything strange is everything that breaks in upon the routine that so easily incrusts us i had reason to expect room to myself at the hotel but found none and was obliged to take up my rest in the common parlor and circumstance which insured my being an early riser with the ﬁrst rosy streak i was out among my indian neighbors whose lodges honeycombed the beautiful beach that curved away in long fair outline on either side the house they were already on the alert the children creeping out from beneath the blanket door of the lodge the women pounding corn in their rude mortars the young men playing on their pipes i had been much amused when the strain proper to the winnebago courting ﬂute was played to on another instrument at any one fancying it melody but now when i heard the notes in their true tone and time i thought it not unworthy comparison in its graceful sequence and the light ﬂourish at the close with the sweetest and this like the is only practised to allure mate the indian become citizen and husband more thinks of playing the ﬂute than one of the members of our society would of choosing the purple light of love f surtout mackinaw has been fully described by able pens and i can only add my tribute to the exceeding beauty of the spot and its position it is charming to be on an island so small that you can sail round it in an afternoon yet large enough to admit of long secluded walks through its gentle groves you can go round it in your boat or on foot you can tread its narrow beach resting at times beneath the lofty walls of stone richly wooded which rise from it in various architectural forms in this stone caves are continually forming from the action of the atmosphere one of these is quite deep and rocky fragment left at its mouth wreathed with little creeping plants looks you sit within like ruined pillar the arched rock surprised much i had heard of it from the perfection of the arch it is perfect whether you look up through it from the lake or down through it to the pg 78 pg 79 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https waters we both ascended and very easy steep and crumbling path and rested at the summit beneath the trees and at the foot upon the cool mossy stones beside the lapsing wave nature has carefully decorated all this architecture with shrubs that take root within the crevices and small creeping vines these natural ruins may vie beautiful effect with the remains of european grandeur and have beside charm of playful mood in nature the sugar rock is fragment in the same kind the pine rock we saw in illinois it has the same air of helmet seen from an eminence at the side which you descend by long and steep path the rock itself may be ascended by the bold and agile up is niche to which those who are neither can climb by ladder very handsome young ofﬁcer and lady who were with us did so and then facing round stood there side by side looking in the niche if not like saints or angels wrought by pious hands in stone romantically if not holily worthy the gazer eye the woods which adorn the central ridge of the island are very full in foliage and in august showed the tender green and pliant leaf of june elsewhere they are rich in beautiful mosses and the wild raspberry from fort holmes the old fort we had the most commanding view of the lake and straits opposite shores and fair islets mackinaw itself is best seen from the water its peculiar shape is supposed to have been the origin of its name michilimackinac which means the great turtle one person whom i saw wished to establish another etymology which he fancied to be more reﬁned but i doubt not this is the true one both because the shape might suggest such name and the existence of an island of such form in this commanding position would seem signiﬁcant fact to the indians henry gives the details of peculiar worship paid to the great turtle and the oracles received from this extraordinary apollo of the indian delphos it is crowned most picturesquely by the white fort with its gay ﬂag from this on one side stretches the town how pleasing sight after the raw crude staring assemblage of houses everywhere else to be met in this country is an old french town mellow in its coloring and with the harmonious effect of slow growth which assimilates naturally with objects round it the people in its streets indian french and others walked with leisure step of those who live life of taste and inclination rather than of the hard press of business in american towns elsewhere on the other side along the fair curving beach below the white houses scattered on the declivity clustered the indian lodges with their amber matting so soft and bright of hue in the late afternoon sun the ﬁrst afternoon i was there looking down from near height i felt that i never wished to see more fascinating picture it was an hour of the deepest serenity bright blue and gold with rich shadows every moment the sunlight fell more mellow the indians were grouped and scattered among the lodges the women preparing food in the kettle or over the many small ﬁres the children half naked wild little goblins were playing both in and out of the water here and there lounged young girl with baby at her back whose bright eyes glanced if born into world of courage and of joy instead of ignominious servitude and slow decay some girls were cutting wood little way from talking and laughing in the low musical tone so charming in the indian women many bark canoes were upturned upon the beach and by that light of almost the same amber the lodges others coming in their square sails set and with almost arrowy speed though heavily laden with dusky forms and all the apparatus of their household here and there glided by with different but scarce less pleasing motion it was scene of ideal loveliness and these wild forms adorned it looking so at home in it all seemed happy and they were happy that day they had to madden them it was sunday and the shops were shut pg 80 pg 81 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https my window at the use my eye was constantly attracted by these picturesque groups i was never tired of seeing the canoes come in and the new arrivals set up their temporary dwellings the women ran to set up the and spread the mats on the ground the men brought the chests kettles the mats were then laid on the outside the cedar strewed on the ground the blanket hung up door and all was completed in less than twenty minutes then they began to prepare the night meal and to learn of their neighbors the news of the day the habit of preparing food out of doors gave all the gypsy charm and variety to their conduct continually i wanted sir walter scott to have been there if such romantic sketches were suggested to him by the sight of few gypsies not group near one of these ﬁres but would have furnished him material separate canvas i was so taken up with the spirit of the scene that i could not follow out the stories suggested by these weather sullen but eloquent ﬁgures they talked great deal and with much variety of gesture so that i often had good guess at the meaning of their discourse i saw that whatever the indian may be among the whites he is anything but taciturn with his own people and he often would declaim or narrate at length indeed it is obvious if only from the fables taken from their stores by mr schoolcraft that these tribes possess great power that way i liked very much to walk or sit among them with the women i held much communication by signs they are almo st invariably coarse and ugly with the exception of their eyes with peculiarly awkward gait and forms bent by burdens this gait so different from the steady and noble step of the men marks the inferior position they occupy i had heard much eloquent contradiction of this schoolcraft had maintained to friend that they were in fact nearly on par with their husbands the white woman with hers although said she on account of inevitable causes the indian woman is subjected to many hardships of peculiar nature yet her position compared with that of the man is higher and freer than that of the white woman why will people look only on one side they either exalt the red man into demigod or degrade him into beast they say that he compels his wife to all the drudgery while he does nothing but hunt and amuse himself forgetting that upon his activity and power of endurance hunter depends the support of his family that this is labor of the most fatiguing kind and that it is absolutely necessary that he should keep his frame unbent by burdens and unworn by toil that he may be able to obtain the means of subsistence i have witnessed scenes of conjugal and parental love in the indian wigwam from which i have often often thought the educated white man proud of his superior civilization might learn useful lesson when he returns from hunting worn out with fatigue having tasted nothing since dawn his wife if she is good wife will take off his moccasons and replace them with dry ones and will prepare his game their repast while his children will climb upon him and he will caress them with all the tenderness of woman and in the evening the indian wigwam is the scene of the purest domestic pleasures the father will relate the amusement of the wife and the instruction of the children all the events of the day hunt while they will treasure up every word that falls and thus learn the theory of the art whose practice is to be the occupation of their lives grant speaks thus of the position of woman amid the mohawk indians lady mary montague says that the court of vienna was the paradise of old women and that there is other place in the world where woman past ﬁfty excites the least interest had her travels extended to the interior of north america she would have seen another instance of this inversion of the common mode of thinking here wom an never was of consequence till sire had son old enough to ﬁght the battles of his country from that date she held superior rank in society was allowed to live at ease and even called to consultations on national affairs in savage and warlike countries the reign of beauty is very short and its inﬂuence comparatively limited the girls in childhood had very pleasing appearance but excepting their ﬁne hair eyes and teeth every external pg 82 pg 83 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https was soon banished by perpetual drudgery carrying burdens too heavy to be borne and other slavish employments considered beneath the dignity of the men these walked before erect and graceful decked with ornaments which set off to adva ntage the symmetry of their persons while the poor women followed meanly attired bent under the weight of the children and the utensils which they carried everywhere with them and disﬁgured and degraded by ceaseless toils they were very early married mohawk had other servant but his wife and whenever he commenced hunter it was requisite he should have some one to carry his load cook his kettle make his moccasons and above all produce the young warriors who were to succeed him in the honors of the chase and of the tomahawk wherever man is mere hunter woman is mere slave it is domestic intercourse that softens man and elevates woman and of that there can be but little where the employ ments and amusements are not in common the ancient caledonians honored the fair but then it is to be observed they were fair huntresses and moved in the light of their beauty to the hill of roes and the culinary toils were entirely left to the rougher sex when the young warrior made his appearance it softened the cares of his mother who well knew that when he grew up every deﬁciency in tenderness to his wife would be made up in superabundant duty and affection to her if it were possible to carry ﬁlial veneration to excess it was done here all other charities were absorbed in it i wonder this system of depressing the sex in their early years to exalt them when all their juvenile attractions are ﬂown and when mind alone can distinguish them has not occurred to our modern reformers the mohawks took good care not to admit their women to share their prerogatives till they approved themselves good wives and mothers the observations of women upon the position of woman are always more valuable than those of men but of these two grant seem much nearer the truth than schoolcraft because though her opportunities observation did not bring her so close she looked more at both sides to ﬁnd the truth carver in his travels among the winnebagoes describes two queens one nominally so like queen victoria the other invested with genuine royalty springing from her own conduct in the great town of the winnebagoes he found queen presiding over the tribe instead of sachem he adds that in some tribes the descent is given to the female line in preference to the male that is sister son will succeed to the authority rather than brother son the position of this winnebago queen reminded forcibly of queen victoria she sat in the council but only asked few questions or gave some triﬂing directions in matters relative to the state women are never allowed to sit in their counci ls except they happen to be invested with the supreme authority and then it is not customary them to make any formal speeches the chiefs she was very ancient woman small in stature and not much distinguished by her dress from several young women that attended her these her attendants seemed greatly pleased whenever i showed any tokens of respect to their queen especially when i saluted her which i frequen tly did to acquire her favor the other was woman who being taken captive found means to kill her captor and make her escape and the tribe were so struck with admiration at the courage and calmness she displayed on the occasion to make her chieftainess in her own light notwithstanding the homage paid to women and the consequence allowed them in some cases it is impossible to look upon the indian women without feeling that they occupy lower place than women among the nations of european civilization the habits of drudgery expressed in their form and gesture the soft and wild but melancholy expression of their eye reminded of the tribe mentioned by mackenzie where the women destroy their female children whenever they have good opportunity and of the pg 84 pg 85 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https reproaches addressed by the paraguay woman to her mother that she had not in the same way saved her from the anguish and weariness of her lot more weariness than anguish doub t falls to the lot of most of these wom en they inherit submission and the minds of the generality accommodate themselves more or less to any posture perhaps they suffer less than their white sisters who have more aspiration and reﬁnement with little power of but their place is certainly lower and their share of the human inheritance less their decorum and delicacy are striking and show that when these are native to the mind habits of life make any difference their whole gesture is timid yet possessed they used to crowd round to inspect little things i had to show them but never press near on the contrary would reprove and keep off the children anything they took from my hand was held with care then shut or folded and returned with an air of precision they would not stare however curious they might be but cast sidelong glances locket that i wore was an object of untiring interest they seemed to regard it talisman my little was still more fascinating to them apparently they had never before seen one an umbrella they entertained profound regard probably looking upon it the most luxurious superﬂuity person can possess and therefore badge of great wealth i used to see an old squaw whose sullied skin and coarse tanned locks told that she had braved sun and storm without doubt or care sixty years at least sitting gravely at the door of her lodge with an old green umbrella over her head happy hours together in the digniﬁed shade her happiness pomp came not it so often does too late she received it with grateful enjoyment one day i was seated on one of the canoes woman came and sat beside with her baby in its cradle set up at her feet she asked by gesture to let her take my shade and then to show her how to open it then she put it into her baby hand and held it over its head looking at the while with sweet mischievous laugh much to say you carry thing that is only ﬁt baby her pantomime was very pretty she like the other women had glance and shy sweet expression in the eye the men have steady gaze that noblest and loveliest of modern preux lord edward fitzgerald who came through buffalo to detroit and mackinaw with brant and was adopted into the bear tribe by the name of eghnidal was struck in the same way by the delicacy of manners in women he says notwithstanding the life they lead which would make most women rough and masculine they are soft meek and modest the best brought up girls in england somewhat coquettish too imagine the manners of mimi in poor squaw that has been carrying packs in the woods all her life mckenney mentions that the young wife during

exchange her portrait worthy not merely of european but of troubadour sentiment it is also evident that schoolcraft says the women have great power at home it can never be otherwise men being dependent upon them the comfort of their lives just so amon g ourselves wives who are neither esteemed nor loved by their husbands have great power over their conduct by the friction of every day pg 86 pg 87 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https over the formation of their opinions by the daily opportunities so close relation affords of perverting testimony and instilling doubts but these sentiments should not come in brief ﬂashes but burn steady ﬂame then there would be more women worthy to inspire them this power is good nothing unless the woman be wise to use it aright has the indian has the white woman noble feeling of life and its uses religious worthy ﬁeld of thought and action man if not the white woman the indian woman occupies position inferior to that of man it is not so much question of power of privilege the men of these subjugated tribes now accustomed to drunkenness and every way degraded bear but faint impress of the lost grandeur of the race they are longer strong tall or ﬁnely proportioned yet you see them stealing along height or striding boldly forward they remind you of what was majestic in the red man on the shores of lake superior it is said if you visit them at home you may still see remnant of the noble blood the pillagers pilleurs band celebrated by the old travellers are still existent there still some eagles of their tribe may rush i have spoken of the hatred felt by the white man the indian with white women it seems to amount to disgust to loathing how i could endure the dirt the peculiar smell of the indians and their dwellings was great marvel in the eyes of my lady acquaintance indeed i wonder why they did not quite give up they certainly looked on with great distaste it get you gone you indian dog was the felt if not the breathed expression towards the hapless owners of the soil their claims all their sorrows quite forgot in abhorrence of their dirt their tawny skins

sticks at him he passed lady said what you will them they will be ungrateful the savage can not be washed out of them bring up an indian child and see if you can attach it to you the next moment she expressed in the presence of one of those children whom she was bringing up loathing at the odor left by one of her people and one of the most respected he passed through the room when the child is grown she will be considered basely ungrateful not to love the lady she certainly will not and this will be cited an instance of the impossibility of attaching the indian whether the indian could by any efforts of love and intelligence from the white man have been civilized and made valuable ingredient in the new state i will not say but this we are sure of french catholics at least did not harm them nor disturb their minds merely to corrupt them the french they loved but the stern presbyterian with his dogmas and his the city circle and the college with their niggard concessions and unfeeling stare have never tried the experiment it has not been tried our people and our government have sinned alike against the of the soil and if they are the fated agents of new they have done nothing invoked god to keep them sinless while they the hest of fate worst of all is it when they invoke the holy power only to mask their iniquity when the felon trader who all the week has been besotting and degrading the indian with rum mixed with red pepper and damaged tobacco kneels with him on sunday before common altar to tell the rosary which recalls the thought of him cruciﬁed love of suffering men and to listen to sermons in praise of purity my savage friends cries the old fat priest you must above all things aim at purity oh my heart swelled when i saw them in christian church

admirable i think the happiest attempt ever made to meet the indian in his own way and catch the tone of his mind it was said in the newspapers that keokuck did actually shed tears when addressed father if he did not with his eyes he well might in his heart not often have they been addressed with such intelligence and tact the few who have not approached them with sordid rapacity but from love to them men havin g souls to be redeemed have most frequently been persons intellectually too narrow too straitly bound in sects or opinions to throw themselves into the character or position of the indians or impart to them anything they can make available the christ shown them by these missionaries is to them but new and more powerful manito the signs of the new religion but the fetiches that have aided the conquerors here i will copy some remarks made by discerning observer on the methods used by the missionaries and their natural results and myself had very interesting conversation upon the subject of the indians their character capabilities after ten years experience among them he was forced to acknowledge that the results of the missionary efforts had produced nothing calculated to encourage he thought that there was an intrinsic disability in them to rise above or go beyond the sphere in which they had so long moved he said that even those indians who had been converted and who had adopted the habits of civilization were very little improved in their real character they were selﬁsh deceitful and indolent those who were still heathens they had repaid the kindnesses of the missionaries with the basest ingratitude killing their cattle and swine and robbing them of their harvests which they wantonly destroyed he had abandoned the idea of effecting any general good to the indians he had conscientious scruples to promoting an enterprise so hopeless that of missions among the indians by sending accounts to the east that might induce philanthropic individuals to contribute to their support in fact the whole experience of his intercourse with them seemed to have convinced him of the irremediable degradation of the race their fortitude under suffering he considered the result of physical and mental insensib ility their courage mere animal excitement which they found it necessary to inﬂame before daring to meet foe they have constancy of purpose and are in fact but little superior to the brutes in point of moral development it is not astonishing that one looking upon the indian character from point of view should entertain such sentiments the object of his intercourse with them was to make them apprehend the mysteries of theology which to the most enlightened is an abstruse metaphysical study and it is not singular they should prefer their pagan superstitions which address themselves more directly to the senses failing in the attempt to christianize before civilizing them he inferred that in the intrinsic degradation of their faculties the obstacle was to be found thus the missionary vainly attempts by once or twice holding up the cross to turn deer and tigers into lambs vainly attempts to convince the red man that heavenly mandate pg 95 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https from him his broad lands he bows his head but does not at heart acquiesce he can not it is not true and if it were the descent of blood through the same channels centuries has formed habits of thought not so easily to be disturbed amalgamation would afford the only true and profound means of civilization but nature seems like all else to declare that this race is fated to perish those of mixed blood fade early and are not generally ﬁne race they lose what is best in either type rather than enhance the value of each by mingling there are exceptions or two such i know of this it is said is the general rule traveller observes that the white settlers who live in the woods soon becom sallow lanky and dejected the atmosphere of the trees does not agree with caucasian lungs and it is perhaps in part an instinct of this which causes the hatred of the new settlers towards trees the indian breathed the atmosphere of the forests freely he loved their shade they are effaced from the land he ﬂeets too part of the same manifestation which can not linger behind its proper the chippewas have lately petitioned the state of michigan that they may be admitted citizens but this would be vain unless they could be admitted brothers to the heart of the white man and while the latter feels that conviction of superiority which enabled our wisconsin friend to throw away the gun and send the indian to fetch it he needs to be very good and very wise not to abuse his position but the white man yet is pirate and avails himself much ever of the maxim might makes right all that civilization does the generality is to cover up this with veil of subtle evasions and chicane and here and there to rouse the individual mind to appeal to heaven against it i have hope of liberalizing the missionary of humanizing the sharks of trade of infusing the conscientious drop into the ﬂinty bosom of policy of saving the indian from immediate degradation and speedy death the whole sermon may be preached from the text needs be that offences must come yet woe onto them by whom they come yet ere they depart i wish there might be some masterly attempt to reproduce in art or literature what is proper to them kind of beauty and grandeur which few of the crowd have hearts to feel yet which ought to leave in the world its monuments to inspire the thought of genius through all ages nothing in this kind has been done masterly since it was clevengers ambition is pity he had not opportunity to try fully his powers we hope some other mind may be bent upon it ere too late at present the only lively impress of their passage through the world is to be found in such books catlin and some stories told by the old travellers let here give another brief tale of the power exerted by the white man over the savage in trying case but in this case it was righteous was moral power we were looking over mckenney tour to the lakes and on observing the picture of or the going cloud observed that is the fellow i came near having ﬁght with and he detailed at length the circumstances this indian was very desperate character and of whom all the leech lake band stood in fear he would shoot down any indian who offended him without the least hesitation and had become quite the bully of that part of the tribe the trader at leech lake warned to beware of him and said that he once when he the trader refused to give up to him his stock of went and got his gun and tomahawk and shook the tomahawk over his head saying give your the trader complied with his exaction but not so did in the adventure which i am about to relate came frequently to him with furs wishing him to give them sugar ﬂour explained to him that he could not trade furs he was sent there teacher and that it would be like putting his hand into the ﬁre to so the traders would inform against him and he would be

by margaret fuller ossoli https he wanted and followed up this sort of game until at last it became insupportable one day the indian brought very large and said i want to get this ten pounds of sugar and some ﬂour and cloth adding i am not like other indians i want to pay what i get found that he must either be robbed of all he had by submitting to these exactions or take stand at once he thought however he would try to avoid scrape and told his customer he had not so much sugar to spare then said he you can spare and thinking to make him back out told him he would give him ﬁve pounds of sugar his skin it said the indian he left the skin telling to take good care of it took it at once to the trader store and related the circumstance congratulating himself that he had got rid of the indian exactions but in about month appeared bringing some dirty indian sugar and said i have brought back the sugar that i borrowed of you and i want my back told him i bought an of you but if you will return the other articles you have got it perhaps i can get it you is the skin said he very quickly have you done with it replied it was in the trader store where he the indian could not get it at this information he was furious laid his hands on his knife and tomahawk and commanded to bring it at once found this was the crisis where he must take stand or be over by this man his wife who was present was much alarmed and begged he would get the skin the indian but he told her that he or the indian would soon be master of his house and if she was afraid to see it decided which was to be so she had better retire he turned to and addressed him in stern voice follows i will not give you the skin how often have you come to my house and i have shared with you what i had i gave you tobacco when you were well and medicine when you were sick and you never went away from my wigwam with your hands empty and this is the way you return my treatment to you i had thought you were man and chief but you are not you are nothing but an old woman leave this house and never enter it again said he expected the indian would attempt his life when he said this but that he had placed himself in position so that he could defend himself and looked straight into the indian eye and like other wild beasts he quailed before the glance of mental and moral courage he calmed down at once and soon began to make apologies then told him kindly but ﬁrmly that if he wished to walk in the same path with him he must walk straight the crack on the ﬂoor before them adding that he would not walk with anybody who would jostle him by walking so crooked he had done he was perfectly tamed and mr said he never had any more trouble with him the conviction here livingly enforced of the superiority on the side of the white man was thus expressed by the indian orator at mackinaw while we were there after the customary compliments about sun dew this said he is the difference between the white and the red man the white man looks to the future and paves the way posterity the red man never thought of this this is statement uncommonly reﬁned an indian but one of the gentlemen present who understood the chippewa vouched it literal rendering of his phrases and he did indeed touch the vital point of difference but the indian if he understands can not make use of his intelligence the fate of his people is against it and pontiac and philip have more chance than julian in the times of old the indian is steady to that simple creed which forms the basis of all his mythology that there is god and life beyond this right and wrong which each man can see betwixt which each man should choose that good brings with it its reward and vice its punishment his moral code if not reﬁned that of civilized nations is clear and noble in the stress laid upon truth and ﬁdelity and all unprejudiced observers bear testimony that the indians until broken from their old anchorage by intercourse with the whites

here that were pleasant companions one gay frank impetuous but sweet and winning she was an american fair and with bright brown hair the other little french canadian used to join in my walks silently take my hand and sit at my feet when i stopped in beautiful places she seemed to understand without word and i never shall forget her little ﬁgure with its light but pensive motion and her delicate grave features with the pale clear complexion and soft eye she was motherless and much left alone by her father and brothers who were boatmen the two little girls were pretty representatives of

crossing the waters belonged to such an one but they were always boats chicago or buffalo till on the 28th of august allegro who shared my plans and wishes rushed in to tell that the general scott had come and in this little steamer accordingly i set off the next morning i was the only lady and attended in the cabin by dutch girl and an indian woman they both spoke english ﬂuently and enter tained much by accounts of their different experiences the dutch girl told of dance among the common people at amsterdam called the shepherd dance the two leaders are dressed shepherd and shepherdess they invent to the music all kinds of movements descriptive of things that may happen in the ﬁeld and the rest are obliged to follow i have never heard of any dance which gave such free play to the fancy

and asked if he might live with her again but she always answered here she was far freer than she would have been in civilized life i was pleased by the nonc halance of this woman and the perfectly national manner she had preserved after so many years of contact with all kinds of people the two women when i left the boat made presents of indian work such travellers value and the manner of the two was characteristic of their different nations the indian brought hers when i was alone looked bashfully down when she gave it and made an almost sentimental little speech the dutch girl brought hers in public and bridling her short chin with air observed she had bought it but the feeling of af fectionate regard was the same in the minds of both island after island we passed all fairly shaped and clustering in friendly way but with little variety of vegetation in the afternoon the weather became foggy and we could not proceed after dark that was dull an evening ever fell the next morning the fog still lay heavy but the captain took out in his boat on an exploring expedition and we found the remains of the old english fort on point joseph all around was so wholly unmarked by anything but stress of wind and weather the shores of these islands and their woods so like one another wild and lonely but nowhere rich and majestic that there was some charm in the remains of the garden the remains even of chimneys and pier they gave feature to the scene here i gathered many ﬂowers but they were the same at mackinaw the captain though he had been on this trip hundreds of times had never seen this spot and never would but this fog and his desire to entertain he presented striking instance how men the sake of getting living forget to live it is just the same in the most romantic the most dull and vulgar places men get the harness on so fast that they can never shake it off unless they guard against this danger from the very ﬁrst in chicago how many men live who never ﬁnd time to see the prairies or learn anything unconnected with the business of the day or about the country they are living in so this captain man of strong sense and good eyesight rarely found time to go off the track or look about him on it he lamented too that there had been call which induced him to develop his powers of expression so that he might communicate what he had seen the enjoyment or instruction of others this is common fault among the active men the truly living who could tell what life is it should not be so literature should not be left to the mere literati ce to the mere

belongs to the fort at the sault said their pastime was to come in the season of making sugar and pass some time on this island days at work and the evening in dancing and other amusements work of

but the beautiful sunset was quite gone and only young moon trembling over the scene when we came within hearing of them i sat up long to hear them merely it was thoughtful hour these two days the 29th and 30th of august are memorable in my life the latter is the birthday of near friend i pass them alone approaching lake superior but i shall not enter into that truly wild and free region shall not have the canoe voyage whose daily adventure with the camping out at night beneath the stars would have given an interlude of such value to my existence i shall not see the pictured rocks their chapels and urns it did not depend on it never has whether such things shall be done or not my friends may they see and and be more especially those who have before them greater number of birthdays and more healthy and unfettered existence i should like to hear some notes of earthly music by the faint moonshine i can hardly see the banks how they look i have guess except that there are trees and now and then light lets know there are homes with their various interests i should like to hear some strains of the ﬂute from beneath those trees just to break the sound of the rapids the land of

love shall set more with the ﬁrst light of dawn i was up and out and then was glad i had not seen all the night before it came upon with such power in its dewy freshness they are beautiful indeed these rapids the grace is so much more obvious than the power i went up through the old chippewa to their head and sat down on large stone to look little way off was one of the unlike in shape to the temporary ones at mackinaw but these have been described by jameson women too i saw coming home from the woods stooping under great loads of cedar that were strapped upon their backs but in many european countrie s women carry great loads even of wood upon their backs i used to hear the girls singing and laughing they were cutting down boughs at mackinaw this part of their employment though

to take down the rapids and presently i saw it coming with the two indian in pink calico shirts moving it about with their long poles with grace and dexterity worthy now and then they cast the ll looked just i had fancied only far prettier when they came to they spread mat in the middle of the canoe i sat down and in less than four minutes we had descended the rapids distance of more than three quarters of mile i was somewhat disap pointed in this being more of an exploit than i found it having heard such expression s used of darting or shooting down these rapids i had fancied there was wall of rock somewhere where descent would somehow be accomplished and that there would come some one gasp of terror and delight some sensation entirely new to but i found myself in smooth water before i had time to feel anything but the buoyant pleasure of being carried so lightly through this surf amid the breakers now and then the indians spoke to one another in vehement jabber which however had tone that expressed other than pleasant excitement it is doubt an act of wonderful dexterity to steer amid these jagged rocks when one rude touch would tear hole in the birch canoe but these men are evidently so used to doing it and so adroit that the silliest person could not feel afraid i should like to have come down twenty times that i might have had leisure to realize the pleasure but the fog which had detained us on the way shortened the boat stay at the sault and i wanted my time to walk about while coming down the rapids the indians caught my breakfast and certainly it was the best of breakfasts the i found quite another thing caught on the spot and cooked immediately from what i had found it at chicago or mackinaw before i had had the bad taste to prefer the trout despite the solemn and eloquent remonstrances of the habitués to whom the superiority of seemed cardinal point of faith i am here reminded that i have omitted that indispensable part of travelling journal the account of what we found to eat i can not hope to make up by one bold stroke all my omissions of daily record but that i may show myself not destitute of the common feelings of humanity i will observe that he whose affections turn in summer towards vegetables should not come to this region till the subject of diet be better understood that of fruit too there is little yet even at the best hotel tables that the prairie chickens require praise from and that the trout and are worthy the transparency of the lake waters in this brief mention i by means intend to give myself an air of superiority to the subject if dinner in the illinois woods on dry bread and drier meat with water from the stream that ﬂowed hard by pleased best of all yet at one time when living at house where nothing was prepared the table ﬁt to touch and even the bread could not be partaken of without headache in consequence i learnt to understand and sympathize with the anxious tone in which fathers of families about to take their innocent children into some scene of wild beauty ask ﬁrst of all is there good table i shall ask just so in future only those whom the powers have furnished with small travelling cases of ambrosia can take exercise all day and be happy without even bread morning or night our voyage back was all pleasure it was the fairest day i saw the river the islands

character he could not change and won the sweet from the bitter his account of his life at home and of his late adventures among the indians was very amusing but i want talent to write it down and i have not heard the slang of these people intimately enough there is good book about indiana called the new purchase written by person who knows the people of the country well enough to describe them in their own way it is not witty but penetratin g valuable its practical wisdom and humored fun there were many told too by those from illinois and wisconsin i not retain any of these well enough nor

so plenty that one would think shooting pigeons or grouse would seem more like slaughter than the excitement of skill to good sportsman hunting the deer is full of adventure and needs only scrope to

in sight of beautiful mackinaw over which rainbow bent in promise of peace i have always wondered in reading travels at the childish joy travellers felt at meeting people they knew and their sense of loneliness when they did not in places where there was everything new to occupy the attention so childish i thought always to be longing the new in the old and the old in the new yet just such sadness i felt when i looked on the island glittering in the sunset canopied by the rainbow and thought friend would welcome there just such childish joy i felt to see unexpectedly on the landing the face of one whom i called friend the remaining two or three days were delightfully spent in walking or boating or sitting at the window to see the indians go this was not quite so pleasant their coming in though accomplished with the same rapidity family not taking half an hour to prepare departure and the departing canoe beautiful object but they left behind on all the shore the blemishes of their stay rags dried boughs fragments of food the marks of their ﬁres nature likes to cover up and gloss over spots and scars but it would take her some time to restore that beach to the state it was in before they came and i had mind canoe excursi on and we asked one of the traders to engage us two good indians that would not only take us out but be sure and bring us back we could not hold converse with them two others offered their aid beside the chief son youth of about sixteen richly dressed in blue broadcloth scarlet sash and leggins with scarf of brighter red than the rest tied around his head its ends falling gracefully on one shoulder they thought it apparently ﬁne amusement to be attending two white women they carried us into the path of the steamboat which was going out and paddled with all their force r too fast indeed there was something of swell on the lake and they sometimes threw water into the canoe however it ﬂew over the waves light seagull they would say pull away and ver warm and after these words would laugh gayly they enjoyed the hour i believe much we the house where we lived belonged to the widow of french trader an indian by birth and wearing the dress of her country she spoke french ﬂuently and was very ladylike in her manners she is great character among them they were all the time coming to pay pg 111 pg 112 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in

when they saw her using her pencil though less so than about the this lady of the tribe wanted to borrow the sketches of the beach with its lodges and wild groups to show to the savages she said of the practical ability of the indian women good specimen is given by mckenney in an amusing story of one who went to washington and acted her part there in the ﬁrst circles with tact and sustained dissimulation worthy of cagliostro she seemed to have thorough love of intrigue its own sake and much dramatic talent like the chiefs of her nation when on an expedition among the foe whether revenge or proﬁt impulses of vanity or seductions had power to turn her aside from carrying out her plan she had originally projected it although i have little to tell i feel that i have learnt great deal of the indians from observing them even in this broken and degraded condition there is language of eye and motion which can not be put into words and which teaches what words never can i feel acquainted with the soul of this race i read its nobler thought in their defaced ﬁgures there was greatness unique and precious which he who does not feel will never duly appreciate the majesty of nature in this american continent i have mentioned that the indian orator who addressed the agents on this occasion said the difference between the white man and the red man is this the white man sooner came here than he thought of preparing the way his posterity the red man never thought of this i was assured this was exactly his phrase and it deﬁnes the true difference we get the better because we look before and after but from the same cause we pine what is not the red man when happy was thoroughly happy when good was simply good he needed the medal to let him know that he was good these evenings

mathematics composition the french and german languages the practice and theory of the fine arts and they are ardent in availing themselves of instruction in the higher branches i found large classes not only in architectural drawing which may be supposed to be followed with view to professional objects but landscape also and large in german in french they can attend many good lectures and concerts without additional charge due place is here assigned to music to its inﬂuence on the whole mind the large and libraries are in constant requisition and the books in most constant demand are not those of amusement but of solid and permanent interest and value only the last year in manchester and two in liverp ool have these advantages been extended to girls but now that part of the subject is looked upon it ought to be and begins to be treated more and more it must and will be wherever true civilization is making its way one of the handsomest houses in liverpool has been purchased the girls school and room and good arrangement been afforded their work and their play among other things they are taught they ought to be in all american schools to cut out and make dresses i had the pleasure of seeing quotations made from our boston dial in the address in which the director of the liverpool institute very benevolent and intelligent man explained to his disciples and others its objects and which concludes thus but this subject of is inexhaustible if traced to its results in action it is in fact whole duty of man what of detail it involves and implies i know that you will each and all think out yourselves beautifully has it been said not the difference between spiritual and material things just this in the one case we must watch details in the other keep alive the high resolve and the details will take care of themselves keep the sacred central ﬁre burning and throughout the system in each of its acts will be warmth and glow enough j myself if i be asked what my purpose is in relation to you i would brieﬂy reply it is that i may help be it ever so feebly to train up race of young men who shall escape vice by rising above it who shall love truth because it is truth not because it brings them wealth or honor who shall regard life solemn thing involving too weighty responsibilities to be wasted in idle or frivolous pursuits who shall recogniz in their daily labors not merely tribute to the hard necessity of daily bread but ﬁeld the development of their better nature by the dischar ge of duty who shall judge in all things themselves bowing the knee to sectarian or party watchwords of any kind and who while they think themselves shall feel others and regard their talents their attainments their opportunities their possessions blessings held in trust the good of their i found that the dial had been read with earnest interest by some of the best minds in these especially practical regions that it had been welcomed representative of some sincere and honorable life in america and thought the ﬁttest to be quoted under this motto what are noble deeds but noble thoughts realized among other signs of the times we bought bradshaw

illuminated breviary now that peace is secured the present between our two countries the spirit is not forgotten that quelled the storm greeted on every side with expressions of feeling about the blessin gs of peace the madness and wickedness of war that would be deemed romantic in our darker land i have answered to the speak ers but you are mightily pleased and illuminat your victories in china and ireland you not and they unprovoked by the taunt would mildly reply we not but it is too true that large part of the nation fail to bring home the true nature and bearing of those events and apply principle to conduct with much justice they in the case of nation nearer to them by kindred and position but we are sure that feeling is growing purer on the subject day by day and that there will soon be large majority against war on any occasion or any object i heard most interesting letter read from tradesman in one of the count ry towns whose daughters are instructors of the people in the way of cutting out from books and pamphlets fragments on the great subjects of the day which they send about in packages or paste on walls and doors he said that one such passage pasted on door he had seen read with eager interest by hundreds to whom such thoughts were probably quite new and with some of whom it could scarcely fail to be little seed of large harvest another good omen i found in written tracts by joseph barker of the town of wortley published through his own how great how imperious the need of such men of such deeds we felt more than ever while compelled to turn deaf ear to the squalid and shameless beggars of liverpool or talking by night in the streets of manchester to the girls from the mills who were strolling bareheaded with coarse rude and reckless air through the streets or seeing through the windows of the the women seated drinking too dull to carouse the homes of england their sweetness is melting into fable only the new spirit in its holiest power can

we saw in liverpool royal institute with the statue of roscoe by chantrey and in its collection from the works of the early italian artists and otherwise bearing traces of that liberality and culture

pecuniary means we saw the statue of huskisson in the cemetery it is ﬁne portrait statue but work of art wants ﬁrmness and grandeur i say it is ﬁne portrait statue though we were told it is not like the original but it is good conception of an individuality which might exist if it does not yet it is by gibson who received his early education in liverpool i saw there too the body of an infant borne to the grave by women it is beautiful custom here that those who have fulﬁlled all other tender ofﬁces to the little being should hold to it the same relation to the very last from liverpool we went to chester one of the oldest cities in england roman station once and abode of the twentieth legion the victorious tiles bearing this inscription heads of jupiter and other marks of their

scarcely take my eyes moment and from it could ill endure to part he was dressed in broadcloth robe richly embroidered leaving his throat and the upper part of his neck bare except that he wore heavy gold chain rich shawl was thrown gracefully around him the sleeves of his robe were loose with white sleeves below he wore black satin cap the whole effect of this dress was very ﬁne yet simple setting off to the utmost advantage the distinguished beauty of his features in which there was mingling of national pride voluptuous sweetness in that unconscious state of reverie when it affects us

with the full summery look of the eye was unlike that he was bengalese living in england his education several others are at present he spoke english well and conversed on several subjects literary and political with grace ﬂuency and delicacy of thought passing from kendal to ambleside we found charming abode furnished us by the care of friend in one of the stone cottages of this region almost the only one not wreathed but commanding beautiful view of the mountains and truly an english home in its neatness quiet and delicate noiseless attention to the wants of all within its walls here we

many centuries they had rarely patience and energy the apprenticeship requisite to give the needed knowledge of the world and habits of labor of cobden he said he is inferior in acquirements to very

in the animated and intellectual circle of edinbur gh in youth an apt disciple in her prime bright ornament of that society she had been an only child cherished wife an adored mother unspoiled by love in any of these relations because that love was founded on knowledge in childhood she had warmly sympathized in the spirit that animated the american revolution and washington had been her hero later the interest of her husband in every struggle freedom had cherished her own she had known in the course of her long life many eminent men knew minutely the history of efforts in that direction and sympathized now in the triumph of the people over the corn laws she had in the american victories with much ardor when girl though with wiser mind her eye was full of light her manner and gesture of dignity her voice rich sonorous and ﬁnely modulated her tide of talk marked by candor justice and showing in every sentence her ripe experience and her noble genial nature dear to memory will be the

about the house its situation is beautiful and the rydalian laurels are magniﬁ cent still i saw abodes among the hills that i should have preferred wordsworth more wild and still more romantic the fresh and lovely rydal mount seems merely the retirement of gentleman rather than the haunt of poet he showed his benignity of disposition in several little things especially in his attentions to young boy we had with us this boy had left the circus exhibiting its feats of horsemanship in ambleside that day only at his own desire to see wordsworth and i feared he would be disappointed i know i should have been at his age if when called to see poet i had found apollo ﬂaming with youthful glory and lyre in hand but instead revere nd old man clothed in black and walking with cautious step along the level however he was not disappointed but seemed in timid reverence to recognize the spirit that had dictated laodamia and dion wordsworth in his turn seemed to feel and prize congenial nature in this child taking us into the house he showed us the picture of his sister repeating with much expression some lines of hers and those so famous of his about her beginning five pg 131 pg 132

they used to be in england the plant from its grace and ﬁnished elegance being great favorite of mine i should like to see it frequently and of luxuriant growth at home and asked their mode of culture which i here mark down the beneﬁt of all who may be interested make bed of and sand put down slips of the fuchsia and give them great deal of water is all they need people have them out here in winter but perhaps they would not bear the cold of our januaries wordsworth spoke with more liberality than we expected of the recent measures about the corn laws saying that the principle was certainly right though to whether existing interests had been carefully attended to was just he was not prepared to say his neighbors were pleased to hear of his speaking thus mildly and hailed it sign that he was opening his mind to more light on these subjects they lament that his habits of seclusion keep him much ignorant of the real wants of england and the world living in this region which is cultivated by small proprietors where there is little poverty vice or misery he hears not the voice which cries so loudly from other parts of england and will not be stilled by sweet poetic suasion or philosophy it is the cry of men in the jaws of destruction it was pleasant to ﬁnd the reverence inspired by this great and pure mind warmest nearest home our landlady in heaping praises upon him added constantly and wordsworth too the people here said i value wordsworth most because he is celebrated writer truly madam said she i think it is because he is so kind neighbor true to the kindred points

has here charming residence it has been ﬁnished only few months but all about it is in unexpectedly fair order and promises much beauty after year or two of growth here we found her restor ed to full health and activity looking indeed far better than she did when in the united states it was pleasant to see her in this home presented to her by the gratitude of england her course of energetic and benevolent effort and adorned by tributes of affection and esteem from many quarters from the testimony of those who were with her in and since her illness her recovery would seem to be of magical quickness and sure progress has been represented at the house of miss martineau i saw milman the author i must not say poet specimen of the polished scholarly man of the world we passed one most delightful day in visit to langdale scene of the excursion to force i am ﬁnishing my letter at carlis le on my way to scotland and will give slight sketch of that excursion and one which occupied another day from keswick to buttermere and crummock water in my next letter iii pg 133 pg 134 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https edinbur gh 20th september i have too long delayed writing up my interesting observations slip from recollection if one waits so many days yet while travelling it is almost impossible to ﬁnd an hour when something of value to be seen will not be lost while writing i said in closing my last that i would write little more about westmoreland but so much has happened since that i must now dismiss that region with all possible brevity the ﬁrst day of which i wished to speak was passed in visiting langdale the scene of wordsworth excursion our party of eight went in two of the vehicles called cars or droskas carriages each drawn by one horse they are rather fatiguing to ride in but good to see from in steep and stony places all alight and the driver leads the horse so many of these there are that we were four or ﬁve hours in going ten miles including the pauses when we wished to look the scenes through which we passed are indeed of the most wild and noble character the wildness is not savage but very calm without recurring to details i recognized the tone and atmosphere of that noble poem which was to at feverish period in my life pure waters free breezes and cold blue sky bringing sense of eternity that gave an aspect of composure to the rudest volcanic wrecks of time we dined at of the vale with its stone ﬂoors old carved cabinet the pride of house of this sort and ready provision of oaten cakes we then ascended near hill to the waterfall called force also subject touched by wordsworth muse you wind along path long time hearing the sound of the falling water but not see it till descending by ladder the side of the ravine you come to its very foot you ﬁnd yourself then in deep chasm bridged over by narrow arch of rock the water falls at the farther end in narrow column looking up you see the sky through ﬁssure so narrow to make it look very pure and distant one of our party passing in stood some time at the foot of the waterfall and added much to its effect his height gave measure by which to appreciate that of surrounding objects and his look by that light so pale and statuesque seemed to inform the place with the presence of its genius our circuit homeward from this grand scene led us through some lovely places and to an outlook upon the most beautiful part of westmoreland passing over to keswic k we saw derwentwater and near it the fall of lodore it was from keswick that we made the excursion of day through borrowdale to buttermere and crummock water which i meant to speak of but ﬁnd it impossible at this moment the mind does not now furnish congenial colors with which to represent the vision of that day it must still wait in the mind and bide its time again to emer ge to outer air at keswick we went to see model of the lake country which gives an excellent idea of the relative positions of all objects its maker had given six years to the necessar y surveys and drawings he said that he had ﬁrst become acquainted with the country from his taste ﬁshing but had learned to love its beauty till the thought arose of making this model that while engaged in it he visited almo st every spot amid the hills and comm only saw both sunrise and sunset upon them that he was happy all the time but almost too happy when he saw one section of his model coming out quite right and felt sure at last that he should be quite successful in representi ng to others the home of his thoughts i looked upon him indeed an enviable man to have profession so congenial with his feelings in which he had been so naturally led to what would be useful and pleasant others passing from keswick through pleasant and cultivated country we paused at fair carlisle not voluntarily but because we could not get the means of proceeding farther pg 135 pg 136 at

the ﬁrst time in some of the footsteps of the unfortunate queen of scots passing next day the border we found the mosses all drained and the very existence of sometime would have seemed problematical but the remains of gilnockie tower of johnnie armstrong so pathetically recalled in one of the ﬁnest of the scottish ballads its size well that of other keeps towers and castles whose ruins are reverentially preserved in scotland gives lively sense of the time when population was so scanty and individual manhood grew to such force ten men in gilnockie were stronger then in proportion to the whole and probably had in them more of intelligence resource and genuine manly power than ten regiments now of drilled to act out manoeuvres they not understand and use artillery which needs of them more than the match to go of f and its hideous message farther on we saw branxholm and the water in crossing which the goblin page was obliged to resume his proper shape and ﬂy crying lost lost lost verily these things seem more like home than one own nursery whose toys and furniture could not in actual presence engage the thoughts like these pictures made familiar household words by the most generous kindly genius that ever blessed this earth on the coach with us was gentleman coming from london to make his yearly visit to the neighborhood of burns in which he was born i can now said he go but once year when boy i never let week pass without visiting the house of burns he afterward observed every step woke us to fresh recollections of walter scott that scott with all his vast range of talent knowledge and activity was poet of the past only and in his inmost heart wedded to the habits of feudal aristocracy while burns is the poet of the present and the future the man of the people and throughout genuine man this is true enough but my part i can not endure comparison which by breath of coolness depreciates either both were wanted each acted the important part assigned him by destiny with wonderful thoroughness and completeness scott breathed the breath just ﬂeeting from the forms of ancient scottish heroism and poesy into new made us the bridge by which we have gone into the old ossianic hall and caught the meaning just it was about to pass from us ever burns is full of the noble genuine democracy which seeks not to destroy royalty but to make all men kings he himself was in nature and in action they belon g to the same world they are pillars of the same church though they uphold its starry roof from opposite sides burns was much the rarer man precisely because he had most of common nature on grand scale his humor his passion his sweetness are all his own they need picturesque or romantic accessories to give them due relief looked at by all lights they are the same since adam there has been none that approached nearer ﬁtnes s to stand up before god and angels in the naked majesty of manhood than robert burns there was serpent in his ﬁeld also yet but his fault we could never have seen brought out the brave and patriotic modesty with which he owned it shame on him who could bear to think of fault in this rich jewel unless reminded by such confession we passed abbotsford without stopping intending to go there on our return last year ﬁve hundred americans inscribed their names in its porter book scotsman who gathered his weary length

in the moonlit evenings of our ﬁrst week here when veil of mist added to its apparent size and at the same time gave it the air with which martin in his illustrations of paradise lost has invested the palace which rose like an exhalation on this our second visit after an absence of near fortnight in the highlands we are at hotel nearly facing the new monument to scott and the tallest buildings of the old town from my windows i see the famous kirk the spot where the old tolbooth was and can almost distinguish that where porteous was done to death and other objects described in the most dramatic

associations present themselves every time i look out of the window in the open square between us and the old town is to be the terminus of the railroad but the building will be masked with trees it is thought it will not mar the beauty of the place yet scott could hardly have looked without regret upon an object that marks so distinctly the conquest of the new over the old and appropriately enough his statue has its back turned that way the effect of the monument to scott is pleasing though without strict unity of thought or original beauty of design the statue is too much hid within the monument and wants that majesty of repose in the attitude and drapery which sitting ﬁgure should have and which might well accompany the massive head of scott still the monument is an ornament and an honor to the city this is now the fourth that has been erected within two years to commemora the triumphs of genius monuments that have risen from the same idea and in such quick succession to schiller to goethe to beethoven and to scott signalize the character of the new still more happily than does the railroad coming up almost to the foot of edinbur gh castle the statue of burns has been removed from the monument erected in his honor to one of the public libraries being there more accessible to the public it is however entirely unworthy its subject giving the idea of smaller and

such should naturally be by large and intelligent liberality of our country he spoke very wisely and hopefully though among other stories with which we americans are put to the blush here there is none worse than that of the conduct of some of our publishers toward him one of these stories i had heard in new york but supposed it to be exaggerated till i had it from the best authority it is of one of our leading houses who were publishing on their own account and had stereotyped one of his works from an early edition when this work had passed through other editions and he had years been busy in reforming and amending it he applied to this house to republish from the later and better edition they refused in vain he urged that it was not only his own reputation an author that he was anxious but the good of the great country through which writings on such important subjects were to be circulated that they might have the beneﬁt of his labors and best knowledge such arguments on the stupid and mercenary tempers of those addressed fell harmless on buffalo hide might arrow the book they thought answered their purpose sufﬁciently it sells other purpose book they knew none and to the natural rights of an author over the fruits of his mind the distilled essence of life consumed in the severities of mental labor they had never heard of such thing his work was in the market and he had more to with it that they could see than the silkworm with the lining of one of their coats greeley the more i look at this subject the more i must maintain in opposition to your views that the publisher can not if mere tradesman be man of honor it is impossible in the nature of things he must have some idea of the nature and value of literary labor or he is wholly unﬁt to deal with its products he can not get along by occasional recourse to paid critics or readers he must himself have some idea what he is about one partner at least in the ﬁrm must be man of culture all must understand enough to appreciate their position and know that he who his sordid aims circulates poisonous trash amid great and growing people and makes it almost impossible those whom heaven has appointed its instructors to their ofﬁce are the worst of traitors and to be condemned at the bar of nations under sentence less severe than false statesmen and false priests this matter should and must be looked to more conscientiously combe repelled by all this indifference to conscience and natural equity in the ﬁrm who had taken possession of his work applied to others but here he found himself at once opposed by the invisible barrier that makes this sort of tyranny so strong and so pernicious it was the understanding among the trade that they were not to interfere with one another indeed they could have chance when at last he did get the work republished in another part of the country less favorable his purposes the bargain made to the pecuniary part of the transaction was in various ways so evaded that up to this time he has received compensation from that work except lock of spurzheim hair i was pleased to hear the true view expressed by one of the chambe rs these brothers have worked their way up to wealth and inﬂuence by daily labor and many steps one of them is more the business man the other the literary curator of their journal of this journal they issue regularly eighty thousand copies and it is doing an excellent work by awakening among the people desire knowledge and to considerable extent furnishing them with good materials i went over their ﬁne establishment where i found more than hundred and ﬁfty persons in good part women employed all in rooms seemingly healthy and content connected with the establish ment is pg 143 pg 144 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https bank and evening instruction in writing singing and arithmetic there was also and the same valuable and liberal provision we had found attached to some of the manchester warehouses such accessories dignify and gladden all kinds of labor and show somewhat of the true spirit of human brotherhood in the employer chambers said he trusted they should never look on publishing chieﬂy business or lucrative and respectable employment but the means of mental and moral beneﬁt to their countrymen to one so wearied and disgusted i have been by vulgar and base avowals on such subjects it was very refreshing to hear this from the lips of successful publisher combe spoke with high praise of hurlbart book human rights and their political guaranties which was published at the tribune ofﬁce he observed that it was the work of real thinker and extremely well written it is to be republished here combe said that it must make its way slowly it could interest those only who were willing to read thoughtfully but its success was sure at last he also spoke with great interest and respect of farnham of whose character and the inﬂuence she has exerted on the female prisoners at sing sing he had heard some account person of quite different character and celebrity is quincey the englis h eater and who lately has delighted us again with the papers in blackwood headed suspiria profundis i had the satisfaction not easily attainable now of seeing him some hours and in the mood of conversation one belonging to the wordsworth and coleridge constellation he too is now years of age the thoughts and knowledge of quincey lie in the past and oftentimes he spoke of matters now become trite to one of later culture but to all that fell from his lips his eloquence subtile and forcible the wind full and gently falling the evening dew lent peculiar charm he is an admirable narrator not rapid but gliding along like rivulet through green meadow giving and taking thousand little beauties not absolutely required to give his story due relief but each in itself separate boon i admired too his urbanity so opposite to the rapid slang style current in the literary conversation of the day sixty years since men had time to things better and more gracefully than now with chalmers we passed couple of hours he is old now but still full of vigor and ﬁre we had an opportunity of hearing ﬁne burst of indignant eloquence from him i shall blush to my very bones said he if the chaarr ch sound these two rr with much burr possible and you will get at an idea of his mode of pronouncing that unweariable word if the chaarrch yields to the storm he alluded to the outcry now raised against the free church by the abolitionists whose motto is send back the money money taken from the american slaveholders chalmers felt that if they did not yield from conviction they must not to assault his manner of speaking on this subject gave an idea of the nature of his eloquence he seldom preaches now ﬁne picture was presented by the opposition of ﬁgure and lineaments between young indian son of the celebrated dwarka nauth tagore who happened to be there that morning and chalmers they were conversing together the swarthy yet elegant face and form of the indian made ﬁne contrast with the ﬂorid portly yet intellectually luminous appearance of the doctor half shepherd half orator he looked shepherd king opposed to some arabian i saw others in edinbur gh of later date who haply gave more valuable well fresher revelations of the spirit and whose names may be by and by more celebrated than those i have cited but the present this must sufﬁce it would take week if i wrote half i saw or thought in

september 30th i was obliged to stop writing at edinbur gh before the better half of my tale was told and must now begin there again to speak of an excursion into the highlands which occupied about fortnight we left edinbur gh by coach perth and arrived there about three in the afternoon i have reason to be very glad that i visit this island before the reign of the is quite over i have been constantly on the top of the coach even one day of drenching rain and enjoy it highly nothing can be more inspiring than this swift steady progress over such smooth roads and placed so high to overlook the country freely with the lively ﬂourish of the horn preluding every pause travelling by railroad is in my opinion the most stupid process on earth it is sleep without the refreshment of sleep the noise of the train makes it impossible either to read talk or sleep to advantage but here the advantages are immense you can ﬂy through this dull trance from one beautiful place to another and stay at each during the time that would otherwise be spent on the road already the artists who are obliged to ﬁnd their home in london rejoice that all england is thrown open to them since they can now avail themselves of day leisure at great distance and with choice of position whereas formerly they were obliged to conﬁne themselves to few green and bowery spots in the neighborhood of the metropolis but while in the car it is to that worst of purgator ies the purgatory of dulness well on the coach we went to perth and passed through kinross and saw loch leven and the island where queen mary passed those sorrowful months before her romantic escape under care of the douglas this unhappy lovely woman stands type in history death time and distance not destroy her attractive power like cleopatra she has still her adorers nay some are born to her in each new generation of men lately she has her chevalier the russian prince labanof f who has spent fourteen years in studying upon all that related to her and thinks now that he can make out story and picture about the mysteries of her short reign which shall satisfy the desire of her lovers to ﬁnd her pure and just she was charming i have only seen of his array of evidence so much may be found in the pages of chambers journal but that much does not disturb the original view i have taken of the case which is that from princess educated under the medici and guise inﬂuence engaged in the meshes of secret intrigue to favor the roman catholic faith her tacit acquiescence at least in the murder of darnley after all his injurious conduct toward her was just what was to be expected from poor beautiful young woman longing to enjoy life exposed both by her position and her natural fascinations to the utmost bewil derment of ﬂattery whether prompted by interest or passion her other acts of folly are most natural and let all who feel inclined harshly to condemn her remember to gently scan your brother man still gentler sister woman surely in all the stern pages of life there is none on which more terrible price is exacted every precious endowment her rank and reign only made her powerless to good and exposed her to danger her talents only served to irritate her foes and disappoint her friends this most charming of women was the destruction of her lovers married three times she had never any happiness wife but in both the connections of her choice found that she had either never possessed or could not retain even few weeks the love of the men she had chosen so that darnley was willing to risk her life and that of his unborn child to wreak his wrath upon rizzio and after few pg 148 pg 149 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https with bothwell she was heard calling aloud knife to kill herself with mother twice and of son and daughter both the children were brought forth in loneliness and sorrow and separated from her early her son educated to hate her her daughter at once immured in convent add the eighteen years of her imprisonm ent and the fact that this foolish prodigal world when there was in it one woman ﬁtted by her grace and loveliness to charm all eyes and enliven all fancies suffered her to be shut up to water with her tears her dull embroi dery during all the full of her life and you will hardly get beyond this story tragedy not noble but pallid and forlorn such were the bootless best thoughts i had while looking at the dull and secret stair of holyrood at the ruins of loch leven castle and afterward at abbotsford where the picture of queen mary head it lay on the pillow when severed from the block hung opposite to ﬁne caricature of queen elizabeth dancing high and disposedly in this last the face is like mask so frightful is the expression of cold craft irritated vanity and the malice of lonely breast in contrast with the attitude and elaborate frippery of the dress the ambassador looks on dismayed the little page can scarcely control the laughter which swells his boyish cheeks such can win the world which better hearts and such mary was even if it had large black speck in it are most like to lose that was most lovely day on which we entered perth and saw in full sunshine its beautiful meadows among them the the famous commemorated in the fair maid of perth adorned with graceful trees like those of the new england country towns in the afternoon we visited the modern kinfauns the stately home of lord grey the drive to it is most beautiful on the one side the park with noble heights that skirt it on the other through belt of trees was seen the river and the sweep of that fair and cultivated country the house is ﬁne one and furnished with taste the library large and some good works in marble among the family pictures one arrested my attention face of girl full of the most pathetic sensibility and with restraint of convention upon its ardent gentle expression she died young returning we were saddened almost always on leaving any such place by seeing such swarms of dirty women and dirtier children at the doors of the cottages almost close by the gate of the avenue to the horrors and sorrows of the streets in such places liverpool glasgow and above all london one has to grow insensible or die daily but here in the sweet fresh green country where there seems to be room everybody it is impossible to forget the frightful inequalities between the lot of man and man or believe that god can smile upon state of things such we ﬁnd existent here can any man who has seen these things dare blame the associationists their attempt to ﬁnd prevention against such misery and wickedness in our land rather will not every man of tolerable intelligence and good feeling commend say rather revere every earnest attem pt in that direction nor dare interfere with any unless he has better to of fer in its place next morning we passed on to crief f in whose neighborhood we visited drummond castle the abode or rather one of the abodes of lord willoughby it has noble park through which you pass by an avenue of two miles long the old keep is still ascended to get the ﬁne view of the surrounding country and during queen victoria visit her guards were quartered there but what took my fancy most was the fashioned garden full of old shrubs and new ﬂowers with its formal parterres in the shape of the family arms and its clipped yew and box trees it was fresh from shower and now glittering and fragrant in bright sunshine this afternoon we pursued our way passing through the plantations of ochtertyre far more charming place to my taste than drummond castle freer and more various in its features five or six of these ﬁne places lie in the neighborhood of crief f and the traveller may give two or three days to visiting them with rich reward of delight but we were pressing on to be with the lakes and mountains rather and that night brought us to fillan where we saw the moon shining on loch earn pg 150 pg 151 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https this region and that of loch katrin and the trosachs which we reached next day scott has described exactly in the lady of the lake nor is it possible to appreciate that poem without going thither neither to describe the scene better than he has done after you have seen it i was somewhat disappointed in the pass of the trosachs itself it is very grand but the grand part lasts so little while the opening view of loch katrine however surpassed expectation it was late in the afternoon when we launched our little boat there ellen isle the boatmen recite though not con molto espressione the parts of the poem which describe these localities observing that they spoke of the personages too with the same air of conﬁdence we asked if they were sure that all this really happened they replied certainly it had been told from father to son through so many generations such is the power of genius to interpolate what it will into the regular of time voyage leaving loch katrine the following day we entered rob roy country and saw on the way the house where helen macgregor was born and rob roy sword which is shown in house by the we came in up loch katrine though both on that and loch lomond you may go in hateful little steamer with squeaking ﬁddle to play rob roy macgregor i walked almost all the way through the pass from loch katrine to loch lomond it was distance of six miles but you feel if you could walk sixty in that pure exhilarating air at inversnaid we took boat again to go down loch lomond to the little inn of rowardennan from which the ascent is made of ben lomond the greatest elevation in these parts the boatmen are ﬁne athletic men one of those with us this evening handsome young man of two or three and twenty sang to us some gaelic songs the ﬁrst very wild and plaintive air was the expostulation of girl whose lover has deserted her and married another it seems he is ashamed and will not even look at her when they meet upon the road she implores him if he has not forgotten all that scene of bygone love at least to lift up his eyes and give her one friendly glance the sad crooning burden of the stanzas in which she repeats this request was very touching when the boatman had ﬁnished he hung his head and seemed ashamed of feeling the song too much then when we asked another he said he would sing another about girl that was happy this one was in three parts first tuneful address from maiden to her absent lover second his reply assuring her of his ﬁdelity and tenderness third strain which expresses their joy when reunited i thought this boatman had sympathies which would prevent his tormenting any poor women and perhaps make some one happy and this was pleasant thought since probably in the highlands elsewhere maidens lend an ear too oft to the careless wooer maidens hearts are always soft would that men were truer i know that i quote the words correctly but that is the sum and substance of masculine report on these matters the ﬁrst day at rowardennan not being propitious ascending the mountain we went down the lake to sup and got very tired in various ways so that we rose very late next morning their we found day of ten thousand our purpose but unhappily large party had come with the sun and engaged all the horses so that if we went it must be on foot this was something of an enterprise the ascent is four miles and toward the summit quite fatiguing however in the pride of newly gained health and strength i was ready and set forth with alone we took guide the people of the house did not advise it they ought they told us afterward they thought the day was so clear that there was probability of danger and they were afraid of seeming mercenary about it it was however wrong they knew what we did not that even the shepherds if mist comes on can be lost in these hills that party of gentlemen were so few pg 152 pg 153 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https before and only by accident found their way to house on the other side and that child which had been lost was not found ﬁve days long after its death we however nothing doubting set forth ascending slowly and often stopping to enjoy the points of view which are many ben lomond consists of congeries of hills above which towers the true ben or highest peak the head of body on reaching the peak the night was one of beauty and grandeur such imagination never painted you see around you plain ground but on every side constel lations or groups of hills exquisitely dressed in the soft purple of the heather amid which gleam the lakes like eyes that tell the secrets of the earth and drink in those of the heavens peak beyond peak caught from the shifting light all the colors of the prism and on the farthest angel companies seemed hovering in their glorious white robes words are idle on such subjects what can i say but that it was noble vision that satisﬁed the eye and stirred the imagination in all its secret pulses had that been afterward seemed likely the last act of my life there could not have been ﬁner decoration painted on the curtain which was to drop upon it about four we began our descent near the summit the traces of the path are not distinct and i said to after while that we had lost it he said he thought that was of consequence we could ﬁnd oar way down i thought however it was the ground was full of springs that were bridged over in the pathway he accordingly went to look it and i stood still because so tired that i did not like to waste any labor soon he called to that he had found it and i followed in the direction where he seemed to be but i mistook overshot it and saw him more in about ten minutes i became alarmed and called him many times it seems he on his side did the same but the brow of some hill was between us and we neither saw nor heard one another i then thought i would make the best of my way down and i should ﬁnd him upon my arrival but in doing so i found the justice of my apprehension about the springs so soon i got to the foot of the hills i would sink up to my knees in bog and have to go up the hills again seeking better thus i lost much time nevertheless in the twilight i saw at last the lake and the inn of rowardennan on its shore between and it lay direct high heathery hill which i afterward found is called the tongue because hemmed in on three sides by watercourse it looked if could i only get to the bottom of that i should be on comparatively level ground i then attempted to descend in the watercourse but ﬁnding that impracticable climbed on the hill again and let myself down by the heather it was very steep and full of deep holes with great fatigue i got to the bottom but when about to cross the watercourse there it looked so deep in the dim twilight that i felt afraid i got down far i could by the root of tree and threw down stone it sounded very hollow and made afraid to jump the shepherds told afterward if i had i should probably have killed myself it was so deep and the bed of the torrent full of sharp stones i then tried to ascend the hill again there was other way to get off it but soon sunk down utterly exhausted when able to get up again and look about it was completely dark i saw far below light that looked about big pin head which i knew to be from the inn at rowardennan but heard sound except the rush of the waterfall and the sighing of the the ﬁrst few minutes after i perceive d i had got to my night lodging such it was the prospect seemed appalling i was very lightly clad feet and dress were very wet had only little shawl to throw round and cold autumn wind had already come and the was to fall on all fevered and exhausted i was i thought i should not live through the night or if i did live always miserable invalid there was chance to keep myself warm by walking now it was dark it would be too dangerous to stir pg 154 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https only chance however lay in motion and my only help in myself and so convinced was i of this that i did keep in motion the whole of that long night imprisoned i was on such little perch of that great mountain how long it seemed under such circumstances only those can guess who may have been similarly circumstan ced the mental experience of the time most precious and profound it was indeed season lonely dangerous and helpless enough the birth of thoughts beyond what the common sunlight will ever call to being be told in another place and time about two hours i saw the stars and very cheery and companionable they looked but then the mist fell and i saw nothing more except such apparitions visited ossian on the when he went out by night and struck the bosky shield and called to him the spirits of the heroes and the maids with their blue eyes of grief to too came those visionary shapes ﬂoating slowly and gracefully their white robes would unfurl from the great body of mist in which they had been engaged and come upon with kiss pervasively cold that of death what they might have told who knows if i had but resigned myself more passively to that cold breathing at last the moon rose i could not see her but the silver light ﬁlled the mist then i knew it was two and that having weathered out so much of the night i might the rest and the hours hardly seemed long to more it may give an idea of the extent of the mountain to say that though i called every now and then with all my force in case by chance some aid might be near and though less than twenty men with their dogs were looking i never heard sound except the rush of the waterfall and the sighing of the and once or twice the startling of the grouse in the heather it was sublime indeed never gotten prese ntation of stern serene realities at last came the signs of day the gradual clearing and breaking up some faint sounds from i know not what the little ﬂies too arose from their bed amid the purple heather and bit truly they were very welcome to so but what was my disappointment to ﬁnd the mist so thick that i could see neither lake nor inn nor anything to guide i had to go by guess and it happened my yankee method served well i ascended the hill crossed the torrent in the waterfall ﬁrst drinking some of the water which was good at that time ambrosia i crossed in that place because the waterfall made steps it were to the next hill to be sure they were covered with water but i was already entirely wet with the mist so that it did not matter i then kept on scrambling it happened in the right direction till about seven some of the shepherds found the moment they came all my feverish strength departed though if unaided i dare say it would have kept up during the day and they carried home where my arrival relieved my friends of distress far greater than i had under gone i had had my grand solitude my ossianic visions and the pleasure of sustaining myself while they had only doubt amounting to anguish and fruitless search through the night entirely contrary to my expectations i only suffered this few days and was able to take parting look at my prison i went down the lake with feelings of complacency it was hill that tongue with the deep ravines on either side and the richest robe of heather i have seen anywhere gave all the men who were looking dinner in the barn and he and ministered to them and they talked of burns really the national writer and known by them apparently none other is and of escapes by ﬂood and fell afterwards they were all brought up to see and it was pleasing indeed to observe the good breeding and good feeling with which they deported themselves on the occasion indeed this adventure created quite an intimate feeling between us and the people there i had been much pleased with them before in attending one of their dances on account of the genuine independence and politeness of their conduct they were willing and pleased pg 155 pg 156 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https dance their highland ﬂings and strathspeys our amusement and did it naturally and freely they would have of fered the stranger the best chair all the rest must wait while i can not economize time to keep up my record in any proportion with what happens nor can i get out of scotland on this page i had intended without utterly slighting many gifts and graces letter vi inverary argyle family on the dirt and the scottish chiefs tournament gr ee alter abbey tomb paris november i am very sorry to leave such wide gap between my letters but i was inevitably prevented from ﬁnishing one that was begun the steamer of the 4th of november i then hoped to prepare one after my arrival here in time the hibernia but severe cold caught on the way unﬁtted writing it is now necessary to retrace my steps long way or lose sight of several things it has seemed desirable to mention to friends in america though i shall make out my narrative more brieﬂy than if nearer the time of action if i mistake not my last closed just i was looking back on the hill where i had passed the night in all the miserable chill and amid the ghostly apparitions of scotch mist but which looked in the morning truly beautiful and had i not known it too well to be deceived alluring in its mantle of rich pink heath the tallest and most full of blossoms we anywhere saw and with the waterfall making music by its side and sparkling in the morning sun passing from tarbet we entered the grand and beautiful pass of glencoe with purple shadows with bright lights betwe en and in one place showing an exquisitely silent and lonely little lake the wildness of the scene was heightened by the black highland cattle feeding here and there they looked much at home too in the park at inverary where i saw them next day in inverary i was disappointed i found indeed the position of every object the same indicated in the legend of montrose but the expression of the whole seemed unlike what i had fancied the present abode of the argyle family is modern structure and boasts very few vestiges of the old romantic history attached to the name the park and upon the lake are beautiful but except from the brief pleasure derived from these the old cross from iona that stands in the lace and the drone of the bagpipe which lulled to sleep at night playing some melancholy air there was nothing to make feel that it was far cry to lochawe but on the contrary i seemed in the very midst of the prosaic the civilized world leaving inverary we left that day the highlands too passing through hell glen very wild and grand deﬁle taking boat then on loch levy we passed down the clyde stopping an hour or two on our way at dumbarton nature herself foresaw the of picture when she made and placed this rock there is every preparation the artist stealing little piece from her treasures to hang on the walls of room here i saw the sword of wallace wight shown by son of the nineteenth century who said that this hero lived about ﬁfty years ago and who did not know the height of this rock in cranny of which he lived or at least ate and slept and donned his clothes from the top of the rock i saw sunset on the beautiful clyd animated that day by an endless procession of steamers little skiffs and boats in one of the former the cardif f castle we embarked the last light of day was fading and that evening found ourselves in glasgow pg 157 pg 158 pg 159 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https understand there is an intellectual society of high merit in glasgow but we were there only few hours and did not see any one certainly the place it may be judged of merely from the general aspect of the population and such objects may be seen in the streets more resembles an inferno than any other we have yet visited the people are more crowded together and the stamp of squalid stolid misery and degradat ion more obvious and appalling the english and scotch not take kindly to poverty like those of sunnier climes it makes them ﬁerce or stupid and life presenting other cheap pleasure they take refuge in drinking i saw here in glasgow persons especially women dressed in dirty wretched tatters worse than none and with an expression of listless unexpecting woe upon their faces far more tragic than the inscription over the gate of dante inferno to one species of misery suffered here to the last extent i shall advert in speaking of london but from all these sorrowful tokens i by means inferred the falsehood of the information that here was to be found circle rich in intellect and in aspira tion the manufacturing and commercial towns burning focuses of grief and vice are also the centres of intellectual life in the rarest ﬂowers and fruits are developed by use of impure and repulsive materials where evil comes to an extreme heaven seems busy in providing means the remedy glaring throughout scotland and england is the necessity the devoutest application of intellect and love to the cure of ills that cry aloud and without such application erelong help must be sought by other means than words yet there is every reason to hope that those who ought to help are seriously though slowly becoming alive to the imperative nature of this duty so we must not cease to hope even in the streets of glasgow and the of manchester and the dreariest recesses of london from glasgow we passed to stirling like dumbarton endeared to the mind which cherishes the memory of its childhood more by association with miss porter scottish chiefs than with snowdon knight and scotland king we reached the town too late to see the castle before the next morning and i took up at the inn the scottish chiefs in which i had not read word since ten or twelve years old we are in the habit now of laughing when this book is named if it were representative of what is most absurdly stilted or bombastic but now in reading my maturer mind was differently impressed from what i expected and the infatuation with which childhood and early youth regard this book and its companion thaddeus of warsaw was justiﬁed the characters and dialogue are indeed out of nature but the sentiment that animates them is pure true and less healthy than noble here is bad drawing bad drama but good music to which the unspoiled heart will always echo even when the intellect has learned to demand better organ its communication the castle of stirling is rich any place in romantic associations we were shown its dungeons and its court of lions where says tradition wild animals kept in the grated cells adjacent were brought out on festival occasions to furnish entertainmen t the court so while lords and ladies gay danced and sang above prisoners pined and wild beasts starved below this at ﬁrst blush looks like very barbarous state of things but on reﬂection one does not ﬁnd that we have outgrown it in our present state of reﬁned civilization only the present way of expressing the same facts is little different still lords and ladies dance and sing unknowing or uncaring that the laborers who minister to their luxuries starve or are turned into wild beasts man need not boast his condition methinks till he can weave his costly tapestry without the side that is kept under looking thus sadly the tournament ground is still kept green and in beautiful order near stirling castle memento of the olden time and we passed away down the beautiful firth turn of the river gave us very advantageous view of it so gay it looked so festive in the bright sunshine one almost seemed to see the graceful forms of knight and noble pricking their pg 160 pg 161 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https steeds to the encounter or the stalwart douglas vindicating his claim to be indeed chief by conquest in the rougher sports of the yeomanry passing along the firth to edinbur gh we again passed two or three days in that beautiful city which i could not be content to leave so imperfectly seen if i had not some hope of revisiting it when the bright lights that adorn it are concentred there in summer almost every one is absent i was very fortunate to see many interesting persons i did on this second visit i saw james simpson philanthropist and leader in the cause of popular education infant schools have been an especial care of his and america well scotland has received the beneﬁt of his thoughts on this subject his last good work has been to induce the erection of public baths in edinbur gh and the working people of that place already deeply in his debt the lectures he has been unwearied in delivering their beneﬁt have signiﬁed their gratitude by presenting him with beautiful model of fountain in silver an ornament to his study never was there place where such measure would be more important if cleanliness be akin to godliness edinbur gh stands at great disadvantage in her devotions the impure air the terriﬁc dirt which surround the working people must make all progress in higher culture impossible and i saw nothing which seemed to so likely to have results of incalculable good this practical measure of the simpsons in support of the precept wash and be clean every whit we returned into england by the way of melrose not content to leave scotland without making our pilgrimage to abbotsford the universal feeling however has made this pilgrimage so common that there is nothing left to say yet though i had read hundred descriptions everything seemed new i went over this epitome of the mind and life of scott what constitutes the great man is more commonly some extraordinary combination and balance of qualities than the highest development of any one so you can not but here be struck anew by the singular combination in scott mind of love the picturesque and romantic with the plainest common sense delight in heroic excess with the prudential habit of order here the most pleasing order pervades emblems of what men commonly esteem disorder and excess amid the exquisite beauty of the ruins of drybur gh i saw with regret that scott body rests in almost the only spot that is not green and can not well be made so the light does not reach it that is not ﬁt couch him who dressed so many dim and relics with living green always cheerful and beneﬁcent scott seemed to the common eye in like measure prosperous and happy up to the last years and the chair in which under the pressure of the sorrows which led to his death he was propped up to write when brain and eye and hand refused their aid the product remaining only guide to the speculator to the workings of the mind in case of insanity or approaching imbecility would by most persons be viewed the only saddening relic of his career yet when i recall some passages in the lady of the lake and the address to his harp i can not doubt that scott had the full share of bitter in his cup and feel the tender hope that we about other gentle and generous guardians and benefactors of our youth that in nobler career they are now fulﬁlling still higher duties with serener mind doubtless too they are trusting in us that we will try to ﬁll their places with kindly deeds ardent thoughts nor leave the world in their absence dim vast vale of tears vacant and desolate letter vii pg 162 pg 163 pg 164 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https into ork with its minster arwick and charming and theodor parker and paris paris we crossed the moorland in heavy rain and reached newcastle late at night next day we descended into it was quite an odd sensation to be taken off one feet and dropped down into darkness by the bucket the stables under ground had pleasant air though the poor horses can not like it much generally they see the light of day more after they have once been let down into these gloomy recesses but pass their days in dragging cars along the rails of the narrow passages and their nights in eating hay and dreaming of grass when we went down we meant to go along the gallery to the place where the miners were then at work but found this was walk of mile and half and beside the weariness of picking one steps slowly along by the light of tallow candle too wet and dirty an enterprise to be undertaken by way of amusement so after proceeding half mile or so we begged to be restore d to our accustomed level and reached it with minds slightly ediﬁed and face and hands much blackened passing thence we saw york with its minster that dream of beauty realized from its roof i saw two rainbows overarching that lovely country through its aisles i heard grand music pealing but how sorrowfully bare is the interior of such cathedral despoiled of the statues the paintings and the garlands that belong to the catholic religion the eye aches them such church is ruined by protestantism its admirable exterior seems that of sepulchre there is correspondent life within within the citadel tower half ruined and is life that has been growing up while the exterior bulwarks of the old feudal time crumbled to ruin geor ge fox while prisoner at york obedience to the dictates of his conscience planted here walnut and the tall tree that grew from it still bears testimony to his living presence on that spot the tree is old but still bears nuts one of them was taken away by my companions and may perhaps be the parent of tree somewhere in america that shall shade those who inherit the spirit if they not attach importance to the etiquettes of quakerism in shefﬁeld i saw the sooty servitors tending their furnaces i saw them also on saturday night after their work was done going to receive its poor wages looking pallid and dull if they had spent on tempering the steel that vital force that should have tempered themselves to manhood we saw also chatsworth with its park and mock wilderness and immense conservatory and really splendid fountains and weal th of marbles it is ﬁne expression of modern luxury and splendor but did not interest i found little there of true beauty or grandeur warwick castle is place entirely to my mind real representative of the english aristocracy in the day of its nobler life the grandeur of the pile itself and its beauty of position introduce you ﬁtly to the noble company with which the genius of vandyke has peopled its walls but short time was allowed to look upon these nobles warriors statesmen and ladies who gaze upon us in turn with such majesty of historic association yet was i very well satisﬁed it is not difﬁcult to see men through the eyes of vandyke his way of viewing character seems superﬁcial though commanding he sees the man in his action on the crowd not in his hidden life he does not like some painters amaze and engross us by his revelations to the secret springs of conduct i know not by what hallucination i forebore to look at the picture i most desired to see of lucy countess of carlisle i was looking at something else and when the fat pompous butler announced her i did not recognize her name from his mouth afterward it ﬂashed across pg 165 pg 166 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https that i had really been standing before her and forgotten to look but repent ance was too late i had passed the castle gate to return more pretty leamington and stratford are hackneyed ground of the latter i only observed what if i knew i had forgotten that the room where shakespeare was born has been an object of devotion only forty years england has learned much of her appre ciation of shakespeare from the germans in the days of innocence i fondly supposed that every one who could understand english and was not cannibal adored shakespeare and read him on sundays always an hour or more and on week days considerable portion of the time but i have lived to know some hundreds of persons in my native land without ﬁnding ten who had any direct acquaintance with their greatest benefactor and i dare say in england large an experience would not end more honorably to its subjects so vast treasure is left untouched while men are complaining of being poor because they have not toothpicks exactly to their mind at stratford i handled too the poker used to such good purpose by geof frey crayon the muse had ﬂed the ﬁre was out and the poker rusty yet pleasant inﬂuence lingered even in that cold little room and seemed to lend transient glow to the poker under the inﬂuence of sympathy in birmingham i heard two discourses from one of the rising lights of england geor ge dawson young man of whom i had earlier heard much in praise he is friend of the people in the sense of brotherhood not of social convenience or patronage in literature catholic in matters of religion antisecta rian seeking truth in aspiration and love he is eloquent with good method in his discourse ﬁre and dignity when wanted with frequent homeliness in enforcement and illustration which offends the etiquettes of england but ﬁts him the better the class he has to address his powers are uncommon and unfettered in their play his aim is worthy he is fulﬁlling and will fulﬁl an important task an educator of the people if all be not marred by taint of and arrogance now obvious in his discourse this taint is not surprising in one so young who has done so much and in order to it has been compelled to great and light heed of the authority of other minds and who is surrounded almost exclusively by admirers neither is it at present large speck it may be quite purged from him by the inﬂuence of nobler motives and the rise of his ideal standard but on the other hand should it spread all must be vitiated let us hope the best he is one that could ill be spared from the band who have taken up the cause of progress in england in this connection i may well speak of james martineau whom i heard in liverpool and fox whom i heard in london martineau looks like the the partially developed man and his speech conﬁrms this impression he is sometimes conservative sometimes reformer not in the sense of eclecticism but because his powers and views not ﬁnd true harmony on the conservative side he is scholarly acute the other pathetic pictorial generous he is prophet and sage yet man full of ﬁne affections and thoughts always suggestive sometimes satisfactory he is well adapted to the wants of that class large one in the present day who love the new wine but not feel that they can afford to throw away all their old bottles fox is the reverse of all this he is homogeneous in his materials and harmonious in the results he produces he has great persuasive power it is the persuasive power of mind warmly engaged in seeking truth itself he sometimes carries homeward convictions with great energy driving in the thought with golden nails glow of kindly human sympathy enlivens his argument and the whole presents thought in proportioned animated body but i am told he is far superior in speech on political or social problems than on such i heard him discuss i was reminded in hearing all three of men similarly engaged in our country charming and theodore parker none of them compare in the symmetrical arrangement pg 167 pg 168 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https extempore discourse or in pure eloquence and communication of spiritual beauty with charming nor in fulness and sustained ﬂow with parker but in power of practical and homely adaptation of their thought to common wants they are superior to the former and all have more variety ﬁner perceptions and are more powerful in single passages than parker and now my pen has run to 1st october and still i have such notabilities fell to my lot to observe while in london and these that are thronging upon here in paris to record you i am sadly in arrears but is comfort to think that such meats i have to serve up are good cold hot at any rate it is just impossible to any better and i shall comfort myself often

difﬁcult pr errors of poverty baillie and madame berry margar et people wood the poor of jer emy the thom paris december i sit down here in paris to narrate some recollections of london the distance in space and time is not great yet i seem in wholly different world here in the region of lights mirrors bright wood ﬁres shrugs vivacious ejaculations wreathed smiles and adroit courtesies it is hard to remember john bull with his hands in pockets except when extended ungracious demand of the perpetual wn or to pay the all but perpetual mug of beer john seen on that side is certainly the most churlish of clowns and the most clownish of churls but then there are so many other sides when gentleman he is so truly the gentleman when man so truly the man of honor his graces when he has any grow up from his inmost heart not that he is free from humbug on the contrary he is prone to the most solemn humbug generally of the philanthrophic or otherwise moral kind but he is always awkward beneath the mask and can never impose upon himself nature meant him to be noble generous sincere and has furnished him with faculties to make himself agreeable in any other way or mode of being is not so with your frenchman who can cheat you pleasantly and move with grace in the devious and slippery path you would be almost sorry to see him quite disinterested and straightforward so much of agreeable talent and naughty wit would thus lie hid want of use but john john we must admire esteem or be disgusted with thee to climate there is not much to choose at this time of year in london six weeks we never saw the sun and fog in paris we have not been blessed with its cheering rays above three or four days in the same length of time and are beside tormented with an oily and tenacious mud beneath the feet which makes it almost impossible to walk this year indeed is an uncommonly severe one at paris but then if they have their share of dark cold days it must be admitted that they all they can to enliven them pg 169 pg 170 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https to dwell ﬁrst on london in itself world we arrived at time which the englishman considers time at all out of the seaso n when parliament is in session and london thronged with the equipages of her aristocracy her titled wealthy nobles i was listened to with smile of contempt when i declared that the stock shows of london would yield amusement and employment more than sufﬁcient the time i had to stay but i found that with my way of viewing things it would be to an inexhaustible studio and that if life were only long enough i would live there years obscure in some corner from which i could issue forth day by day to watch unobserved the vast stream of life or to decipher the hieroglyphics which ages have been inscribing on the walls of this vast palac i may not call it temple which human effort has reared means not yet used efﬁcaciously of human culture and though i wish to return to london in the season when that city is an adequate representative of the state of things in england i am glad i did not at ﬁrst see all that pomp and parade of wealth and luxury in contrast with the misery squalid agonizing rufﬁanly which stares one in the face in every street of london and hoots at the gates of her palaces more ominous note than ever was that of owl or raven in the portentous times when empires and races have crumbled and fallen from inward decay it is impossible however to take near view of the treasures created by englis h genius accumulated by english industry without prayer daily more fervent that the needful changes in the condition of this people may be effected by peaceful revolution which shall destroy nothing except the shocking inhumanity of exclusiveness which now prevents their being used the beneﬁt of all may their present possessors look to it in time few already are earnest in good spirit myself much i pitied the poor abandoned hopeless wretches that swarm in the roads and streets of england i pity far more the english noble with this difﬁcult problem before him and such need of speedy solution sad is his life if conscientious man sadder still if not poverty in england has terrors of which i never dreamed at home i felt that it would be terrible to be poor there but far more so to be the possessor of that which so many thousands are perishing and the middle class too can not here enjoy that serenity which the sages have described naturally their peculiar blessing too close too dark throng the evils they can not obviate the sorrows they can not reliev to man of good heart each day must bring purgatory which he knows not how to bear yet to which he fears to become insensible from these clouds of the present it is pleasant to turn the thoughts to some objects which have cast light upon the past and which by the virtue of their very nature prescribe hope the future i have mentioned with satisfaction seeing some persons who illustrated the past dynasty in the progress of thought here wordsworth chalmers quincey andrew combe with still higher pleasure because to one of my own sex whom i have honored almost above any i went to pay my court to joanna baillie i found on her brow not indeed coronal of gold but serenity and strength undimmed and unbroken by the weight of more than fourscore years or by the scanty appreciation which her thoughts have received i prize joanna baillie and madame roland the best specimens which have been hitherto offered of women of roman strength and singleness of mind adorned by the various culture and capable of the various action opened to them by the progress of the christian idea they are not sentimental they not sigh and write of withere d ﬂowers of fond affection and woman heart born to be misunderstood by the object or objects of her fond inevitable choice love the passion when spoken of at all by them seems thing noble religious worthy to be felt they not write of it always they did not think of it always they saw other things in this great rich suffering world in superior delicacy of touch they show the woman but the hand is ﬁrm nor was all their speech one continued utterance of mere personal experience it contained things which are good intellectually universally pg 171 pg 172 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https regret that the writings of joanna baillie are not more known in the united states the plays on the passions are faulty in their plan attempts at comic even at truly dramatic effect fail but there are masterly sketches of character vigorous expre ssions of wise thought deep fervent ejaculations of an aspiring soul we found her in her little calm retreat at hampstead surrounded by marks of love and reverence from distinguished and excellent friends near her was the sister older than herself yet still sprightly and full of active kindness whose character and their mutual relation she has in one of her last poems indicated with such happy mixture of sagacity humor and tender pathos and with so absolute truth of outline although autograph collector i asked theirs and when the elder gave hers sister to joanna baillie it drew tear from my eye good tear genuine pearl homage to that fairest product of the soul of man humble disinterested tenderness hampstead has still good deal of romantic beauty i was told it was the favorite of london artists till the railroads gave them easy means of spending few hours to advantage farther off but indeed there is wonderful deal of natural beauty lying in untouched sweetness near london near one of our cities it would all have been grabbed up the ﬁrst thing but we too are beginning to grow wiser at richmond i went to see another lady of more than threescore years celebrity more than fourscore in age miss berry the friend of horace walpole and her charms of manner and conversation long and still reigning power she has still the vivacity the careless nature or reﬁned art that made her please so much in earlier days is girlish and gracefully so verily with her was sign of labor or sorrow from the older turning to the young i must speak with pleasure of several girls i know in london who are devoting themselves to painting profession they have really wise and worthy views of the artist avocation if they remain true to them they will enjoy free serene existence unprofaned by undue care or sentimental sorrow amo ng these margaret gillies has attained some celebrity she may be known to some in america by engravings in the people journal from her pictures but if i remember right these are coarse things and give just notion of her pictures which are distinguished elegance and reﬁnement little mannerized but she is improving in that respect the people journal comes nearer being fair sign of the times than any other publication of england apparently if we except punch the times on which you all use your scissors so industriously it is managed with vast ability doubt but the blood would tingle many time to the ﬁngers ends of the body politic before that solemn organ which claims to represent the heart would dare to beat in uniso still it would require all the wise management of the times or wisdom enough to without it and wide range and diversity of talen t indeed almost sweeping the circle to make people journal england the present is only bud of the future ﬂower mary and william howitt are its main support i saw them several times at their cheerful and elegant home in mary howitt i found the same engaging traits of character we are led to expect from her books children her husband is full of the same agreeable information communicated in the same lively yet precise manner we ﬁnd in his books it was like talking with old friends except that now the eloquence of the eye was added at their house i became acquainted with southwood smith the philanthropist he is at present engaged on the construction of good tenements calculated to improve the condition of the working people his plans look promising and should they succeed you shall have detailed account of them on visiting him we saw an object which i had often heard celebrated and had thought would be revolting but found on the contrary an agreeable sight this is the skeleton of jeremy bentham it was at bentham request that the skeleton dressed in the same dress he habitually wore stuffed out to an exact resemblance of life and with portrait mark in wax the best i ever saw sits there assistant to smith in the entertainment of his guests and companion of pg 173 pg 174 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https studies the ﬁgure leans little forward resting the hands on stout stick which bentham always carried and had named dapple the attitude is quite easy the expression of the whole quite mild winning yet highly individual it is pleasing mark of that unity of aim and tendency to be expected throughout the life of such mind that bentham while quite young man had made will in which to oppose in the most convincing manner the prejudice against dissection of the human subject he had given his body after death to be used in service of the cause of science i have not yet been able said the will to much service to my by my life but perhaps i may in this manner by my death many years after reading pamphlet by smith on the same subject he was much pleased with it became his friend and bequeathed his body to his care and use with directions that the skeleton should ﬁnally be disposed of in the way i have described the countenance of smith has an expression of expansive sweet almost childlike goodness miss gillies has made charming picture of him with favorite little granddaughter nestling in his arms another marked ﬁgure that i encountered on this great showboard was cooper the author of the purgatory of luicides very remarkable poem of which had there been leisure before my departure i should have made review and given copious extracts in the tribune cooper is strong man and probably milder one than when in the prison where that poem was written the earnestness in seeking freedom and happiness all men which drew upon him that penalty seems unabated he is very signiﬁcant type of the new and also an agent in bringing it near one of the poets of the people also i saw sweetest singer of them all chieftain unknown to the queen is again exacting cruel tribute from him i wish much that some of those of new york who have taken an interest in him would provide there nook in which he might ﬁnd refuge and solace the evening of his days to sing or to work likes him best and where he could bring up two ﬁne boys to happier prospects than the parent land will afford them could and would america but take from other lands more of the talent well the bone and sinew she would be rich but the stroke of the clock warns to stop now and begin with fresher eye and hand on some interesting topics my sketches are slight still they can not be made

old age but i can not think this will prove ﬁrm in texture and fair of hue what is done by sunlight give lonely chamber window from which through the foliage you can catch glimpses of beautiful

notes to make on london we had scarcely any sunlight by which to see pictures and i postponed all visits to private collections except one in the hope of being in england next time in the long summer days in the national gallery i saw little except the murillos they were so beautiful that with who had true conception of his kind of genius before they took away the desire to look into anything else at the same time they did not affect much either except with sense of content in this genius so rich and full and strong it was cup of sunny wine that refreshed but brought intoxicati ng visions there is something very noble in the genius of spain there is such an intensity and singleness it seems to it has not half shown itself and must have an important part to play yet in the drama of this planet at the dulwich gallery i saw the flower girl of murillo an enchanting picture the memory of which must always cast light upon the day light that will not pass away sweet forewarning who can despair when he thinks of form like that so full of life and bliss nature that made such human forms to match the butterﬂy and the bee on june mornings when the are in blossom has surely enough of happiness in store to satisfy us all somewhere some time it was pleasant indeed to see the treasu res of those galleries of the british museum and of so charming place hampton court open to everybody in the national gallery one ﬁnds throng of and men just come from their work true they make great deal of noise thronging to and fro on the uncarpeted ﬂoors in their thick boots and noise from which when penetrated by the atmosphere of art men in the thick est boots would know how to refrain still i felt that the sight of such objects must be gradually doing them great deal of good the british museum would in itself be an education man who should go there once week and think and read at his leisure moments about what he saw hampton court i saw in the gloom and rain and my chief recollections are of the magniﬁcent beneath whose work of took refuge from the pelting shower the expectations cherished from childhood about the cartoons were all bafﬂed there was light by which they could be seen but i must hope to visit hampton court again in the time of roses the zoölogical gardens are another pleasure of the million since although something is paid there it is so little that almost all can afford it to it is vast pleasu re to see animals where they can show out their habits or instincts and to see them assembled from all climates and countries amid verdure and with room enough they are here is true poem they have ﬁne lion the ﬁrst i ever saw that realized the idea we have of the king of the animal world but the groan and roar of this one were equally royal the eagles were ﬁne but rather disgraced themselves it is trait of english piety which would doubt ﬁnd its defenders among ourselves not to feed the animals on sunday that their keepers may have rest at least this was the explanation given us by one of these men of the state of ravenous hunger in which we found them on the monday i half hope he was jesting with us certain it is that the eagles were wild with famine and even the grandest of them who had eyed us at ﬁrst if we were not ﬁt to live in the same zone with him when the meat came round after short struggle to maintain his dignity joined in wild shriek and scramble with the rest sir john soane museum i visited containing the sarcophagus described by waagen hogarth pictures ﬁne canaletto and manuscript of tasso it ﬁlls the house once the

round the serene and sleepy face of its wearer here are fourteen in one you ﬁnd all the palms in another the productions of the regions of snow in another those squibs and humorsome utterances of nature the cactuses there i saw the of all the cactuses hoary solemn plant declared to be thousand years old disdaining to say if it is not really much older in yet another the most exquisitely minute plants delicate the tracery of frostw ork too delicate the bowers of fairies such at least visit the gross brains of earthly poets the reform club was the only one of those splendid establishments that i visited certainly the force of comfort can farther go nor can anything be better contrived to make dressing eating and even sleeping there are bedrooms well those who will comfortable can be imagined yet to this palace of so many single gentlemen rolled into one seemed stupidly comfortable in the absence of that elegant arrangement and vivacious atmosphere which only women can inspire in the kitchen indeed i met them and on that account it seemed the pleasantest part of the building even there they are but the servants of servants there reigned supreme genius in his way who has published work on cookery and around him his pupils men who pay handsome yearly fee novitiate under his instruction i was not sorry however to see men predominant in the cooking department i hope to see that and washing transferred to their care in the progress of things since they are the stronger sex the arrangements of this kitchen were very ﬁne combining great convenie nce with neatness and even elegance fourier himself might have taken pleasure in them thence we passed into the private apartments of the artist and found them full of pictures by his wife an artist in another walk one or two of them had been engraved she was an englishwoman whimsical little excursion we made on occasion of the anniversary of the of two of my friends they had often enjoyed reading the account of john gilpin in america and now thought that they were in england and near enough they would celebrate theirs also at the bell at edm onton i accompanied them with little page to eke out the train pretty and graceful and playful enough the train of princess but our excursion turned out somewhat of failure in an opposite way to gilpin whereas he went too fast we went too slow first we took coach and went through cheapside to take omnibus at strange misnomer the flower but gilpin could never have had his race through cheapside it is in its present crowded state we were obliged to proceed at funeral pace we missed the omnibus and when we took the next one it went with the slowness of family horse in the old chaise of new england deacon and after all only took us at the house carriage was to be sought the lady who let it and all her grooms were to be allowed time to recover from their consternation at so unusual move strangers taking carriage to dine at the little inn at edmonton now mere alehouse before we could be allowed to proceed the english stand lost in amaze at yankee notions with their quick come and go and it is impossible to make them go ahead in the zigzag path unless you push them rather old part of the plan had been pilgrimage to the grave of lamb with collateral view to the rural beauties of edmonton but night had fallen on all such hopes two hours at least before we reached the bell there indeed we found them somewhat more alert to comprehend our wishes they laughed when we spoke of gilpin showed us print of the race and the window where gilpin must have stood ony alas there was none allowed us to make our own ﬁre and provided us wedding dinner of tough meat and stale bread nevertheless we danced dined paid i believe and celebrated the wedding quite to our satisfaction though in the space of half an hour pg 179 pg 180 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https knew friends were even at that mom ent expecting us to tea at some miles distance but it is always pleasant in this world of routine to act out freak such one said an english gentleman one of us would rarely have dreamed of much less acted why was it not pleasant oh very but so out of the way returning we passed the house where freiligrath ﬁnds temporary home earning the bread of himself and his family in commercial house england houses the exile but not without and where is the arcadia that dares invite all genius to her arms and change her golden wheat their green laurels and immortal ﬂowers arcadia the name were america and now returns naturally to my mind one of the most interesting things i have seen here or elsewhere school poor italian boys sustained and taught by few of their exiled compatriots and especially by the mind and efforts of mazzini the name of joseph mazzini is well known to those among us who take an interest in the cause of human freedom who not content with the peace and ease bought themselves by the devotion and sacriﬁces of their fathers look with anxious interest on the suffering nations who are preparing similar struggle those who are not like the brutes that perish content with the enjoyment of mere national advantages indifferent to the idea they represent can not get that the human family is one and beats with one great heart they know that there can be genuine happiness salvation any unless the same can be secured all to this universal interest in all nations and places where man understan ding his inheritance strives to throw off an arbitrary rule and establish state of things where he shall be governed becomes man by his own conscience and intelligence he may speak the truth it rises in his mind and indulge his natural emotions in purity added an especial interest in italy the mother of our language and our laws our greatest benefactress in the gifts of genius the garden of the world in which our best thoughts have delighted to expatiate but over whose bowers now hangs perpetual veil of sadness and whose noblest plants are doomed to removal if they can not bear their ripe and perfect fruit in another climate they are not permitted to lift their heads to heaven in their own some of these generous refugees our country has received kindly if not with fervent kindness and the word corr eggio is still in my ears i heard it spoken in new york by one whose heart long oppression could not paralyze speranza some of the italian youth now inscribe on their banners encouraged by some traits of apparent promise in the new pope however their only true hope is in themselves in their own courage and in that wisdom winch may only be learned through many disappointments to how to employ it so that it may destroy tyranny not themselves mazzini one of these noble refugees is not only one of the heroic the courag eous and the faithful boasts many such he is also one of the wise of those who disappointed in the outward resul ts of their undertakings can yet bate jot of heart and hope but must steer right onward it was superﬁcial enthusiasm impatient energies that impelled him but an understanding of what must be the designs of heaven with regard to man since god is love is justice he is one who can live fervently but steadily gently every day every hour well on great occasions cheered by the light of hope with schiller he is sure that those who live their faith shall behold it living he is one of those same beings who measuring all things by the ideal standard have yet time to mourn over failure or imperfection there is too much to be done to obviate it thus mazzini excluded from publication in his native language has acquired the mastery both of french and english and through his expressions in either shine the pg 181 pg 182 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https which animated his earlier effort with mild and steady radiance the misfortunes of his country have only widened the sphere of his instructions and made him an exponent of the better to europe at large those who wish to form an idea of his mind could not better than to read his sketches of the italian martyrs in the people journal they will ﬁnd there on one of the most difﬁcult occasions an ardent friend speaking of his martyred friends with the purity of impulse warmth of sympathy largeness and steadiness of view and ﬁneness of discrimination which must belong to legislator christian commonwealth but though i have read these expressions with great delight this school was one to still more forcible of the same ideas here these poor boys picked up from the streets are redeemed from bondage and gross ignorance by the most patient and constant devotion of time and effort what love and sincerity this demands from minds capable of great thoughts large plans and rapid progress only their peers can comprehend yet exceeding great shall he the reward and amon g the ﬁshermen and poor people of judæa were picked up those who have become to modern europe leaven that leavens the whole mass so may these poor italian boys yet become more efﬁcacious missionaries to their people than would an orphic poet at this period these youths have very commonly good faces and eyes from which that italian ﬁre that has done so much to warm the world glows out we saw the distribution of prizes to the school heard addresses from mazzini pistracci mariotti once resident in our country and an english gentleman who takes great interest in the work and then adjourned to an adjacent room where supper was provided the boys and other guests among whom we saw some of the exiled poles the whole evening gave true and deep pleasure though tinged with sadness we saw planting of the kingdom of heaven though now larger than grain of and though perhaps none of those who watch the spot may live to see the birds singing in its branches i have not yet spoken of one of our benefactors carlyle whom i saw several times i approached him with more reverence after little experience of england and scotland had taught to appreciate the strength and height of that wall of shams and conventions which he more than any man or thousan d men he almost alone begun to throw down wherever there was fresh thought generous hope the thought of carlyle has begun the work he has torn off the veils from hideous facts he has burnt away foolish illusions he has awakened thousands to know what it is to be man we must live and not merely pretend to others that we live he has touched the rocks and they have given forth musical answer little more was wanting to begin to construct the city but that little was wanting and the work of construction is left to those that come after him nay all attempts of the kind he is the readiest to deride fearing new shams worse than the old unable to trust the general action of thought and ﬁnding heroic man natural king to represent it and challenge his conﬁdence accustomed to the inﬁnite wit and exuberant richness of his writings his talk is still an amazement and splendor scarcely to be faced with steady eyes he does not converse harangues it is the usual misfortune of such marked men happily not one invariable or inevitable that they can not allow other minds room to breathe and show themselves in their atmosphere and thus miss the refreshment and instruction which the greatest never cease to need from the experience of the humblest carlyle allows one chance but bears down all opposition not only by his wit and onset of words resistless in their sharpness so many bayonets but by actual physical superiority raising his voice and rushing on his opponent with torrent of sound this is not the least from unwillingness to allow freedom to others on the contrary man would more enjoy manly resistance to his thought but it is the impulse of mind accustomed to follow out its own impulse the hawk its prey and which knows not how to stop in the chase carlyle indeed is arrogant and overbearing but in his arrogance there is littleness or it is the heroic arrogance of some old scandinavian conqueror is his nature pg 183 pg 184 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https the untamable impulse that has given him power to crush the dragons you not love him perhaps nor revere and perhaps also he would only laugh at you if you did but you like him heartily and like to see him the powerful smith the siegfried melting all the old iron in his furnace till it glows to sunset red and burns you if you senselessly go too near he seemed to quite isolated lonely the desert yet never was man more ﬁtted to prize man could he ﬁnd one to match his mood he ﬁnds such but only in the past he sings rather than talks he pours upon you kind of satirical heroical critical poem with regular cadences and generally catching up near the beginn ing some singular epithet which serves refrain when his song is full or with which with he catches up the stitche s if he has chanced now and then to let fall row the higher kinds of poetry he has sense and his talk on that subject is delightfully and gorgeously absurd he sometimes stops minute to laugh at it himself then begins anew with fresh vigor all the spirits he is driving before him seem to him fata morganas ugly masks in fact if he can but make them turn about but he laughs that they seem to others such dainty ariels he puts out his chin sometimes till it looks like the beak of bird and his eyes ﬂash bright instinctive meanings like jove bird yet he is not calm and grand enough the eagle he is more like the falcon and yet not of gentle blood enough that either he is not exactly like anything but himself and therefore you can not see him without the most hearty refreshment and he is original rich and strong enough to afford thousand faults one expects some wild land in rich kingdom his talk like his books is full of pictures his critical strokes maste rly allow his point of view and his survey is admirable he is large subject i can not speak more or wiselier of him now nor needs it his works are true to blame and praise him the siegfried of england great and powerful if not quite invulnerable and of might rather to destroy evil than legislate good at all events he seems to be what destiny intended and represents fully certain side so we make remonstrance to his being and proceeding himself though we sometimes must us i had meant some remarks on some ﬁne pictures and the little i saw of the theatre in england

some respects an improvement upon others i have seen there was the appearance of great neatness and order in the arrangements of life kindness and good judgment in the discipline of the prisoners yet there was also an air of bleak forlornness about the place and it fell far short of what my mind demands of such abodes considered redemption schools but the subject of prisons is now engaging the attention of many of the wisest and best and the tendency is in what seems to the true direction i need not trouble myself to make prude and pg 185 pg 186 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https suggestions it is subject to which persons who would be of use should give the earnest devotion of calm and leisurely thought the same day i went to see an establishment which gave unmixed pleasure it is bathing establishment put at very low rate to enable the poor to avoid one of thee worst miseries of their lot and which yet prom ises to pay joined with this is an establishment washing clothes where the poor can go and hire almost nothing good tubs water ready heated the use of an apparatus rinsing drying and ironing all so admirably arranged that poor woman can in three hours get through an amount of washing and ironing that would under ordinary circumstances occupy three or four days especially the drying closets i contemplated with great satisfaction and hope to see in our own country the same arrangements throughout the cities and even in the towns and villages hanging out the clothes is great exposure women even when they have good place it but when is so common in cities they must dry them in the house how much they suffer in new york i know those poor women who take in washing endure great deal of trouble and toil from this cause i have suffered myself from being obliged to send back what had cost them so much toil because it had been perhaps inevitably soiled in the drying or ironing or ﬁlled with the smell of their miscellaneous cooking in london it is much worse an eminent physician told he knew of two childr en whom he considered to have died because their mother having but one room to live in was obliged to wash and dry clothes close to their bed when they were the poor people in london naturally without washing all they can and beneath that perpetual fall of soot the result may be guessed all but the very poor in england put out their washing and this custom ought to be universal in civilized countries it can be done much better and quicker by few regular laundresses than by many families and the washing day is so malignant foe to the peace and joy of households that it ought to be effaced from the calendar but long we are so miserable to have any very poor people in this world they can not put out their washing because they can not earn enough money to pay it and preliminary to something better washing establishments like this of london are desirable one arrangement that they have here in paris will be good one even when we cease to have any very poor people and please heaven also to have any very rich these are the crèches where poor women leave their children to be nursed during the day while they are at work i must mention that the superintendent of the washing establishment observed with legitimate triumph that it had been built without giving single dinner or printing single puf f extraordinary thing indeed england to turn to something little gayer embroidery on this tattered coat of civilized life went into only two theatres one the old drury once the scene of great glories now of execrable music and more execrable acting if anything can be invented more excruciating than an english opera such was the fashion at the time i was in london i am sure sin of mine deserves the punishment of bearing it at the sadler wells theatre i saw play which i had much admired in reading it but found still better in actual representatio n indeed it seems to there can be better acting play this is the patrician daughter by marston the movement is rapid yet clear and free the dialogue natural digniﬁed and ﬂowing the characters marked with few but distinct strokes where the tone of discourse rises with manly sentiment or passion the audience applauded with bursts of generous feeling that gave great pleasure this play is one that in its scope and meaning marks the new in england it is full of an experience which is inevitable to man of talent there and is harbinger of the day when the noblest commoner shall be the only noble possible in england pg 187 pg 188 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https how different all this acting to what i ﬁnd in france here the theatre is living you see something really good and good throughout not one touch of that stage strut and vulgar bombast of tone which the english actor fancies indispensable to scenic illusion is tolerated here the ﬁrst time in my life i saw something represented in style uniformly good and should have found sufﬁcient proof if i had needed any that all men will prefer what is good to what is bad if only fair opportunity choice be allowed when i came here my ﬁrst thought was to go and see mademoiselle rachel i was sure that in her i should ﬁnd true genius absolutely the diamond and so it proved i went to see her seven or eight times always in parts that required great force of soul and purity of taste even to conceive them and only once had reason to ﬁnd fault with her on one single occasion i saw her violate the harmony of the character to produce effect at particular moment but almost invariably i found her true artist worthy greece and worthy at many moments to have her conceptions immortalized in marble her range even in high tragedy is limite she can only express the darker passions and grief in its most desolate aspects nature has not gifted her with those softer and more ﬂowery attributes that lend to pathos its utmost tenderness she does not melt to tears or calm or elevate the heart by the presence of that tragic beauty that needs all the assaults of fate to make it show its immortal sweetness her noblest aspect is when sometimes she expresses truth in some severe shape and rises simple and austere above the mixed elements around her on the dark side she is very great in hatred and revenge i admired her more in phedre than in any other part in which i saw her the guilty love inspired by the hatred of goddess was expressed in all its symptoms with force and terrible naturalness that almost suffocated the beholder after she had taken the poison the exhaustion and paralysis of the system the sad cold calm submission to fate were still more grand i had heard so much about the power of her eye in one ﬁxed look and the expression she could concentrate in single word that the utmost results could only satisfy my expectations it is indeed something magniﬁcent to see the dark cloud give out such sparks each one ﬁt to deal separate death but it was not that i admired most in her it was the grandeur truth and depth of her conception of each part and the sustained purity with which she represented it the rest i shall write somewhere detailed critique upon the parts in which i saw her it is she who has made acquainted with the true way of viewing french tragedy i had idea of its powers and symmetry till now and have received from the revelation high pleasure and crowd of thoughts the french language from her lips is divine dialect it is stripped of its national and personal peculiarities and becomes what any language must moulded by such genius the pure music of the heart and soul i never could remember her tone in speaking any word it was too perfect you had received the thought quite direct yet had i never heard her speak word my mind would be ﬁlled by her attitudes nothing more graceful can be conceived nor could the genius of sculpture surpass her management of the antique drapery she has beauty except in the intellectual severity of her outline and bears marks of age which will grow stronger every year and make her ugly before long still it will be grandiose gypsy or rather sibylline ugliness well adapted to the expression of some tragic parts only it seems if she could not live long she expends force enough upon part to furnish out dozen common lives though the french tragedy is well acted throughout yet unhappily there is male actor now with spark of ﬁre and these men seem the meanest pigmies by the side of rachel on the scene beside the tragedy intended by the author you see also that common tragedy woman of genius who throws away her precious heart lives and dies one unworthy of her in parts this effect is productive of too much pain i saw rachel one pg 189 pg 190 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https with her brother and sister the sister imitated her so closely that you could not help seeing she had manner and an imitable manner her brother was in the play her lover wretched automaton and presenting the most unhappy family likeness to herself since then i have hardly cared to go and see her we could wish with geniuses with the phoenix to see only one of the family at time in the pathetic or sentimental drama paris boasts another young actress nearly distinguished in that walk rachel in hers this is rose cheny whom we saw in her personation of clarissa harlowe and afterward in genevieve and the protégé sans le savoir little piece written expressly her by scribe the miss clarisse of the french drama is feeble and partial reproduction of the heroine of richardson indeed the original in all its force of intellect and character would have been too much the charming rose cheny but to the purity and lovely tenderness of clarissa she does full justice in the other characters she was the true french girl full of grace and mixture of naïveté and cunning sentiment and frivolity that is winning and piquant if not satisfying only grief seems very strange to those bright eyes we not ﬁnd that they can weep much and bear the light of day and the inhaling of charcoal seems near at hand to their brightest pleasures at the other little theatres you see excellent acting and sparkle of wit unknown to the world out of france the little pieces in which all the leading topics of the day are reviewed are full of drolleries that make you laugh at each instant poudr is the only one of these i have seen in this among other jokes dumas in the character of and in costume half oriental half juggler is made to pass the other theatres in review while seeking candidates his new one dumas appeared in court yesterday and defended his own cause against the editors who sue him evading some of his engagements i was very desirous to hear him speak and went there in what i was assured would be very good season but french audience who knew the ground better had slipped in before and i returned has been too often the case with in paris having seen nothing but endless staircases dreary vestibules and gens the hospitality of le grande nation to the stranger is in many respects admirable galleries libraries cabinets of coins museums are opened in the most liberal manner to the stranger warmed lighted ay and guarded him almost all days in the week treasures of the past are at his service but when anything is happening in the present the french run quicker glide in more adroitly and get possession of the ground i ﬁnd it not the most easy matter to get to places even where there is nothing going on there is so much tiresome fuss of getting billets from one and another to be gone through but when something is happening it is still worse i missed hearing guizot in his speech on the montpensier marriage which would have given very good idea of his manner and which like this defence of dumas was skilful piece of work regards evasion of the truth the good feeling toward england which had been fostered with so much care and toil seems to have been entirely dissipated by the mutual recriminations about this marriage and the old dislike ﬂames up more ﬁercely having been hid awhile beneath the ashes i saw the little duchess the innocent or ignorant cause of all this disturbance when presented at court she went round the circle on the arm of the queen though only fourteen she looks twenty but has something fresh enga ging and girlish about her i fancy it will soon be rubbed out under the drill of the royal household i attended not only at the presentation but at the ball given at the tuileries directly after these are ﬁne shows the suite of apartments is very handsome brilliantly lighted and the french ladies surpass all others in the art of dress indeed it gave much pleasure to see them certainly there are many ugly ones but they are so well dressed and have such an air of graceful vivacity that the general effect was that of ﬂower often happens several american women were among the most distinguished positive beauty one from philadelphia who is by many persons considered the prettiest ornament of the dress circle at the italian opera was especially marked by the attention of the king however these ladies even if here long time not attain the air and manner of pg 191 pg 192 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https women the magnetic atmosphere that envelops them is less brilliant and exhilarating in its attractions it was pleasant to my eye which has always been so wearied in our country by the sombre masses of men that overcloud our public assemblies to see them now in so great variety of costume color and decoration among the crowd wandered leverrier in the costume of academician looking if he had lost not found his planet french savants are more generally men of the world and even men of fashion than those of other climates but in his case he seemed not to ﬁnd it easy to exchange the music of the spheres the music of ﬁddles speaking of leverrier leads to another of my disappointments i went to the sorbonne to hear him lecture nothing dreaming that the old pedantic and theological character of those halls was strictly kept up in these days of light an old guardian of the inner temple seeing approach had his speech all ready and manning the entrance said with disdainful air before we had time to utter word monsieur may enter if he pleases but madame must remain here in the after some exclamations of surprise i found an alternative in the hotel clugny where i passed an hour very delightfully while waiting my companion the rich remains of other centuries are there so arranged that they can be seen to the best advantage many of the works in ivory china and carved wood are truly splendid or exquisite i saw dagger with jewelled hilt which talked whole poems to my mind in the various adorations of the magi i found constantly one of the wise men black and with the marked african lineaments before i had half ﬁnished my companion came and wished at least to visit the of the sorbonne now that the talk too good female ears was over but the guardian again interfered to deny entrance you can go madame said he to the college of france you can go to this and place but you can not enter here what sir said i is it your institution alone that remains in state of barbarism voulez vous madame he replied and he spoke his little dog began to bark at q ue voulez vous madame la regle what would you have madam it is the rule reply which makes laugh even now i think how the satirical wits of former days might have used it against the bulwarks of learned dulness i was more fortunate in hearing arago and he justiﬁed all my expectations clear rapid full and equal his discourse is worthy its celebrity and i felt repaid the four hours one is obliged to spend in going in waiting and in hearing the lecture begins at half past one and you must be there before twelve to get seat so constant and animated is his popularity i have attended with some interest two discussions at the athenée on suicide the other on the crusades they are amateur affairs where always at such times one hears much nonsense and vanity much making of phrases and sentimental grimace but there was one excellent speaker adroit and rapid only frenchman could be with admirable readiness skill and rhetorical polish he examined the arguments of all the others and built upon their failures triumph himself his management of the language too was masterly and french is the best of languages such purpose clear ﬂexible full of sparkling points and quick picturesque turns with subtile blandness that makes the dart tickle while it wounds truly he pleased the fancy ﬁlled the ear and carried us pleasantly along over the smooth swift waters but then came from the crowd gentleman not one of the appo inted orators of the evening but who had really something in his heart to say grave dark man with spanish eyes and the simple dignity of honor and earnestness in all his gesture and manner he said in few and unadorned words his say and the sense of real presence ﬁlled the room and those charms of rhetoric faded vanish the beauties of from the eyes of astonished childhood pg 193 pg 194 at home and

looked down from one of the tribunes upon the ﬂower of the celebrities of france that is to say of the celebrities which are authentic comme il faut among them were many marked faces many ﬁne heads but in reading the works of poets we always fancy them about the age of apollo himself and i found with pain some of my favorites quite old and very unlike the company on parnassus represented by raphael some however were venerable even noble to behold indeed the literary dynasty of france is growing old and here in england and germany there seems likely to occur serious gap before the inauguration of another if indeed another is coming however it was an imposing sight there are men of real distinction now in the academy and molière would have fair chance if he were proposed among the audience i saw many ladies of ﬁne expression and manner well one or two precieuses ridicules race which is never quite extinct rémusat is the custom on these occasions painted the portrait of his predecessor the discourse was brilliant and discriminating in the details but the orator seemed to to neglect drawing some obvious infer ences which would have given better point of view his subject séance to much more impressive ﬁnd interesting was one which borrowed nothing from dress decorations or the presence of titled pomp i went to call on la mennais to whom i had letter i found him in little study his secretary was writing in larger room through which i passed with him was somewhat but vivacious elderly man whom i was at ﬁrst sorry to see having wished half an hour undisturbed visit to the apostle of democracy but how quickly were those feelings displaced by joy when he named to the great national lyrist of france the unequalled béranger i had not expected to see him at all he is not one to be seen in any show place he lives in the hearts of the people and needs homage from their eyes i was very happy in that little study in presence of these two men whose inﬂuence has been so great so real to béranger has been much his wit his pathos his exquisite lyric grace have made the most delicate strings vibrate and i can feel well see what he is in his nation and his place i have not personally received anything from la mennais born under other circumstances mental facts which he once the pupil of rome has learned by passing through severe ordeals are at the basis of all my thoughts but i see well what he has been and is to europe and of what great force of nature and spirit he seems suf fering and pale but in his eyes is the light of the future these are men who need ﬂourish of trumpets to announce their coming band of martial music upon their steps obsequious nobles in their train they are the true kings the theocratic kings the judges in israel the hearts

place by itself and an ample ﬁeld in which to expat iate the american ﬁrst introduced to some good pictures by the truly great geniuses of the religious period in art must if capable at all of mental approximation to the life therein embodied be too deeply affected too full of thoughts to be in haste to say anything and i bide my time such great crisis however is to be apprehended from acquaintance with the productions of the modern french school they are indeed full of talent and of vigor but also melodramatic and exaggerated to degree that seems to give the nightmare passage through the fresh and cheerful day they sound depth of soul and are marked with the signet of degenerate age thus speak i generally to the pictures of horace vernet one can not but turn gracious eye they are so faithful transcript of the life which circulates around us in the present state of things and we are willing to see his nobles and generals mounted on such excellent horses la roche gives pleasure there is in his pictures simple and natural poesy he is man who has in his own heart well of good water whence he draws himself when the streams are mixed with strange soil and bear offensive marks of the bloody battles of life the pictures of leopold robert i ﬁnd charming they are full of vigor and nobleness they express nature where all is rich young and on large scale those that i have seen are so happily expressive of the thoughts and perceptions of early manhood i can hardly regret he did not live to enter on another stage of life the impression now received is so single the effort of the french school in art also its main tendency in literature seems to be to turn the mind inside out in the coarsest acceptation of such phrase art can only be truly art by presenting an adequate outward symbol of some fact in the interior life but then it is symbol that art seeks to present and not the fact itself these french painter s seem to have idea of this they have not studied the method of nature with the true artist with nature herself the more full the representation the more profound and enchanting is the sense of mystery we look and look on ﬂower of which we can not scrutinize the secret life yet b looking seem constantly drawn nearer to the soul that causes and governs that life but in the french pictures suffering is represented by streams of blood by the most ghastly contortions i saw movement in the opposite direction in england it was in turner pictures of the later period it is well known that turner so long an idol of the english public paints now in manner which has caused the liveliest dissensions in the world of connoisseurs there are two parties one of which maintains not only that the pictures of the late period are not good but that they are not pictures at all it is impossible to make out the design or ﬁnd what turner is aiming at by those strange blotches of color the other party declare that these pictures are not only good but divine whoever looks upon them in the true manner will not fail to ﬁnd there somewhat ineffably and transcendently admirable soul of art books have been written to defend this side of the question i had become much interested about this matter the fervor of feeling on either side seemed to denote that there was something real and vital going on and while time would not permit my visiting other private collections in london and its neighborhood i insisted on taking it one of turner pictures it was at the house of one of his devoutest disciples who has arranged everything in the rooms to harmonize with them pg 198 pg 199 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https were great many of the earlier period these seemed to charming but superﬁcial views of nature they were of character that he who runs may read obvious simple graceful the later pictures were quite different matter looking things of pictur rather than picture itself sometimes you saw range of red dots which after long looking dawned on you the roofs of houses shining streaks turned out to be most alluring rivulets if traced with patience and devout eye above all they charmed the eye and the thought still these pictures it seems to can not be considered ﬁne works of art more than the mystical writing common to certain class of minds in the united states can be called good writing great work of art demands great thought or thought of beauty adequately expressed neither in art nor literature more than in life can an ordinary thought be made interesting because well dressed but in transition state whether of art or literature deeper thoughts are imperfectly expressed because they can not yet be held and treated masterly this seems to be the case with turner he has got beyond the english gentleman conventional view of nature which implies little sentiment and very cultivated taste he has become awake to what is elemental normal in nature instance one sees in the working of water on the he tries to represent these primiti ve forms in the drawings of piranesi in the pictu res of rembrandt one sees this grand language exhibited more truly it is not picture but certain primitive and leading effects of light and shadow or lines and contours that captivate the attention i saw picture of rembrandt at the louvre whose subject i not know and have never cared to inquire i can not analyze the group but i understand and feel the thought it embodies at something similar turner seems aiming an aim so opposed to the practical and outward tendency of the english mind that matter of course the majority ﬁnd themselves mystiﬁed and thereby angered but the same reason answering to so deep and seldom satisﬁed want in the minds of the minority to secure the most ardent sympathy where any at all can be elicited upon this topic of the primitive forms and operations of nature i am reminded of something interesting i was looking at yesterday these are botanical models in wax with microscopic dissections by an artist from florence pupil of calamajo the director of the museum there i saw collections of ten different genera embrac ing from ﬁfty to sixty species of fungi mosses and lichens detected and displayed in all the beautiful secrets of their lives many of them observed by leveillé of paris the artist told that ﬁsherman introduced to such acquaintance with the marvels of love and beauty which we trample under foot or burn in the chimney each careless day exclaimed is the good god who protects us on the sea that made all these and similar recognition correspondent feeling will not be easily evaded by the most callous observer this artist has supplied many of these models to the magniﬁcent collection of the jardin des plantes to edinbur gh and to bologna and would furnish them to our museums at much cheaper rate than they can elsewhere be obtained i wish the universities of cambridge new york and other leading institutions of our country might avail themselves of the opportunity in paris i have not been very fortunate in hearing the best music at the different houses the orchestra is always good but the vocalization though far superior to what i have heard at home falls so far short of my ideas and hopes to the italian have not been often the opera comique i visited only once it was tolerably well and more and myself i ﬁnd the tolerable intolerable in music at the grand opera i heard robert le diable and guillaume tell almost with ennui the decorations and dresses are magniﬁcent the instrumental performance good but not one ﬁne singer to ﬁll these ﬁne parts duprez has had great reputation and probably has sung better in former days still he has vulgar mind and can never have had any merit an artist at present i ﬁnd him unbearable he forces his voice sings in the most coarse showy style and aims at producing effects without regard to the harmony of his part fat and vulgar he still takes the part of the lover

nothing lablache is excellent intonation manner of song action ronconi i found good in the doctor of the higher parts grisi though now much too large some of her parts and without particle of poetic grace or dignity has certainly beauty of feature and from nature ﬁne voice but i ﬁnd her conception of her parts equally coarse and shallow her love is the love of peasant her anger though having the italian pictures richness and vigor is the anger of an italian ﬁshwife entirely unlike anything in the same rank elsewhere her despair is that of person with the toothache or who has drawn blank in the lottery the ﬁrst time i saw her was in norma then the beauty of her outline which becomes really enchanting she recalls the ﬁrst emotions of love the force and gush of her song ﬁlled my ear and charmed the senses so that i was pleased and did not perceive her great defects but with each time of seeing her i liked her less and now i not like her at all persiani is more generally favorite here she is indeed skilful both an actress and in the management of her voice but i ﬁnd her expression meretricious her singing mechanical neither of these women is equal to pico in natural force if she had but the same advantages of culture and environment in hearing semiramide here i ﬁrst learned to appreciate the degree of talent with which it was cast in new york grisi indeed is far better semiramis than borghese but the best parts of the opera lost all their charm from the inferiority of brambilla who took pico place mario has charming voice grace and tenderness he ﬁlls very well the part of the young chivalric lover but he has range of power coletti is very good singer he has not from nature ﬁne voice or personal beauty but he has talent good taste and often surpasses the expectation he has inspired gardini the new singer i have only heard once and that was in shepherd part he showed delicacy tenderness and tact in ﬁne among all these male singers there is much to please but little to charm and the women they never fail absolutely to ﬁll their parts but ray of the muse has fallen on them don giovanni conferred on beneﬁt of which certainly its great author never

with the toothache i resolved to get rid of the cause of sorrow by the aid of ether not sorry either to try its efﬁcacy after all the marvellous stories i had heard the ﬁrst time i inhaled it i did not several seconds feel the effect and was just thinking alas this has not power to soothe nerves so irritable mine when suddenly i wandered off i know where but it was sensation like wandering in long and through many alleys of trees impressions but all pleasant and serene the moment the tube was removed i started into consciousness and put my hand to my cheek but sad the throbbing tooth was still there the dentist said i had not seemed to him insensible he then gave the ether in stronger dose and this time i quitted the body instantly and can not remember any detail of what i saw and did but the impression was in the oriental tale where the man has his head in the water an instant only but in his vision thousand years seem to have passed i experienced that same sense of an immense length of time and succession of impressions even now the moment my mind was in that state seems to far longer period in time than my life on earth does i look back upon it suddenly i seemed to see the old dentist i had the moment before i inhaled the gas amid his plants in his nightcap and in the twilight the ﬁgure had somewhat of magical air and he seemed to say again i started up fancying that once more he had not dared to extract the tooth but it was gone what is worth noticing is the mental translation i made of his words which my ear must have caught my companion tells he said le moment phrase of just many syllables but conveying just the opposite sense ah i how i wished then that you had settled there in the united states who really brought this means of evading portion of

of suffering and escape the effort of screwing up your courage one of these moments but not the jar to the whole system i found the effect of having taken the ether bad i seemed to taste it all the time and neuralgic pain continued this lasted three days the evening of the third i had taken ticket to don giovanni and could not bear to give up this opera which i had always been longing to hear still i was in much suffering and it was the sixth day i had been so much weakened however i went expecting to be obliged to come out but the music soothed the nerves at once i hardly suffered at all

great causes thought and anxiety how childish has seemed the endless gossip of the parisian press on the subject of the spanish marriage melancholy the ﬂimsy falsehoods of guizot melancholy the avowal so naïvely made amid those falsehoods that to his mind expediency is the best policy this is the policy said he that has made france so prosperous indeed the success is correspondent with the means though in quite another sense than that he meant i went to the hotel des invalides supposing i should be admitted to the spot where repose the ashes of napoleon though i love not pilgrimages to sepulchres and prefer paying my homage to the living spirit rather than to the dust it once animated i should have liked to muse moment beside his urn but yet the visitor is not admitted there in the library however one sees the picture of napoleon crossing the alps opposite to that of the present king of the french just they are these should serve frontispieces to two chapters of history in the ﬁrst the seed was sown in ﬁeld of blood indeed yet was it the seed of all that is vital in the present period by napoleon the career was really laid open to talent and all that is really great in france now consists in the possibility that talent ﬁnds of struggling to the light paris is great intellectual centre and there is chamber of deputies to represent the people very different from the poor limited assembly politically so called their tribune is that of literature and one needs not to beg tickets to mingle with the audience to the actually chamber of deputies i was indebted two pleasures first and greatest sight of the manuscripts of rousseau treasured in their library i saw them and touched them manuscripts just he has celebrated them written on the ﬁne white paper tied with ribbon yellow and faded age has made them yet at their touch i seemed to feel the ﬁre of youth immo rtally glowing more and more expansive with which his soul has pervaded this century he was the precursor of all we most prize true his blood was mixed with madness and the course of his actual life made some detours through villanous places but his spirit was intimate with the fundamental truths of human nature and fraught with prophecy there is none who has given birth to more life this age his gifts are yet untold they are too present with us but he who thinks really must often think with rousseau and learn of him even more and more such is the method of genius to ripen fruit the crowd of those rays of whose heat they complain pg 206 pg 207 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https second pleasure was in the speech of berryer when the chamber was discussing the address to the king those of thiers and guizot had been so far more interesting they stood more that was important but berryer is the most eloquent speaker of the house his oratory is indeed very good not logical but plausible full and rapid with occasional bursts of ﬂame and showers of sparks though indeed stone of size and weight enough to crush any man was thrown out of the crater although the oratory of our country is very inferior to what might be expected from the perfect freedom and powerful motive development of genius in this province it presents several examples of persons superior in both force and scope and equal in polish to berryer nothing can be more pitiful than the manner in which the infamous affair of cracow is treated on all hands there is not even the affectation of noble feeling about it la mennais and his coadjutors published in la reforme an honorable and manly protest which the public rushed to devour the moment it was out of the press wonder it was the only crumb of comfort offered to those who have the nobleness to hope that the confederation of nations may yet be conducted on the basis of divine justice and human right most men who touched the subject apparently weary of feigning appeared in their genuine colors of the calmest most complacent selﬁshness described by körner in the prayer of such man god save my wife child and hearth then my harvest also then will i bless thee though thy lightning scorch to blackness all the rest of human kind sentiment which ﬁnds its paraphrase in the following vulgate of our land lord save my wife child and brother sammy us four and mor the latter clause indeed is not quite frankly avowed yet by politicians it is very amusing to be in the chamber of deputies when some dull person is speaking the french have truly greek vivacity they can not endure to be bored though their conduct is not very digniﬁed i should like corps of the same kind of in our legislative assemblies when honorable gentlemen are addressing their constituents and not the assembly repeating in lengthy windy clumsy paragraphs what has been the truism of the newspaper press months previous wickedly wasting the time that was given us to learn something ourselves and help our in the french chamber if man who has nothing to say ascends the tribune the is ﬁlled with the noise of myriad beehives the president rises on his feet and passes the whole time of the speech in taking the most violent exercise stretching himself to look imposing ringing his bell every two minutes shouting to the representatives of the nation to be decorous and attentive in vain the more he rings the more they wo be still i saw an orator in this situation ﬁghting against the desires of the audience only frenchman could man of any other nation would have died of embarrassment rather out his sentences stretching out both arms with an air of injured dignity panting growing red in the face but the hubbub of voices never stopped an instant at last he pretended to be exhausted stopped and took out his box instantly there was calm he seized the occasion and shouted out sentence but it was the only one he was able to make heard they were not to be trapped so second time when any one is speaking that commands interest berryer did the effect of this vivacity is very pleasing the murmur of feeling that rushes over the assembly is so quick and electric too the ripple on the lake i heard guizot speak one day short time his manner is very deﬁcient in dignity not even the dignity of station pg 208 pg 209 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https see the man of cultivated intellect but without inward strength nor is even his panoply of proof i saw in the library of the deputies some books intended to be sent to our country through vattemare the french have shown great readiness and genero sity with regard to his project and i earnestly hope that our country if it accept these tokens of will show both energy and judgment in making return i not speak from myself alone but from others whose opinion is entitled to the highest respect when i say it is not by sending great quantity of documents of merely local interest that would be esteemed lumber in our garrets at home that you pay respect to nation able to look beyond the binding of book if anythi ng is to be sent let persons of ability be deputed to make selection honorable to us and of value to the french they would like documents from our congress is important to commerce and manufactures they would also like much what can throw light on the history and character of our aborigines this project of international exchange could not be carried on to any permanent advantage without accredited agents on either side but in its presen t shape it wears an aspect of good feeling that is valuable and may give very desirable impulse to thought and knowledge vattemare has given himself to the plan with indefatigable perseverance and i hope our country will not be backward to accord him that furtherance he has known how to conquer from his countrymen to his complaisance i was indebted opportunity of leisurely survey of the imprimeri royale which gave several suggestions i shall impart at more favorable time and of the operations of the mint also it was at his request that the librarian of the chamber showed the manuscripts of roussea u which are not always seen by the traveller he also introduced to one of the evening schools of the frères chretiens where i saw with pleasure how much can be done the working classes only by evening lessons in reading and writing adults had made surprising progress and still more so in drawing i saw with the highest pleasure excellent copies of good models made by porters and with their brass badges on their breasts the beneﬁts of such an accomplishment are in my eyes of the highest value giving them by insensible degrees their part in the glories of art and science and in the tranquil reﬁnements of home visions rose in my mind of all that might be done in our country by associations of men and women who have received the beneﬁts of literary culture giving such evening lessons throughout our cities and village should i ever return i shall propose to some of the an association such purpose and try the experiment of one of these schools of christian brothers with the vow of disinterestedness but without the robe and the subdued priestly manner which even in these men some of whom seemed to truly good i could not away with i visited also protestant institution called that of the deaconesses which pleased in some respects beside the regular crèche they take the sick children of the poor and nurse them till they are well they have also refuge like that of the home which the ladies of new york have provided through which members of the most unjustly treated class of society may return to peace and usefulness there are institutions of the kind in paris but too formal the treatment shows ignorance of human nature i see nothing that shows so enlightened spirit the home little germ of good which i hope ﬂourishes and ﬁnds active aid in the community i have collected many facts with regard to this suffering class of women both in england and in france i have seen them under the thin veil of gayety and in the horrible tatters of utter degradation i have seen the feelings of men with regard to their condition and the general heartlessness in women of more favored and protected lives which i can only ascribe to utter ignorance of the facts if proclamation of some of these can remove it i hope to make such one in the hour of riper judgment and after more extensive survey sad are many features of the time we have at least the satisfaction of feeling that if something true can be revealed if something wise and kind shall be perseveringly tried it stands chance of nearer success than ever before much light has been let in at the pg 210 pg 211 at home and

school idiots near paris so called long time by the impatience of the crowd yet there are really none such but only beings so below the average standard so partially organized that it is difﬁcult them to learn or to sustain themselves i wept the whole time i was in this place shower of sweet and bitter tears of joy at what had been done of grief all that i and others possess and can not impart to these little ones but patience and the father of all will give them all yet good angel these of paris have in their master i have seen man that seemed to more worthy of envy if one could envy happiness so pure and tender he is man of seven or eight and twenty who formerly came there only to give lessons in writing but became so interested in his charge that he came at last to live among them and to serve them they sing the hymns he writes them and i saw his ﬁne countenance looking in love on those distorted and opaque vases of humanity where he had succeeded in waking up faint ﬂame i thought his heart could never fail to be well warmed and buoyant they sang well both in parts and in chorus went through gymnastic exercises with order and pleasure then stood in circle and kept time while severa l danced extremely well one little fellow with whom the difﬁculty seemed to be that an excess of nervous sensibility paralyzed instead of exciting the powers recited poems with touching childish grace and perfect memory they write well draw well make shoes and carpenter work one of the cases most interesting to the metaphysician is that of boy brought there about two years and half ago at the age of thirteen in state of brutality and of ferocious brutality i read the physician report of him at that period he discovered ray of decency or reason entirely beneath the animals in the exercise of the senses he discovered restless fury beyond that of beasts of prey breaking and throwing down whatever came in his way was voracious glutton and every way grossly sensual many trials and vast patience were necessary before an inlet could be obtained to his mind then it was through the means of mathematics he delights in the ﬁgures can draw and name them all detects them by the touch when blindfolded each mental effort of the kind he still follows up with an imbecile chuckle indeed his face and whole manner are still that of an idiot but he has been raised from his sensual state and can now discriminate and name colors and perfumes which before were all alike to him he is partially redeemed earlier doubt far more might have been done him but the degree of success is an earnest which must encourage to perseverance in the most seemingly hopeless cases i thought sorrowfully of the persons of this class whom i have known in our country who might have been so raised and solaced by similar care i hope ample provision may erelong be made these pariahs of the human race every case of the kind brings its blessings with it and observation on these subjects would be rich

them both mysterious whispers and the resolute pleadings from the better world which calls us not to slumber here but press daily onward to claim our heritage paris i was sad to leave thee thou wonderful focus where ignorance ceases to be pain because there we ﬁnd such means daily to lessen it it is the only school where i ever found abundance of teachers who could bear being examined by the pupil in their special branches i must go to this school more before i again cross the atlantic where often years i have carried about some triﬂing question without ﬁnding the person who could answer it really deep questions we must all answer ourselves the more the pity then that we get not quickly through with crowd of details where the expe rience of others might accelerate our progress leaving by diligence we pursued our way from twelve on thursday till twelve at night on friday thus having large share of magniﬁcent moonlight upon the unknown ﬁelds we were traversing at chalons we took boat and reached lyons betimes that afternoon so soon refreshed we sallied out to visit some of the garrets of the weavers we were making inquiries about these sweet little girl who heard us offered to be our guide she led us by weary winding way whose pavement was much easier her feet in their wooden sabots than ours in paris shoes to the top of hill from which we saw the ﬁrst time the blue and arrowy rhone entering the light buildings on this high hill i found each chamber tenanted by family of weavers weavers wife husband sons daughters nine years old upward was helping on one side were the looms nearer the door the cooking apparatus the beds were shelves near the ceiling they climbed up to them on ladders my sweet little girl turned out to be wife of six or seven years standing with two rather children she seemed to have the greatest comfort that is possible amid the perplexities of hard and anxious lot to judge by the proud and affectionate manner in which she always said mon mari and by the courteous gentleness of his manner toward her she seemed indeed to be one of those persons on whom the graces have smiled in their cradle and to whom natural loveliness of character makes the world easy it can be made while the evil spirit is still so busy choking the wheat with tares i admired her graceful manner of introducing us into those dark little rooms and she was affectionately received by all her acquaintance but alas that voice by nature of such vivacity repea ted again and again ah we are all very unhappy now you sing together or go to evening schools we have not the heart when we have piece of work we not stir till it is ﬁnished and then we run to try and get another but often we have to wait idle weeks it grows worse and worse and they say it is not likely to be any better we can think of nothing but whether we shall be able to pay our rent ah the workpeople are very unhappy now this poor lovely little girl at an age when the merchant daughters of boston and new york are just gaining their ﬁrst experiences of society knew to farthing the price of every article of food and clothing that is wanted by such household her thought by day and her dream by night was whether she should long be able to procure scanty supply of these and nature had gifted her with precis ely those qualities which unembarrassed by care would have made her and all she loved really pg 214 pg 215 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https and she was fortunate now compared with many of her sex in lyons of whom gentleman who knows the class well said when their work fails they have resource except in the sale of their persons there are but these two ways open to them weaving or prostitution to gain their

visionaries and fanatics to themselves be woe who have eyes and see not ears and hear not the convulsions and sobs of injured humanity my little friend told she had nursed both her children almost all of her class are obliged to put their children out to nurse but said she they are brought back so little so miserable that i resolved if possible to keep mine with next day in the steamboat i read pamphlet by physician of lyons in which he recommends the establishment of crèches not merely like those of paris to keep the children by day but to provide them thus by the infants receiving nourishment from more healthy persons and who under the supervision of directors would treat them well he hopes to counteract the tendency to degenerate in this race of sedentary workers and to save the mothers from too heavy burden of care and labor without breaking the bond between them and their children whom under such circumstances they could visit often and see them taken care of they brought up to know nothing except how to weave can not take care of them here again how is one reminded of fourier observations and plans still more enforced by the recent developments at manchester to the habit of feeding children on opium which has grown out of the position of things there descending next day to avignon i had the mortiﬁcation of ﬁnding the banks of the rhone still sheeted with white and there waded through melting snow to laura tomb we did not see dickens tower and goblin was too late in the day we saw snowball ﬁght between two bands of the military in the castle yard that was gay enough to make goblin laugh and next day on to arles still snow and cutting blasts in the south of france where everybody had promised us and blossoms to console us the dreary winter of paris at arles indeed i saw the little saxifrage blossoming on the steps of the amphitheatre and in ﬂower amid the tombs here the ﬁrst time i saw the great handwriting of the romans in its proper medium of stone and i was content it looked us grand and solid i expected if life in those days was thought worth the having the enjoying and the using the sunlight was warm this day it lay deliciously still and calm upon the ruins one old woman sat knitting where thousand persons once gazed down in ﬁerce excitement on the ﬁghts of men and lions coming back we were refreshed all through the streets by the sight of the women of arles they answered to their reputation beauty tall erect and noble with high and digniﬁed features and full earnest gaze of the eye they looked if the eagle still waved its wings over their city even the very old women still have degree of beauty because when the colors are all faded and the skin wrinkled the face retains this dignity of outline the men not share in these characteristics some priestess well beloved of the powers of old religion must have called down an especial blessing on her sex in this town hence to marseilles is little the traveller to see except the mixture of oriental blood in the crowd of the streets thence by steamer to genoa of this transit he who has been on the mediterranean in stiff breeze well understands i can have nothing to say except i suffered it was all one dull tormented dream to and i believe to most of the ship company dream too of thirty hours duration instead of the promised sixteen the excessive beauty of genoa is well known and the impression upon the eye alone was correspondent with what i expected but alas the weather was still so cold i could not realize that i had actually touched those shores to which i had looked forward all my life where it seemed that the heart would expand and the whole nature be turned to delight seen by cutting wind the marble palaces the gardens the magniﬁcent water pg 216 pg 217 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https of genoa failed to charm i saw not felt how beautiful they were only at naples have i found my italy and here not till after week waiting till i began to believe that all i had heard in praise of the climate of italy was fable and that there is really spring anywhere except in the imagination of poets the ﬁrst week was an exact copy of the miseries of new england spring bright sun came an hour or two in the morning just to coax you forth without your cloak and then came up villanous horrible wind exactly like the worst east wind of boston breaking the heart racking the brain and turning hope and fancy to an irrevocable green and yellow hue in lieu of their native rose however here at naples i have at last found my italy i have passed through the grotto of pausilippo visited cuma baiæ and capri ascended vesuvius and found all familiar except the sense of enchantment of sweet exhilaration this scene conveys behold how brightly breaks the morning and yet all new if never yet described nature here most proliﬁc and exuberant in her gifts has touched them all with charm unhackneyed unhackneyable which the boots of english dandies can not trample out nor the raptures of sentimental tourists daub or fade baiæ had still hid divinity vesuvius fresh baptism of ﬁre and sorrento was beyond picture beyond poesy the greatest artist had been at work there in temper beyond the reach of human art beyond this reader my old friend and valued acquaintance on other themes i shall tell you nothing of naples it is thing apart in the journey of life and if repre sented at all should be so in fairer form than offers itself at present now the actual life here is over i am going to rome and expect to see that fane of thought the last day of this week at genoa and leghorn i saw the ﬁrst time italians in their homes very attractive i found them charming women reﬁned men eloquent and courteous if the cold wind hid italy it could not the italians little group of faces each so full of character dignity and what is so rare in an american face the capacity pure exalting passion will live ever in my memory fulﬁlment of hope we started from leghorn in an english boat highly recommended and little deserving of such praise many another bepuf fed article in the middle of ﬁne clear night she was run into by the mail steamer which all on deck clearly saw coming upon her reason that could be ascertained except that the man at the wheel said he had turned the right way and it never seemed to occur to him that he could change when he found the other steamer had taken the same direction to be sure the other steamer was equally careless but change on our part would have prevented an accident that narrowly missed sending us all to the bottom it hardly seemed worth while to persist the sake of convicting them of error neither the captain nor any of his people spoke french and we had been much amused before by the chambermaid acting out the old story of will you lend the loan of gridiron polish lady was on board with french who understood word of english the daughter of john bull would speak to the lady in english and when she found it of use would say imperiously to the suivante go and ask your mistress what she will have breakfast and now when i went on deck there was parley between the two steamers which the captain was obliged to manage by such interpreters he could ﬁnd it was long and confused business it ended at last in the neapolitan steamer taking us in tow an inglorious return to leghorn when she had decided upon this she swept round her lights glancing like sagacious eyes to take us the sea was calm lake the sky full of stars she made long detour with her black hull her smoke and lights which look so pretty at night then came round to us like the bend of an arm embracing it was pretty picture worth the stop and the fright the loss of hours though i did not think so at the time pg 218 pg 219 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https leghorn we changed the boat and retracing our steps came now at last to naples to this misgoverned full of dirty degraded men and women yet still most lovely naples which the most i can say is that the divine aspect of nature can make you forget the situation of man in this region which was surely intended him princely child angelic in virtue genius and beauty and not begging haunted image kissing lazzarone letter xiv italy of the sculptor aristocracy olff diana and the painter painters in of the and escos of ix and his measur dinner at the baths of jealousy contemporaneo rome may there is very little that i can like to write about italy italy is beautiful worthy to be loved and embraced not talked about yet i remember well that when afar i liked to read what was written about her now all thought of it is very tedious the traveller passing along the beaten track vetturinoed from inn to inn ciceroned from gallery to gallery thrown through indolence want of tact or ignorance of the language too much into the society of his compatriots sees the least possible of the country fortunately it is impossible to avoid seeing great deal the great features of the part pursue and ﬁll the eye yet i ﬁnd that it is quite out of the question to know italy to say anything of her that is full and sweet so to convey any idea of her spirit without long residence and residence in the districts untouched by the scorch and dust of foreign invasion the invasion of the dilettanti i mean and without an intimacy of feeling an abandonment to the spirit of the place impossible to most americans they retain too much of their english blood and the travelling english class seem to the most unseeing of all possible animals there are exceptions instance the perceptions and pictures of browning seem delicate and just here on the spot they did at distance but take them class they have the vulgar familiarity of trollope without her vivacity the cockneyism of dickens without his graphic power and love of the odd corners of human nature i admired the english at home in their island i admired their honor truth practical intelligence persistent power but they not look well in italy they are not the ﬁgures this landscape i am indignant at the contempt they have presumed to express the faults of our state what is the vulgarity expressed in our chewing and way of eating eggs compared to that which elbows the greek marbles in hand and sneers through the miserere of the sistin chapel beneath the very glance of michel angelo sibyls peter nice of managing the colosseum by moonlight snatches bits sketch from the sublime silence of the campagna yet i was again reconciled with them the other day in visiting the studio of macdonald there i found complete gallery of the aristocracy of england each lord and lady who visits rome considers it part of the ceremony to sit to him bust and what ﬁne race how worthy the marble what heads of orators statesmen gentlemen of women chaste grave resolute and tender unfortunately they not look well in ﬂesh and blood then they show the habitual coldness of their temperament the habitual subservience to frivolous conventionalities they need some great occasion some pg 220 pg 221 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https crisis in order to make them look free and digniﬁed these busts yet is the beauty there though imprisoned and clouded and such crisis would show us more then one boadicea more than one alfred tenerani has just completed statue which is of it is called the angel of the resurrection i was not so fortunate to ﬁnd it in his studio in that of wolff i saw diana ordered by the emperor of russia it is modern and sentimental different from the antique diana the trance of read young lady of our day from the thrill with which the ancient shepherds deprecated the magic pervasions of hecate but very beautiful and exquisitely wrought he has also lately ﬁnished the four seasons represented children of these winter is graceful and charming among the sculptors i delayed longest in the of gott i found his groups of young ﬁgures connected with animals very refreshing after the grander attemp ts of the present time they seem real growths of his habitual mind of nature full of joy and freedom his spaniels and other frisky poppets would please apollo far better than most of the marble nymphs and muses of the present day our crawford has just ﬁnished bust of crawford which is extremely beautiful full of grace and innocent sweetness all its accessaries are charming wreaths the arrangement of drapery the stuff of which the robe is made i hope it will be much seen on its arrival in new york he has also an herodias in the clay which is individual in expression and the ﬁgure of distinguished elegance i liked the designs of crawford better than those of gibson who is estimated highest in the profession now among the studios of the european painters i have visited only that of overbeck it is well known in the united states what his pictures are i have much to say at more favorable time of what they represented to he himself looks if he had just stepped out of one of them lay monk with pious eye and habitual morality of thought which limits every gesture painting is not largely represented here by american artists at present terry has two pleasing pictures on the easel

campagn such i saw it on my ﬁrst entrance into rome all light and calmness hicks charming length of an italian girl holding mandolin it will be sure to please his pictures are full of life and give the promise of some real achievement in art of the fragments of the great time i have now seen nearly all that are treasured up here i have however yet nothing of consequence to say of them i ﬁnd that others have often given good hints to how they look and to what they are it can only be known by approximating to the state of soul out of which they grew they should not be described but reproduced they are many and precious yet is there not so much of high excellence i had expected they will not ﬂoat the heart on boundless sea of feeling like the starry night on our western prairies yet i love much to see the galleries of marbles even when there are not many separately admirable amid the cypresses and ilexes of roman villas and picture that is good at all looks very good in one of these old palaces the italian painters whom i have learned most to appreciate since i came abroad are domenichino and titian of others one may learn something by copies and engravings but not of these the portraits of titian look upon from the walls things new and strange they are portraits of men such i have not known in his picture absurdly called sacred and profane love in the borghese palace one of the ﬁgures has developed my powers of gazing to an extent unknown before domenichino seems very unequal in his pictures but when he is grand and free the energy of his genius perfectly satisﬁes the frescos of caracci and his scholars in the farnese palace have been to source of the purest pleasure and i not remember to have heard of them i loved guercino much before i came here but i have looked too pg 222 pg 223 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https at his pictures and begin to grow sick of them he is very limited genius leonardo i can not yet like at all but i suppose the pictures are good some people to look at they show wonderful deal of study and thought that is not what i can best appreciate in work of art i hate to see the marks of them i want simple and direct expression of soul the rest the ordinary cant of connoisseur on these matters seems in italy even more detestable than elsewhere i have not yet so sufﬁciently recovered from my pain at ﬁnding the frescos of raphael in such state to be able to look at them happily i had heard of their cond ition but could not realize it however i have gained nothing by seeing his pictures in oil which are well preserved i ﬁnd i had before the full impression of his genius michel angelo frescos in like manner i seem to have seen far i can but it is not the same with the sculptures my thought had not risen to the height of the moses it is the only thing in europe so far which has entirely outgone my hopes michel angelo was my demigod before but i ﬁnd offering worthy to cast at the feet of his moses i like much too his christ it is refreshing contrast with all the other representations of the same subject i like it even contrasted with raphael christ of the transﬁguration or that of the cartoon of feed my lambs i have heard owls hoot in the colosseum by moonlight and they spoke more to the purpose than i ever heard any other voice upon that subject i have seen all the pomps and shows of holy week in the church of peter and found them less imposing than an habitual acquaintance with the place with processions of monks and nuns stealing in now and then or the swell of vespers from some side chapel i have ascended the dome and seen thence rome and its campagna its villas with their cypresses and pines serenely sad is nothing else in the world and the fountains of the vatican garden gushing hard by i have been in the subterranean to see poor little boy introduced much to his surprise to the bosom of the church and then i have seen by the stone popes where they lie on their tombs and the old mosaics and virgins with gilt caps it is all rich and full impressive in its way peter must be to each one separate poem the ceremonies of the church have been numerous and splendid during our stay here and they borrow unusual interest from the love and expectation inspired by the present pontif he is man of noble and good aspect who it is easy to see has set his heart upon doing something solid the beneﬁt of man but pensively too must one feel how hampered and inadequate are the mean s at his command to accomplish these ends the italians not feel it but deliver themselves with all the vivacity of their temperament to perpetual hurras vivas rockets and processions i often think how grave and sad must the pope feel he sits alone and hears all this noise of expectation week or two ago the cardinal secretary published circular inviting the departments to measures which would give the people sort of representative council nothing could seem more limited than this improvement but it was great measure rome at night the corso in which we live was illuminated and many thousands passed through it in procession i saw them ﬁrst assembled in the piazza del popolo forming around its fountain great circle of ﬁre then river of ﬁre they streamed slowly through the corso on their way to the quirinal to thank the pope upbearing banner on which the edict was printed the stream of ﬁre advanced slowly with perpetu al like sound of voices the torches ﬂashed on the animated italian faces i have never seen anything ﬁner ascending the quirinal they made it mount of light bengal ﬁres were thrown up which cast their red and white light on the noble greek ﬁgures of men and horses that reign over it the pope appeared on

an instant the same week came the natal day of rome great dinner was given at the baths of titus in the open air the company was on the grass in the area the music at one end pg 224 pg 225 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https ﬁlled with the handsome roman women occupied the other sides it was new thing here this popular dinner and the romans greeted it in an intoxication of hope and pleasure sterbini author of the vestal presided many others like him long time exiled and restored to their country by the present pope were at the tables the colosseum and triumphal arches were in sight an efﬁgy of the roman wolf with her royal nursling was erected on high the guests with shouts and music congratulated themselves on the possession in pius of new and nobler founder another state among the speeches that of the marquis man of literary note in italy and of manzoni contained this passage he was sketching the past history of italy the crown passed to the head of german monarch but he wore it not to the beneﬁt but the injury of christianity the world the emperor henry was tyrant who wearied out the patience of god god said to rome i give you the emperor henry and from these hills that surround us hildebrand pope gregory raised his austere and potent voice to say to the emperor did not give you italy that you might destroy her and italy germany europe saw her butcher prostrated at the feet of gregory in penitence italy germany europe had then kindled in the heart the ﬁrst spark of liberty the narrative of the dinner passed the censor and was published the ambassador of austria read it and found with modesty and candor truly admirable that this passage was meant to allude to his emperor he must take his passports if such home thrusts are to be made and so the paper was seized and the account of the dinner only told from mouth to mouth from those who had already read it also the idea of dinner the pope is abandoned lest something too frank should again be said and they tell here with laugh i fancy you have assisted at the ﬁrst and last popular dinner thus we may see that the liberty of rome does not yet advance with boots and the new romulus will need to be prepared deeds at least bold his predecessor if he is to open new order of things i can not well wind up my gossip on this subject better than by translating passage from the programme of the contemporaneo which represents the hope of rome at this moment it is conducted by men of talent the contemporaneo contemporary is journal of progress but tempered the good and wise think best in conformity with the will of our best of princes and the wants and expectations of the public through discussion it desires to prepare minds to receive reforms so soon and far they are favored by the law of opportunity every attempt which is made contrary to this social law must fail it is vain to hope fruits from tree out of season and equally in vain to introduce the best measures into country not prepared to receive them and so on i intended to have translated in full the programme but time fails and the law of opportunity does not favor my opportunity leaves london this afternoon i have given enough to mark the purport of the whole it will easily be seen that it was not from the platform assumed by the contemporaneo that lycurgus legislated or socrates taught the christian religion was propagated or the church was reformed by luther the opportunity that the martyrs found here in the colosseum from whose blood grew up this great tree of papacy was not of the kind waited by these moderate progressists nevertheless they may be good schoolmasters italy and are not to be disdained in these piping times of peace more

ofessors in its university tambr oni and milan and her female state of woman in italy and byr and its neighborhood and affairs milan august 9 since leaving rome i have not been able to steal moment from the rich and varied objects before to write about them i will therefore take brief retrospect of the ground i passed from florence to rome by the perugia route and saw the ﬁrst time the italian vineyards the grapes hung in little clusters when i return they will be full of light and life but the ﬁelds will not be so enchantingly fresh nor so enamelled with ﬂowers the profusion of red poppies which dance on every wall and glitter throughout the grass is great ornament to the landscape in full sunlight their vermilion is most beautiful well might ceres gather such poppies to mingle with her wheat we climbed the hill to assisi and my ears thrilled with many old remembered melodies when an old peasant in sonorous phrase bade look out and see the plain of umbria i looked back and saw the carriage toiling up the steep path drawn by pair of those oxen shelley so much admired i stood near the spot where goethe met with little adventure which he has described with even more than his usual delicate humor who can ever be alone moment in italy every stone has voice every grain of dust seems instinct with spirit from the past every step recalls some line some legend of lore assisi was exceedingly charming to so still temporal noise and bustle seem hushed down yet by the presence of the saint so clean rains of heaven wash down all impurities into the valley i must confess that elsewhere i have shared the feelings of dickens toward francis and sebastian the mounseer tonsons of catholic art sebastian i have not been so tired of the beauty and youth of the ﬁgure make the monotony with which the subject of his martyrdom is treated somewhat less wearisome but francis is so sad and so ecstatic and so brown so entirely the monk clara so entirely the nun i have been very sorry her that he was able to draw her from the human to the heavenly life she seems so sad and so worn out by the effort but here at assisi one can not help being penetrated by the spirit that ﬂowed from that life here is the room where his father shut up the boy to punish his early severity of devotion here is the picture which represents him despoiled of all outward things even his garments himself body and soul to the service of god in the way he believed most acceptable here is the under ground chapel where rest those weary bone s saluted by the tears of so many weary pilgrims who have come hither to seek strength from his example here are the churches above full of the works of earlier art animated by the contagion of great example it is impossible not to bow the head and feel how mighty an inﬂuence ﬂows from single soul sincere in its service of truth in whatever form that truth comes to it troop of neat pretty attended us about going with us into the little chapels adorned with pictures which open at every corner of the streets smiling on us at pg 229 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https distance some of them were fourteen or ﬁfteen years old i found reading writing and sewing were all they learned at their school the ﬁrst indeed they knew well enough if they could ever get books to use it on tranquil assisi was on every wall was read viva pio and we found the guides and workmen in the shop full of vague hope from him the old love which has made so rich this aerial cradle of francis glows warm ever in the breasts of men still ever they long and shout aloud at the least appearance of an object the church at the foot of the hill santa maria degli angeli seems tawdry after assisi it also is full of records of francis his pains and his triumphs here too on little chapel is the famous picture by overbeck too exact copy but how different in effect from the early art we had just seen above harmonious but frigid grave but dull childhood is beautiful but not when continued or rather transplanted into the period where we look passion varied means and manly force before reaching perugia i visited an etrurian tomb which is little way off the road it is said to be one of the ﬁnest in etruria the is full of them but excavations are expensive and not frequent the effect of this one was beyond my expectations in it were several female ﬁgures very digniﬁed and calm the dim fell on them by turns the expression of these ﬁgures shows that the position of woman in these states was noble their eagles nests cherished well the female eagle who kept watch in the eyrie perugia too is on noble hill what daily excitement such view taken at every step life is worth ten times much in city so situated perugia is full overﬂowing with the treasures of early art i saw them so rapidly it seems now if in trance yet certainly with proﬁt manifold gain such mahomet thought he gained from his ﬁve minutes visits to other spheres here are two portraits of raphael youth it is touching to see what ef fect this angel had upon all that surrounded him from the very ﬁrst florence i was there month and in sense saw florence that is to say i took an inventory of what is to be seen there and not without great intellectual proﬁt there is too much that is really admirable in art nature of its growth lies before you too clearly to be evaded of such things more elsewhere i not like florence i cities more purely italian the natural character is ironed out here and done up in french pattern yet there is french vivacity nor italian either the grand and more agitated by the position in which he ﬁnds himself between the inﬂuence of the pope and that of imploring and commanding his people to keep still and they are still and glum death this is all on the outside within tuscany burns private culture has not been in vain and there is in large circle mental preparation very different state of things from the present with an ardent desire to diffuse the same amid the people at large the sovereign has been obliged the present to give more liberty to the press and there is an immedia rush of thought to the new vent if it is kept open few months the effect on the body of the people can not fail to be great i intended to have translated some passages from the programme of the patria one of the papers newly started at florence but time fails one of the articles in the same number by lambruschini on the duties of the clergy at this juncture contains views liberal can be found in print anywhere in the world more of these things when i return to rome in the autumn when i hope to ﬁnd little leisure to think over what i have seen and if found worthy to put the result in writing i visited the studios of our sculptors greenough has in clay david which prom ises high beauty and nobleness full of grace and tender expression he is also modelling head of napoleon and justly enthusiastic in the study his great group i did not see in such state to be secure of my impression the face of the pioneer is very ﬁne the form of the woman graceful and expressive but i was not satisﬁed with the indian i shall see it more whole on my return to florence pg 230 pg 231 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https to the eve and the greek slave i could only join with the rest of the world in admiration of their beauty and the ﬁne feeling of nature which they exhibit the statue of calhoun is full of power simple and majestic in attitude and expression in busts powers seems to unrivalled still he ought not to spend his best years on an employment which can not satisfy his ambition nor develop his powers if our country loves herself she will order from him some great work before the prime of his genius has been frittered away and his best years spent on lesser things i saw at florence the festivals of john but they are poor affairs to one who has seen the neapolitan and roman people on such occasions passing from florence i came to bologna bologna indeed an italian city full of expression of physiognomy so to speak woman should love bologna there has the spark of intellect in woman been cherished with reverent care not in former ages only but in this bologna raised woman who was worthy to the dignities of its university and in their certosa they proudly show the monument to matilda tambroni late greek professor there her letters preserved by her friends are said to form very valuable collection in their anatomical hall is the bust of woman professor of anatomy in art they have had properzia di rossi elizabetta sirani lavinia fontana and delight to give their works conspicuous place in other cities the men alone have their casino dei nobili where they give balls conversazioni and similar entertainments here women have one and are the soul of society in milan also i see in the ambrosian library the bust of female mathematician these things make feel that if the state of woman in italy is so depressed yet toward better is not wholly wanting still more signiﬁcant is the reverence to the madonna and innumerable female saints who if like teresa they had intellect well piety became counsellors less than comforters to the spirit of men ravenna too i saw and its old christian art the pineta where byron loved to ride and the paltry apartments where cheered by new affection in which was more of tender friendship than of passion he found himself less wretched than at beautiful venice or stately genoa all the details of this visit to ravenna are pretty i shall write them out some time of padua too the little to be said should be said in detail of venice and its enchanted life i could not speak it should only be echoed back in music there only i began to feel in its fulness venetian art it can only be seen in its own atmosphere never had i the least idea of what is to be seen at venice it seems to if one ever yet had seen it entirely wanting is any expression of what i felt myself venice on this subject i shall not write much till time place and mode agree to make it ﬁt venice where all is past is ﬁt asylum the dynasties of the past the duchesse berri owns one of the ﬁnest palaces on the grand canal the duc bordeaux rents another mademoiselle taglioni has bought the famous casa and it is under repair thanks to the fashion which has made venice refuge of this kind the palaces rarely inhabited by the representatives of their ancient names are valuable property and the noble structures will not be suffered to lapse into the sea above which they rose so proudly the restorations too are made with excellent taste and judgment is spoiled three of these ﬁne palaces are now hotels so that the transient visitor can enjoy from their balconies all the wondrous shows of the venetian night and day much any of their former possessors did i was at the europa formerly the giustinia ni palace with better air than those on the grand canal and more unobstructed view than danieli pg 232 pg 233 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https berri gave an entertainment on the birthnight of her son and the old duchesse came from vienna to attend it was scene of the palace full of light so that from the canal could be seen even the pictures on the walls landing from the gondolas the elegan tly dressed ladies and gentlemen seem ed to rise from the water we also saw them glide up the great stair rustling their plumes and in the make and receive the customary grimaces ﬁne band stationed on the opposite side of the canal played the while and ﬂotilla of gondolas lingered there to listen i too amid the mob pleasant position in venice alone thought of the stuarts bourbons bonapartes here in italy and offered up prayer that other names when the possessors have power without the heart to use it the emancipation of

every legitimate desire of such minds gentle punishment the distributors of letters cachet and spielber g dungeons to their having passed more than fortnight at venice i have come here stopping at vicenza verona mantua lago di garda brescia certainly i have learned more than ever in any previous ten days of my existence and have formed an idea what is needed the study of art and its history in these regions to be sure i shall never have time to follow it up but it is delight to look up those glorious vistas even when there is hope of entering them violent shower obliged to stop on the way it was late at night and i was nearly asleep when roused by the sound of bubbling waters i started up and asked is that the adda and it was so deep is the impression made by simple natural recital like that of renzo wanderings in the promessi sposi that the memory of his hearing the adda in this way occurred to at once and the adda seemed familiar if i had been native of this region the scottish lakes seem the domain of walter scott so does milan and its neighborhood in the mind of foreigner belong to manzoni i have seen him since the gentle lord of this wide domain his hair is white but his eyes still beam when he ﬁrst saw the apparitions of truth simple tenderness and piety which he has so admirably recorded our beneﬁt those around lament that the fastidiousness of his taste prevents his completing and publishing more and that thus treasury of rare knowledge and reﬁned thought will pass from us without our reaping the beneﬁt we indeed have title to complain what we possess from his hand is so excellent at this moment there is great excitement in italy supposed spy of austria has been assassinated at ferrara and austrian troops are marched there it is pretend ed that conspiracy has been discovered in rome the consequent disturbances have been put down the national guard is forming all things seem to announce that some important change is inevitable here but

thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https october i think my last letter was from milan and written after i had seen manzoni this was to great pleasure i have now seen the most important representatives who survive of the last epoch in thought our age has still its demonstrations to make its heroes and poets to crown although the modern italian literature is not poor many persons at distance suppose but on the contrary surprisingly rich in tokens of talent if we consider the circumstances under which it struggles to exist yet very few writers have or deserve european or american reputation where whole country is so kept down her best minds can not take the lead in the progress of the age they have too much to suffer too much to explain but among the few who through depth of spiritual experience and the beauty of form in which it is expressed belong not only to italy but to the world manzoni takes high rank the passive virtues he teaches are longer what is wanted the manners he paints with so delicate ﬁdelity are beginning to change but the spirit of his works he tender piety the sensibility to the meaning of every humblest form of life the delicate humor and satire so free from disdain are immortal young italy rejects manzoni though not irreverently young italy prizes his works but feels that the doctrine of pray and wait is not her at this moment she needs more fervent hope more active faith she is right it is well known that the traveller if he knows the italian language written in books the standard tuscan still ﬁnds himsel f stranger in many parts of italy unable to comprehend the dialects with their lively abbreviations and witty slang that of venice i had understood somewhat and could enter into the drollery and naïveté of the gondoliers who class have an unusual share of character but the milanese i could not at ﬁrst understand at all their language seem ed to detestably harsh and their gestures unmeaning but after friend who possesses that large and ready sympathy easier found in italy than anywhere else had translated verbatim into french some of the poems written in the milanese and then read them aloud in the original i comprehended the peculiar inﬂection of voice and idiom in the people and was charmed with it one is with the instinctive wit and wisdom of children there is very little to see at milan compared with any other italian city and this was very fortunate allowing an interval of repose in the house which i can not take when there is so much without tempting to incessant observation and study i went through the north of italy with constantly increasing fervor of interest when i had thought of italy it was always of the south of the roman states of tuscany but now i became deeply interested in the histo ry the institutions the art of the north the fragments of the past mark the progress of its waves so clearly i learned to understand to prize them every day more to know how to make use of the books about them i shall have much to say on these subjects some day leaving milan i went on the lago maggiore and afterward into switzerland of this tour i shall not speak here it was beautiful little romance by itself and inﬁnitely refreshing to be so near nature in these grand and simple forms after so much exciting thought of art and man the day passed in the bernardin with its lofty peaks and changing lights upon the distant snows holy exquisite valleys and waterfalls its stories of eagles and chamois was the greatest refreshment i ever experience d it was bracing cold bath after the heat of crowd amid which one has listened to some most eloquent oration returning from switzerland i passed fortnight on the lake of and afterward visited lugano there is exaggeration in the enthusiastic feeling with which artists and poets have viewed these italian lakes their beauties are peculiar enchanting innumerable the titan of richter the wanderjahre of goethe the elena of taylor the pictures of turner had not prepared the visions of beauty that daily entranced the pg 237 pg 238 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https and heart in those regions to our country nature has been most bounteou s but we have nothing in the same kind that can compare with these lakes seen under the italian heaven to those persons who have pretended to discover that the effects of light and atmosphere were ﬁner than they found in our own lake scenery i can only say that they must be exceedingly obtuse in organization defect not uncommon among americans nature seems to have labored to express her full heart in many ways possible when she made these lakes moulded and planted their shores lago maggiore is grand resplendent in its beauty the view of the alps gives sort of lyric exaltation to the scene lago di garda is so soft and fair glittering sweet on one side the ruins of ancient palaces rise so softly with the beauties of that shore but at the other end amid the tyrol it is sublime calm concentrated in its meaning can not be better described in general than in the words of taylor softly sublime profusely fair lugano is more savage more free in its beauty i was on it in high gale there was little clanger just enough to exhilarate its waters were wild and clouds blowing across the neighboring peaks i like very much the boatmen on these lakes they have strong and prompt character of simple features they are more honest and manly than italian men are found in the thoroughfares their talk is not so witty that of the venetian gondoliers but picturesque and what the french call incisive very touching were some of their histories they told them to while pausing sometimes on the lake on this lake also i met lady franklin wife of the celebrated navigator she has been in the united states and showed equal penetration and candor in remarks on what she had seen there she gave interesting particulars to the state of things in van diemen land where she passed seven years when her husband was in authority there i returned to milan the great feast of the madonna 8th september and those made the archbishop entry which took place the same week these excited much feeling the milanese can have chance to display this archbishop being much nearer tire public heart than his predecessor who was poor servant of austria the austrian rule is always equally hated and time instead of melting away differences only makes them more glaring the austrian race have faculties that can ever enable them to understand the italian charact er their policy so well contrived to palsy and repress time can not kill and there is always force at work underneath which shall yet and i think now before long shake off the incubus the italian nobility have always kept the invader at distance they have not been at all seduced or corrupted by the lures of pleasure or power but have shown passive patriotism highly honorable to them in the middle class ferments much thought and there is capacity effort in the present system it can not show itself but it is there thought ferments and will yet produce wine that shall set the lombard veins on ﬁre when the time action shall arrive the lower classes of the population are in dull state indeed the censorship of the press prevents all easy natural ways of instructing them there are public meetings free access to them by more instructed and aspiring minds the austrian policy is to allow them degree of material and though so much wealth is drained from the country the service of the foreigners jet enough must remain on these rich plains comfortably to feed and clothe the inhabitants yet the great moral inﬂuence of the pope action though obstructed in their case does reach and rouse them and they too felt the thrill of indignation at the occupation of ferrara the base conduct of the police toward the people when at milan some youths were resolute to sing tire hymn in honor of pius when the feasts the archbishop afforded so legitimate an occasion roused all the people to unwonted feeling the nobles protested and austria had not courage to persist usual she could not sustain her police who rushed upon defenceless crowd that had share in what excited their displeasure except by sympathy and driving them like pg 239 pg 240 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https wounded them in the backs austria feels that there is now sympathy her in these matters that it is not the interest of the world to sustain her her policy is indeed too thoroughly organized to change except by revolution its scope is to serve ﬁrst reigning family instead of the people second with the people to seek physical in preference to an intellectual good and third to prefer seeming outward peace to an inward life this policy may change its opposition from the tyrannical to the insidious it can know other change yet i meet persons who call themselves americans miserable thoughtless esaus unworthy their high birthright think that mess of pottage can satisfy the wants of man and that the viennese listening to strauss s waltzes the lombard peasant supping full of his polenta is happy enough alas i have the more reason to be ashamed of my countrymen that it is not among the poor who have so much toil that there is little time to think but those who are rich who travel body that is they not travel in mind absorbed at home by the lust of gain the love of show abroad they see only the equipages the ﬁne clothes the food have heart the idea the destiny of our own great nation how can they feel the spirit that is struggling now in this and others of europe but of the hopes of italy i will write more fully in another letter and state what i have seen what felt what thought i went from milan to pavia and saw its magniﬁcent certosa i passed several hours in examining its riches especially the sculptures of its façade full of force and spirit i then went to florence by parma and bologna in parma though ill i went to see all the works of the masters wonderful beauty it is that informs them that which is the chosen food of my soul yet noble beauty and which did its message to also those works are failing it will not be useless to describ them in book beside these pictures i saw nothing in parma and

october 18 in the spring when i came to rome the people were in the intoxication of joy at the ﬁrst serious measures of reform taken by the pope i saw with pleasure their childlik joy and trust with equal pleasure i saw the pope who has not in his expression the signs of intellectual greatness so much of nobleness and tenderness of heart of large and liberal sympathies heart had spoken to heart between the prince and the people it was beautiful to see the immediate good inﬂuence exerted by human feeling and generous designs on the part of ruler he had wished to be father and the italians with that readiness of genius that characterizes them entered at once into the relation they the roman people stigmatized by prejudice so crafty and ferocious showed themselves children eager to learn quick to obey happy to conﬁde pg 241 pg 242 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https doubts were always present whether all this joy was not premature the task undertaken by the pope seemed to present insuperable difﬁculties it is never easy to put new wine into old bottles and our age is one where all things tend to great crisis not merely to revolution but to radical reform from the people themselves the help must come and not from princes in the new state of things there will be none but natural princes great men from the aspirations of the general heart from the teachings of conscience in individuals and not from an old church long since undermined corroded by time and gnawed by vermin the help must come rome to resume her glory must cease to be an ecclesiastical capital must renounc all this gorgeous mummery whose poetry whose picture charms one more than myself but whose meaning is all of the past and ﬁnds echo in the future although i sympathized warmly with the warm love of the peop le the adulation of leading writers who were so willing to take all from the hand of the prince of the church gift and bounty instead of implying steadily that it was the right of the people was very repulsive to the moderate party like all who in transition state manage affairs with constant eye to prudence lacks dignity always in its expositions it is disagreeable and depressing to read them passing into tuscany i found the liberty of the press just established and superior preparation to make use of it the alba the patria were begun and have been continued with equal judgment and spirit their aim is to educate the youth to educate the lower people they see that this is to be done by promoting thought fearlessly yet urge temperance in action while the time is yet so difﬁcult and many of its signs dubious they aim at breaking down those barriers between the different states of italy relics of barbarous state of polity artiﬁcially kept up by the craft of her foes while anxious not to break down what is really native to the italian character and differences that give individual genius chance to grow and the fruits of each region to ripen in their natural way aim at harmony of spirit to measures of education and the affairs of business without which italy can never one nation present front strong enough to resist foreign robbery and want of which so much time and talent are wasted here and internal development almost wholly checked there is in tuscany large corps of enlightened minds well prepared to be the instructors the elder brothers and guardians of the lower people and whose hearts burn to fulﬁl that noble ofﬁce before it had been almost impossible to them the reasons i have named in speaking of lombardy but during these last four months that the way has been opened by the freedom of the press and establishment of the national guard valuable ﬁrst of all giving occasion public meetings and free interchange of thought between the different classes is surprising how much light they have been able to dif fuse bolognese to whom i observed how can you be so full of trust when all your hopes depend not on the recognition of principles and wants throughout the people but on the life of one mortal man replied ah but you consider that his life gives us chance to effect that recognition if pius ix be spared to us ﬁve years it will be impossible his successors ever to take backward course our nation is of genius so vivacious are unhappy but not stupid we italians can learn much in two months other nations in twenty years this seemed to brag when i returned to tuscany and saw the great developmen t and diffusion of thought that had taken place during my brief absence the grand duke though dull man had dared to declare himself an italian prince and the heart of tuscany had bounded with hope it is now deeply justly felt that the curse of italy is foreign intrusion that if she could dispense with foreign aid and be free from foreign aggression she would ﬁnd the elements of salvation within herself all her efforts tend that way to ablish the natural position of things may heaven grant them success myself i believe they will attain it i see more reason hope i know more of the people their rash and bafﬂed struggles have taught them prudence they are wanted in the civilized world peculiar inﬂuence their leaders are thinking men their cause is righteous i believe that pg 243 pg 244 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https will revive to new life and proba bly greater one more truly rich and glorious than at either epoch of her former greatness during the period of my absence the austrians had entered ferrara it is well that they hazarded this step it showed them the difﬁculties in acting against prince of the church who is at the same time friend to the people the position was new and they were probably surprised at the result at the ﬁrmness of the pope surprised at the indignation tempered by calm resolve on the part of the italians louis philippe mean apostasy has this time turned to the advantage of freedom he renounced the good understanding with england which it had been one of the leading features of his policy to maintain in the hope of aggrandizing and enriching his family not france he did not care france he did not know that he was paving the way italian freedom england now is led to play part little nearer her pretensions the guardian of progress than she often comes and the ghost of la fayette looks down not unappeased to see the constitutional king decried by the subjects he has cheated and lulled so craftily the king of sardinia is worthless man in whom nobody puts any trust so far regards his heart or honor but the stress of things seems likely to keep him on the right side the little sovereigns blustered at ﬁrst then ran away affrighted when they found there was really spirit risen at last within the charmed circle spirit likely to defy to transcend the spells of haggard premiers and imbecile monarchs i arrived in florence unhappily too late the great fête of the 12th of september in honor of the grant of national guard but i wept at the mere recital of the events of that day which if it should lead to important results must still be hallowed ever in the memory of italy the great and beautiful emotions that ﬂooded the hearts of her children the national guard is hailed with undue joy by italians the earnest of progress the ﬁrst step toward truly national institutions and representation of the people gratitude has done its natural work in their hearts it has made them better some days before the fête were passed in reconciling all strifes composing all differences between cities districts and individuals they wished to drop all petty all local differences to wash away all stains to bathe and prepare new great covenant of brotherly love where each should act the good of all on that day they all embraced in sign of this foes all exchanged the kiss of faith and love they exchanged banners token that they would ﬁght would animate one another all was done in that beautiful poetic manner peculiar to this artist people but it was the spirit so great and tender that melts my heart to think of it was the spirit of true religion my country welling freshly from some great hearts in thy early hours won thee all of value that thou canst call thy own whose groundwork is the assertion still sublime though thou hast not been true to it that all men have equal rights and that these are birth derived from god alone i rejoice to say that the americans took their share on this occasion and that greenough of the few americans who living in italy takes the pains to know whether it is alive or dead who penetrates beyond the cheats of tradesmen and the cunning of mob corrupted by centuries of slavery to know the real mind the vital blood of leading part i am sorry to say that large portion of my countrymen here take the same slothful and prejudiced view the english and after many years sojourn betray entire ignorance of italian literature and italian life beyond what is attainable in month passage through the thoroughfares however they did show this time becom ing spirit and erected the american eagle where its cry ought to be heard from afar nation is striving independent existe nce and government representing the people crawford here in rome has had the just feeling to join the guard and it is real sacriﬁce an artist to spend time on the exercises but it well becomes the sculptor of orpheus him who had such faith such music of divine thought that he made the stones move turned the beasts from their accustomed haunts and shamed hell itself into sympathy with the grief of love i not deny that such spirit is wanted here in italy it is everywhere if anything great anything permanent is to be done in reference to what i have said of many americans in italy i will only add that they talk about the corrupt and pg 245 pg 246 pg 247 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https state of italy they about that of our slaves at home they come ready trained to that mode of reasoning which afﬁrms that because men are degraded by bad institutions they are not ﬁt better to the english some of them are full of generous intelligent sympathy what is more solidly more wisely good than the right sort of englishmen others are like gentleman i travelled with the other day man of intelligence and reﬁnement too to the details of life and outside culture who observed that he did not see what the italians wanted of national guard unless to wear these little caps he was man who had passed ﬁve years in italy but always covered with that called by witty french writer the britannic ﬂuid very sweet to my ear was the continual hymn in the streets of florence in honor of pius ix it is the roman hymn and none of the new ones written in tuscany have been able to take its place the people thank the grand duke when he does them good but they know well from whose mind that good originates and all their love is the pope time presses or i would fain describe in detail the troupe of laborers of the lower class marching home at night keeping step if they were in the national guard ﬁlling the air and cheering the melancholy moon by the patriotic hymns sung with the mellow tone and in the perfect time which belong to italians i would describe the extempore concerts in the streets the rejoicings at the theatres where the addresses of liberal souls to the people through that best vehicle the drama may now be heard but i am tired what i have to write would ﬁll volumes and my letter must go i will only add some words upon the happy augury i draw from the wise docility of the people with what readi ness they listened to wise counsel and the hopes of the pope that they would give advantage to his enemies at time when they were so fevered by the knowledge that conspiracy was at work in their midst that was time of trial on all these occasions of popular excitement their conduct is like music in such order and with such union of the melody of feeling with discretion where to stop but what is wonderful is that they acted in the same manner on that difﬁcult occasion the inﬂuence of the pope here is withou t bounds he can always calm the crowd at once but in tuscany where they have such idol they listened in the same way on very trying occasion the ﬁrst announceme nt of the regulation the tuscan national guard terribly disappointed the people they felt that the grand duke after suffering them to demonstrate such trust and joy on the feast of the 12th did not really trust on his side that he meant to limit them all he could they felt bafﬂed cheated hence young men in anger tore down at once the symbols of satisfaction and respect but the leading men went among the people begged them to be calm and wait till deputation had seen the grand duke the people listening at once to men who they were sure had at heart their best good waited the grand duke became convinced and all ended without disturbance if they continue to act thus their hopes can not be bafﬂed certainly i one not think that the present road will sufﬁce to lead italy to her goal but it is an onward upward road and the people learn they advance now they can seek and think fearless of prisons and bayonets healthy circulation of blood begins and the heart frees itself from disease i earnestly hope some expression of sympathy from my country toward italy take good chance and something you have shown much good feeling toward the old world in its physical difﬁculties ought to still more in its spiritual endeavor this cause is ours above all others we ought to show that we feel it to be so at present there is likelihood of war but in case of it i trust the united states would not fail in some noble token of sympathy toward this country the soul of our nation need not wait its government these things are better done by individuals i believe some in the united states will pay attention to these words of mine will feel that i am not person to be kindled by childish sentimental enthusiasm but that i must be sure i have seen something of italy before speaking i i have been here only seven months but my means of observation have been uncomm on i have been ardently desirous to judge fairly and had prejudices to prevent beside i was not ignorant of the history and literature of italy and had some common ground on which to stand with its inhabitants and hear pg 248 pg 249 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https they have to say in many ways italy is of kin to us she is the country of columbus of amerigo of cabot it would please much to see cannon here bought by the contributions of americans at whose head should stand the name of cabot to be used by the guard salutes on festive occasions if they should be so happy to have more serious need in tuscany they are casting one to be called the gioberti from writer who has given great impulse to the present movement i should like the gift of america to be called the amerigo the columbo or the washingt on please think of this some of my friends who still care the eagle the fourth of july and the old cries of hope and honor see if there are any objections that i not think of

this letter will reach the united states about the 1st of january and it may not be impertinent to offer few ear reﬂections every new year indeed conﬁrms the old thoughts but also presents them under some new aspects the american in europe if thinking mind can only become more american in some respects it is great pleasure to be here although we have an independent political existence bur position toward europe to literature and the arts is still that of colony and one feels the same joy here that is experienced by the colonist in returning to the parent home what was but picture to us becomes reality remote allusions and derivations trouble more we see the pattern of the stuff and understand the whole tapestry there is gradual clearing up on many points and many baseless notions and crude fancies are dropped even the passage of the business american through the great cities escorted by cheating couriers and ignorant valets place unable to hold intercourse with the natives of the country and passing all his leisure hours with his countrymen who know more than himself clears his mind of some mistakes some mists from his horizon there are three species first the servile american being utterly shallow thoughtless worthless he comes abroad to spend his money and indulge his tastes his object in europe is to have fashionable clothes good foreign cookery to know some titled persons and furnish himself with gossip by retailing which among those less travelled and uninformed himsel f he can win importance at home i look with unspeakable contempt on this class class which has all the thoughtless ness and partiality of the exclusive classes in europe without any of their reﬁnement or the chivalric feeling which still sparkles among them here and there however though these willing serfs in free age some little hurt and cause some annoyance at present they can not continue long our country is fated to grand independent existence and its laws develop these parasites of bygone period must wither and drop away then there is the conceited american instinctively bristling and proud knows not what he does not see not he that the history of humanity many centuries is likely to have produced results it requires some training some devotion to appreciate and proﬁt by with his great clumsy hands only ﬁtted to work on he seizes the old cremona violin makes it shriek with anguish in his grasp and then declares he thought it was all humbug before he came and now he knows it that there is not really any music in these old things that the frogs in one of our swamps make much ﬁner they are pg 250 pg 251 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https and alive to him the etiquettes of courts and camps the ritual of the church seem simply silly wonder profoundly ignorant he is of their origin and meaning just so the legends which are the subjects of pictures the profound myths which are represented in the antique marbles amaze and revolt him indeed such things need to be judged of by another standard than that of the connecticut he criticises severely pictures feeling quite sure that his natural senses are better means of judgment than the rules of connoisseurs feeling that to see such objects mental vision well ﬂeshly eyes are needed and that something is aimed at in art beyond the imitation of the commonest forms of nature this is jonathan in the sprawling state the booby truant not yet aspiring enough to be good yet in his folly there is meaning add thought and culture to his independence and he will be man of might he is not creature without hope like the dandy of the class ﬁrst speciﬁed the artistes form class by themselves yet among them though seeking special aims by special means may also be found the lineaments of these two classes well of the third of which i am now to speak this is that of the thinking american man who recognizing the immense advantage of being born to new world and on virgin soil yet does not wish one seed from the past to be lost he is anxious to gather and carry back with him every plant that will bear new climate and new culture some will dwindle others will attain bloom and stature unknown before he wishes to gather them clean free from noxious insects and to give them fair trial in his new world and that he may know the conditions under which he may best place them in that new world he does not neglect to study their history in this the history of our planet in some moments seems so painfully mean and little terrible bafﬂings and failures to compe nsate some brilliant successes crushing of the mass of men beneath the feet of few and these too often the least worthy such small drop of honey to each cup of gall and in many cases so mingled that it is never one moment in life purely tasted all so little achieved humanity whole such tides of war and pestilence intervening to blot out the traces of each triumph wonder if the strongest soul sometimes pauses aghast wonder if the many indolently console themselves with gross joys and frivolous prizes yes those men are worthy of admiration who can carry this cross faithfully through ﬁfty years it is great while all the agonies that beset lover of good lover of men it makes soul worthy of speedier ascent more productive ministry in the next sphere blessed are they who ever keep that portion of pure generous love with which they began life how blessed those who have deepened the fountains and have enough to spare the thirst of others some such there are and feeling that with all the excuses failure still only the sight of those who triumph gives meaning to life or makes its pangs endurable we must arise and follow eighteen hundred years of this christian culture in these european kingdoms great theme never lost sight of mighty idea an adorable history to which the hearts of men invariably cling yet are genuine results rare grains of gold in the river sandy bed where is the genuine democracy to which the rights of all men are holy where the like wisdom learning all through life more and more of the will of god where the aversion to falsehood in all its myriad disguises of cant vanity covetousness so clear to be read in all the history of jesus of nazareth modern europe is the sequel to that history and see this hollow england with its monstrous wealth and cruel poverty its conventional life and low practical aims see this poor france so full of talent so adroit yet so shallow and glossy still which could not escape from false position with all its baptism of blood see that lost poland and this italy bound down by treacherous hands in all the force of genius see russia with its brutal czar and innumerable slaves see austria and its royalty that represents nothing and its people who people are and have nothing if we consider the amount of truth that has really been spoken out in the world and the love that has beat in private hearts genius has decked each time with such splendid ﬂowers conve ying each one enough of instruction in its life of pg 252 pg 253 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by

europe toils and struggles with her idea and at this moment all things bode and declare new outbreak of the ﬁre to destroy old palaces of crime may it fertilize also many vineyards here at this moment successor of peter after the lapse of near two thousand years is called utopian by part of this europe because he strives to get some food to the mouths of the leaner of his ﬂock wonderful state of things and which leaves the best argument against despair that men not can not despair amid such dark experiences and thou my country wilt thou not be more true does greater success await thee all things have so conspired to teach to aid new world new chance with oceans to wall in the new thought against interference from the old treasures of all kinds gold silver corn marble to provide every

how often dost thou near the ground how show the vulture in these later days thou wert to be the guard of humanity the herald of all progress how often hast thou betrayed this high commission fain would the tongue in clear triumphant accents draw example from thy story to encourage the hearts of those who almost faint and die beneath the old oppressions but we must stammer and blush when we speak of many things i take pride here that i can really say the liberty of the press works well and that checks and balances are found naturally which sufﬁce to its government i can say that the minds of our people are alert and that talent has free chance to rise this is much but dare i further say that political ambition is not darkly sullied in other countries dare i say that men of most inﬂuence in political life are those who represent most virtue or even intellectual power is it easy to ﬁnd names in that career of which i can speak with enthusiasm must i not confess to boundless lust of gain in my country must i not concede the weakest vanity which bristles and blusters at each foolish taunt of the foreign press and admit that the men who make these undigniﬁed rejoinders seek and ﬁnd popularity so can i help admitting that there is yet antidote cordially adopted which will defend even that great rich country against the evils that have grow n out of the commercial system in the old world can i say our social laws are genera lly better or show nobler insight into the want s of man and woman i indeed say what i believe that voluntary association improvement in these particulars will be the grand means my nation to grow and give nobler harmony to the coming age but it is only of small minority that i can say they yet seriously take to heart these things that they earnestly meditate on what is wanted their country mankind our cause is indeed the cause of all mankind at present could we succeed really succeed combine deep religious love with practical development the achievements of genius with the happiness of the multitude we might believe man had now reached commanding point in his ascent and would stumble and faint more then there is this horrible cancer of slavery and the wicked war that has grown out of it how dare i speak of these things here i listen to the same arguments against the emancipation of italy that are used against the emancipation of our blacks the same arguments in favor of the spoliation of poland the conquest of mexico i ﬁnd the cause of tyranny and wrong everywhere the same lo my country the darkest offender because with the least excuse forsworn to the high calling with which she was called champion of the rights of men but robber and jailer the scour ge hid behind her banner her eyes ﬁxed not on the stars but on the possessions of other men pg 254 pg 255 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https it pleases here to think of the abolitionists i could never endure to be with them at home they were so tedious often so narrow always so rabid and exaggerated in their tone but after all they had high motive something eternal in their desire and life and if it was not the only thing worth thinking of it was really something worth living and dying to free great nation from such terrible blot such threatening plague god strengthen them and make them wise to achieve their purpose i please myself too with remembering some ardent souls among the american youth who i trust will yet expand and help to give soul to the huge too hastily body may they be constant were man but constant he were perfect it has been said and it is true that he who could be constant to those moments in which he has been truly human not brutal not mechanical is on the sure path to his perfection and to effectual service of the universe it is to the youth that hope addresses itself to those who yet burn with aspiration who are not hardened in their sins but i dare not expect too much of them i am not very old yet of those who in life morning i saw touched by the light of high hope many have seceded some have become voluptuaries some mere family men who think it quite life enough to win bread half dozen people and treat them decently other s are lost through indolence and vacillation yet some remain constant i have witnessed many shipwreck yet still beat noble hearts i have found many among the youth of england of france of italy also full of high desire but will they have courage and purity to ﬁght the battle through in the sacred the immortal band of some of them i belie ve it and await the proof if few succeed amid the trial we have not lived and loved in vain to these the heart and hope of my country happy new year i not know what i have

rise to see the ﬂoods of sunlight blessing us they have almost every day since i returned to rome months and more scarce three or four days of rainy weather i still see the fresh roses and grapes each morning on my table though both these i expect to give up at christmas this autumn is something like my countrymen say at home like what they not say so i always supposed they meant like their ideal standard certainly this weather corresponds with mine and i begin to believe the climate of italy is really what it has pg 256 pg 257 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https represented shivering here last spring in an air better than the cruel cast wind of puritan boston i thought all the praises lavished on italia italia would turn out to be ﬁgments of the brain and that even byron usually accurate beyond the conception of plodding pedants had deceived us when he says you have the happiness in italy to see the sun set sure he rise and not according to view which exercises withering inﬂuence on the enthusiasm of youth in my native land be forced to regard each pleasant day weather how delightful too is the contrast between this time and the spring in another respect then i was here like travellers in general expecting to be driven away in short time like others i went through the painful process of so unnatural everywhere so counter to the healthful methods and true life of the mind you rise in the morning knowing there are great number of objects worth knowing which you may never have the chance to see again you go every day in all moods under all circumstances feeling probably in seeing them the inadequacy of your preparation understanding or duly receiving them this consciousness would be most valuable if one had time to think and study being the natural way in which the mind is lured to cure its defects but you have time you are always wearied body and mind confused dissipated sad the objects are of commanding beauty or full of suggestion but there is quiet to let that beauty breathe its life into the soul time to follow up these suggestions and plant the proper harvest many persons run about rome nine days and then go away they might well expect to appreciate the venus by throwing stone at it hope really to see rome in this time i stayed in rome nine weeks and came away unhappy he who having been taken in the visions of the night through some wondrous realm wakes unable to recall anything but the hues and outlines of the pageant the real knowledge the recreative power induced by familiar love the assimilation of its soul and substance the true value of such revelation wanting and he remains poor tantalus hungrier than before he had tasted this spiritual food rome is not wonder and those who try to make it such lose the ideal rome if they ever had it without gaining any notion of the real to those who travel they everything else only because others i not speak they are nothing nobody counts in the estimate of the human race who has not character one i now really live in rome and i begin to see and feel the real rome she reveals herself day by day she tells some of her life now i never go out to see sight but i walk every day and here i can not miss of some object of consummate interest to end walk in the evenings which are long now i am at leisure to follow up the inquiries suggested by the day one becomes familiar ancient and modern rome at ﬁrst so painf ully and discordantly jumbled together are drawn apart to the mental vision one sees where objects and limits anciently wore the superstructures vanish and you recognize the local habitation of so many thoughts when this begins to happen one feels ﬁrst truly at ease in rome then the old kings the consuls and tribunes the emperors drunk with blood and gold the warriors of eagle sight and remorseless beak return us and the togated procession ﬁnds room to sweep across the scene the seven hills tower the innumerable temples glitter and the via sacra swarms with triumphal life once more ah how joyful to see once more this rome instead of the pitiful peddling anglicized rome ﬁrst viewed in unutterable dismay from the coupé of the vettura rome all full of taverns cheating chambermaids vilest valets place and ﬂeas niobe of nations indeed ah why secretly the heart blasphemed did the sun omit to kill pg 258 pg 259 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https too when all the glorious race which wore her crown fell beneath his ray thank heaven it is possible to wash away all this dirt and come at the marble yet their the later papal rome it requires much acquaintance much thought much reference to books the child of protestant republican america to see where belong the legends illustrated by rite and picture the sense of all the rich tapestry where it has united and poetic meaning where it is broken by some accident of history all these senseless mass of juggleries to the uninformed really growths of the human spirit struggling to develop its life and full of instruction those who learn to understand them then modern rome ecclesiastical still darkened and damp in the shadow of the vatican but where bright hopes gleam now amid the ashes never was people who have had more to corrupt them tyranny and incubus of priestcraft the invasions ﬁrst of goths then of trampling emperors and kings then of foreigners to turn them from sincere hopeful fruitful life and they are much corrupted but still ﬁne race i can not look merely with pictorial eye on the lounge of the roman dandy the bold juno gait of the roman contadina i love them dandies and all i believe the natural expression of these ﬁne forms will animate them yet certainly there never was people that showed better heart than they in this day of love of purely moral inﬂuence it makes very happy to be once in place ruled by father love and where the pervasive glow of one good generous heart is felt in every pulse of every day i have seen the pope several times since my return and it is real pleasure to see him in the thoroughfares where his passage is always greeted that of the living soul the ﬁrst week of november there is much praying the dead here in the chapels of the cemeteries i went to santo spirito this cemetery stands high and all the way up the slope was lined with beggars petitionin g alms in every attitude ﬁnd tone i mean tone that belongs to the professional beggar gamut that is peculiar and under every pretext imaginable from the quite legles s elderly gentleman to the ragged rufﬁan with the roguish twinkle in his eye who has merely slight stiffness in one arm and one leg i could not help laughing it was such show to the alarm of my attend ant who declared they would kill if ever they caught alone but i was not afraid i am sure the endless falsehood in which such creatures live must make them very cowardly we entered the cemetery it was sweet tranquil place lined with cypresses and soft sunshine lying on the stone coverings where repose the houses of clay in which once dwelt joyous roman hearts the hearts here take pleasure in life there were several chapels in one boys were chanting in others people on their knees silently praying the dead in another was one of the groups in wax exhibited in such chapels through the ﬁrst week of november it represented carlo borromeo beautiful young man in long scarlet robe pure and brilliant was the blood of the martyrs relieving the poor who were grouped around him people and children the halt the maimed the blind he had called them all into the feast of love the chapel was lighted and draped so to give very good effect to this group the spectators were mainly children and young girls listening with ardent eyes while their parents or the nuns explained to them the group or told some story of the saint it was pretty scene only marred by the presence of man who ever and anon shook the poor box i can not understand the bad taste of choosing him when there were frati and priests enough of expression less unprepossessing i next entered where the stations or different periods in the passion of jesus are painted on the wall kneeling before these were many persons here franciscan in his brown robe and cord there pregnant woman uttering doubtless some tender aspiration the welfare of the yet unborn dear one there some boys with gay yet reverent air while all the while these fresh young voices were heard chanting it was beautiful moment and despite the wax saint the friar the professional pg 260 pg 261 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https and my own removal wide pole from pole from the positron of mind indicated by these forms their spirit touched and i prayed too prayed the distant every way distant those who seem to have forgotten and with all we had in common prayed the dead in spirit if not in body prayed myself that i might never walk the earth the tomb of my dead self and prayed in general all unspoiled and loving hearts less all who suffer and ﬁnd yet helper going out i took my road by the cross which marks the brow of the hill up the ascent still wound the crowd of devotees and still the beggars beset them amid that crowd how many lovely women the women of italy are intellectually in low place are unaffected you can see what heaven meant them to be and i believe they will be yet the mothers of great and generous race before lay rome how exquisitely tranquil in the sunset never was an aspect that serene grandeur could vie with that of rome at sunset next day was the feast of the milanese saint whose life has been made known to some americans by manzoni when speaking in his popular novel of the cousin of carlo federigo borromeo the pope came in state to the church of carlo in the corso the show was magniﬁcent the church is not very large and was almost ﬁlled with papal court and guards in all their splendid harmonies of color an italian child was next little girl of four or ﬁve years whom her mother had brought to see the pope in the intervals of gazing the child smiled and made signs to i nodded in return and asked her name virginia said she and how is the signora named mar gherita my name she rejoined is virginia gentil i i laughed but did not follow up the cunning graceful lead i chatted and played with her now and then at last she said to her mother la signora molto cara the signora is very dear or to use the english equivalent darling show her my two sisters so the mother herself woman introduced two handsome young ladies and with the family i was in moment pleasantly intimate the hour before sat three young english ladies the pretty daughters of noble earl their manners were strange contrast to this italian graciousness best expressed by their constant use of the pronoun that see that man some high dignitary of the church look at that dress dropped constantly from their lips ah without being catholic one may well wish rome was not dependent on english who violate her ceremonies with acts that bespeak their thoughts full of wooden shoes and can anything be more sadly expressive of times out of joint than the fact that trollope is resident in italy yes she is ﬁxed permanently in florence i am told pensioned at the rate of two thousand pounds year to trail her slime over the fruit of italy she is here in rome this winter and after having violated the virgin beauty of america will have many year her chance to sully the imperial matron of the civilized world what must the english public be if it wishes to pay two thousand pounds year to get italy trollopiﬁed but to turn to pleasanter subject when the pope entered borne in his chair of state amid the pomp of his tiara and his white and gold robes he looked to thin or the italians murmur anxiously at times consumato or wasted but during the ceremony he seemed absorbed in his devotions and at the end i think he had become exhilarated by thinking of carlo who was such another over the human race himself and his face wore bright glow of faith he blessed the people he raised his eyes to heaven with gesture quite natural it was the spontaneous act of soul which felt that mom ent more than usual its relation with things above it and sure of support from higher power i saw him to still greater advantage little while after when riding on the campagna with young gentleman who had been ill we met the pope on foot taking exercise he often pg 262 pg 263 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https his carriage at the gates and walks in this way he walked rapidly robed in simple white drapery two young priests in spotless purple on either side they gave silver to the poor who knelt beside the way while the beloved father gave his benediction my companion knelt he is not catholic but he felt that this blessing would him harm the pope saw at once he was ill and gave him mark of interest with that expression of melting love the true the only charity which assures all who look on him that were his power equal to his will living thing would ever suffer more this expression the artists try in vain to catch all busts and engravings of him are caricatures it is magnetic sweetness lambent light that plays over his features and of which only great genius or soul tender his own would form an adequate image the italians have one term of praise peculiarly characteristic of their highly endowed nature they say of such and such ha una phisonomia simpatica he has sympathetic expression and this is praise enough this may be said of that of pius ix he looks indeed if nothing human could be foreign to him such alone are the genuine kings of men he has shown undoubted wisdom bravery and ﬁrmness but it is above all his generous human heart that gives him his power over this people his is face to shame the selﬁsh redeem the sceptic alarm the wicked and cheer to new effort the weary and what form the issues of his life may take is yet uncertain in my belief they are such he does not think of but they can not fail to be good my part i shall always rejoice to have been here in his time the working of his inﬂuence conﬁrms my theories and it is positiv treasure to to have seen him i have never been presented not wishing to approach so real presence in the path of mere etiquette i am quite content to see him standing amid the crowd while the band plays the music he has inspired sons of rome awake yes awake and let put you again to sleep in prison has happened to those who were called by the marseillaise affairs look well the king of sardinia has at last though with evident distrust and heartlessness entered the upward path in way that makes it difﬁcult to return the duke of modena the most senseless of all these ancient gentlemen after publishing declaration which made him more ridiculous than would the bitterest pasquinad penned by another that he would ﬁght to the death against reform ﬁnds himself obliged to lend an ear to the league the customs and if he joins that other measures follow of course austria trembles and in ﬁne can not sustain the point of ferrara the king of naples after having shed much blood which he has terrible account to render ah how many sad fair romances are to tell already about the calabrian difﬁculties still ﬁnds the spirit fomenting in his people he can not put it down the dragon teeth are sown and the lazzaroni may be men yet the swiss affairs have taken the right direction and good will ensue if other powers act with decent honesty and think of healing the wounds of switzerland rather than merely of tying her down so that she can not annoy them in rome here the new council is inaugurated and elections have given tolerable satisfaction already struggles ended in other places begin to be renewed here to lights introduction of machinery we shall see at the end of the winter how they have gone on at any rate the wants of the people are in some measure represented and already the conduct of those who have taken to themselves so large porti on of the loaves and ﬁshes on the very platform supposed to be selected by jesus general feeding of his sheep begins to be the subject of spoken well whispered animadversion torlonia is assailed in his bank campana amid his urns or his monte di picti but these assaults have yet to be veriﬁed pg 264 pg 265 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https the day when the council was to be inaugurated great preparations were made by representatives of other parts of italy and also of foreign nations friendly to the cause of progress it was considered to repres ent the same fact the feast of the 12th of september in tuscany dawn of an epoch when the people shall ﬁnd their wants and aspirations represented and guarded the americans showed warm interest the gentlemen subscribing to buy ﬂag the united states having none before in rome and the ladies meeting to make it the same distinguished individual indeed who at florence made speech to prevent the american eagle being taken out on so triﬂing an occasion with similar perspicuity and superiority of view on the present occasion was anxious to prevent rash demonstrations which might embroil the united states with austria but the rash youth here present rushed on ignorant how to value his nestorian prudence fancying simpletons that the cause of freedom was the cause of america and her eagle at home wherever the sun shed warmer ray and there was reaso n to hope happier life man so they hurried to buy their silk red white and blue and inquired of recent arrivals how many states there are this winter in the union in order to making the proper number of stars magniﬁcent was procured not without difﬁculty this once the eyrie of the king of birds is now rookery rather full of black ominous fowl ready to eat the harvest sown by industrious hands this eagle having previously spread its wings over piece of furniture where its back was sustained by the wall was somewhat deﬁcient in part of its anatomy but we ﬂattered ourselves he should be held so high that roman eye if disposed could carp and criticise when lo just the banner was ready to unfold its young glories in the home of horace virgil and tacitus an ordinance appeared prohibiting the display of any but the roman ensign this ordinance was it

have indignantly crushed at once any of these malignant efforts however that may be one can ever be really displeased with any measure of the pope knowing his excellent intentions but the limitation of the festival deprived it of the noble character of the brotherhood of nations and an ideal aim worn by that of tuscany the romans drilled and disappointed greeted their councillors with but little enthusiasm the procession too was but poor affair rome carriages had been lent by the princes and nobles at the request of the city to convey the councillors i found something symbolical in this thus will they be obliged to furnish from their old grandeur the vehicles of the new ideas each deputy was followed by his target and banner when the deputy ferrara passed many garlands were thrown upon his carriage there has been deep respect and sympathy felt the citizens of ferrara they have conducted so well under their late trying circumstanc es they contained themselves knowing that the least indiscretion would give handle aggression to the enemies of the good cause but the daily occasions of irritation must have been innumerable and they have shown much power of wise and digniﬁed after the procession passed i attempted to go on foot from the café novo in the corso to peter to see the decorations of the streets but it was impossible in that dense but most vivacious various and crowd with all best will on their part to aid the foreigner it was impossible to advance so i saw only themselves but that was great pleasure there is so much individuality of character here that it is great entertainment to be in crowd in the evening there was ball given at the argentina lord minto was there prince corsini now senator the torlonias in uniform of the civic guard torlonia in sash of their colors given her by the civic guard which she waved often in answer to their greetings but the beautiful show of the evening was the trasteverini dancing the saltarello in their most brilliant costume i saw them thus to much greater advan tage than pg 266 pg 267 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https before several were nobly handsome and danced admirably it was really like pinelli the saltarello enchants in this is really the italian wine the italian sun the ﬁrst time i saw it danced one night very unexpectedly near the colosseum it carried quite beyond myself so that i most unamiably insisted on staying while the friends in my company not heated by enthusiasm like were shivering and perhaps catching cold from the damp i fear they remember it against nevertheless i cherish the memory of the moments wickedly stolen at their expense it is only the ﬁrst time seeing such thing that you enjoy peculiar delight but since i love to see and study it much the pope in receiving the councillors made speech the king of prussia intrenched himself in on similar occasion only much better and shorter that he meant only to improve not to reform and should keep things in statu quo safe locked with the keys of peter this little speech was made doubt more to reassure czars emperors and kings than from the promptings of the spirit but the fact of its necessity well the inferior freedom and spirit of the roman journals to those of tuscany seems to say that the pontiﬁcal government though from the accident of this one man accession it has taken the initiative to better times yet may not after while from its very nature be able to keep in the vanguard sad contrast to the feast of this day was presented by the same persons fortnight after following the body of silvani one of the councillors who died suddenly the councillors the different societies of rome corps frati bearing tapers the civic guard with drums slowly beating the same state carriages with their liveried attendants all slowly sadly moving with torches and banners drooped along the corso in the dark night single horseman with his long white plume and

last content myself with praising the glorious weather i wrote in the last day of it since we have had fortnight of rain falling incessantly and whole days and nights of torrents such are peculiar to the shower in our country under these circumstances i have found my lodging in the corso not only has its dark side but is all dark and that one in the piazza di spagne would have been better in this respect there on these days the only ones when i wish to stay at home and write and study i should have had the light now if i consulted the good of my eyes i should have the lamp lit on ﬁrst rising in the morning every sweet must have its bitter and the exchange from the brilliance of the italian heaven to weeks and months of rain and such black cloud is unspeakably dejecting myself at the end of this fortnight without exercise or light and in such damp atmosphere i ﬁnd myself without stren gth without appetite almost without spirits the life of the german scholar who studies ﬁfteen hours out of the or that of the pg 268 pg 269 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https g prisoner who could live throu gh ten ﬁfteen twenty years of dark prison with only half an hour exercise in the day is to mystery how can the brain the nerves ever support it we are made to keep in motion to drink the air and light to these are needed to make life supportable the physical state is so difﬁcult and full of pains at any rate i am sorry those who have arrived just at this time hoping to enjoy the christmas festivities everything was spoiled by the weather i went at half past ten to san luigi francese church adorned with some of domenichino ﬁnest frescos on the life and death of cecilia this name leads to little digression in letter to phillips the dear friend of our revered charming i asked him if he remembered what recumbent statue it was of which charming was wont to speak of sight that impressed him more than anything else in rome he said indeed his mood and the unexpectedness in seeing this gentle saintly ﬁgure lying there if death had just struck her down had doubt much inﬂuence upon him but still he believed the work had peculiar holiness in its expression i recognized at once the theme of his description the name he himself had forgotten i entered the other evening the lonely church of cecilia in trastevere in his case it was twilight one or two nuns were at their devotions and there lay the ﬁgure in its with an air so gentle so holy if she had only ceased to pray the hand of the murderer struck her down her gentle limbs seemed instinct still with soft sweet life the expression was not of the heroine the martyr so much of the tender angelic woman i could well understand the deep impression made upon his mind the expression of the frescos of domenichino is not inharmonious with the suggestions of this statue finding the mass was not to begin some time i set out the quirinal to see the pope return from that noble church santa maria maggiore where he ofﬁciated this night i reached the mount just he was returning few torches gleamed before his door perhaps hundred people were gathered together round the fountain last year an immense multitude waited him there to express their affection in one grand night the change was occasioned partly by the weather partly by other causes of which i shall speak by and by just he returned the moon looked palely out from amid the wet clouds and shone upon the fountain and the noble ﬁgures above it and the long white cloaks of the guardia nobile who followed his carriage on horseback darker objects could scarcely be seen except by the ﬂickering light of the torches much blown by the wind i then returned to san luigi the effect of the night service there was very ﬁne those details which often have such glaring mean look by day are lost sight of in the night and the unity of impression from the service is much more undisturbed the music too descriptive of that which promised peace on earth to men was very sweet and the pastorale particularly soothed the heart amid the crowd and pompous ceremonial but here too the sweet had its bitter in the vulgar vanity of the leader of the orchestra trait too common in such who not content with marking the time the musicians made his stick heard in the remotest nook of the church so that what would have been sweet music and ﬂowed in upon the soul was vulgarized to make you remember the performers and their machines on monday the leaders of the guardia civica paid their respects to the pope who in receiving them expressed his constantly increasing satisfaction in having given this institution to his people the same evening there was procession with torches to the quirinal to pay the homage due to the day feast of john and of the pope giovanni maria mastai but all the way the rain continually threatened to extinguish the torches and the pope could give but hasty salute under an umbrella when the heavens were again opened and such cataract of water descended drove both man and beast to seek the nearest shelter pg 270 pg 271 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america

less effective ceremony than i expected from the descriptions of travellers and writers there was moment of throwing on the black veil peal of music salute of cannon the nun an elegantly dressed woman of ﬁve or six and twenty enough but whose quite worldly air gave the idea that it was one of those arrangements made because suitable establishment could otherwise be given her forward knelt and prayed her confessor in that strained unnatural whine too common among preachers of all churches and all countries praised himself having induced her to enter on path which would lead her fettered steps from palm to palm from triumph to triumph poor thing she looked if the domestic olives and poppies were all she wanted and lacking these tares and wormwood must be her portion she was then taken behind grating her hair cut and her clothes exchanged the nun vestments the sisters who worked upon her looking like crows or ravens at their ominous feasts all the while the music played ﬁrst sweet and thoughtful then triumphant strains the effect on my mind was revolting and painful to the last degree were monastic seclusion always voluntary and could it be ended whenever the mind required change back from seclusion to common life i should have nothing to say against it there are positions of the mind which it suits exactly and even characters that might choose it all through life

him who has persuaded novice that the snares of the world are less dangerous than the demons of solitude festivities in italy have been of great importance since century or two back the thought the feeling the genius of the people have had more chance to expand to express themselves there than anywhere else now if the march of reform goes forward this will not be so there will be also speeches made freely on public occasions without having the life pressed out of them by the censorship now we hover betwixt the old and the new when the many reasons the new prevail i hope what is poetical in the old will not be lost the ceremonies of new year are before but i shall have to send this letter on ear day i can not describe them the romans begin now to talk of the mad gayeties of carnival and

devoted to the memory of byron but was quite unequal to the part being one of those affectionate natures that must have some one near with whom to be occupied and now it seems she has resigned herself

ofﬁcers were in black velvet dresses with broad white collars they took the oaths of ofﬁce and then actually kissed his foot i had supposed this was never really done but only very low obeisance made

hearing vespers now what they replied is there oration speech so deeply rooted in the american mind is the idea that sermon is the only real worship this church is indelibly stamped on my mind coming to rome this time i saw in the diligence young man whom his uncle priest of the convent that owns this church had sent intending to provide him employment here some slight circumstances tested the character of this young man and showed it what i have ever found it singularly honorable and conscientious he was led to show his papers among which was letter from youth whom with that true benevolence only possible to the poor because only they can make great sacriﬁces he had so beneﬁ ted to make an entire change in his prospects life himself poor orphan with nothing but tolerable education at an orphan asylum and friend of his dead parents to ﬁnd him employment on leaving it he had felt this young man poorer and more uninstructed than himself had taught him at his leisure to read and write had then collected from friends and given himself till he had gathered together sixty francs procuring also his protégé letter from monks who were friends of his to the convents on the road so that wherever there was one the poor youth had lodging and food gratis thus armed he set forth on foot rome piacenza their native place affording little hope even of gaining bread in the

soul of the departed his simpl faith in these being apparently indestructible and amid his tears he said the fathers were so unkind they were hardly willing to hear speak word they were so afraid i

found it thronged while preacher panting sweating leaning half out of the pulpit was exhorting his hearers to imitate christ with unspeakable disgust i gazed on this false shepherd of those who had just so failed in their duty to poor stray lamb their church is so rich in ornaments the seven baiocchi were hardly needed to burnish it their is very imposing composition by an artist of rome still in the prime of his powers capalti it represents the circumcision with the cross and six waiting angels in the background joseph who holds the child the priest and all the ﬁgures in the foreground

mentioned picture let say word or two about art and artists by way of parenthesis in this letter so much occupied with political affairs we laugh little here at some words that come from your city on the subject of art we hear that the landscapes painted here show want of familiarity with nature artists need to return to america and see her again but friends nature wears different face in italy from what she does in america you not want to see her italian face it is very glorious we thought it was the aim of art to reproduce all forms of nature and that you would not be sorry to have transcripts of what you have not always round you american art is not necessarily reproduction of american nature hicks has made charming picture of familiar life which those who can not believe in italian daylight would not tolerate i am not sure that all eyes are made in the same manner i have known those who declare they see nothing remarkable in these skies these hues and always complain when they are reproduced in picture i have yet seen picture by cropsey on an italian subject but his sketches from scotch scenes are most poetical and just presentations of those lakes those mountains with their mourn ing veils he is an artist of great promise cranch has made picture ogden haggerty of ﬁne of old colonna story i wish he would write ballad about it too there is plenty of material but to return to the jesuits one swallow does not make summer nor am have seen so much and barbarous greed of gain in all classes of foolish to attach undue importance to the demand by those who have dared to appropriate peculiarly to themselves the sacred name of jesus from poor orphan and the soul of one of their own order of seven baiocchi more but i have always been satisﬁed from the very nature of their institutions that the current prejudice against them must be correct these institutions are calculated to harden the heart and destroy entirely that truth which is the conservative principle in character their inﬂuence is and must be always against the free progress of humanity the more i see of its working the more i feel how pernicious it is and were i european to object should i lend myself with more ardor than to the extirpation of this cancer true disband the jesuits there would still remain jesuitical men but singly they would have inﬁnitely less power to work mischief the inﬂuence of the oscurantist foe has shown itself more and more plainly in rome during the last four or ﬁve weeks false miracle is devised the madonna del popolo who has her handsome house very near has cured paralytic youth who in fact was never diseased and appearing to him in vision takes occasion to criticise severely the measures of the pope rumors of tumult in one quarter are circulated to excite it in another inﬂammatory handbills are put up in the night but the romans thus far resist all intrigues of the foe to excite them to bad conduct on ear day however success was

europe by margaret fuller ossoli https and not it might truly have been because the pope was unwell but in the most ungracious irritating manner possible by saying he is tired of these things he is afraid of disturbance then the people being naturally excited and angry the governor sent word to the pope that there was excitement without letting him know why and had the guards doubled on the posts the most absurd rumors were circulated among the people that the cannon of angelo were to be pointed on them but they with that singular discretion which they show now instea d of rising their enemies had hoped went to ask counsel of their lately appointed senator corsini he went to the pope found him ill entirely ignorant of what was going on and much distressed when he heard it he declared that the people should be satisﬁed and since they had not been allowed to come to him he would go to them accordingly the next day though rainy and of searching cold like that of scotch mist we had all our windows thrown open and the red and yellow tapestries hung out he passed through the principal parts of the city the people throwing themselves on their knees and crying out holy father desert us forget us listen to our enemies the pope wept often and replied fear nothing my people my heart is yours at last seeing how ill he was they begged him to go in and he returned to the quirinal the present tribune of the people far rule in the heart is concerned ciceronacchio following his carriage i shall give some account of this man in another letter the moment the difﬁculties are healed they will be whenever the pope directly shows himself to the people then his generous affectionate heart will always act and act on them dissipating the clouds which others have been toiling to darken in speaking of the intrigues of these emissaries of the power of darkness i will mention that there is report here that they are trying to get an italian consul the united states and one in the employment of the jesuits this rumor seems ridiculous yet it is true that beecher panic about catholic inﬂuence in the united states is not quite unfounded and that there is considerable hope of establishing new dominio n there i hope the united states will appoint italian catholic to consulship the representative of the united states should be american our national character and interests are peculiar and can not be ﬁtly represented by foreigner unless like ombrossi of florence he has passed part of his youth in the united states it would indeed be well if our government paid attention to qualiﬁcation the ofﬁce in the candidate and not to pretensions founded on partisan service appointing only men of probity who would not stain the national honor in the sight of europe it would be wise also not to select men entirely ignorant of foreign manners customs ways of thinking or even of any language in which to communicate with foreign society making the country ridiculous by all sorts of blunders but were pity if sufﬁcient number of americans could not be found who are honest have some knowledge of europe and gentlemanly tact and are able at least to speak french to return to the pope although the shadow that has fallen on his popularity is in great measure the work of his enemies yet there is real cause it too his conduct in deposing time one of the censors about the banners of the 15th of december his speech to the council the same day his extreme displeasure at the sympathy of few persons with the triumph of the swiss diet because it was protestant triumph and above all his speech to the consistory so deplorably weak in thought and absolute in manner show man less strong against domestic than foreign foes instiga ted by generous humane heart to advance but fettered by the prejudices of educa tion and terribly afraid to be or seem to be less the pope of rome in becoming reform prince and father to the fatherless i insert passage of this speech which seems to say that whenever there shall be collision betw een the priest and the reformer the priest shall triumph another subject there is which profoundly afﬂicts and harasses our mind it is not certainly unknown to you venerable brethren that many enemies of catholic truth have in our times especially directed their efforts by the desire to place certain monstrous pg 281 pg 282 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https of opinion on par with the doctrine of christ or to blend them therewith seeking to propagate more and more that impious system of indiffer ence toward all religion whatever and lately some have been found dreadful to narrate who have offered such an insult to our name and apostolic dignity slanderously to represent us participators in their folly and favorers of that most iniquitous system above named these have been pleased to infer from the counsels certainly not foreign to the sanctity of the catholic religion which in certain affairs pertaining to the civil exercise of the pontiﬁc sway we had benignly embraced the increase of public prosperity and good and also from the pardon bestowed in clemency upon certain persons subject to that sway in the very beginning of our pontiﬁcate that we had such benevolent sentiments towa rd every description of persons to believe that not only the sons of the church but others also remaining aliens from catholic unity are alike in the way of salvation and may attain eternal life words are wanting to us from horror to repel this new and atrocious calumny against us it is true that with intimate affection of heart we love all mankind but not otherwise than in the charity of god and of our lord jesus christ who came to seek and to save that which had perished who wisheth that all men should be saved and come to knowledge of the truth and who sent his disciples through the whole world to preach the gospel to every creature declaring that those who should believe and be baptized should be saved but those who should not believe should be condemned let those therefore who seek salvation come to the pillar and support of the truth which is the church them come that is to the true church of christ which possesses in its bishops and the supreme head of all the roman pontif f never succession of apostolic authority and which nothing has ever been more zealous than to preach and with all care preserve and defend the doctrine announced the mandate of christ by his apostles which church afterwar d increased from the time of the apostles in the midst of every species of difﬁculties and ﬂourished throughout the whole world radiant in the splendor of miracles ampliﬁed by the blood of martyrs ennobled by the virtues of confessors and virgins corroborated by the testimony and most sapient writings of the fathers it still ﬂourishes throughout all lands refulgent in perfect unity of the sacraments of faith and of holy discipline we who though unworthy preside in this supreme chair of the apostle peter in which christ our lord placed the foundat ion of his church have at time abstained from any cares or toils to bring through the grace of christ himself those who are in ignorance and error to this sole way of truth and salvation let those whoever they be that are adverse remember that heaven and earth shall pass away but nothing can ever perish of the words of christ nor be chang ed in the doctrine which the catholic church received to guard defend and publish from him next to this we can not but speak to you venerable brethren of the bitterness of sorrow by which we were affected on seeing that few days since in this our fair city the fortress and centre of the catholic religion it proved possible to ﬁnd few indeed and frantic laying aside the very sense of humanity and to the extreme disgust and indignation of other citizens of this town were not withheld by horror from triumphing openly and publicly over the most lamentable intestine war lately excited among the helvetic people which truly fatal war we sorrow over from the depths of our heart well considering the blood shed by that nation the slaughter of brothers the atrocious daily recurring and fatal discords hatreds and dissensions which usually redound among nations in consequence especially of civil wars the detriment which we learn the catholic religion has suffered and fear it may yet suffer in consequence of this and ﬁnally the deplorable acts of sacrilege committed in the ﬁrst conﬂict which our soul shrinks from narrating it is probably on account of these fears of pius ix lest he should be called protestant pope that the roman journals thus far in translating the american address to the pope have not dared to add any comment pg 283 pg 284 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https if the heart the instincts of this good man have been beyond his thinking powers that only shows him the providential agent to work out aims beyond his ken wave has been set in motion which can not stop till it casts up its freight upon the shore and if pius ix does not suffer himself to be surrounded by dignitaries and see the signs of the times through the eyes of others he does not suffer the knowledge he had of general society simple prelate to become incrusted by the ignorance habitual to princes can not fail long to be most important agent in fashioning new and better this beautiful injured land i will now give another document which may be considered

errors by all the foolish conjectures which the police by system and many men of my party through want of knowledge or poverty of intellect have heaped upon it i am not subverter nor communist nor man of blood nor hater nor intolerant nor exclusive adorer of system or of form imagined by my mind i adore god and an idea which seems to of god an angel of moral unity and of progressive civilization

our party if the people shou ld rise in violent attack against the selﬁshness and bad government of their rulers i while rendering homage to the right of the people shall be among the ﬁrst to prevent the excesses and the vengeance which long slavery has prepared i believe profoundly in religious principle supreme above all social ordinances in divine order which we ought to seek to realize here on earth in law in providential design which we all ought according to our powers to study and to promote i believe in the inspiration of my immortal soul in the teaching of humanity which shouts to through the deeds and words of all its saints incessant progress all through the work of all my brothers toward common moral amelioration toward the fulﬁlment of the divine law and in the great history of humanity i have studied the history of italy and have found there rome twice directress of the world st through the emperors later through the popes i have found there that every manifestation of italian life has also been manifestation of european life and that always when italy fell the moral unity of europe began to fall apart in analysis in doubt in anarchy i believe in yet another manifestation of the italian idea and i believe that another european world ought to be revealed from the eternal city that had the capitol and has the vatican and this faith has not abandoned ever through years poverty and griefs which god alone knows in these few words lies all my being all the secret of my life i may err in the intellect but the heart has always remained pure i have never lied through fear or hope and i speak to you i should speak to god beyond the sepulchre pg 285 pg 286 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller

creeds now existing you can put yourself at the head of this developm ent if god wills that such creeds shou ld revive you can make them revive if god wills that they should be transformed that

breaking out inevitable nor can human power prevent it nor i it must be said frankly most holy father address to you these words because i doubt in the least of our destiny or because i believe you the sole the indispensable means of the enterprise the unity of italy is work of god part of the design of providence and of all even of those who show themselves most satisﬁed with local improvements and who less sincere than i wish to make them means of attaining their own aims it will be fulﬁlled with you or without you but i address you because i believe you worthy to take the initiative in work so vast because your putting yourself at the head of it would much abridge the road and diminish the dangers the pg 289 pg 290 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by

other countries and place her immediately at the head of european progress because it is in your power to cause that god and the peop le terms too often fatally disjoined should meet at once in beautiful and holy harmony to direct the fate of nations if i could be near you i would invoke from god power to convince you by gesture by accent by tears now i can only conﬁd to the paper the cold corpse it were of my thought nor can i ever have the certainty that you have read and meditated moment what i write but i feel an imperious necessity of fulﬁlling this duty toward italy and you and whatsoever you may think of it i shall ﬁnd myself more in peace with my conscience having thus addressed you believe most holy father in the feelings of veneration and of high hope which professes you

its fervent truth thousand petty interruptions have prevented my completing this letter till now the hour of closing the mail the steamer is so near i shall not have time to look over it either to see what i have written or make slight corrections however i suppose it represents the feelings of the last few days and shows that without having lost any of my conﬁdence in the italian movement the ofﬁce of the pope in promoting it has shown narrower limits and sooner than i had expected this does not at all weaken my personal feeling toward this excellent man whose heart i have seen in his face and can never doubt it was necessary to be great thinker great genius to compete with the difﬁculties of his position i never supposed he was that i am only disappointed that his good heart has not carried him on little farther with regard to the reception of the american address it is only the roman press that is so timid the private expressions of pleasure have been very warm the italians say the americans are indeed our brothers it remains to be seen when pius ix receives it whether the man the reforming prince or the pope is uppermost at that moment footnote k return this letter was printed in paris to be circulated in italy prefatory note signed by friend of mazzini states that the original was known to have reached the hands of the pope the hope is expressed that the publication of this letter though without the authority of its writer will yet not displease him those who are deceived to his plans and motives will thus learn his true purposes and feelings and the

proximate cause was an attack made upon his brother house by paradisi now imprisoned in the castle of angelo pending law process proof of his accusations don carlo had been ill before and the painful agitation cause d by these circumstances decided his fate the public had been by means displeased at this inquiry into the conduct of don alessandro torlonia believing that his assumed muniﬁcence is in this case literally robbery of peter to pay paul and that all he gives to rome is taken from rome but i sympathized less with the affectionate indignation of his brother too good man to be made the conﬁdant of wrong or have eyes it if such exist thus in the poetical justice which does not fail to be done in the prose narrativ of life while men hastened the moment cry was raised against don

shall rise and bloom again from present corruption to immo rtal purity if don carlo had been thinker man of strong intellect might have devised means of using his money to more radical advantage than

remonstrated the pope was ﬁrm and at last is said to have answered with sharp reproof the past the cardinal contained himself in the audience but going out literally suffocated with the rage he had suppressed the bad blood his bad heart had been so long making rushed to his head and he died on his return home men laughed and proposed that all the widows he had deprived of maintenance should

died of rage because he could longer devour the public goods and this is the last echo of his requiem the pope is anxious to have at least men in places of power men of much ability it would seem are not to be had his last prime minister was man said to have energy good dispositions but thinking power the cardinal bofondi whom he has taken now is said to be man of scarce any ability there being

the disturbances of the 1st of january here were answered by similar excitements in leghorn and genoa produced by the same hidden and malignant foe at the same time the austrian government in milan organized an attempt to rouse the people to revolt with view to arrests and other measures calculated to stiﬂe the spirit of independence they know to be latent there in this iniquitous attempt they murdered eighty persons yet the citizens on their guard refused them the desired means of ruin and they were forced to retractions impuden tly vile their attempts had been the viceroy proclaimed that

the bambino the church was entirely full mostly with contadini and the poorer people absorbed in their devotions one man near never raised his head or stirred from his knees to see anything he seemed

seeing catholicism here in italy i can not conceive there was once soul in the religion while the blood of its martyrs was yet fresh upon the ground but that soul was always too much encumbered with the remains of pagan habits and customs that soul is now quite ﬂed elsewhere and in the splendid catafalco watched by so many white and men would they let it be opened nothing would be found but bones

exceptional charac ters the exercises were in all the different languages under the sun it would have been exceedingly interesting to hear them one after the other each in its peculiar cadence and inﬂection but much of the individual expression was taken away by that general false academic tone which is sure to pervade such exhibitions where young men speak who have yet nothing to say it would have been different indeed if we could have heard natives of all those countries who were animated by real feelings real wants still it was interesting particularly the language and music of kurdistan and the beauty of the greek after the ruder dialects among those who appeared to the best advantage were several blacks and the majesty of the latin hexameters was conﬁded to blooded guinea negro who acquitted himself better than any other i heard i observed too the perfectly gentlemanly appearance of these young men and that they had nothing of that cuffy swagger by which those freed from servile

we saw her with her lamb in pictures the horses are being blessed by antonio and under his harmonizing inﬂuence are afterward driven through the city twelve and even twenty in hand they are harnessed into light wagons and men run beside them to guard against accident in case the good inﬂuence of the saint should fail this morning came the details of infamous attempts by the austrian police to exasperate the students of pavia the way is to send persons to smoke cigars in forbidden places who insult those who are obliged to tell them to desist these traps seem particularly shocking when laid ﬁery and sensitive young men they succeeded the students were lured into combat and number left dead and wounded on both sides the university is shut up the inhabitants of pavia and milan have put on mourning even at the theatre they wear it the milanese will not walk in that quarter where the blood of their citizens has been so wantonly shed they have demanded legal investigati on of the conduct of the ofﬁcials at piacenza similar attempts have been made to excite the italians by smoking in their faces and crying long live the emperor it is worthy homage to pay to the austrian crown of fering

revolt and that even the women quelled the troops on them stones furniture boiling oil such means of warfare the household may easily furnish to thoughtful matron ﬁrst stroke of apoplexy from which the loss of good deal of bad blood relieved him his mind apparently having become clearer thereby he has offered his subjects an amnesty and terms of reform which it is hoped will arrive before his troops have begun to bombard the cities in obedience to earlier orders comes also the news that the french chamber of peers propose an address to the king echoing back all the falsehoods of his speech including those upon reform and the enormous one that the peace of europe is now assured but that some members have worthily opposed this address and spoken truth in an honorable manner also that the infamous sacriﬁce of the poor little queen of spain puts on more tragic colors that it is pretended she has epilep sy and she is to be made to renounce the throne which indeed has been terriﬁc curse to her and heaven and earth have looked calmly on while the king of france has managed all this with the most unnatural of mothers january this morning comes the plan of the address of the chamber of deputies to the king it contains some passages that are keenest satire upon him also some remarks which have been made some words of truth spoken in the chamber of peers that must have given him some twinges of nervous shame he read guizot speech on the affairs of switzerland shows his usual shabbin ess and falsehood surely never prime minister stood in so mean position he one like metternich seems noble and manly in comparison if there is cruel atheistical treacherous policy there needs not at least continual evasion to avoid declaring in words what is so glaringly manifest in fact pg 301 pg 302 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https is news that the revolution has now broken out in naples that neither sicilians nor neapolitans will trust the king but demand his abdication and that his bad demon coclo has ﬂed carrying two hundred thousand ducats of gold but in particulars this news is not yet sure though doubt there is truth at the bottom aggressions on the part of the austrians continue in the north the advocates tommaso and manin light thus reﬂected on the name of the last doge having dared to declare formally the

faith than rome in her greatest days ever knew how much has happened since i wrote first the victorious resistance of sicily and the revolution of naples this has led us yet only to but even these have been of great use to the progress of italy the neapolitans will probably have to get rid at last of the stupid crow ned head who is at present their puppet but their bearing with him has led to the wiser sovereigns granting these constitutions which if eventually inadequate to the wants of italy will be so useful are so needed to educate her to seek better completer forms of administration pg 303 pg 304 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https the midst of all this serious work came the play of carnival in which there was much less interest felt than usual but enough to dazzle and captivate stranger one thing however has been omitted in the description of the roman carnival that it rains every day almost every day came on violent rain just the tide of gay masks was fairly engaged in the corso this would have been well worth bearing once or twice the sake of seeing the admirable good humor of this people those who had laid out all their savings in the gayest thinnest dresses on carriages and chairs the corso found themselves suddenly drenched their ﬁnery spoiled and obliged to ride and sit shivering all the afternoon but they never murmured never scolded never stopped throwing their ﬂowers their strength of constitution is wonderful while i in my shawl and boa was coughing at the open window from the moment i inhaled the wet sepulchral air the of the house had taken off their woollen gowns and arrayed in white muslins and roses sat in the drenched street beneath the drenching rain quite happy and have suf fered nothing in consequence the romans renounced the moccoletti ostensibly an expression of sympathy the sufferings of the milanese but really because at that time there was great disturbance about the jesuits and the government feared that difﬁculties would arise in the excitement of the evening but since we have had this entertainment in honor of the revolutions of france and austria and nothing could be more beautiful the fun usually consists in all the people blowing one another lights out we had not this all the little tapers were left to blaze and the long corso swarmed with tall lights crept out over the surface of all the houses and such merry little twinkling lights laughing and ﬂickering with each slightest movement of those who held them up and down the corso they twinkled they swarmed they streamed while surge of gay triumphant sound ebbed and ﬂowed beneath that glittering surface here and there danced men carrying aloft moccoli and clanking chains

termination of their diversion closed of their own accord and with one consent singing the hymns pio by nine and retired peacefully to their homes to dream of hopes they yet scarce understand this happened last week the news of the dethronement of louis philippe reached us just after the close of the carnival it was just year from my leaving paris i did not think i looked with such disgust on the empire of sham he had established in france and saw the soul of the people imprisoned and held fast in an iron vice that it would burst its chains so soon whatever be the result france has done gloriously she has declared that she will not be satisﬁed with pretexts while there are facts in the world to stop her march is vain attempt though the onward path be dangerous and difﬁcult it is vain to cry peace peace when there is peace the news from france in these days sounds ominous though still vague it would appear that the political is being merged in the social struggle it is well

against the other and to corrupt them all fearing every noble instinct hostile to every grand idea devoted to the material interests of an oligarchy of princes spoiled by senseless education of

people and with it the progress of mankind he returns like w ordsworth great man to pg 319 pg 320 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https what he foresaw he will see his predictions accomplishing yet long time mazzini has mind far in advance of his times in general and his nation in particular mind that will be best revered and understood when the illustrious gioberti shall be remembered pompous verbose charlatan with just talent enough to catch the echo from the advancing wave of his day but without any true sight of the wants of man at this epoch and yet mazzini sees not all he aims at political emancipation but he sees not perhaps would deny the bearing of some events which even now begin to work their way of this more anon but not nor in the small print of the tribune sufﬁce it to say i allude to that of which the cry of communism the systems of fourier are but forerunners mazzini sees much already milan where he is he has probabl y this day received the intelligence of the accomplishment of his foresight implied in his letter to the pope which angered italy by what was thought its tone of irreverence and doubt some six months since is the 7th of may i had throw n aside this letter begun the 19th of april from sense that there was something coming that would supersede what was then to say this something has appeared in form that will cause deep sadness to good hearts everywhere good and loving hearts that long human form which they can revere will be unprepared and time must suffer much from the ﬁnal dereliction of pius ix to the cause of freedom progress and of the war he was fair image and men went nigh to idolize it this they can more though they may be able to ﬁnd excu his feebleness love his good heart less than before and draw instruction from the causes that have produced his failure more valuable than his success would have been pius one can doubt who has looked on him has good and pure heart but it needed also not only strong but great mind to compr ehend his trust and to the same keep faithful with singleness of aim highly esteemed friend in the united states wrote to express distaste to some observations in letter of mine to the tribune on ﬁrst seeing the pontif f year ago observing to say that he had not the expression of great intellect was uncalled alas far from it it was an observation that rose inevitably on knowing something of the task before pius and the hopes he had excited the problem he had to solve was one of such difﬁculty that only one of those minds the rare product of ages the redemption of mankind could be equal to its solution the question that inevitably rose on seeing him was is he such one the answer was immediately negative but at the same time he had such an aspect of true benevolence and piety that hope arose that heaven would act through him and impel him to measures wise beyond his knowledge this hope was conﬁrmed by the calmness he showed at the time of the conspiracy of july and the occupation of ferrara by the austrians tales were told of simple wisdom of instinct which he obeyed in opposition to the counsels of all his cardinals everything went on well time but tokens of indubitable weakness were shown by the pope in early acts of the winter in the removal of censor at the suggestion of others in his speech to the consistory in his answer to the ﬁrst address of the council in these he declared that when there was conﬂict between the priest and the man he always meant to be the priest and that he preferred the wisdom of the past to that of the future still times went on bending his predeterminations to the call of the moment he acted wiselier than he intended instance three weeks after declaring he would not give constitution to his people he gave it sop to cerberus indeed poor thing that will by and by have to give place to something more legitimate but which served its purpose at the time declaration of rights the people when the news of the revolution of vienna arrived the pope himself cried viva pio nono and this pg 321 pg 322 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https of truth in one so humble though opposed to his formal declarations was received by his people with that immediate assent which truth commands the revolution of lombardy followed the troops of the line were sent thither the volunteers rushed to accompany them in the streets of rome was read the proclamation of charles albert in which he styles himself the servant of italy and of pius ix the priests preached the war and justly crusade the pope blessed their banners nobody dreamed or had cause to dream that these movements had not his full sympathy and his name was in every form invoked the chosen instrument of god to inspir italy to throw off the oppressive yoke of the foreigner and recover her rights in the civilized world at the same time however the pope was seen to act with great blindness in the affair of the jesuits the other states of italy drove them out by main force resolved not to have in the midst of the war foe and spy in the camp rome wished to the same but the pope rose in their defence he talked if they were assailed religious body when he could not fail like everybody else to be aware that they were dreaded and hated solely agents of despotism he demanded that they should be assailed only by legal means when none such were available the end was in always the worst possible he would not entirely yield and the people would not at all the order was ostensibly dissolved but great part of the jesuits really remain here in disguise constant source of irritation and mischief which if still greater difﬁculties had not arisen would of itself have created enough meanwhile in the earnestness of the clergy about the pretended loss of the head of andrew in the ceremonies of the holy week which at this juncture excited real interest was much matter thought to the calm observer to the restlessness of the new wine the old bottles being heard to crack on every side and hour by hour thus affairs went on from day to day pope kissing the foot of the brazen jupiter and blessing palms of straw at peter the circolo romano erecting itself into kind of jacobin club dictating programmes an italian and choosing committees to provide the expenses of the war the civic guard arresting people who tried to make mobs if famishing and being searched were found well provided both with arms and money the ministry at their wits end with their trunks packed up ready to be off at moment warning the report it is not yet known whether true or false that one of the roman civic guard artist engaged in the war of lombardy had been taken and hung by the austrians brigand roused the people to sense of the position of their friends and they went to the pope to demand that he should take decisive stand and declare war against the austrians the pope summoned consistory the people waited anxiously expressions of his were reported if the troops ought not to have thought of leaving the front ier while every man woman and child in rome knew and every letter and bulletin declared that all their thought was to render active aid to the cause of italian independence this anxious doubt however had not prepared at all the excess to which they were to be disappointed the speech of the pope declared that he had never any thought of the great results which had followed his actions that he had only intended local reforms such had previously been suggested by the potentates of europe that he regretted the misuse which had been made of his name and wound up by lamenting over the war to every italian heart the best and holiest cause in which ages they had been called to embark their hopes if it was something offensive to the spirit of religion and which he would fain see hushed up and its motives smoothed out and ironed over momentary stupefaction followed this astounding performance succeeded by passion of indignation in which the words traitor and imbecile were associated with the name that had been so dear to his people this again yielded to settled grief they felt that he pg 323 pg 324 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https betrayed but traitor timid and weak but still sovereign whom they had adored and man who had brought them much good which could not be quite destroyed by his wishing to disown it even of this fact they had time to stop and think the necessity was too imminent of obviating the worst consequences of this ill and the ﬁrst thought was to prevent the news leaving rome to dishearten the provinces and army before they had tried to persuade the pontif f to wiser resolves or if this could not be to supersede his power i can not repress my admiration at the gentleness clearness and good sense with which the roman people acted under these most difﬁcult circumstances it was aston ishing to see the clear understanding which anima ted the crowd one man and the decision with which they acted to effect their purpose wonderfully has this people been developed within year the pope besieged by deputations who mildly but ﬁrmly showed him that if he persisted the temporal power must be placed in other hands his ears ﬁlled with reports of cardinals such venerable persons he pathetically styles them would not yield in spirit though compelled to in act after two days struggle he was obliged to place the power in the hands of the persons most opposed to him and nominally acquiesce in their proceedings while in his second procla mation very touching from the sweetn ess of its tone he shows ﬁxed misunderstandin g of the cause at issue which leaves hope of his ever again being more than name or an efﬁgy in their af fairs his people were much affected and entirely laid aside their anger but they would not be blinded to the truth while gladly returning to their accustomed habits of affectionate homage toward the pontif f their unani mous sense and resolve is thus expressed in an able pamphlet of the day such in every respect would have been deemed impossible to the rome of 1847 from the last allocution of pius result two facts of extreme gravity he entire separation between the spiritual and temporal power and the express refus al of the pontif f to be chief of an italian republic but far from drawing hence reason discouragement and grief who looks well at the destiny of italy may bless providence which breaks or changes the instrument when the work is completed and by secret and inscrutable ways conducts us to the fulﬁlment of our desires and of our hopes if pius ix refuses the italian people does not therefore draw back nothing remains to the free people of italy except to unite in one constitutional kingdom founded on the largest basis and if the chief who by our assemblies shall be called to the highest honor either declines or does not answer worthily the people will take care of itself italians down with all emblems of private and partial interests let us unite under one single banner the tricolor and if he who has carried it bravely thus far lets it fall from his hand we will take it one from the other millions of us and till the last of us shall have perished under the banner of our redemption the stranger shall not return into italy viva italy viva the italian people m these events make indeed crisis the work begun by napoleon is ﬁnished there will never more be really pope but only the efﬁgy or simulacrum of one the loss of pius ix is the moment great one his name had real moral weight was trumpet appeal to sentiment it is not the same with any man that is left there is not one that can be truly leader in the roman dominion not one who has even great intellectual weight the responsibility of events now lies wholly with the people and that wave of thought which has begun to pervade them sovereigns and statesmen will go where they are pg 325 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https it is probable power will be changed continually from hand to hand and government become to all intents and purposes representative italy needs now quite to throw aside her stupid king of naples who hangs like dead weight on her movements the king of sardinia and the grand duke of tuscany will be trusted while they keep their present course but who can feel sure of any sovereign now that louis philippe has shown himself so mad and pius ix so blind it seems if fate was at work to bewilder and cast down the dignities of the world and democratize society at blow in rome there is now anchor except the good sense of the people it seems impossible that collision should not arise between him who retains the name but not the place of sovereign and the provisional government which calls itself ministry the count mamiani its new head is man of reputation writer but untried yet leader or statesman should agitations arise the pope can longer calm them by one of his fatherly looks all lies in the future and our best hope must be that the power which has begun so great work will ﬁnd due means to end it and make the year 1850 year of true jubilee to italy year not merely of pomps and tributes but of recognized rights and intelligent joys year of real peace founded not on compromise and the lying etiquettes of diplomacy but on truth and justice then this sad disappointment in pius ix may be forgotten or while all that was lovely and generous in his life is prized and reverenced deep instruction may be drawn from his errors to the inevitable dangers of priestly or princely environment and higher knowledge may elevate nobler commonwealth than the world has yet known hoping this i remain at present here should my hopes be dashed to the ground it will not change my faith but the struggle its manifestation is to of vital interest my friends write to urge my return they talk of our country the land of the future it is so but that spirit which made it all it is of value in my eyes which gave all of hope with which i can sympathize that future is more alive here at present than in america my country is at present spoiled by prosperity stupid with the lust of gain soiled by crime in its willing perpetuation of slavery shamed by an unjust war noble sentiment much forgotten even by individuals the aims of politicians selﬁsh or petty the literature frivolous and venal in europe amid the teachings of adversity nobler spirit is struggling spirit which cheers and animates mine i hear earnest words of pure faith and love i see deeds of brotherhood this is what makes my america i not deeply distrust my country she is not dead but in my time she sleepeth and the spirit of our fathers ﬂames more but lies hid beneath the ashes it will not be so long bodies can not live when the soul gets too overgrown with gluttony and falsehood but it is not the making president out of the mexican war that would make wish to come back here things are before my eyes worth recording and if i can not help this work i would gladly be its historian may returning from little tour in the alban mount where everything looks so glorious this glorious spring i ﬁnd temporary quiet the pope brothers have come to sympathize with him the crowd sighs over what he has done presents him with great bouquets of ﬂowers and reads anxiously the news from the north and the proclamations of the new ministry meanwhile the nightingales sing every tree and plant is in ﬂower and the sun and moon shine if paradise were already on earth i go to one of the villas to dream it is so beneath the pale light of the stars footnote m return close of comment by pio angelo fierortino on the allocution of pius ix spoken in the secret consistory of 29th april 1848 dated italy 30th april 1st year of the redemption of italy pg 326 pg 327 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https letter xxv review of the course of pius people disappointed the monuments in milan naples king of naples and his calamities of the italian summer among the mountains of italy rome december 2 i have not written six months and within that time what changes have taken place on this side the great water of how great dramatic interest historically bearing inﬁnitely important ideally easy is the descent in i wrote last when pius ix had taken the ﬁrst stride on the downward road he had proclaimed himself the foe of further reform measures when he implied that italian independence was not important in his eyes when he abandoned the crowd of heroic youth who had gone to the ﬁeld with his benediction to some of whom his own hand had given crosses all the popes his predecessors had meddled with most frequently instigated war now came one who must carry out literally the doctrines of the prince of peace when the war was not wrong or the aggrandizement of individuals but to redeem national to redeem human rights from the grasp of foreign oppression i said some cried traitor some imbecile some wept but in the minds of all i believe at that time grief was predominant they could longer depend on him they had thought their best friend they had lost their father meanwhile his people would not submit to the inaction he urged they saw it was not only ruinous to themselves but base and treacherous to the rest of italy they said to the pope this can not be you must follow up the pledg es you have given or if you will not act to redeem them you must have ministry that will the pope after he had once declared to the contrary ought to have persisted he should have said i can not thus belie myself i can not put my name to acts i have just declared to be against my conscience the ministers of the people ought to have seen that the position they assumed was utterly untenable that they could not advance with an enemy in the background cutting off all supplies but some patriotism and some vanity exhilarated them and the pope having weakly yielded they unwisely began their impossible task mamiani their chief i esteem man under all circumstances unequal to such position man of rhetoric merely but man could have acted unless the pope had resigned his temporal power the cardinals been put under sufﬁcient check and the jesuits and emissaries of austria driven from their sad scene began the pope up more and more in his palace the crowd of selﬁsh and insidious advisers darkening round enslaved by confessor who might have been the liberator of suffering europe permitted the most infamous treacheries to be practised in his name private letters were written to the foreign powers denying the acts he outwardly sanctioned the hopes of the people were evaded or dallied with the chamber of deputies permitted to talk and pass measures which they never could get funds to put into execution legions to form and manoeuvre but never to have the arms and clothing they needed again and again the people went to the pope satisfaction they got thus plotted and thus worked the scarlet men of sin playing the hopes of italy off and on while their hope was of the miserable defeat consu mmated by still worse traitor at milan on the 6th of august but indeed what could be expected from the sword of pius pg 328 pg 329 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https when pius ix himself had thus failed in his high vocation the king of naples bombarded his city and set on the lazzaroni to rob and murder the subjects he had deluded by his pretended gift of the constitution pius proclaimed that he longed to embrace all the princes of italy he talked of peace when all knew great part of the italians there was longer hope of peace except in the sepulchre or freedom the taunting manifestos of welden are sufﬁcient comment on the conduct of the pope the government of his holiness is too weak to control his subjects singularly enough great number of romans are found ﬁghting against us contrary to the expressed will of their prince were the excuses invasions of the pontiﬁcal dominions and the robbery and insult by which they were accompanied such invasions it was said made his holiness very indignant he remonstrated against these but we ﬁnd word of remonstrance against the tyranny of the king of naples word of sympathy the victims of lombardy the suf ferings of verona vicenza padua mantua venice in the affairs of europe there are continued signs of the plan of the retrograde party to effect similar demonstrations in different places at the same hour the 15th of may was one of these marked days on that day the king of naples made use of the insurrection he had contrived to excite to massacre his people and ﬁnd an excuse recalling his troops from lombardy the same day similar crisis was hoped in rome from the declarations of the pope but that did not work at the moment exactly the foes of enfranchisement hoped however the wounds were cruel enough the roman volunteers received the astounding news that they were not to expect protection or countenance from their prince all the army stood aghast that they were longer to ﬁght in the name of pio it had been so dear so sweet to love and really reverence the head of their church so inspiring to ﬁnd their religion once in accordance with the aspirations of the soul they were to be deprived too of the aid of the disciplined neapolitan troops and their artillery on which they had counted how cunningly all this was contrived to cause dissension and dismay may easily be seen the neapolitan general pepe nobly refused to obey and called on the troops to remain with him they wavered but they are pampered army personally much attached to the king who pays them well and indulges them at the expense of his people that they may be his support against that people when in throe of nature it rises and striven its rights the same reason the sentiment of patriotism was little diffused among them in comparison with the other troops and the alternative presented was one in which it required very clear sense of higher duty to act against habit generally after wavering awhile they obeyed and returned the roman states which had received them with so many testimonials of affection and honor on their retreat were not slack to show correspondent aversion and contempt the towns would not suffer their passage the hamlets were unwilling to serve them even with ﬁre and water they were ﬁlled at once with shame and rage one ofﬁcer killed himself unable to bear it in the unreﬂecting minds of the soldiers hate sprung up the rest of italy and especially rome which will make them admirable tools of tyranny in case of civil war this was the ﬁrst great calamity of the war but apart from the treachery of the king of naples and the dereliction of the pope it was impossible it should end thoroughly well the people were in earnest and have shown themselves so brave and able to bear privation one should dare after the proofs of the summer to reiterate the taunt so unfriendly frequent on foreign lips at the beginning of the contest that the italian can boast shout and ﬂing garlands but not act the italian always showed himself noble and brave even in foreign service and is doubly so in the cause of his country but efﬁcient heads were wanting the princes were not in earnest they were looking at expediency the grand duke timid and prudent wanted to what was safest tuscany his ministry moderate and prudent would have liked to win great prize at small risk pg 330 pg 331 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https went farther than the people pulled them the king of sardinia had taken the ﬁrst bold step and the idea that treachery on his part was premeditated can not be sustained it arises from the extraordinary aspect of his measures and the knowledge that he is not incapable of treachery he proved in early youth but now it was only his selﬁshness that worked to the same results he fought and planned not italy but the house of savoy which his balbis and gioberti s had so long been prophesying was to reign supreme in the new great of italy these prophecies he more than half believed because they chimed with his ambitious wishes but he had not soul enough to realize them he trusted only in his disciplined troops he had not nobleness enough to believe he might rely at all on the sentiment of the people his troops he dared not have good generals conscious of meanness and timidity he shrank from the approach of able and earnest men he was inly afraid they would in helping italy take her and themselves out of his guardianship antonini was insulted garibaldi rejected other experienced leaders who had rushed to italy at the ﬁrst could never get employment from him to his generalship it was entirely inadequate even if he had made use of the ﬁrst favorable moments but his ﬁrst thought was not to strike blow at the austrians before they recovered from the discomﬁture of milan but to use the panic and need of his assistance to induce lombardy and venice to annex themselves to his kingdom he did not even wish seriously to get the better till this was done and when this was done it was too late the austrian army was recruited the generals had recovered their spirits and were burning to retrieve and avenge their past defeat the conduct of charles albert had been shamefully evasive in the ﬁrst months the account given by franzi ni when challenged in the chamber of deputie s at turin might be summed up thus why gentlemen what would you have every one knows that the army is in excellent condition and eager action they are often reviewed hear speeches and sometimes get medals we take places always if it is not difﬁcult i myself was present once when the troops advanced our men behave d gallantly and had the advantage in the ﬁrst skirmish but afterward the enemy pointed on us artillery from the heights and naturally we retired but to supposing that his majesty charles albert is indifferent to the success of italy in the war that is absurd he is sword of italy he is the most magnanimous of princes he is seriously occupied about the war many day i have been called into his tent to talk it over before he was up in the morning sad was it that the heroic milan the heroic venice the heroic sicily should lean on such reed this and by hurried acts equally unworthy unwise sully the glory of their shields some names indeed stand out quite free from this blame mazzini who kept up combat against folly and cowardice day by day and hour by hour with almost supernatural strength warned the people constantly of the evils which their advisers were drawing upon them he was heard then only by few but in this italia del popolo may be found many prophecies exactly fulﬁlled those of the love of phoebus during the struggles of ilium he himself in the last sad days of milan compared his lot to that of cassandra at all events his hands are pure from that what could be done to arouse lombardy he did but the moderate party unable to wean themselves from old habits the pupils of the wordy gioberti thought there could be safety unless under the mantle of prince they did not foresee that he would run away and throw that mantle on the ground tommaso and manin also were clear in their aversion to these measures and with them with all who were resolute in principle at that time great inﬂuence has followed it is said charles albert feels bitterly the imputations on his courage and says they are most ungrateful since he has exposed the lives of himself and his sons in the combat indeed there ought to be made distinction between personal and mental courage the former charles albert may possess may have too much of what this still aristocratic world calls the feelings of gentleman to shun exposing himself to chance shot now and then an entire want of mental courage he has shown the battle decisiv against him was made so by his giving up the moment fortune turned against him it is shameful to hear so many say this result was inevitable just because the material advantages were pg 332 pg 333 pg 334 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https favor of the austrians pray was never battle won against material odds it is precisely such that good leader noble man may expect to win were the austrians driven out of milan because the milanese had that advantage the austria ns would again have suffered repulse from them but the baseness of this man on whom they had been cajoled into relying baseness that deserves the pillory and on pillory will the magnanimous he was meanly called in face of the crimes of his youth and the timid selﬁshness of his middle age stand in the sight of posterity he made use of his power only to betray milan he took from the citizens all means of defence and then gave them up to the spoiler he promise d to defend them to the last drop of his blood and sold them the next minute even the paltry terms he made he has not seen maintained had the people slain him in their rage he well deserved it at their hands and all his conduct since show how righteous would have been that sudden verdict of passion of all this great drama i have much to write but elsewhere in more full form and where i can duly sketch the portraits of actors little known in america the materials are i have bought my right in them by much sympathetic suffering yet amid the blood and tears of italy is joy to see some glorious new births the italians are getting cured of mean adulation and hasty boasts they are learning to prize and seek realities the efﬁgies of straw are getting knocked down and living growing men take their places italy is being educated the future her leaders are learning that the time is past trust in princes and precedents there is hope except in truth and god her lower people are learning to shout less and think more though my thoughts have been much with the public in this struggle life i have been away from it during the summer months in the quiet valleys on the lonely mountains there personally undisturbed i have seen the glorious italian summer wax and wane the summer of southern italy which i did not see last year on the mountains it was not too hot and i enjoyed the great luxuriance of vegetation i had the advantage of having visited the scene of the war minutely last summer so that in mind i could follow every step of the campaign while around were the glorious relics of old times crumbling theatre or temple of the roman day the village of the middle ages on whose purple height shone the sun and moon of italy in changeless lustre it was great pleasure to to watch the gradual growth and change of the seasons so different from ours last year i had not leisure this quiet acquaintance now i saw the ﬁelds ﬁrst dressed in their carpets of green enamelled richly with the red poppy and blue ﬂower that sunshine how resplendent then swelled the ﬁg the grape the olive the almond and my food was of these products of this rich clime near three months i had grapes every day the last four weeks enough daily two persons cent exquisite salad two persons dinner and supper cost but cent and all other products of the region were in the same proporti on one who keeps still in italy and lives the people may really have much simple luxury very little money though both travel and to the inexperienced foreigner life in the cities are expensive letter xxvi thoughts of the italian race the seasons

335 pg 336 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https this six months of seclusion had been welcome but now i felt the need of meeting other eyes beside those so bright and so shallow of the italian peasant indeed i left what was most precious but which i could not take with n still it was compensation that i was again to see rome that almost killed with her cold breath of last winter yet still with that cold breath whispered tale of import so divine rome so beautiful so great her presence stupeﬁes and one has to withdraw to prize the treasures she has given city of the soul yes it is that the very dust magnetizes you and thousand spells have been chaining you in every careless every murmuring moment yes rome however seen thou must be still adored and every hour of absence or presence must deepen love with one who has known what it is to repose in thy arms repose whatever be the revolution s tumults panics hopes of the present day still the temper of life here is repose the great past enfolds us and the emotions of the moment can not here greatly disturb that impression from the wild shout and throng of the streets the setting sun recalls us it rests on hundred domes and temples on the campagna whose grass is rooted in departed human greatness so full of spirit that death itself seems longer cold let rest here too hest here seems possible meseems myriad lives still linger here awaiting some one great summons the rivers had burst their bounds and beneath the moon the ﬁelds round rome lay one sheet of silver entering the gate while the baggage was under examination i walked to the entrance of villa far stretched its overarching shrubberies its deep green bowers two statues with foot advanced and uplifted ﬁnger seemed to greet it was near the scene of great revels great splendors in the old time there lay the gardens of sallust where were combined palace theatre library bath and villa strange things have happened since the most attractive part of secret buried or has ﬂed to animate other forms of that part historians have rarely given hint more than they now of the truest life of our day which refuses to be embodied by the pen craving forms more mutable more eloquent than the pen can give i found rome empty of foreigners most of the english have ﬂed in affright germans and french are wanted at home czar has recalled many of his younger subjects he does not like the schooling they get here that large part of the population which lives by the visits of foreigners was suffering very much industry every reason stagnant the people were every moment becoming more exasperated by the impudent measures of the minister rossi and their mortiﬁcation at seeing rome represented and betrayed by foreign er and what foreigner pupil of guizot and louis philippe the news of the bombardment and storm of vienna had just reached rome zucchi the minister of war at once left the city to put down manifestations in the provinces and impede the entrance of the troops of the patriot chief garibaldi into bologna from the provi nces came soldiery called by rossi to keep order at the opening of the chamber of deputies he reviewed them in the face of the civic guard the press began to be restrained men were arbitrarily seized and sent out of the kingdom the public indignation rose to its height the cup overﬂowed the 15th was beautiful day and i had gone out long walk returning at night the old padrona met with her usual smile little clouded you know said she that the minister rossi has been killed roman said murdered killed yes thrust in the back wicked man surely but is that the way to punish even the wicked i can not observed philosopher sympathize under any circumstances with so immoral deed but surely the manner of doing it was great pg 337 pg 338 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https people at large were not so reﬁned in their comments either the padrona or the philosopher but soldiers and populace alike ran up and down singing blessed the hand that rids the earth of tyrant certainly the manner was great the chamber was awaiting the entranc of rossi had he lived to enter he would have found the assembly without single exception ranged upon the opposition benches his carriage approached attended by howling hissing multitude he smiled affected unconcern but must have felt relieved when his horses entered the courtyard gate of the cancelleria he did not know he was entering the place of his execution the horses stopped he alighted in the midst of crowd it jostled him if the purpose of insult he turned abruptly and received he did so the fatal blow it was dealt by resolute perhaps experienced hand he fell and spoke word more the crowd if all previously acquainted with the plan doubt most of them were issued quietly from the gate and passed through the outside crowd members among whom was he who dealt the blow dispersing in all directions two or three minutes this outside crowd did not know that anything special had happened when they did the news was at the moment received in silence the soldiers in whom rossi had trusted whom he had hoped to ﬂatter and bribe stood at their posts and said not word neither they nor any one asked who did this where is he gone the sense of the people certainly was that it was an act of summary justice on an offender whom the laws could not reach but they felt it to be indecent to shout or exult on the spot where he was breathing his last rome so long supposed the capital of christendom certainly took very pagan view of this act and the piece represented on the occasion at the theatres was the death of nero the next morning i went to the church of andrea della valle where was to be performed funeral service with ﬁne music in honor of the victims of vienna this they here the victims of every place victims of milan victims of paris victims of naples and now victims of vienna but i found the church closed the service put of f was thinking about her own victims i passed into the ripetta and entered the church of san luigi dei francesi the republican ﬂag was ﬂying at the door the young sacristan said the ﬁne musical service which this church gave formerly on philip day in honor of louis philipp would now be transferred to the republican anniversary the 25th of february i looked at the monument chateaubriand erected when here to poor girl who died last of her family having seen all the others perish round her i entered the domenichino chapel and gazed anew on the magniﬁcent representations of the life and death of cecilia she and agnes are my favorite saints i love to think of those angel visits which her husband knew by the fragrance of roses and lilies left behind in the apartment i love to think of his visit to the catacombs and all that followed in one of the pictures cecil ia she stretches out her arms toward the suffering multitude seems if an immortal fount of purest love sprung from her heart it gives very strongly the idea of an inexhaust ible love only love that is much worth thinking about leaving the church i passed along toward the piazza del popolo yellow tiber rose but not high enough to cause distress he does when in swelling mood i heard the drums beating and entering the piazza i found the troops of the line already assembled and the civic guard marching in by platoons each battalion saluted it entered by trumpets and ﬁne strain from the band of the carbineers i climbed the pincian to see better there is place so ﬁne anything of this kind the piazza del popolo it is so full of light so fair and grand the obelisk and fountain make so ﬁne centre to all kinds of groups pg 339 pg 340 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https object of the present meeting was the civic guard and troops of the line to give pledges of sympathy preparatory to going to the quirinal to demand change of ministry and of measures the ﬂag of the union was placed in front of the obelisk all present saluted it some ofﬁcials made address es the trumpets sounded and all moved toward the quirinal nothing could be gentler than the disposition of those composing the crowd they were resolved to be played with longer but threat was uttered or thought they believed that the court would be convinced by the fate of rossi that the retrograde movement it had attempted was impracticable they knew the retrograde party were ruck and hoped to use the occasion to free the pope from its meshes all felt that pius ix had fallen irrevocably from his high place the friend of progress and father of italy but still he was personally beloved and still his name so often shouted in hope and joy had not quite lost its prestige i returned to the house which is very near the quirinal on one side i could see the palace and gardens of the pope on the other the piazza barberini and street of the four fountains presently i saw the carriage of prince barberini drive hurriedly into his yard gate the footman signing to close it dischar ge of was heard and the drums of the civic guard beat to arms the padrona ran up and down crying with every round of shot jesu maria they are killing the pope poor holy father ito tito out of the window to her husband what is the matter the lord of creation disdained to reply signora pray pray ask tito what is the matter i did so i know signora nobody knows why you go on the mount and see it would be an imprudence signora nobody will go i was just thinking to go myself when i saw poor man borne by badly wounded and heard that the swiss were ﬁring on the people their doing so was the cause of whatever violence there was and it was not much the people had assembled usual at the quirinal only with more form and solemnity than usual they had taken with them several of the chamber of deputies and they sent an embassy headed by galetti who had been in the late ministry to state their wishes they received peremptory negative they then insisted on seeing the pope and pressed on the palace the swiss became alarmed and ﬁred from the windows and from the roof they did this it is said without orders but who could at the time suppose that if it had been planned to exasperate the people to blood what more could have been done it was very little was shed but the pope doubt felt great panic he heard the report of that they tried to burn door of the palace i would lay my life that he could have shown himself without the slightest danger nay that the habitual respect his presence would have prevailed and hushed all tumult he did not think so and to still it once more degraded himself and injured his people by making promises he did not mean to keep he protests now against those promises extorted by violence strange plea indeed the representative of st peter pg 341 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https is all full of the efﬁgies of those over whom violence had power there was an early pope about to be thrown into the tiber violence had power to make him say what he did not mean delicate girls men in the prime of hope and pride of power were all alike about that they could die in boiling oil roasted on coals or cut to pieces but they could not say what they did not mean these formed the true church it was these who had power to disseminate the religion of him the prince of peace who died bloody death of torture between sinner s because he never could say what he did not mean little church outside the gate of sebastian commemorates the following affecting tradition of the church peter alarmed at the persecution of the christians had gone forth to ﬂy when in this spot he saw bright ﬁgure in his path and recognized his master travelling toward rome lord he said whither goest thou i go replied jesus to die with my people peter comprehend ed the reproof he felt that he must not fourth time deny his master yet hope salvation he returned to rome to offer his life in attestation of his faith the roman catholic church has risen monument to the memory of such facts and has the present head of that church quite failed to understand their monition not all the popes have so failed though the majority have been intriguing ambitious men of the world but even the mob of in rome there is true mob of unheeding who never had thought before beyond contriving how to satisfy their animal instincts the on hearing the protest there was another pius not long since who talked in very differen t style when the french threatened him he said may with you see ﬁt but i can not consent to act against my convictions in fact the only digniﬁed course the pope to pursue was to resign his temporal power he could longer hold it on his own terms but to it he clung and the counsellors around him were men to wish him to regard that the ﬁrst of duties when the question was of waging war the independence of italy they regarded him solely the head of the church but when the demand was to satisfy the wants of his people and ecclesiastical goods were threatened with taxes then he was the prince of the state bound to maintain all the selﬁsh prerogatives of bygone days the beneﬁt of his successors poor pope how has his mind been torn to pieces in these later days it moves compassion there can be doubt that all his natural impulses are generous and kind and in more private station he would have died beloved and honored but to this he was unequal he has suffered bad men to surround him and by their misrepresentations and insidious suggestions at last entirely to cloud his mind i believe he really thinks now the progress movement tends to anarchy blood and all that looked worst in the ﬁrst french revolution however that may be i can not forgive him some of the circumstances of this ﬂight to ﬂy to naples to throw himself in the arms of the bombarding monarch blessing him and thanking his soldiery preserving that part of italy from anarchy to protest that all his promises at rome were null and void when he thought himself in safety to choose commission governing in his absence composed of men of princely blood but to character so null that everybody laughed and said he chose those who could best be spared if they were killed but they all ran away directly when rome was thus left without any government to refuse to see any deputation even the senator of rome whom he had so gladly sanctioned are the acts either of fool or foe they are not his acts to be sure but he is responsible he lets them stand such in the face of the world and weeps and prays their success more of him his day is over he has been made it seems unconsci ously an instrument of good his regrets can not destroy nor can he be made so important an instrument of these acts have not had the effect the foes of freedom hope rome remained quite cool and composed all felt that they had not demanded more than was their duty to demand and were willing to accept what might follow in few days all began to say well who would have thought it the pope the cardinals the princes are pg 342 pg 343 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https and rome is perfectly tranquil and one does not miss anything except that there are not so many rich carriages and liveries the pope may regret too late that he ever gave the people chance to make this reﬂection yet the best fruits of the movement may not ripen long time it is movement which requires radical measures clear resolute men these last yet not show themselves in rome the new tuscan ministry has three men of superior force in various ways guerazzi such are not yet to be found in rome but should she fall this time she must either advance with decision and force or fall since to stand still is impossible people have learned much ignorance and servility of thought are lessened way is paving ﬁnal triumph and my country what does she you have chosen new president from slave state representative of the mexican war

comes in the ﬁrst days or rather nights of january all the quarter of eustachio is turned into one the stalls are set out in the street and brightly lighted up these are full of cheap toys prices varying from half cent up to twenty cents the dolls which are dressed husband and wife or sometimes grouped in families are the most grotesque that can be imagined among the toys are great quantities of whistles tin trumpets and pg 346 pg 347 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https tambourines of these every man woman and child has bought one and is using it to make noise this extempore concert begins about ten and lasts till midnight the delight of the numerous children that form part of the orchestra the familiarity without the least

the hand blowing the trumpet both and spying out hundred queer things in nooks that entirely escape the roman still plays amid his serious affairs and very serious have they been this past winter the roman legions went out singing and dancing to ﬁght in lombardy and they fought less bravely that when i wrote last the pope had ﬂed guided he says by the hand of providence italy deems by the hand of austria gaëta he had already soiled his white robes and defamed himself ever by heaping benedictions on the king of naples and the bands of mercenaries whom he employs to murd er his subjects on the least sign of restlessness in their most painful position most cowar dly had been the conduct of his making promises he never meant to keep stealing away by night in the coach of foreign diplomatist protesting that what he had done was null because he had acted under fear if such protest could avail to one who boasts himself representative of christ and his apostles guardian of the legacy of the martyrs he selected band of most incapable men to face the danger he had feared himself most of these followed his example and ﬂed rome sought an interview with him to see if reconciliation were possible he refused to receive her messengers his wicked advisers calculated upon great confusion and distress inevitable on the occasion but once the hope of the bad heart was doomed to immediate disappointment rome coolly said if you desert you will not hear must act myself she threw herself into the arms of few men who had courage and calmness this crisis they bade her think upon what was to be done meanwhile avoiding every excess that could give color to calumny and revenge the people with admirable good sense comprehended and followed up this advice never was rome so truly tranquil so nearly free from gross ill this winter few words of brotherly admonition have been more powerful than all the spies dunge ons and scaffolds of gregory the hand of the omnipotent works us observed an old man whom i saw in the street selling cigars the evening before the opening of the constitutional asse mbly he was struck by the radiant beauty of the night the old people observe that there never has been such winter this which follows the establishment by the french of republic may the omens speed well host of enemies without are ready to levy war against this fering people to rivet anew their chains still there is now an obvious tide throughout europe toward better order of things and wave of it may bear italy onward to the shore the revolution like all genuine ones has been instinctive its results unexpected and surprising to the greater part of those who achieved them the waters which had ﬂowed so secretly beneath the crust of habit that many never heard their murmur unless in dreams have suddenly burst to light in full and beautiful jets all rush to drink the pure and living draught in the time of jesus the multitude had been long enslaved beneath cumbro us ritual their minds designedly darkened by those who should have enlightened them brutiﬁed corrupted amid monstrous contradictio ns and abuses yet the moment they hear word correspondent to the original nature yes it is true they cry it is spoken with authority yes it ought to be so priests ought to be better and wiser than other men if they were they would not need pomp and temporal power to command respect yes it is true we ought not to lie we should not try to impose upon one another we ought rather to prefer that our children should work honestly their bread than get it by cheating

probably would please god more than the kissing of relics we have long darkly felt that these things were so now we know it the unreality of relation between the people and the hierarchy was obvious instantly upon the ﬂight of pius he made an immense mistake then and he made it because neither he nor his cardinals were aware of the unreality they did not know that great is the force of habit truth only is imperishable the people had abhorred gregory had adored pius upon whom they looked saviour liberator ﬁnding themselves deceived had overshadowed their love still had pius remai ned here and had courage to show himself on agitating occasions his position the pope before whom they had been bred to bow his aspect which had once seemed to them full of blessing and promise like that of an angel would have still retained power probably the temporal dominion of the papacy would not have been broken up he ﬂed the people felt contempt his want of force and truth he wrote to reproach them with ingratitude they were indignant what had they to be grateful constitution to which he had not kept true an instant the institution of the national guard which he had begun to neutralize benedictions followed by such actions the desertion of the poor volunteers in the war italian independence still the people were not quite alienated from pius they felt sure that his heart was in substance good and kindly though the habits of the priest and the arts of his counsellors had led him so egregiously to falsify its dictates and forget the vocation with which he had been called many hoped he would see his mistake and return to be at one with the people among the more ignorant there was superstitious notion that he would retur n in the night of the 5th of january there were many

pius ix to our most beloved subjects from this paciﬁc abode to which it has pleased divine providence to conduct us and whence we can freely manifest our sentiments and our will we have waited testimonies of remorse from our misg uided children the sacrileges and misdeeds committed against persons attached to our service whom some have been slain others outraged in the most barbarous manner well those against our residence and our person but we have seen nothing except sterile invitation to return to our capital unaccompanied by word of condemnation those crimes or the least guaranty our security against the frauds and violences of that same company of furious men which still tyrannizes with barbarou s despotism over rome and the states of the church we also waited expecting that the protests and orders we have uttered would recall to the duties of ﬁdelity and subjec tion those who have despised and trampled upon them in the very capital of our states but instead of this new and more monstrous act of undisguised felony and of actual rebellion by them audaciously committed has ﬁlled the measure of our afﬂiction and excited at the same time our just indignation it will afﬂict the church universal we speak of that act in every respect detestable by which it has been pretended to initiate the convocation of general national assembly of the roman states by decree of the 29th of last december in order to establish new political forms the pontiﬁcal dominion adding thus iniquity to iniquity the authors and favorers of the demagogical anarchy strive to destroy the temporal authority of the roman pontif f over the dominions of holy church irrefragably established through the most ancient and solid rights and venerated recognized and sustained by all the nations and making others believe that his sovereign power can be subject to controversy or depend on the caprices of the factious we shall spare our dignity the humiliation of dwelling on all that is monstrous pg 350 pg 351 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https in that act abominable through the absurdity of its origin less than the illegality of its form and the impiety of its scope but it appertains to the apostolic authority with which however unworthy we are invested and to the responsibility which binds us by the most sacred oaths in the sight of the omnipotent not only to protest in the most energetic and efﬁcacious manner against that same act but to condemn it in the face of the universe an enormous and sacrilegious crime against our independence and sovereignty meritin g the chastisements threatened by divine and human laws we are persuaded that on receiving the impudent invitation you were full of holy indignation and will have rejected far from you this guilty and shameful provocation notwithstanding that none of you may say he has been deluded by fallacious seductions and by the preachers of subversive doctrines or ignorant of what is contriving by the foes of all order all law all right true liberty and your happiness we again raise and utter abroad our voice so that you may be more certain of the absoluteness with which we prohibit men of whatever class and condition from taking any part in the meetings which those persons may dare to call the nomination of individuals to be sent to the condemned assembly at the same time we recall to you how this absolute prohibition is sanctioned by the decrees of our predecessors and of the councils especially of the sacred of trent sect xxii chap 11 in which the church has fulminated many times her censures and especially the greater excommunication incurred without fail by any declaration of whomsoever daring to become guilty of whatsoever attempt against the temporal sovereignty of the supreme pontif f this we declare to have been already unhappily incurred by all those who have given aid to the act and others preceding intended to prejudice the same sovereignty and in other modes and under false pretexts have perturbed violated and usurped our authority yet though we feel ourselves obliged by conscience to guard the sacred deposit of the patrimony of the spouse of jesus christ conﬁded to our care by using the sword of severity given to us that purpose we can not therefore forget that we are on earth the representative of him who in exercise of his justice does not forget mercy raising therefore our hands to heaven while we to it recommend cause which is indeed more heaven than ours and while anew we declare ourselves ready with the aid of its powerful grace to drink even to the dregs the defence and glory of the catholic church the cup of persecution which he ﬁrst wished to drink the salvation of the same we shall not desist from supplicating him benignly to hear the fervent prayers which day and night we unceasingly offer the salvation of the misguided day certainly could be more joyful us than that in which it shall be granted to see return into the fold of the lord our sons from whom now we derive so much bitterness and so great tribulations the hope of enjoying soon the happiness of such day is strengthened in us by the reﬂection that universal are the prayers which united to ours ascend to the throne of divine mercy from the lips and the heart of the faithful throughout the catholic world urging it continually to change the hearts of sinners and reconduct them into the paths of truth and of justice gaëta january 6 1849 the silliness bigotry and ungenerous tone of this manifesto excited

to be slaves are accustomed to in america jesus cried an orator bade them feed his lambs if they have done so it has been to rob their ﬂeece and drink their blood why said another have we been so long

esent state of and intelligence rome evening of 20 the league between the italian states and the diet which was to establish it had been the thought of gioberti but had found the instrument at rome in mamiani the deputies were to be named by princes or parliaments their mandate to be limited by the existing institutions of the several states measures of mutual security and some modiﬁcations in the way of reform would be the utmost that could be hoped from this diet the scope of this party did not go beyond more vigorous prosecution of the war independence and the establishment of good institutions the several principalities on basis of assimilation mazzini the great radical thinker of italy was on the contrary persuaded that unity not union was necessary to this country he had taken his motto god and the people and believed in other powers he wished an italian constitutional assembly selected directly by the people and furnished with an unlimited mandate to decide what form was now required by the needs of the peninsula his own wishes certainly aimed at republic but the decision remained with the representatives of the people the thought of gioberti had been at ﬁrst the popular one he in fact was the seer of the moderate party myself i always looked upon him entirely charlatan who covered his want of all real force by the thickest embroidered mantle of words still time he corresponded with the wants of the italian mind he assailed the jesuits and was of real use by embodying the distrust and aversion that brooded in the minds of men against these most insidious and inveterate foes of liberty and progress this triumph at least he may boast that sect has been obliged to yield its extinction seems impossible of such power was the ﬁery will of loyola in the primate he had embodied the lingering hope of the catholic church pius ix had answered to the appeal had answered only to show its futility he had run through italy courier charles albert when the so falsely styled magnanimous entered pretending to save her from the stranger really hoping to take her himself his own cowardice and treachery neutralized the hope and charles albert abject in his disgrace took retrograde ministry this the country would not suffer and obliged him after while to reassume at least the position of the previous year by taking gioberti his premier but it soon became evident that the ministry of charles albert was in the same position had been that of pius ix the hand was powerless when the head was indisposed meantime the name of mazzini had echoed through tuscany from the revered lips of montanelli it reached the roman states and though at ﬁrst propagated by foreign impulse yet soon understood was welcomed congenial montanelli had nobly said addressing florence we could not regret that the realization of this project should take place in sister city still more illustrious than ours the romans took him at his word the constitutional assembly the roman states was elected with double mandate that the deputies might sit in the constitutional assembly all italy whenever the other pg 355 pg 356 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https could send theirs they were elected by universal suffrage those who listened to jesuits and moderates predicted that the project would fail of itself the people were too ignorant to make use of the liberty of suf frage but ravens are not the true prophetic birds the roman eagle recommences her ﬂight and it is from its direction only that the may draw his augury the people are certainly ignorant centuries of the worst government the neglect of popular education the enslavement of speech and the press could make them yet they have an instinct to recognize measures that are good them few weeks schooling at some popular meetings the clubs the conversations of the national guard s in their quarters or on patrol were sufﬁcient to concert measures so well that the people voted in larger proportion than at contested elections in our country and made very good choice the opening of the constitutional assembly gave occasion ﬁne procession all the troops in rome deﬁled from the campidoglio among them many bear the marks of suffering from the lombard war the banners of sicily venice and bologn waved proudly that of naples was veiled with crape i was in balcony in the piazza di venezia the palazzo di venezia that sternest feudal pile so long the of austrian machinations seemed to frown the bands each in passing struc k up the marseillaise the nephew of napoleon and garibaldi the hero of montevideo walked together deputies the deputies grave band mostly advocates or other professional men walked without other badge of distinction than the tricolored scarf i remembered the entrance of the deputies to the coun cil only fourteen months ago in the magniﬁcent carriages lent by the princes the occasion they too were mostly nobles and their liveried attendants followed carrying their scutcheons princes and councillors have both ﬂed or sunk into nothingness in those councillors was counsel will it be found in the present let us hope so what we see has much more the air of reality than all that parade of scutcheons or the pomp of dress and retinue with which the ecclesiastical court was wont to amuse the people few days after followed the proclamation of republic an immense crowd of people surrounded the palazzo della cancelleria within whose rossi fell while the debate was going on within at one in the morning of the 9th of february republic was resolved upon and the crowd rushed away to ring all the bells early next morning i rose and went forth to observe the republic over the quirinal i went through the forum to the capitol there was nothing to be seen except the magniﬁcent calm emperor the tamers of horses the fountain the trophies the lions usual among the marbles living ﬁgures few dirty bold women and murillo boys in the sun just usual i passed into the corso there were men in the liberty cap course the lowest and vilest had been the ﬁrst to assume it all the horrible beggars persecuting impudently usual i met some english all their comfort was it would not last month they hoped to see all these fellows shot yet the english clergyman more mild and legal only hopes to see them the ministry deputies hung carlyle would be delighted with his countrymen they are entirely ready and anxious to see cromwell italy they too think when the people starve it is matter what happens in the back parlor what signiﬁes that if there is order in the front how dare the people make noise to disturb us yawning at billiards i met an american he had conﬁdence in the republic why because he had conﬁdence in the people why becau they were not like our people ah jonathan and john but i must say the italian has decided advantage over you in the power of quickly feeling generous sympathy well some other things which i have not time now to particularize i have memoranda from you both in my at last the procession mounts the campidoglio it is all dressed with banners the tricolor surmounts the palace of the senator the senator himself has ﬂed the deputies mount the steps and one of them reads in clear friendly voice the following words pg 357 pg 358 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https fundament al decree of the constitutional assembl y of rome art papacy has fallen in fact and in right from the temporal government of the roman state art roman pontif f shall have all the necessary guaranties independence in the exercise of his spiritual power art form of government of the roman state shall be pure democracy and will take the glorious name of roman republic art roman republic shall have with the rest of italy the relations exacted by common nationality between each of these expressive sentences the speaker paused the great bell of the capitol gave forth its solemn melodies the cannon answered while the crowd shouted viva la republica v iva italia the imposing grandeur of the spectacle to gave new force to the emotion that already swelled my heart my nerves thrilled and i longed to see in some answering glance spark of rienzi little of that soul which made my country what she is the american at my side remained impassive receiving all his birthright from triumph of democracy he was quite indifferent to this manifestation on this consecrated spot passing the winter in rome to study art he was insensible to the artistic beauty of the scene ensible to this new life of that spirit from which all the forms he gazes at in galleries emanated he did not see the use of these popular demonstrations again i must mention remark of his specimen of the ignorance in which americans usually remain during their ﬂighty visits to these scenes where they associate only with one another and i it the rather this seemed really thoughtful intelligent man vain vulgar triﬂer he said the people seem only to be looking on they take part what people said i why these around us there is other people there are few beggars and the others are only soldiers soldiers the civic guard all the decent men in rome thus it is that the american on many points becomes more ignorant coming abroad because he attaches some value to his crude impressions and frequent blunders it is not thus that any can be gathered from foreign gardens without modest scrutiny patient study and observation he spends his money and goes home with new coat perhaps but mind befooled rather than instructed it is necessary to speak the languages of these countries and know personally some of their inhabitants in order to form any accurate impressions the ﬂight of the grand duke of tuscan y followed in imitation of his great exemplar he promised and smiled to the last deceiving montanelli the pure and sincere at the very moment he was about to enter his carriage into the belief that he persevered in his assent to the liberal movement his position was certainly very difﬁcult but he might have left it like gentleman like man of honor was pity to destroy so lightly the good opinion the tuscans had of him now tuscany meditates union with rome pg 359 pg 360 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https charles albert is ﬁlled with alarm he is indeed betwixt two ﬁres gioberti has published one of his prolix weak addresses in which he says that in the beginning of every revolution one must ﬁx limit beyond which he will not go that himself he has done it are passing beyond his mark and he will not go any farther of the want of thought of insight into historic and all other truths which distinguishes the illustrious gioberti this assumption is specimen but it makes difference he and his prince must go sooner or later if the movement continues nor is there any prospect of its being stayed unless by foreign intervention this the pope has not yet it is believed solicited but there is little reason to hope he will be spared that crowning disgrace he has already consented to the incitement of civil war should an intervention be solicited all depends on france will she basely forfeit every pledge and every duty to say nothing of her true interest it seems that her president stands doubtful intending to what is his particular interest but if his interest proves opposed to the republican principle will france suffer herself again to be hoodwinked and enslaved it is impossible to know she has already shown such devotion to the mere prestige of name on england dependence can be placed she is guided by great idea her parliamentary leaders sneer at sentimental policy and the jargon of ideas she will act always her own interest and the interest of her present government is becoming more and more the crushing of the democratic tendency they are obliged to it at home both in the back and the front parlor it would not be decent yet to have spielber g just at home obstreperous patriots but england has so many ships it is just easy to transport them to safe distance then the church of england so long an enemy to the church of rome feels decided interest with it on the subject of temporal possessions the rich english traveller fearing to see the prince borghese stripped of one of his palaces hospital or some such low use thinks of his own park and the crowded village of beggars at its gate and muses i hope to see them all shot yet these rascally republicans how i wish my country would show some noble sympathy when an experience so like her own is going on politically she can not interfere but formerly when greece and poland were struggling they were at least aided by private contributions italy naturally so rich but long racked and impoverished by her oppressors greatly needs money to arm and clothe her troops some token of sympathy too from america would be so welcome to her now if there were circle of persons inclined to trust such to i might venture to promise the trust should be used to the advantage of italy it would make proud to have my country show religious faith in the progress of ideas and make some small sacriﬁce of its own great resources in aid of sister cause now but i must close this letter which it would be easy to swell to volume from the materials in my mind one or two traits of the hour i must note mazzarelli chief of the present ministry was prelate and named spontaneously by the pope before his ﬂight he has shown entire and frank intrepidity he has laid aside the title of monsignor and appears before the world layman nothing can be more tranquil than has been the state of rome all winter every wile has been used by the oscurantists to excite the people but their conﬁdence in their leaders could not be broken little mutiny in the troops stimulated by letters from their old leaders was quelled in moment the day after the proclamation of the republic some zealous ignoramuses insulted the carriages that appeared with servants in livery the ministry published grave admonition that democracy meant liberty not license and that he who infringed upon an innocent freedom of action in others must be declared traitor to his country every act of the kind ceased instantly an intimation that it was better not to throw large comﬁts or oranges during the carnival injuries have thus been sometimes caused was obeyed with equal docility on sunday last placards afﬁxed in the high places summoned the city to invest giuseppe mazzini with the rights of roman citizen i have not yet heard the result the pope pg 361 pg 362 at home and abroad or things and thoughts

rome at any rate the ﬁrst time in his life deputy to the constitutional assembly it would be noble poetic justice if he could enter also roman citizen february the austrians have invaded ferrara taken and six hostages and retired this step is doubt intended to determine whether france will resent the insult or whether she will betray italy it shows also the assurance of the austrian that the pope will approve of an armed intervention probably before i write again these matters will reach some decided crisis letter xxix the roman albert traitor of character addr ess to the oratory own terry and

maria rome march 20 the roman republic moves on better than could have been expected there are great difﬁculties about money necessarily the government so beset with trials and dangers can not command conﬁdence in that respect the solid coin has crept out of the country or lies hid and in the use of paper there are the corresponding inconveniences but the poor always the chief sufferers from such state of things are wonderfully patient and i doubt not that the new form if italy could be left to itself would be settled the advantage of all tuscany would soon be united with rome and to the republic of central italy longer broken asunder by petty restrictions and sacriﬁced to the interests of few persons would come that prosperity natural to region so favored by nature could italy be left alone but treacherous selﬁsh men at home strive to betray and foes threaten her from without on every side even france her natural ally promises to prove foolishly and basely faithless the dereliction from principle of her governme nt seems certain and thus far the nation despite the remonstrance of few worthy men gives sign of effective protest there would be little hope italy were not the thrones of her foes in tottering state their action liable at every moment to be distracted by domestic difﬁculties the austrian government seems destitute of support from the nation is possible government to be and the army is longer what it was being made up so largely of new recruits the croats are uncertain in their adhesion the war in hungary likely to give them much to and if the russian is called in the rest of europe becomes hostile all these circumstances give italy chance she otherwise could not have she is in great measure unfurnished with arms and money her king in the south is bloody angry foe her king in the north proved traitor charles albert has now declared war because he could not otherwise but his sympathies are in fact all against liberty the splendid lure that he might become king of italy glitters more the republicans are in the ascendant and he may well doubt should the stranger be driven out whether piedmont could escape the contagion now his people insisting on war he has the air of making it with good grace but should he be worsted probably he will know some loophole by which to steal out the rat will get out and leave the lion in the trap pg 363 pg 364 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https illustrious gioberti has fallen ever from his high scaffold of words his demerits were too unmistakable rhetoric to hide that he sympathized with the pope rather than the roman people and could not endure to see him stripped of his temporal power one could blame in the author of the primato that he refused the italian general assembly if it was to be based on the montanelli system instead of his own might be conviction or it might be littleness and vanity but that he privily planned without even adherence of the council of ministers an armed intervention of the piedmontese troops in tuscany thus willing to cause civil war and at this great moment to see italian blood shed by italian hands was treachery i think indeed he has been probably made the in that affair that charles albert planned the measure and ﬁnding himself unable to carry it out in consequence of the vigilance and indignant opposition of the chamber of deput ies was somewhat consoled by making it an occasion to victimize the illustrious whom four weeks before the people had forced him to accept his minister now the name of gioberti is erased from the corners of the streets to which it was afﬁxed year ago he is stripped of all his honorary degrees and proclaimed an unworthy son of the country mazzini is the idol of the people soon to be hunted out sneered the sceptical american possibly yes man is secure of his palm till the ﬁght is over the civic wreath may be knocked from his head hundred times in the ardor of the contest matter if he can always keep the forehead pure and lofty will mazzini in thinking of mazzini i always remember petrarch invocation to rienzi mazzini comes at riper period in the world history with the same energy of soul but of purer temper and more enlar ged views to answer them i not know whether i mentioned kind of poetical correspondence about mazzini and rossi rossi was also an exile liberal principles but he did not value his birthright he alienated it and french citizen became peer of france and representative of louis philippe in italy when with the fatuity of those whom the gods have doomed to perish pius ix took the representative of the fallen guizot policy his minister he made him roman citizen he was proclaimed such on the 14th of november on the 15th he perished before he could enter the parliament he had called he fell at the door of the cancelleria when it was sitting mazzini in his exile remained absolute ly devoted to his native country because though feeling few can that the interests of humanity in all nations are identical he felt also that born of race so suffering so much needing devotion and energy his ﬁrst duty was to that the only powers he acknowledged were god and the people the special scope of his acts the unity and independence of italy rome was the theme of his thoughts but very early exiled he had never seen that home to which all the orphans of the soul so naturally turn now he entered it roman citizen elected representative of the people by universal suffrage his motto dio popolo is put upon the coin with the roman eagle unhappily this coin is of brass or else of silver with much alloy dii avertite omen and may peaceful days turn it all to pure gold on his ﬁrst entrance to the house mazzini received with fervent applause and summoned to take his place beside the president spoke follows it is from colleagues that should come these tokens of applause these tokens of affection because the little good i have not done but tried to has come to from rome rome was always sort of talisman youth i studied the history of italy and found while all the other nations were born grew up played their part in the world then fell to reappear more in the same power single city was privileged by god to die only to rise again greater than before to fulﬁl mission greater than the ﬁrst i saw the rome of the empire extend her conquests from the conﬁnes of africa to the conﬁnes of asia i saw rome perish crushed by the barbarians by those whom even yet the world calls barbarians i saw her rise again after having chased away these same pg 365 pg 366 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https reviving in its sepulchre the germ of civilization i saw her rise more great conquest not with arms but with words in the name of the popes to repeat her grand mission i said in my heart the city which alone in the world has had two grand lives one greater than the other will have third after the rome which wrought by conquest of arms the rome which wrought by conquest of words must come third which shall work by virtue of example after the rome of the emperors after the rome of the popes will come the rome of the people the rome of the people is arisen not salute with applauses but let us rejoice together i can not promise anything myself except concurrence in all you shall the good of rome of italy of mankind perhaps we shall have to pass through great crises perhaps we shall have to ﬁght sacred battle against the only enemy that threatens us we will ﬁght it and we will conquer i hope please god that foreigners may not be able to say any more that which so many of them repeat speaking of our affairs the light which comes from rome is only an ignis fatuus wandering among the tombs the world shall see that it is starry light eternal pure and resplendent those we look up to in the heavens on later day he spoke more fully of the difﬁculties that threaten at home the young republic and said let us not hear of right of left of centre these terms express the three powers in constitutional monarchy us they have meaning the only divisions us are of republicans or of sincere men and temporizing men let us not hear so much of the republicans of and of yesterday i am republican of twenty years standing entertaining such hopes italy when many excellent many sincere men held them utopian shall i denounce these men because they are now convinced of their practicability this last i quote from memory in hearing the gentle tone of remonstrance with those of more petty mind or inﬂuenced by the passions of the partisan i was forcibly reminded of the parable by jesus of the vineyard and the discontent of the laborers that those who came at the eleventh hour received also penny mazzini also is content that all should fare alike brethren if only they will come into the vineyard he is not an orator but the simple conversational tone of his addres s is in refreshing contrast with the boyish rhetoric and academic swell common to italian speakers in the present unﬂedged state they have freer use of the power of debate they will become more simple and manly the speech of mazzini is laden with thought goes straight to the mark by the shortest path and moves without effort from the irresistible impression of deep conviction and ﬁdelity in the speaker mazzini is man of genius an elevated thinker but the most powerful and ﬁrst impression from his presence must always be of the religion of his soul of his virtue both in the modern and antique sense of that word if clearness of right if energy if indefatigable perseverance can steer the ship through this dangerous pass it will be done he said we will conquer whether rome will this time is not to certain but such men mazzini conquer always in defeat yet heaven grant that more blood more corruption of priestly government be italy it could only be once more the strength of her present impulse would not fail to triumph at last but even one more trial seems too intolerably much when i think of the holocaust of the broken hearts bafﬂed lives that must attend it but enough of politics the present this letter goes by private hand and news will be superseded before it can arrive let rather take the opportunity to say some things that i have let lie by while writing of political events especially of our artists i wish to say something i know many of thorn if not all and see with pleasure our young country so fairly represented among the painters i saw of brown only two or three pictures at the exhibition in florence they were coarse ﬂashy things i was told he could better but man who indulges himself with such coarse can not surely well at any time pg 367 pg 368 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https merits of terry and freeman are not my merits they are beside both favorites in our country and have sufﬁcient number of pictures there every one to judge i am connoisseur regards the technical merits of paintings it is only poetic invention or tender feeling of nature which captivates terry loves grace and consciously works from the model the result is pleasing transposition of the hues of this clime but the design of the picture is never original nor is it laden with any message from the heart of freeman i know less the two or three pictures of his that i have seen never interested i have not visited his studio of hicks i think very highly he is man of ideas an original observer and with poetic heart his system of coloring is derived from thoughtful study not mere imitation of nature and shows the ﬁneness of his organization struggling unaided to pursue the expensive studies of his art he has had only small studio and received only orders little cabinet pictures could he carry out adequately his ideas in him would be found the treasure of genius he has made the drawings large picture of many ﬁgures the design is original and noble the grouping highly effective could he paint this picture i believe it would be real boon to the lovers of art the lovers of truth i hope very much that when he returns to the united state s some competent patron of of the few who have mind well see the drawings and order the picture otherwise he can not paint it the expenses attendant on models so many ﬁgures are great and the time demanded could not otherwise be taken from the claims of the day among landscape painters cropsey and cranch have the true artist spirit in faculties each has what the other wants cropsey is reverent and careful student of nature in detail it is pedantry but true love he has and his pictures are full of little gentle signs of intimacy they please and touch but yet in poetic feeling of the heart of nature he is not equal to cranch who produces ﬁne effects by means more superﬁcia l and on examination less satisfactory each might take somewhat from the other to advantage could he it without diminishing his own original dower both are artists of high promise and deserve to be loved and cherished by country which may without presumption hope to carry landscape painting to pitch of excellence unreached before the historical painter the position with us is many reasons not favorable but there is bar in the way of the landscape painter and fate bestowing such prodigality of subject seems to give us hint not to be mistaken i think the love of landscape painting is genuine in our nation and it is branch of art where achievement has been comparatively low we may not unreasonably suppose it has been left us i trust it will be undertaken in the highest spirit nature it seems to reveals herself more freely in our land she is true virgin and conﬁding smiles upon the vision of true endymion i hope to see not only copies upon canvas of our magniﬁcent scenes but transfusion of the spirit which is their divinity then why should the american lands cape painter come to italy cry many i think myself he ought not to stay here very long yet few years study is precious here nature herself has worked with man if she wanted to help him in the composition of pictures the ruins of italy in their varied relations with vegetation and the heavens make speeches from every stone instruction of the artist the greatest variety here is found with the greatest harmony to know how this union may be accomplished is main secret of art and though the coloring is not the same yet he who has the key to its mysteries of beauty is the more initiated to the same in other climates and will easily attune afresh his more instructed eye and mind to the contemplation of that which moulded his childhood i may observe of the two artists i have named that cranch has entered more into the spirit of italian landscape while cropsey is still more distinguished on subject s such he ﬁrst loved he seemed to ﬁnd the scotch lake and mountain scenery very congenial his sketches and pictures taken from short residence there are impressive perhaps pg 369 pg 370 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https or tender subject suits him best something rich bold and mellow is more adapted to call out the genius of cranch among the sculptors new names rise up to show that this is decidedly province hope in america i look upon this the natural talent of an american and have doubt that glories will be displayed by our sculptors unknown to classic art the facts of our history ideal and social will be grand and of new import it is perfectly natural to the american to mould in clay and carve in stone the permanence of material and solid relief in the forms correspond to the positiveness of his nature better than the mere ephemeral and even tricky methods of the painter his need of motion and action better than the chambered scribbling of the poet he will thus record his best experiences and these records will adorn the noble structures that must naturally arise the public uses of our society it is particularly gratifying to see men that might amass far more money and attain more temporary power in other things despise those lower lures too powerful in our country and aim only at excellence in the expression of thought among these i may mention story and mozier story has made in florence the model statue of his father this i have not seen but two statuettes that he modelled here from the fisher of goethe pleased extremely the languid meditative reverie of the boy the morbid tenderness of his nature is most happily expressed in the ﬁrst is the fascinated surrender to the siren murmur of tire ﬂood in the second he has taken the moment half drew she him half sank he in i hope some one will give him an order to make them in marble mozier seemed to have an immediate success the ﬁdelity and spirit of his could be appreciated by every one an ideal head of pocahontas too he had at once orders many copies it was not an indian head but in the union of sweetness and strength with princelike childlike dignity very happily expressive of his idea of her character i think he has modelled rebecca at the well but this i did not see these have already ﬁrm hold on the affections of our people every amer ican who comes to italy visits their studios and speaks of them with pride indeed they well may in comparing them with artists of other nations it will not be long before you see greenough group it is in spirit pendant to cooper novels i confess i wish he had availed himself of the opportunity to immortalize the real noble indian in marble this is only the man of the woods metamora uncas but the group should be very instructive to our people you seem crazy about powers greek slave the florentines were about cimabue madonnas in which we still see the spark of genius but not fanned to its full ﬂame if your enthusiasm be genuine that of the lively florentines we will not quarrel with it but i am afraid great part is draw rapture and newspaper echo genuine enthusiasm however crude the state of mind from which it springs always elevates always educates but in the same proportion talking and writing effect stultiﬁes and debases i shall not judge the adorers of the greek slave but only observe that they have not kept in reserve any higher admiration works even now extant which are in comparison with that statue what that statue is compared with any weeping marble on common monument i consider the slave form of simple and sweet beauty but that neither an ideal expression nor specimen of plastic power is it transcendent powers stands far higher in his busts than in any ideal statue his conception of what is individual in character is clear and just his power of execution almost unrivalled but he has had lifetime of discipline the bust while his studies on the human body are comparatively limited nor is his treatment of it free and masterly to his conception of subject is not striking i not consider him rich in artistic thought pg 371 pg 372 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https less than greenough and crawford would feel it rich reward many labors and happy climax to their honors to make an equestrian statue of washington our country i wish they might all it each would show different kind of excellence to present the man on horseback the wise centaur the tamer of horses may well be deemed high achievement of modern it was of ancient art the study of the anatomy and action of the horse so rich in suggestions is naturally most desirable to the artist happy he who obliged by the brevity of life and the limitations of fortune to make his studies conform to his orders ﬁnds himself justiﬁed by national behest in entering on this department at home one gets callous about the character of washington from long expe rience of fourth of july bombast in his praise but seeing the struggles of other nations and the deﬁciencies of the leaders who try to sustain them the heart is again stimulated and puts forth buds of praise one appreciates the wonderful combination of events and inﬂuences that gave our independence so healthy birth and the almost miraculous merits of the men who tended its ﬁrst motions in the combination of excellences needed at such period with the purity and modesty which dignify the private man in the humblest station washington yet stands alone country has ever had such good future other is so happy to have pattern of spotless worth which will remain in her latest day venerable now surely then that form should be immortalized in material solid its fame and happily the artist that form was of natural beauty and dignity and he who places him on horseback simply represents his habitual existence everything concurs to make an equestrian statue of washington desirable the digniﬁed way to manage that affair would be to have committee chosen of impartial judges men who would look only to the merits of the work and the interests of the country unbiassed by any personal interest in favor of some one artist it is said it is impossible to ﬁnd such committee but i can not believe it let there be put aside the mean squabbles and jealousies the vulgar pushing of unworthy friends with which unhappily the artist career seems more rife than any other and fair concurrence established let each artist offer his design an equestrian statue of washington and let the best have the preference crawford has made design which he takes with him to america and which i hope will be generally seen he has represented washington in his actual dress ﬁgure of fame winged presents the laurel and civic wreath his gesture declines them he seems to say the deed is enough need badge outward token in reward this group has insipid allegorical air might be supposed and its composition is very graceful simple and harmonious the costume is very happily managed the angel ﬁgure is draped and with the which badge both of ancient and modern times seems to connect the two ﬁgures and in an artistic point of view balances well the cocked hat there is similar harmony between the angel wings and the extremities of the horse the action of the winged ﬁgure induces natural and spirited action of the horse and rider i thought of goethe remark that ﬁne work of art will always have at distance where its details can not be discerned beautiful effect of architectural ornament and that this excellence the groups of raphael share with the antique he would have been pleased with the beautiful balance of forms in this group with the freedom with which light and air play in and out the management of the whole being clear and satisfactory at the ﬁrst glance but one should go into great number of studies you can in rome or florence and see the abundance of heavy and inharmonious designs to appreciate the merits of this anything really good seems so simple and so matter of course to the unpractised observer some say the americans will not want group but just the fact the portrait of washington riding straight onward like marcus aurelius or making an address or lifting pg 373 pg 374 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https sword i not know about that is matter of feeling this winged ﬁgure not only gives poetic sense to the group but natural support and occasion action to the horse and rider uncle sam must send major downing to look at it and then if he wants other designs let him establish concurrence i have said and choose what is best i am not particularly attached to greenough powers or crawford i admire various excellences in the works of each and should be glad if each received an order an equestrian statue nor is there any reason why they should not there is mone y enough in the country and the more good things there are the people to see freely in open daylight the better that makes artists germinate i love the artists though i can not speak of their works in way to content their friends or even themselves often who can that has standard of excellence in the mind and delicate conscience in the use of words my highest tribute is meagre of super latives in comparison with the hackneyed puffs with which artists submit to be besmeared submit alas often they court them rather i not expect any kindness from my contemporaries i know that what is to justice and honor is to them only hateful coldness still i love them i wish their good i feel deeply their sufferings annoyances priva tions and would lessen them if i could i have thought it might perhaps be of use to publish some account of the expenses of the artist there is general impression that the artist lives very cheaply in italy this is mistake italy compared with america is not so very cheap except those who have iron constitutions to endure bad food eaten in bad air damp and dirty lodgings the expense s even in florence of simple but clean and wholesome life are little less than in new york the great difference is people that are rich an englishman of rank and fortune does not need the same amount of luxury at home to be on footing with the nobles of italy the broadway merchant would ﬁnd his display of mahogany and carpets thrown away in country where higher kind of ornament is the only one available but poor people who can at any rate buy only the necessaries of life will ﬁnd them in the italian cities where all sellers live by cheating foreigners very little cheaper than in america the patrons of art in america ignorant of these facts and not knowing the great expenses which attend the study of art and the production of its wonders are often guilty of most undesigned cruelty and things which it would grieve their hearts to have done if they only knew the facts they have read essays on the uses of adversity in developing genius and they are not sufﬁciently afraid to administer dose of adversity beyond what the forces of the patient can bear laudanum in drops is useful medicine but cupful kills downright beside this romantic idea about letting artists suffer to develop their genius the american mæcenas is not sufﬁciently aware of the expenses attendant on producing the work he wants he does not consider that the painter the sculptor must be paid the time he spends in designing and moulding less than in painting and carving that he must have his bread and his workhouse or studio his marbles and colors sculptor his workmen so that if the price be paid he asks modest and delicate man very commonly receives guerdon his thought real essence of the work the luxury of seeing it embodied which he could not otherwise have afforded the american mæcenas often pushes the price down not from want of generosity but from habit of making what are called good bargains bargains one own advantage at the expense of poorer brother those who call these good not believe that mankind is one and beats with one great heart they have not read the life of jesus christ then the american mæcenas sometimes after ordering work has been known to change his mind when the statue is already modelled it is the american who does these things because an american who either from taste or vanity buys picture is often quite pg 375 pg 376 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https to the arts and

powers who on hearing the price of the proserpine wonderingly asked is statuary riz lately queen victoria of england and her albert it is said use their royal privilege to get works of art at price below their value but their subjects would be ashamed to so to supply means of judging to the american merchant full of kindness and honorable sympathy beneath the crust he so often is who wants pictures and statues not merely from ostentation but means of delight and improvement to himself and his friends who has soul to respect the genius and desire the happiness of the artist and who if he errs does so from ignorance of the circumstances i give the following memorandum made at my desire by an artist my neighbor the rent of suitable studio modelling in clay and executing statues in marble may be estimated at 200 year the best journeyman carver in marble at rome receives 60 month models are paid 1 day the cost of marble varies according to the size of the block being generally sold by the cubic palm square of nine inches english general guide regarding the prices established among the higher sculptors of rome i may mention that statu of size the demand is from to varying according to the composition of the ﬁgure and the number of accessories it is common belief in the united states that student of art can live in italy and pursue his studies on an income of 300 or 400 year this is lamentable error the russian government allows its pensioners 700 which is scarcely sufﬁcient per annum should be placed at the disposal of every young artist leaving our country europe let it be remembered in addition to considerations inevitable from this memorandum that an artist may after years and months of uncheered and difﬁcult toil after he has gone through the earlier stages of an education ﬁnd it too largely based and of aim too high to ﬁnish in this world the prussian artist here on my left hand learned not only his art but reading and writing after he was thirty farmer son he was allowed freedom to learn anything till the death of the head of the house left him beggar but set him free he walked to berlin distant several hundred miles attracted by his ﬁrst works some attention and received some assistance in money earned more by invention of ploughshare walked to rome struggled through every privation and has now reputation which has secured him the means of putting his thoughts into marble true at years of age he is still severely poor he can not marry because he can not maintain family but he is cheerful because he can work in his own way trusts with childlike reliance in god and is still sustained by the vigorous health he won laboring in his father ﬁelds not every man could continue to work circumstanced he is at the end of the him the only sad thing in my mind is that his works are not worth working though of merit in composition and execution yet ideally product of the galvanized piety of the german school more than to my unchurched eyes you are likely to have work to look at in the united states by the great mast er of that school overbeck perkins of boston who knows how to spend his money with equal generosity and discretion having bought his wise and foolish virgins it will be precious to the country from great artistic merits to the spirit blessed are the poor in spirit that kind of severity is perhaps has become the nature of overbeck he seems like monk but really pious and pure one this spirit is not what i seek i deem it too narrow our day but being deeply sincere in him its expression is at times also deeply pg 377 pg

next century god moves in mysterious way every struggle made by the old tyrannies all their jesuitical deceptions their rapacity their imprisonments and executions of the most generous men only sow more dragon teeth the crop shoots up daily more and more plenteous when i ﬁrst arrived in italy the vast majority of this people had wish beyond limited monarchies constitutional governments they still respected the famous names of the nobility they despised the priests but were still fondly attached to the dogmas and ritual of the roman catholic church it required king bomba the triple

socialism the aristocrat dreams of the guillotine always when he hears men speak of the people the inﬂuence of the jesuits is still immense in france both in france and england the grossest falsehoods have been circulated with unwearied diligence about the state of things in italy an amusing specimen of what is still done in this line i ﬁnd just now in foreign journal where it says there are red ﬂags on all the houses of rome meaning to imply that the romans are athirst blood now the fact is that these ﬂags are put up at pg 381 pg 382 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and

occupy rome was ﬁrmly resisted oudinot describes in his despatches readiness submission having tried in vain to gain this point he has sent to france fresh orders these will be decided by the turn the election takes meanwhile the french troops are much exposed to the roman force where they are should the austrians come up what will they will they shamelessly fraternize with the french after pretending and proclaiming that they came here check upon their aggressions will they oppose them in defence of rome with which they are at war ah the way of falsehood the way of treachery dark how

looks desolate profaned i feel what i never expected to if i might by and by be willing to leave rome then i have the ﬁrst time seen what wounded men suffer the night of the 30th of april i passed in the hospital and saw the terrible agonies of those dying or who needed amputation felt their mental pains and longing the loved ones who were away many of these were lombards who had come from the ﬁeld of novarra to ﬁght with fairer chance were students of the university who had enlisted and thrown themselves into the front of the engagement the impudent falsehoods of the french general despatches are incredible the french were never decoyed on in any way they were received with every possible mark of hostility they were defeated in open ﬁeld the garibaldi legion rushing out to meet them and though they suffered much from the walls they sustained themselves nowhere they never put up white ﬂag till they wished to surrender the vanity that strives to cover over these facts is unworthy of men the only excuse the imprudent conduct of the expedition is that they were deceived not by the romans here but by the priests of gaëta leading them to expect action in their favor within the walls these priests themselves were deluded by their hopes and old habits of mind the troops did not ﬁght well and general oudinot abandoned his wounded without proper care all this says nothing against french valor proved by ages of glory beyond the doubt of their worst foes they were demoralized because they fought in so bad cause and there was sincere ardor or clear hope in any breast but to return to the hospitals these were put in order and have been kept so by the princess belgioioso the princess was born of one of the noblest familie s of the milanese descendant of the great trivalzio and inherited large fortune very early she compromised it in liberal movements and on their failure was obliged to ﬂy to paris where time she maintained herself by writing and i think by painting also princess so placed naturally excited great interest and she drew around her little court pg 383 pg 384 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret

called locate between pavia and milan she had made experiments in the socialist direction with ﬁne judgment and success association education labor transaction of household affairs had been carried on several years she had spared devotion of time and money to this object loved and was much beloved by those objects of her care and said she hoped to die there all is now despoiled and broken up though it may be hoped that some seeds of peaceful reform have been sown which will spring to light when least expected the princess returned to italy in full of hope in pius ix and charles albert she showed her usual energy and truly princely heart sustaining at her own expense company of soldiers and journal up to the last sad betrayal of milan august 6th these days undeceived all the people but few of the noblesse she was one of the few with mind strong enough to understand the lesson and is now warmly interested in the republican movement from milan she went to france but ﬁnding it impossible to effect anything serious there in behalf of italy returned and has been in rome about two months since leaving milan she receives income her possessions being in the grasp of radetzky and can not know when if ever she will again but she worked so largely and well with money so can she without she published an invitation to the roman women to make lint and bandages and offer their services to the wounded she put the hospitals in order in the central one trinita pellegrini once the abode where the pilgrims were received during holy week and where foreigners were entertained by seeing their feet washed by the noble dames and dignitaries of rome she has remained day and night since the 30th of april when the wounded were ﬁrst there some money she procured at ﬁrst by going through rome accompanied by two other ladies veiled to beg it afterward the voluntary contributions were generous among the rest i am proud to say the americans in rome gave 250 of which handsome portion came from mr brown the consul i value this mark of sympathy more because of the irritation and surprise occasioned here by the position of cass the envoy it is most unfortunate that we should have an envoy here the ﬁrst time just to offend and disappoint the romans when all the other ambassadors are at gaëta ours is in rome if by his presence to discountenance the republican government which he does not recognize cass it seems is required by his instructions not to recognize the government till sure it can be sustained now it seems to that the only digniﬁed ground our government the only legitimate ground any republican government is to recognize any nation the government chosen by itself the suffrage had been correct here and the proportion of votes to the whole population was much larger it was said by americans here than it is in our own country at the time of contested elections it had elected an assembly that asse mbly had appointed to meet the exigencies of this time the triumvirate if any misrepresentations have induced america to believe france affects to have believed that so large vote could have been obtained by moral intimidation the present unanimity of the population in resisting such immense odds and the enthusiasm of their every expression in favor of the present government puts the matter beyond doubt the roman people claims once more to have national existence it declines further serfdom to an ecclesiastical court it claims liberty of conscience of action and of thought should it fall from its present position it will not be from internal dissent but from foreign oppression since this is the case surely our country if other is bound to recognize the present government so long it can sustain itself this position is that to which we have right being such it is matter how it is viewed by others but i dare assert it is the only respectable one our country in the eyes of the emperor of russia himself the ﬁrst best occasion is past when cass might had he been empowered to act rush did in france have morally strengthened the staggering republic which would have found sympathy where alone it is of permanent value on the basis of principle had it been in vain what then america would have acted honorably to our being compromised thereby with the papal government that fear is idle pope and cardinals pg 385 pg 386 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https great hopes from america the giant inﬂuence there is kept up with the greatest care the number of catholic writers in the united states too carefully counted had our republican government acknowledged this republican government the papal camarilla would have respected us more but not loved us less have we not the loaves and ﬁshes to give well the precious souls to be saved ah here indeed america might go straightforward with all needful impunity bishop hughes himself need not be anxious that ﬁrst best occasion has passed and the unrecognized unrecognizing envoy has given offence and not comfort by presence that seemed constantly to say i not think you can sustain yourselves it has wounded both the heart and the pride of rome some of the lowest people have asked is it not true that your country had war to become free y es then why they not feel us yet even now it is not too late if america would only hail triumphant though she could not sustain injured rome that would be something can you suppose rome will triumph you say without money and against so potent league of foes i am not sure but i hope i believe something in the heart of people when fairly awakened i have also lurking conﬁdence in what our fathers spoke of so constantly providential order of things by which brute force and selﬁsh enterprise are sometimes

afraid to come till his dear cousins of austria had put everything in perfect order then the austrians entered to take leghorn but the florentines still kept on imploring them not to come there florence was subdued good possible already have had the answer they deserved now they crown their work by giving over guerazzi and petracci to be tried by an austrian truly the cup of shame brims over

write of rome in these sad but glorious days plain facts are the best my feelings i could not ﬁnd ﬁt words when i last wrote the french were playing the second act of their farce in the ﬁrst the french government affected to consult the assembly the assembly or majority of the assembly affected to believe the pretext it gave and voted funds twelve thousand men to go to civita vecchia arriving there oudinot proclaimed that he had come friend and brother he was received such immediately he took possession of the town disarmed the roman troops and published manifesto in direct opposition to his ﬁrst declaration he sends to rome that he is coming there friend receives the answer that he is not wanted and can not be trusted this answer he chooses to consider coming from minority and advances on rome the pretended majority on which he counts never shows itself by single movement within the walls he makes an assault and is defeated on this subject his despatches to his government are full of falsehoods that would disgrace the lowest pickpocket which it is impossible he should not know to be such pg 389 pg 390 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https assembly passed vote of blame louis bonaparte writes letter of compliment and assurance that this course of violence shall be sustained in conformity with this promise twelve thousand more troops are sent this time it is not thought necessary to consult the assembly let us view the second act now appears in rome ferdinand lesseps envoy of the french government he declares himself clothed with full powers to treat with rome he can not conceal his surprise at all he sees there at the ability with which preparations have been made defence at the patriotic enthusiasm which pervades the population neverth eless in beginning his game of he is not ashamed to insist on the french occupying the city again and again repulsed he again and again returns to the charge on this point and here i shall translate the letter addressed to him by the triumvi rate both because of its perfect candor of statement and to give an idea of the sweet and noble temper in which these treacherous aggressions have been met letter of the triumvirs to monsieur lesseps may 25 1849 we have had the honor monsieur to furnish you in our note of the 16th with some information to the unanimous consent which was given to the formation of the government of the roman republic we would speak to you of the actual question such it is debated in fact if not by right between the french government and ours you will allow us to it with the frankness demanded by the urgency of the situation well the sympathy which ought to govern all relations between france and italy our diplomacy is the truth and the character given to your mission is guaranty that the best possible interpretation will be given to what we shall say to you with your permission we return an instant to the cause of the present situation of affairs in consequence of conferences and arrangements which took place without the government of the roman republic ever being called on to take part it was some time since decided by the catholic powers 1st that modiﬁcation should take place in the government and institutions of the roman states 2d that this modiﬁcation should have basis the return of pius not pope to that obstacle is interposed by us but temporal sovereign 3d that if to attain that aim continuous intervention was judged necessary that intervention should take place we are willing to admit that while some of the contracting governments the only motive was the hope of general restor ation and absolute return to the treaties of 1815 the french government was drawn into this agreement only in consequence of erroneous information tending systematically to depict the roman states given up to anarchy and governed by terror exercised in the name of an audacious minority we know also that in the modiﬁcation proposed the french government intended to represent an inﬂuence more or less liberal opposed to the absolutist programme of austria and of naples it does none the less remain true that under the apostolic or constitutional form with or without liberal guaranties to the roman people the dominant thought in all the negotiations to which we allude has been some sort of return toward the past compromise between the roman people and pius ix considered temporal prince we can not dissemble to ourselves monsieur that the french expedition has been planned and executed under the inspiration of this thought its object was on one side to throw the sword of france into the balance of negotiations which were to be opened at rome on the other to guarantee the roman people from the excess of retrograde but always on condition that it should submit to constitutional monarchy in favor of the holy father this is assured to us partly from information which we believe we possess to pg 391 pg 392 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https concert with austria from the proclamations of general oudinot from the formal declarations made by successive envoys to the triumvirate from the silence obstinately maintained whenever we have sought to approach the political question and obtain formal declaration of the fact proved in our note of the 16th that the institutions by which the roman people are govern ed at this time are the free and spontaneous expression of the wish of the people inviolable when legally ascertained the rest the vote of the french assembly sustains implicitly the fact that we afﬁrm in such situation under the menace of an inadmissible compromise and of negotiations which the state of our people way provoked our part monsieur could not be doubtful to resist owed this to our country to france to all europe we ought in fulﬁlment of mandate loyally given loyally accepted maintain to our country the inviolability so far that was possible to us of its territory and of the institutions decreed by all the powers by all the elements of the state we ought to conquer the time needed appeal from france ill informed to france better informed to save the sister republic the disgrace and the remorse which must be hers if rashly led on by bad suggestions from without she became before she was aware accomplice in an act of violence to which we can ﬁnd parallel without going back to the partition of poland in we owed it to europe to maintain far we could the fundamental principles of all international life the independence of each people in all that concerns its internal administration we say it without pride if it is with enthusiasm that we resist the attempts of the neapolitan monarchy and of austria our eternal enemy it is with profound grief that we are ourselves constrained to contend with the arms of france believe in following this line of conduct we have deserved well not only of our country but of all the people of europe even of france herself we come to the actual question you know monsieur the events which have followed the french intervention our territory has been invaded by the king of naples four thousand spaniards were to embark on the 17th invasion of this country the austrians having surmounted the heroic resistance of bologna have advanced into romagna and are now marching on ancona we have beaten and driven out of our territory the forces of the king of naples we believe we should the same by the austrian forces if the attitude of the french here did not fetter our action we are sorry to say it but france must be informed that the expedition of civita vecchia said to be planned our protection costs us very dear of all the interventions with which it is hoped to overwhelm us that of the french has been the most perilous against the soldiers of austria and the king of naples we can ﬁght god protects good cause but we not wish to ﬁght against the french we are toward them in state not of war but of simple defence but this position the only one we wish to take wherever we meet france has us all the inconveniences without any of the favorable chances of war the french expedition has from the ﬁrst forced us to concentrate our troops thus leaving our frontier open to austrian invasion and bologna and the cities of romagna unsustained the austrians have proﬁted by this after eight days of heroic resistance by the population bologna was forced to yield we had bought in france arms our defence of these ten thousand muske ts have been detained between marse illes and civita vecchia these are in your hands thus with single blow you deprive us of ten thousand soldiers in every armed man is soldier against the austrians your forces are disposed around our walls if siege they remain there without avowed aim or programme they have forced us to keep the city in state of defence which weighs upon our ﬁnances they force us to keep here body of troops who might be saving our cities from the occupation and ravages of the austrians they hinder our going from place to place our provisioning the city our sending couriers they keep pg 393 pg 394 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https in state of excitement and distru st which might if our population were less good and devoted lead to sinister results they not engender anarchy nor reaction both are impossible at rome but they sow the seed of irritation against france and it is misfortune us who were accustomed to love and hope in her we are besieged monsieur besieged by france in the name of protective mission while some leagues off the king of naples ﬂying carries off our hostages and the austrian slays our brothers you have presented propositions those propositions have been declared inadmissible by the assembly you add fourth to the three already rejected this says that france will protect from foreign invasion all that part of our territory that may be occupied by her troops you must yourself feel that this changes nothing in our position the parts of the territory occupied by your troops are in fact protected but if only the present to what are they reduced and if it is the future have we other way to protect our territory than by giving it up entirely to you the real intent of your demands is not stated it is the occupation of rome this demand has constantly stood ﬁrst in your list of propositions now we have had the honor to say to you monsieur that is impossible the people will never consent to it if the occupation of rome has its aim only to protect it the people thank you but tell you at the same time that able to defend rom by their own forces they would be dishonored even in your eyes by declaring themselves insufﬁcient and needing the aid of some regiments of french soldiers if the occupation has otherwise political object which god forbid the people who have given themselves freely these institutions can not suffer it rome is their capital their palladium their sacred city they know very well that apart from their principles apart from their honor there is civil war at the end of such an occupation they are ﬁlled with distrust by your persistence they foresee the troops being once admitted changes in men and in actions which would be fatal to their liberty they know that in presence of foreign bayonets the independence of their assembly of their government would be vain word they have always civita vecchia before their eyes on this point be sure their will is irrevocable they will be massacred from barricade to barricade before they will surrender can the soldiers of france wish to massacre brother people whom they came to protect because they not wish to surrende r to them their capital there are france only three parts to take in the roman states she ought to declare herself us against us or neutral to declare herself us would be to recognize our republic and ﬁght side by side with us against the austrians to declare against us is to crush without motive the liberty the national life of friendly people and ﬁght side by side with the austrians france can not that she will not risk european war to depress us her ally let her then rest neutral in this conﬂict between us and our enemies only yesterday we hoped more from her but we demand but this the occupation of civita vecchia is fact accomplished let it go france thinks that in the present state of things she ought not to remain distant from the ﬁeld of battle she thinks that vanquishers or vanquished we may have need of her moderative action and of her protection we not think so but we will not react against her let her keep civita vecchia let her even extend her encampments if the numbers of her troops require it in the healthy regions of civita vecchia and viterbo let her then wait the issue of the combats about to take place all facilities will be offered her every proof of frank and cordial sympathy given her ofﬁcers can visit rome her soldiers have all the solace possible but let her neutrality be sincere and without concealed plans let her declare herself in explicit terms let her leave us free to use all our forces let her restore our arms let her not by her cruisers drive back from our ports the men who come to our aid from other parts of italy let her above all withdraw from before our walls and cause pg 395 pg 396 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https the appearance of hostility to cease between two nations who later undoubtedly are destined to unite in the same international faith now they have adopted the same form of government in his answer lesseps appears moved by this statement and particularly expresses himself thus one point appears above all to occupy you it is the thought that we wish forcibly to impose upon you the obligation of receiving us friends friendship and violence are incompatible thus it would be inconsistent on our part to begin by ﬁring our cannon upon you since we are your natural protectors such contradiction enters neither into my intentions nor those of the government of the french republic nor of our army and its honorable these words were written at the of oudinot and of course seen and approved by him at the same time in private conversation the honorable chief could swear he would occupy rome by one means or another few days after lesseps consented to conditions such the romans would tolerate he longer insisted on occupying rome but would content himself with good positions in the country oudinot protested that the plenipotentiary had exceeded his powers he should not obey the armistice was at an end and he should attack rome on monday it was then friday he proposed to leave these two days the few foreigners that remain ed to get out of town lesseps went off to paris in great seeming indignation to get his treaty ratiﬁed of course we could not hear from him eight or ten days meanwhile the honorable chief alike in all his conduct attacked on sunday instead of monday the attack began before sunrise and lasted all day i saw it from my window whic h though distant commands the gate of pancrazio why the whole force was bent on that part i not know if they could take it the town would be cannonaded and the barricades useless but it is the same with the pincian gate made feints in two other directions but they were at once repelled the french fought with great bravery and this time it is said with beautiful skill and order sheltering themselves in their advance by movable barricades the italians fought like lions and inch of ground was gained by the assailants the loss of the french is said to be very great it could not be otherwise six or seven hundred italians are dead or wounded among them are many ofﬁcers those of garibaldi especially who are much exposed by their daring bravery and whose red tunic makes them the natural mark of the enemy it seems to great folly to wear such dress amid the dark uniforms but garibaldi has always done it he has now been wounded twice here and seventeen times in ancona all this week i have been much at the hospitals where are these noble sufferers they are full of enthusiasm this time was treason vicenza novara milan they had not been given up by wicked chiefs at the moment they were shedding their blood and they had conquered all were only anxious to get out again and be at their posts they seemed to feel that those who died so gloriously were fortunate perhaps they were if rome is obliged to yield how can she stand always unaided against the four powers shall these noble youths ﬂy they are the ﬂower of the italian youth especially among the lombards are some of the ﬁnest young men i have ever seen if rome falls if venice falls there is spot of italian earth where they can abide more and certainly italian will wish to take refuge in france truly you said lesseps violence and friendship are incompatible military funeral of the ofﬁcer ramerino was sadly picturesque and affecting the priests went before the body singing while his brothers in arms bore the lighted tapers his horse followed saddled and bridled the horse hung his head and stepped dejectedly he felt there was something strange and gloomy going on that his master was laid low ramerino left wife and children great proportion of those pg 397 pg 398 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https run those risks are happily alone parents weep but will not suffer long their grief is not like that of widows and children since the 3d we have only cannonade and skirmishes the french are at their trenches but can not advance much they are too much molested from the walls the romans have made one very successful sortie the french availed themselves of violent thunderstorm when the walls were left more thinly guarded to try to scale them but were immediately driven back it was thought by many that they never would be willing to throw bombs and shells into rome but they whenever they can that generous hope and faith in them republicans and brothers which put the best construction on their actions and believed in their truth far possible is now destroyed the government is false and the people not resist the general is false and the soldiers obey meanwhile frightful sacriﬁces are being made by rome all her glorious oaks all her gardens of delight her casinos full of the monuments of genius and taste are perishing in the defence the houses the trees which had been spared at the gate of pancrazio all afforded shelter to the foe and caused so much loss of life that the romans have now fully acquiesced in destruction agonizing to witness villa borghese is ﬁnally laid waste the villa of raphael has perished the trees are all cut down at villa albani and the house that most beautiful ornament of rome must i suppose go too the stately marble forms are already driven from their place in that portico where winckelmann sat and talked with such delight villa salvage is burnt with all its ﬁne frescos and that bank of the tiber shorn of its lovely plantations rome will never recover the cruel ravage of these days perhaps only just begun i had often thought of living few months near peter that i might go much i liked to the church and the museum have villa pamﬁli and monte mario within the compass of walk it is not easy to ﬁnd lodgings there it is quarter foreigners never inhabit but walking about to see what pleasant places there were i had ﬁxed my eye on clean simple house near ponte angelo it bore on tablet that it was the property of angela its little balconies with their old wooden rails full of ﬂowers in humble earthen vases the many the air of domestic quiet and comfort marked it the home of some vestal or widow some lone woman whose heart was centred in the ordinary and simplest pleasures of home i saw also she was one having the most limited income and i thought she will not refuse to let room few months i shall be quiet herself and sympathize about the ﬂowers and birds now the villa pamﬁli is all laid waste the french encamp on monte mario what they have done there is not known yet the cannonade reverberates all day under the dome of peter and the house of poor angela is levelled with the ground i hope her birds and the white peacocks of the vatican gardens are in safety who cares gentle harmless creatures now i have been often interrupted while writing this letter and suppose it is confused well incomplete i hope my next may tell of something decisive one way or the other news is not yet come from lesseps but the conduct of oudinot and the formation of the new french ministry give reason to hope good many seem resolved to force back pius ix among his bleeding ﬂock into the city ruined by him where he can not remain and if he come all this struggle and sorrow is to be borne over again mazzini stands ﬁrm rock i know not whether he hopes successful issue but he believes in god bound to protect men who what they deem their duty yet how long lord shall the few trample on the many i am surprised to see the air of perfect good faith with which articles from the london times upon the revolutionary movements are copied into our papers there exists not in europe paper more violently oppose d to the cause of freedom than the times and neither its leaders nor its foreign correspondence are to be depended upon it is said to receive money from austria i know not whether this be true or whether it be merely subservient to the aristocratical feeling of england which is far more opposed to pg 399 pg 400 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https movements than is that of russia in england fear embitters hate it is droll to remember our reading in the ay down to the dust with them slaves they are to think how bitter the english were on the italians who succumbed and see how they hate those who resist and their cowardice here in italy is ludicrous it is they who run away at the least intimation of danger is they who invent all the fe fo fum stories about italy is they who write to the times and elsewhere that they dare not their lives stay in rome where i woman walk everywhere alone and all the little children the same with their nurses more of this anon letter xxxii progress of the tragedy ix disavows and the roman of of the city of the people crisis appr oaching rome june 21 it is now two weeks since the ﬁrst attack of oudinot and yet we hear nothing decisive from paris i know not yet what news may have come last night but by the morning mail we did not even receive notice that lesseps had arrived in paris whether lesseps was consciously the servant of all these base intrigues time will show his conduct was boyish and foolish if it was not treacherous the only object seemed to be to create panic to agitate to take possession of rome somehow though what to with it if they could get it the french government would hardly know pius in his allocution of the 29th of april last has explained himself fully he has disavowed every liberal act which ever seemed to emanate from him with the exception of the amnesty he has shamelessly recalled his refusal to let austrian blood be shed while roman ﬂows daily at his request he has implicitly declared that his future government could he return would be absolute despotism dispelled the last lingering illusion of those still anxious to apologize him only prisoner now in the hands of the cardinals and the king of naples the last frail link is broken that bound to him the people of rome and could the french restore him they must frankly avow themselves abandon entirely and fully the position they took in february 1848 and declare themselves the allies of austria and of russia meanwhile they persevere in the jesuitical policy that has already disgraced and is to ruin them after week of vain assaults oudinot sent to rome the following letter which i translate well the answers it elicited letter of general oudinot intended the roman constituent assembly the triumvirate the generalissimo and the commander of the national guar general events of war have you know conducted the french army to the gates of rome should the entrance into the city remain closed against us i should see myself constrained to employ

recourse to such terrib le necessity i think it my duty to make last appeal to people who can not have toward france sentiments of hostility the roman army wishes doubt equally with myself to spare bloody ruin to the capital of the christian world with this conviction i pray you signore general to give the enclosed proclamation the most speedy publicity if twelve hours after this despatch shall

occasionally to answer the ﬁre of your batteries we approach these last moments when the necessities of war burst out in terrible calamities spare them to city fall of so many glorious memories if you persist in repelling us on you alone will fall the responsibility of irreparable disasters the following are the answers of the various functionaries to whom this letter was sent answer of the assembl

french republic convention which we conﬁrmed soon after your protest it must consider that convention obligatory both parties and indeed safeguard of the rights of nations until it has been ratiﬁed or declined by the government of france therefore the assembly must regard violation of that convention every hostile act of the french army since the 31st of may and all others that shall take place before the resolution of your government can be made known and before the expiration of the time agreed upon the armistice you demand general an answer correspondent to the intentions and power of france nothing could be more conformable with the intentions and power of franc than to cease ﬂagrant violation of the rights of nations whatever may be the results of such violation the people of

accept the triumvirs armellini mazzini saffi observe the miserable evasion of this missive of oudinot the fortune of war has conducted us what war he pretended to come friend protector is enraged only because after his deceits at civita vecchia rome will not trust him within her walls this he daily sacriﬁces hundreds of lives the roman people can not be hostile to the french indeed they were not disposed to be so they had been stirred to emulation by the example of france they had warmly hoped in her their true ally it required all that oudinot has done to turn their faith to contempt and aversion pg 405 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https man he knows now that he comes upon city which wished to receive him only friend and he cries with my cannon with my bombs i will compel you to let betray you the conduct of enough tenfold blacker now that while the plenipotentiary is absent with the treaty to be ratiﬁed her army daily assails rome in vain after receiving these answers to his letter and proclamation oudinot turned all the force of his cannonade to make breach and began what one even in these days has believed possible the bombardment of rome yes the french who pretend to be the advanced guard of civilization are bombarding rome they dare take the risk of destr oying the richest bequests made to man by the great past nay they seem to it in an especially barbarous manner it was thought they would avoid much possible the hospitals the wounded marked to their view by the black banner and the places where are the most precious monuments but several bombs have fallen on the chief hospital and the capitol evidently is especially aimed at they made breach in the wall but it was immediately ﬁlled up with barricad and all the week they have been repulsed in every attempt they made to gain ground though with considerable loss of life on our side on theirs it must be great but how great we can not know ponte molle the scene of raphael fresco of battle in the vatican saw again ﬁerce struggle last friday more than ﬁfty were brought wounded into rome but wounds and assaults only ﬁre more and more the courage of her defenders they feel the justice of their cause and the peculiar iniquity of this aggression in proportion there seems little aid to be hoped from man they seem to claim it from god the noblest sentiments are heard from every lip and thus far their acts amply correspond on the eve of the bombardment one or two ofﬁcers went round with ﬁne band it played on the piazzas the marseillaise and roman marches and when the people were thus assembled they were told of the proclamation and asked how they felt many shouted loudly guerra viva la republica romana afterward bands of young men went round singing the chorus vogliamo sempre quella vogliamo liberta we want always one thing we want liberty guitars played and some danced when the bombs began to come one of the trasteverini those noble images of the old roman race redeemed her claim to that descent by seizing bomb and extinguishing the match she received medal and reward in money soldier did the same thing at palazza spada where is the statue of pompey at whose base great cæsar fell he was promoted immediately the people were seized with emulation armed with pans of wet clay they ran wherever the bombs fell to extinguish them women collect the balls from the hostile cannon and carry them to ours thus very little injury has been done to life the people cry madonna protects us against the bombs she wills not that rome should be destroyed meanwhile many poor people are drive n from their homes and provisions are growing very dear the heats are now terrible us and must be far more so the french it is said vast number are ill of fever indeed it can not be otherwise oudinot himself has it and perhaps this is one explanation of the mixture of violence and weakness in his actions he must be deeply ashamed at the poor result of his bad acts at the end of two weeks and so much bravado he has done nothing to rome unless intercept provisions kill some of her brave youth and injure churches which should be

followed the news of the surrender of ancona and rome found herself alone though venice continued to hold out all communication was cut of the republican troops almost to man left ancona but long

also not only sustained the exhausting service by day but were harassed at night by attacks feigned or real these commonly began about eleven or twelve at night just when all who meant to rest were fairly asleep i can imagine the harassing effect upon the troops from what i feel in my sheltered pavilion in consequence of not knowing quiet night sleep month the bombardment became constantly more serious the house where i live was ﬁlled early the 20th with persons obliged to ﬂy from the piazza di gesu where the ﬁery rain fell thickest the night of the we were all alarmed about two by tremendous cannonade it was the moment when the breach was ﬁnally made by which the french entered they rushed in and i grieve to say that by the only instance of defection known in the course of the siege those companies of the regiment union which had in charge position on that point yielded to panic and abandoned it the french immediately entered and intrenched themselves that was the fatal

but full of feeling and sustained from the houses would have been match even their disciplined troops after the 22d of june the slaughter of the romans became every day more fearful their defences were knocked down by the heavy cannon of the french and entirely exposed in their valorous onsets great numbers perished on the spot those who were brought into the hospitals were generally grievously wounded very commonly subjects amputation my heart bled daily more and more at these sights and i could not feel much myself though now the balls and bombs began to fall round also the night of the 28th the effect was truly fearful they whizzed and burst near many thirty fell upon or near the hotel russie where cass has his temporary abode the roof of the studio in the pavilion tenanted by stermer well known to the visitors of rome his cabinet pictures was torn to pieces i sat alone in my much exposed apartment thinking if one strikes i only hope it will kill at once and that god will transport my soul to some sphere where virtue and love are not tyrannized over by egotism and brute force in this however that night passed the next we had reason to expect still more ﬁery salute toward the pincian here alone remained three or four pieces of cannon which could be used but on the morning of the 30th in contest at the foot of the janic ulum the line old papal troops naturally not in earnest like the free corps refused to ﬁght against odds so terrible the heroic marina fell with hundreds of his devoted lombards garibaldi saw his best ofﬁcers perish and himself went in the afternoon to say to the assembly that further resistance was unavailing the assembly sent to oudinot but he refused any conditions even to guarantee safe departure to garibaldi his brave foe notwithstanding great number of men left the other regiments to follow the leader whose courage had captivated them and whose superiority over difﬁculties commanded their entire conﬁdence toward the evening of monday the 2d of july it was known that the french were preparing to cross the river and take possession of all the city i went into the corso with some friends it was ﬁlled with citizens and military the carriage was stopped by the crowd near the doria palace the lancers of garibaldi galloped along in full career i longed sir walter scott to be on earth again and see them all are light athletic resolute ﬁgures many of the forms of the ﬁnest manly beauty of the south all sparkling with its genius and ennobled by the resolute spirit ready to dare to to die we followed them to the piazza of john lateran never have i seen sight so beautiful so romantic and so sad whoever knows rome knows the peculiar solemn grandeur of that piazza scene of the ﬁrst triumph of rienzi and whence may be seen the magniﬁcence of the mother of all churches the baptistery with its porphyry columns the santa scala with its glittering mosaics of the early ages the obelisk standing fairest of any of those most imposing monuments of rome the view through the gates of the campagna on that side so richly strewn with ruins the sun was setting the crescent moon rising the ﬂower of the italian youth were marshalling in that solemn place they had been driven from every other spot where they had offered their hearts bulwarks of italian independence in this last they had sacriﬁced hecatombs of their best and bravest in that cause they must now go or remain prisoners and slaves wher go they knew not except distant hungary there is not now spot which would receive them or where they can act honor commands they had all put on the beautiful dress of the garibaldi legion the tunic of bright red cloth the greek cap or else round hat with puritan plume their long hair was blown back from resolute faces all looked full of courage they had counted the cost before they entered on this perilous struggl they had weighed life and all its material advantages against liberty and made their election they turned not back nor ﬂinched at this bitter crisis i saw the wounded all that could go laden upon their bagg age cars some were already pale and fainting still they wished to go i saw many youths born to rich inheritance carrying in handker chief all their worldly goods the women were ready their eyes too were resolved if sad the wife of garibaldi followed him on pg 412 pg 413 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https he himself was distinguished by the white tunic his look was entirely that of hero of the middle ages face still young the excitements of his life though so many have all been youthful and there is fatigue upon his brow or cheek fall or stand one sees in him man engaged in the career which he is adapted by nature he went upon the parapet and looked upon the road with and obstruction being in sight he turned his face moment back upon rome then led the way through the gate hard was the heart stony and seared the eye that had tear that moment go fated gallant band and if god care not indeed men the sparrows most of ye go forth to perish and rome anew the niobe must she lose also these beautiful and brave that promised her regeneration and would have given it but the perﬁdy the overpowering force of the foreign intervention i know that many respectable gentlemen would be surprised to hear speak in this way gentlemen who perform their duties to society by buying themselves handsome clothes and furniture with the interest of their money speak of garibaldi and his men brigands and vagabonds such are they doubtless in the same sense jesus moses and eneas were to men who can throw so lightly aside the ease of wealth the joys of affection the sake of what they deem honor in whatsoever form are the respectable doubt there are in these bands number of men of lawless minds and who follow this banner only because there is them other path but the greater part are the noble youths who have ﬂed from the austrian conscription or ﬂy now from the renewal of the papal suf focation darkened by french protection the protectors they entirely threw aside the mask it was always supp osed they would the moment they had possession of rome i not know whether they were really so bewildered by their priestly counsellors to imagine they would be well received in city which they had bombarded and where twelve hundred men were lying wounded by their assault to say nothing of the justice or injustice of the matter it could not be supposed that the roman people if it had any sense of dignity would welcome them i did not appear in the street i would not give any countenance to such wrong but an english lady my friend told they seemed to look expectingly the strong party of friends they had always pretended to have within the walls the french ofﬁcers looked up to the windows ladies and she being the only one they saw saluted her she made reply they then passed into the corso many were assembled the softer romans being unable to control curiosity the milanese would have disclaimed but preserving an icy silence in an evil hour foolish priest dared to break it by the cry of viva pio nono the populace roused to fury rushed on him with their knives he was much wounded one or two others were killed in the rush the people howled then and hissed at the french who advancing their bayonets and clearing the way before them fortiﬁed themselves in the piazzas next day the french troops were marched to and fro through rome to inspire awe in the people but it has only created disgust amounting to loathing to see that with such an imposing force and in great part fresh the french were not ashamed to use bombs also and kill women and children in their beds oudinot then seeing the feeling of the people and ﬁnding they pursued spy any man who so much showed the way to his soldiers the italians went out of the cafés if frenchmen entered short that the people regard ed him and his followers in the same light the austrians declared martial law in rome the press is stiﬂed everybody is to be in the house at half past nine in the evening and whoever in any way insults his men or puts any obstacle in their way is to be shot the fruits of all this will be the same elsewhere temporary repression will sow the seeds of perpetual resistance and never was rome in so fair way to be educated republican form of government now especially could nothing be more irritat ing to an italian population in the month of july than to drive them to their homes at half past nine after the insupportable heat of the day their only enjoyment and refreshment are found in evening walks and chats together they sit before their cafés or in groups outside some friendly door now they must pg 414 pg 415 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https home when the drum beats at nine they are forbidden to stand or sit in groups and this by their bombarding protector comment is unnecessary french soldiers are daily missing of some it is known that they have been killed by the trasteverini daring to make court to their women of more than hundred and ﬁfty it is only known that they can not he found and in two days of french order more acts of violence have been committed than in two months under the triumvirate the french have taken up their quarters in the of the quirinal and venetian palaces which are full of the wounded many of whom have been driven igh mad and their burning wounds exasperated by the sound of the drums and trumpets constant sense of an insulting presence the wounded have been warned to leave the quirinal at the end of eight days though there are many who can not be moved from bed to bed without causing them great anguish and peril nor is it known that any other place has been provided hospital them at the palazzo di venezia the french have searched three emigrants whom they wished to imprison even in the apartments where the wounded were lying runnin g their bayonets into the mattresses they have taken themselves beds given by the romans to the hospital public property but private gift the hospital of santo spirito was governmental establishment and in using part of it the wounded its director had been retained because he had the reputation of being honest and not illiberal but soon the french entered he with true priestly baseness sent away the women nurses saying he had longer money to pay them transported the wounded into miserable airless basement that had before been used granary and appropriated the good apartments to the use of the french july the report of this morning is that the french yesterday violated the domicile of our consul brown pretending to search persons hidden there that brown banner in one hand and sword in the other repelled the assault and fairly drove them down stairs that then he made them an appropriate speech though in mixed language of english french and italian that the crowd vehemently applauded brown who already was much liked the warm sympathy he had shown the romans in their aspirations and their distresses and that he then donned his uniform and went to oudinot to make his protest how this was received i know not but understand brown departed with his family yesterday evening will america look coldly on the insult to herself she has on the struggle of this injured people an edict is out to disarm the national guard the generous protectors wish to take all the trouble upon themselves rome is full of them at every step are met groups in the uniform of france with faces bronzed in the african war and so stultiﬁed by life without enthusiasm and without thought that i not believe napoleon would recognize them french soldiers the effect of their appearance compared with that of the italian free corps is that of body compared with spirit it is easy to see how they could be used to purposes so contrary to the legitimate policy of france they not look more intellectual more ﬁtted to have opinions of their own than the austrian soldiery july the plot thickens the exact facts with regard to the invasion of brown s house i have not been able to ascertain i suppose they will be published oudinot has promised to satisfy cass i must add in reference to what i wrote some time ago of the position of our envoy here that the kind and sympathetic course of cass toward the republicans in these troubles his very gentlemanly and courteous bearing have from the minds of most removed all unpleasant feelings they see that his position was very peculiar to the papal government ﬁnding here the republican and just at that moment violently assailed unless he had extraordinary powers he naturally felt obliged to communicate further with our gover nment before acknowledging this i shall always regret however that he did not stand free to occupy the high position that belonged to the pg 416 pg 417 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america and europe by margaret fuller ossoli https of the united states at that moment and peculiarly because it was by republic that the roman republic was betrayed but i say the plot thickens yesterday three families were carried to prison because boy crowed like cock at the french soldiery from the windows of the house they occupied another because man pursued took refuge in their at the same time the city being mostly disarmed came the edict to take down the insignia of the republic emblems of anarchy but worst of all they have done is an edict commanding all foreigners who had been in the service of the republican government to leave rome within hours this is the most infamous thing done yet it drives to desperation those who stayed because they had so many to go with and place to go to or because their relatives lie wounded here others wished to remain in rome under present circumstances i am sick of breathing the same air with men capable of part so utterly cruel and false soon i can i shall take refuge in the mountains if it be possible to ﬁnd an obscure nook unpervaded by these convulsions let not my friends be surprised if they not hear from some time i may not feel like writing i have seen too much sorrow and alas without power to aid it make s sick to see the palaces and streets of rome full of these infamous foreigners and to note the already changed aspect of her population the men of rome had begun ﬁlled with new hopes to develop unknown energy walked quick their eyes sparkled they delighted in duty in responsibility in year of such life their effeminacy would have been vanquished now dejectedly unemployed they lounge along the streets feeling that all the implements of labor all the ensigns of hope have been

conquer viva rome the capital of italy viva the italy of the people viva the roman republic roman rome july 4 1849 yes july 4th the day so joyously celebrated in our land is that of the entran ce of the french into rome i know not whether the romans will follow out this programme with constancy the sterner milanese have done if they can it will draw upon them endless persecutions countless exactions but at once educate and prove them worthy of nobler life yesterday i went over the scene of conﬂict it was fearful even to see the casinos quattro venti and vascello where the french and romans had been several days so near one another all shattered to pieces with fragments of rich stucco and painting still sticking to rafters between the great holes made by the cannonade and think that men had stayed and fought in them when only mass of ruins the french indeed were entirely sheltered the last days to my unpractised eyes the extent and thoroughness of their works seemed miraculous and gave the ﬁrst clear idea of the incompetency of the italians to resist organized armies i saw their commanders had not even known enough of the art of war to understand how the french were conducting the siege it is true their resources were at any rate inadequate to resistance only continual sorties would have arrested the progress of the foe and to make them and man the wall their forces were inadequate i was struck more than ever by the heroic valor of our people so call them now ever go where i may large part of my heart will ever remain in italy i hope her children will always acknowl edge sister though i drew not my ﬁrst breath here contadini showed where braves are buried beneath heap of wall that fell upon them in the shock of one cannonade marble nymph with broken arm looked sadly that way from her fountain some roses were blooming still some red oleanders amid the ruin the sun was casting its last light on the mountains on the tranquil sad campagna that sees one leaf more turned in the book of woe this was in the vascello i then entered the french ground all mapped and hollowed like honeycomb pair of skeleton legs protruded from bank of one barricade lower dog had scratched away its light covering of earth from the body of man and discovered it lying face upward all dressed the dog stood gazing on it with an air of stupid amazement i thought at that moment recalling some letters received men and women of america spared these frigh tful sights these sudden wrecks of every hope what angel of heaven you suppose has time to listen to your tales of morbid woe if any ﬁnd leisure to work men think you not they have enough to to care the victims here i see you have meetings where you speak of the italians the hungarians i pray you something let it not end in mere cry of sentiment that is better than to sneer at all that is liberal like the english to talk of the holy victims of patriotism anarchists and brigands but it is not enough it ought not to content your consciences you owe tithe to heaven the privilege s it has showered on you whose achievement so many here suffer and perish daily deserve to retain them by helping your pg 420 pg

absence of which always made sick in our own country here at least one does not suffer from obtuseness or indifference they take pleasure too in acts of kindness they are bountiful but it is useless

two hours later and that i could have place in that if i liked so i accepted the weather had been beautiful but on the eve of the day ﬁxed my departure the wind rose and the rain fell in torrents i observed that the river which passed my window was much swollen and rushed with great violence in the night i heard its voice still stronger and felt glad i had not to set out in the dark i rose at twilight and was expecting my carriage and wondering at its delay when i heard that the great diligence several miles below had been seized by torrent the horses were up to their necks in water before any one dreamed of danger the postilion called on all the saints and threw himself into the water tire door of the diligence could not be opened and tire passengers forced themselves one after another into the cold water it was dark too had i been there i had fared pair of strong men were ill after it though all escaped with life several days there was going to rome but at last we set forth in two great diligences with all the horses of the route many miles the mountains and ravines were covered with snow i seemed to have returned to my own country and climate few miles were passed before the conducto r injured his leg under the wheel and i had the pain of seeing him suffer all the way while blood of jesus and souls in purgatory was the mildest beginning of an answer to the jeers of the postilions upon his paleness we stopped at miserable osteria in whose cellar we found magniﬁcent relic of cyclopean architecture indeed in italy one is paid at every step discomfort and danger by some precious subject of thought we proceeded very slowly and reached just at night solitary little inn which marks the site of the ancient home of the sabine virgins snatched away to become the mothers of rome we were there saluted with the news that the tiber also had overﬂowed its banks and it was very doubtful if we could pass but what else to there were accommodations in the house thirty people or even three and to sleep in the carriages in that wet air of the marshes was more certain danger than to attempt the passage so we set forth the moon almost at the full smiling sadly on the ancient grandeurs half draped in mist and anon drawing over her face thin white veil we approached the tiber the towers and domes of rome could be seen like cloud lying low on the horizon the road and the meadows alike under water jay between us and it one sheet of silver the horses entered they behaved nobly we proceeded every moment uncertain if the water would not become deep but the scene was beautiful and i enjoyed it highly i have never yet felt afraid when really in the presence of danger though sometimes in its apprehension at last we entered the gate the diligence stopping to be examined i walked to the gate of villa ludovisi and saw its rich shrubberies of myrtle so pale and eloquent in the moonlight my dear friend madame arconati has shown generous love contadina whom i

suffering before the misfortunes of other regions of italy the defeat at novara preconcerted in hope to strike the last blow at italian independ ence the surrender and painful condition of genoa the unless the government could secure conﬁdence abroad well at home her people from ﬁnding that foothold which they were ready the vacillations of france agitated them still they could not seriously believe she would ever act the part she has we must say france because though many honorable men have washed their hands of all share in the perﬁdy the assembly voted funds to sustain the expedition to civita vecchia and the nation the army have remained quiescent one was one could be deceived to the scope of this expedition it was intended to restore the pope to the temporal sovereignty from which the people by the use of suffrage had deposed him doubt the french in case of success proposed to temper the triumph of austria and naples and stipulate conditions that might soothe the romans and make their act less odious they were probably deceived also by the representations of gaëta and believed that large party which had been intimidated by the republicans would declare in favor of the pope when they found themselves likely to be sustained but this last pretext can in noway avail them they landed at civita vecchia and one declared the pope they marched on rome placards were afﬁxed within the walls by hands unknown calling upon the papal party to rise within the town not soul stirred the french had excuse left pretending to believe that the present government was not entirely acceptable to the people notwithstanding they assail the gates they ﬁre upon peter and their balls pierce the vatican they were repulsed they deserved retired in quick and shameful defeat surely the brave french soldiery could not if they had not been demoralized by the sense of what an infamous course they were pursuing france eager to destroy the last hope of italian emancipation the alguazil of austria the soldiers of republican france ﬁring upon republican rome if there be angel well demon powers that interfere in the affairs of men those bullets could scarcely fail to be turned back against their own breasts yet roman blood has ﬂowed also i saw how it stained the walls of the vatican gardens on the 30th of ﬁrst anniversary of the appearance of pius ix too famous encyclic letter shall he shall any pope ever again walk peacefully in these gardens it seems impossible the temporal sovereignty of the popes is virtually destroyed by their shameless merciless measures taken to restore it the spiritual dominion ultimately falls too into irrevocable ruin what may be the issue at this moment we can not guess the french have retired to civita vecchia but whether to reëmbark or to await reinforcements we know not the neapolitan force has halted within few miles of the walls it is not large and they are undoubtedly surprised at the discomﬁture of the french perhaps they wait the austrians but we not yet hear that these have entered the romagna meanwhile rome is strongly barricaded and though she can not stand always against world in arms she means at least to so long possible mazzini is at her head she has now guide who understands his faith and all there is of noble spirit will show itself we all feel very sad because the idea of bombs barbarously thrown in and in rome is peculiarly dreadful apart from all the blood and anguish inevitable at such times the glories of art may perish and mankind be forever despoiled of the most beautiful inheritance yet i would defend rome to the last moment she must not be false to the higher hope that has dawned upon her she must not fall back again into servility and corruption and one is willing the interference of the french has roused the weakest to resistance from the austrians from the neapolitans they cried we expected this but from the is too infamous it can not be borne and they all ran to arms and fought

narratives the memoirs of my sister contain most faithful description but they are accessible to all and i trust will be read by all who have read this volume i have chosen rather to give the accounts somewhat condensed which appeared in the new york tribune at the time of the calamity the ﬁrst is from the pen of bayard taylor who visited the scene on the day succeeding the wreck and describes the appearance of the shore and the remains of the vessel this is followed by the narrative of hasty wife of the captain herself participant in the scene and so overwhelmed by grief at her husband loss

making the passage on landing among the oakes admitted into his house and gave place of rest the remaining two or three hours of the night this morning i visited the wreck traversed the beach some extent on both sides and collected all the particulars that are now likely to be obtained relative to the closing scenes of this terrible disaster the sand is strewn distance of three or four miles with fragments of planks spars boxes and the merchandise with which the vessel was laden with the exception of piece of her broadside which ﬂoated to the shore intact all the timbers have been so chopped and broken by the sea that scarcely stick of ten feet in length can be found in front of the wreck these fragments are piled up along water mark to the height of several feet while farther in among the are scattered casks of almonds stove in and their contents mixed with the sand sacks of juniper about half the hull remains under water not more than ﬁfty yards from the shore the spars and rigging belonging to the foremast with part of the mast itself are still attached to the ruins surging over them at every swell jonathan smith the agent of the underwriters intended to have the launched this morning the purpose of cutting away the rigging and ascertaining how the wreck lies but the sea is still too high from what i can learn the loss of the elizabeth is mainly to be attributed to the inexperience of the mate bangs who acted captain after leaving gibraltar by his own statement he supposed he was somewhere between cape may and barnegat on thursday evening the vessel was consequently running northward and struck head on at the second thump hole was broken in her side the seas poured through and over pg 444 pg 445 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in

the cabin in their to take refuge on the forecastle which was the least exposed part of the vessel they succeeded with great difﬁculty hasty the widow of the late captain fell into hatchway from which she was dragged by sailor who seized her by the hair the swells increased continually and the danger of the vessel giving way induced several of the sailors to commit themselves to the waves previous to this they divested themselves of their clothes which they tied to pieces of plank and sent ashore these were immediately seized upon by the beach pirates and never afterward recovered the carpenter cut loose some planks and spars and upon one of these madame ossoli was advised to trust herself the captain promising to go in advance with her boy she refused saying that she had wish to live without the child and would not at that hour give the care of it to another hasty then took hold of plank in company with the second mate davis through whose assistance she landed safely thoug h terribly bruised by the ﬂoating timber the captain clung to hatch and was washed ashore insensible where he was resuscitated by the efforts of oakes and several others who were by this time collected on the beach most of the men were entirely destitute of clothing and some who were exhausted and ready to let go their hold were saved by the islanders who went into the surf with lines about their waists and caught them the young italian girl celesta pardena who was bound new york where she had already lived in the family of henry peters gray the artist was at ﬁrst greatly alarmed and uttered the most piercing screams by the exertions of the ossolis she was quieted and apparently resigned to her fate the passengers reconciled themselves to the idea of death at the proposal of the marquis ossoli some time was spent in prayer after which all sat down calmly to await the parting of the vessel the marchioness ossoli was entreated by the sailors to leave the vessel or at least to trust her child to them but she steadily refused early in the morning some men had been sent to the lighthouse the which is kept there although this is but two miles distant the boat did not arrive till about one by which time the gale had so increased and the swells were so high and terriﬁc that it was impossible to make any use of it mortar was also brought the purpose of ﬁring line over the vessel to stretch hawser between it and the shore the mortar was stationed on the lee of hillock about hundred and ﬁfty rods from the wreck that the powder might be kept dry it was ﬁred ﬁve times but failed to carry line more than half the necessary distance just before the forecastle sunk the remaining sailors determined to leave the steward with whom the child had always been great favorite took it almost by main force and plunged with it into the sea neither reached the shore alive the marquis ossoli was soon afterwards washed away but his wife remained in ignorance of his fate the cook who was the last person that reached the shore alive said that the last words he heard her speak were i see nothing but death before shall never reach the shore it was between two and three in the afternoon and

braid hats wool oil almonds and other articles contained in the vessel were carried off soon they came to land on sunday there were nearly thousand persons here from all parts of the coast between rockaway and montauk and more than half of them were engaged in secreting and carrying off everything that seemed to be of value the two bodies found yesterday were those of sailors all have now come

the elizabeth from conversation with hasty widow of the captain of the elizabeth we gather the following particulars of her voyage and its melancholy termination we have already stated that captain hasty was prostrated eight days after leaving leghorn by disease which was regarded and treated fever but which ultimately exhibited itself of the most malignant type he died of it just the vessel reached gibraltar and his remains were committed to the deep after short detention in quarantine the elizabeth resumed her voyage on the 8th ultimo and was long bafﬂed by adverse winds two days from gibraltar the terrible disease which had proved fatal to the captain attacked the child of the ossolis beautiful boy of two years and many days his recovery was regarded hopeless his eyes were completely close d ﬁve days his head deprived of all shape and his whole person covered with pustules yet through the devoted attention of his parents and their friends he survived and at length gradually recovered only few scars and red spots remained on his face and body and these were disappearing to the great joy of his mother who felt solicitous that his rare beauty should not be marred

progre ss the wind shifted and blew strongly from the southwest several days sweeping them rapidly on their course until on thursday evening last they knew that they were near the end of their voyage their trunks were brought up and repacked in anticipation of speedy arrival in port meantime the breeze gradually swelled to gale which became decided about nine on that evening but their ship was new and strong and all retired to rest usual they were running west and supposed themselves about sixty miles farther south than they actually were by their reckoning they would be just off the harbor of new york next morning about half past two bangs the mate in command took soundings and reported fathoms he said that depth insured their safety till daylight and turned in again of course all was thick around the vessel and the storm howling ﬁercely one hour afterward the ship struck with great violence and in moment was fast aground she was stout brig of 531 tons ﬁve years old heavily laden with marble and drawing seventeen feet water had she been light she might have ﬂoated over the bar into twenty feet water and all on board could have been saved she struck rather sidewise than bows on canted on her side and stuck fast the mad waves making clear sweep over her pouring down into the cabin through the skylight which was destroyed one side of the cabin was immediately and permanently under water the other frequently drenched the passengers who were all up in moment chose the most sheltered positions and there remained calm earnest and resigned to any fate long three hours land was

mistaken rocks which made the prospect still more dismal the young ossoli cried little with discom fort and fright but was soon hushed to sleep our friend margaret had two but one of them proved unﬁt use all the boats had been smashed in pieces or torn away soon after the vessel struck and it would have been madness to launch them in the dark if it had been possible to launch them at all with the waves charging over the wreck every moment sailor soon after light took madame ossoli serviceable and swam ashore with it in quest of aid those left on board and arrived safe but of course could not return his means of deliverance by 7 it became evident that the cabin must soon go to pieces and indeed it was scarcely tenantable then the crew were collected in the forecastle which was stronger and less exposed the vessel having settled by the stem and the sailors had been repeatedly ordered to go aft and help the passengers forward but the peril was so great that none obeyed at length the second mate davis went himself and accompanied the italian girl celesta pardena safely to the forecastle though with great difﬁculty madame ossoli went next and had narrow escape from being washed away but got over her child was placed in bag tied around sailor neck and thus carried safely marquis ossoli and the rest followed each convoyed by the mate or one of the sailors all being collected in the forecastle it was evident that their position was still most perilous and that the ship could not much longer hold together the women were urged to try ﬁrst the experiment of taking each plank and committing themselves to the waves madame ossoli refused thus to be separated from her husband and child she had from the ﬁrst expressed willingness to live or die with them but not to live without them hasty was the ﬁrst to try the plank and though the struggle was some time doubtful one did ﬁnally reach the shore utterly exhausted there was strong current setting to the westward so that though the wreck lay but quarter of mile from the shore she landed three fourths of mile distant other woman and passenger survives though several of the crew came ashore after she did in similar manner the last who came reports that the child had been washed away from the man who held it before the ship broke up that ossoli had in like manner been washed from the foremast to which he was clinging but in the horror of the moment margaret never learned that those she so clung to had preceded her to the spirit land those who remained of the crew had just persuaded her to trust herself to plank in the belief that ossoli and their child had already started the shore when just she was stepping down great wave broke pg 449 pg 450 pg 451 at home and abroad or things and thoughts in america

reported but both mates and most of the crew got on one fragment or another it was supposed that those of them who were drowned were struck by ﬂoating spars or planks and thus stunned or disabled so to preclude all chance of their rescue we not know at the time of this writing whether the manuscript of our friend work on italy and her late struggles has been saved we fear it has not been one of

department of reviews and criticism on current literature art music position which she ﬁlled nearly two years eminently our readers well know her reviews of longfellow poems wesley memoirs poe poems

conﬂuent of the most malign ant type and terminated his life soon after they touched at gibraltar after sickness of intense agony and loathsome horror the vessel was detained some days in quarantine by reason of this afﬂiction but ﬁnally set sail again on the 8th ultimo just in season to bring her on our coast on the fearful night between thursday and friday last when darknes s rain and terriﬁc gale from the southwest the most dangerous quarter possible conspired to hurl her into the very jaws of destruction it is said but we know not how truly that the mate in command since the captain death mistook the fire island light that on the highlands of neversink and so fatally miscalculated his course but it is hardly probable that any other than fully manned ship could have worked off that coast under such gale blowing him directly toward the roaring breakers she struck during the night and before the next evening the elizabeth was mass of drifting sticks and planks while her passengers and part of her crew were buried in the boiling surges alas that our gifted friend and those nearest to and most loved by her should have been among them pg 454 pg 455 at home and abroad or
