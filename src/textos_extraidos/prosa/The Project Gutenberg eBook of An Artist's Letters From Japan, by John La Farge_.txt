letters from japan yokohama july 3 arrived yesterday on the cover of the letter which i mailed from our steamer i had but time to write we are coming in it is like the picture books anything that i can add will only be ﬁlling in of detail we were in the great bay when i came up on deck in the early morning the sea was smooth like the brilliant blank paper of the prints vast surface of water reﬂecting the light of the sky if it were thicker air streaks of blue light like ﬁnest washes of the brush determined distances beyond in white haze the square white sails spotted the white horizon and ﬂoated above it the slackened beat of the engine made great noise in the quiet waters distant high hills of foggy green marked the new land nearer us junks of the shapes you know in violet transparency of shadow and ﬁve or six and steamers red and black or white looking barbarous and out of place but still if they were part of us and spread all around us ﬂeet of small boats manned by rowers standing in robes ﬂapping about them or tucked in above their waists there were so many that the crowd looked blue and the color of their dresses repeating the sky in prose still the larger part were mostly naked and their legs and arms and backs made great novelty to our eyes accustomed to nothing but our ship and the enormous space empty of life which had surrounded us days the muscles of the boatmen stood out sharply on their small frames they had almost least those who were wrists and delicate hands and handsome setting of the neck the foot looked broad with toes very square they were excitedly waiting to help in the coaling and unloading and soon we saw them begin to work carrying great loads with much chatter ing around us played the smallest boats with rowers standing up and sculling then the came rushing to us its standing rowers bending and rising their thighs roundi ng and insteps sharpening what small garments they had ﬂuttering like scarfs so that our fair missionaries turned their backs to the sight two boys struggling at the great sculls in one of the small boats were called by us out of the crowd and carried us off to look at the outgoing steamer which takes our mail and which added its own confusion and its attendant crowd of boats to all the animation on the water delicious and curious moment this ﬁrst sense of being free from the big prison of the ship of the pleasure of directing one own course of not understanding word of what one hears and yet of getting at meaning through every sense of being close to the top of the waves on which we dance instead of looking down upon them from the tall ship sides of seeing the small pg 1 pg 2 pg 3 the project gutenberg ebook of an artist letters from japan by john la farge https of the boys burning yellow in the sun and noticing how they recall the dolls of their own country in the expression of their eyes how every little detail of the boat is different and yet so curiously the same and return to the ﬁrst sensation of feeling while lying ﬂat on the bottom of the boat at the level of our faces the tossing water dotted with innumerable orange copies of the sun then subtle inﬂuences of odor the sense of something very foreign of the presence of another race came up with the smell of the boat we climbed up the side of the big steamer and found the doctor there who told us that he had been expecting us whole month so that he soon took possession of us and we found ourselves in the hotel launch and at the wharf and passing the custom house and its ofﬁcers who let everything go through quickly except my suspicious water blocks outside of the gate in the street we found the jinrikisha an arrangement that you know probably well i perambulator or gig very small with hood that is usually lowered and with man in the shafts our fellows were in clothes big inscription on their backs and they wore vests trousers and broad straw hats poised on their heads but you know all about these and i have only to add that we were trundled off to our hotel along the pretty quay which edges that part of the town past european houses unlike ours and having certain character which will probab ly appear very commonplace later because it is not beautiful but which is novel yet to us our hotel is also on the quay just at corner where canal breaks in and where we can see big walls and trees on the other side our rooms open on the same blue water spangled with sunshine and fading into sky there and steamers far out picturesque junks sailing past rapidly ﬂattened out into mere edges of shadow and light against the sea and the sky their great hollow sterns with the rudder far inboard and sails which are open at the seams not far from us was little boat with man ﬁshing his big round hat important any part of the boat it was already late in the day european children were out with their japanese nurses from time to time phaeton or curricle passed with european occupants and even in this tremendous heat ladies rode out on horseback but the human beings are not the novelty not even the japanese what is absorbingly new is the light its whiteness its silvery milkiness we have come into it through an open door after fourteen gray days of the paciﬁc which ended only at sunrise this very morning and we looked again at all the light outside from the room where we lunched where the waiters slipped about in black clothes like those of the runners and where we were joined at table by foreign gentleman with high yellow face and slanting eyes and dressed in the latest european fashion with high collar scarf and pointed shoes he was very courteous and managed what little english he used skilfully he dresses and he gave touch of the far east in the story of his being here he is under cloud an amiable exile whose return to his native land might involve his being boiled in oil or other ingenious form of death well he ﬁgured at luncheon with us i hear that he has been obliged to leave because of his having poisoned too many of his guests one day at table enemies of his because of his having despatched with the sword those whose digestion had resisted his efforts at conciliation however this may be his extradition is demanded to which he objects invoking western ideas of civilization and protesting that his excesses have been merely political then late in the afternoon we sauntered out into the japanese so that we might mingle with the gray black and blue crowd and respectfully followed by our jinrikisha men who slowly dragge d our carriages behind them like grooms following their masters we stopped at little curio shops and pg 4 pg 7 the project gutenberg ebook of an artist letters from japan by john la farge https over miserable odds and ends calling up i feel sure the unexpressed contempt of the doctor the great collector of precious lacquers but it is so amusing to see things they are and not they should be we went into show which had an enormous draped sign outside and where in uncertain darkness an old miserable distorted dwarf played the part of spider in web to the accompaniment of ﬁendish music and the declamation of the showman then we lingered outside of booth in which wrestling match was going on but did not enter and we saw the big wrestlers go in or come out their shoulders far above the heads of smaller race of men and we turned at every moment to look at the children many of whom are so pretty and who seem to have an easy time of it men carry them in their arms women with us and many little elder sister walks about with the infant of the family slung behind her maternal shoulders and then there are curious combinations of western and eastern successful our hats and shoes and made here are used and our ugly shirts stiffen out the folds of the soft japanese robes but the multitude wear their usual dress and make abuse of hats the kuruma wearied by the novelty every detail of which however was known to us before we walked back in the white milky sunset which was like brilliant twilight july we made our ﬁrst visit to town yesterday that is to say we went to tokio which is about twenty miles off of course we took our jinrikishas at the door of the hotel and passing through the wide yokohama streets saw the houses some with high garden walls in which are small doors there are sidewalks too and european shops and colonial buildings and telegraph ofﬁce and the japanese kura or buildings with black and white earthen surfaces the black polished to glaze was done with greek and etruscan vases they have deep windows or doors recessed like our safes with great air of solidity which contrasts with that temporary wooden structure the usual japanese house i came near saying that the little railway station is like ours but it is better than most of ours with neat arrangements we enter ed the little cars i noticed in the third class japanese curled up on the seats the grade is level table the landscape is lovely and we saw the shapes we know so well in the curious shapes of the japanese pines little temples on the hillside and with their network of causeways occasional ly horse or peasant threading them the land is cultivated like garden the lotus leaves ﬁll the ditches and one or two pink ﬂowers are just out from time to time we saw stretches of blue sea and once an instant i looked up into the hazy clouded sky far beyond the hills that were lost in the mist into which the stretched i saw pale clear blue opening in which was an outline more distinct something very pure the edge of mountain looking if it belonged to another world than the dewy moist one in which we cone of pg 8 pg 9 the project gutenberg ebook of an artist letters from japan by john la farge https and moa t with lotus on passing through the station very much like the other with its various arrangements comfort and order and rooms and so forth met crowd of jinrikishas with their runners or my friends tell to call them kuruma and kurumaya every man clamoring patronage in the usual way of the hackman we selected leader chojiro who speaks little is traveled man having gone far constantinople wears the queue ﬂattened forward over the top of his shaven head and whose naked feet were to run through the day over roads which horse would need to be well shod little way from us on the square stood the car of the tramway which runs far asakusa to the great popular temples of protecting divinities kuwanon and jizo benten from whose shrine ﬂowed one day copper coins if from fountain buddhist sermons are preached daily which are full of innumerable images pictures and and where prayer duly turned helped the worshiper to be free from annoying sins or to obtain his desires how shall i describe our ride through the enormous city we were going far across it to call on professor the great authority on japanese art and to be delighted and instructed by him through some fragments of his collection pg 10 the project gutenberg ebook of an artist letters from japan by john la farge https the well in the ﬁrst street where the tramway runs there are façades to houses and in their pilasters the ionic capital has at length made the circle of the world then we took more oriental and narrower streets through the quarter of the the dancers and singers who go out perpetually to put ﬁnishing touch on entertainments at such early hours they are of course unseen where houses seemed more closed than usual servants were attending to household duties and we heard the occasional strum of guitar then great streets again with innumerable low houses the usual shops like open sheds with swinging signs carved painted and gilded or with draperies of black cloth marked with white characters merchants sat on their mats among the crowded goods girls at corners drew water from the wells in narrower street the black streak of ﬁle of bulls peacefully dragging merchandise where the crowd was thickest palanquin all closed in which was shut some obstinate adherent to ancient fashions then bridges and canals and great empty spaces long white walls with black copings and buildings that continued the walls with gratings like those of barracks these were the yashikis residences of princes who were formerly obliged to spend part of the year at the seat of government with small armies of retainers then the walls of the castle great sloping ramparts of irregular blocks of masonry about which stand strangely twisted while the great moats of clouded water are almost ﬁlled with the big leaves of the lotus now and then great gates of gray wood and enormous doors on some of the wide avenues we met cavalry ofﬁcers in european costume correct in style most of the younger with straggling mustaches long and thin whence their nickname of naturally connected with that of the cats devourers of ﬁsh the are called near ofﬁcial buildings we saw great deal of black and trousers and spectacles everything was seen at full run our runners dragging us at horse pace still it was long before we reached our destination streets succeeded streets empty or full in desolate oriental wearisomeness at length we stopped at little gate in plank fence and entered vast high space formerly prince park at one end of which we saw trees and hills and we came to the professor house little european structure my mind is yet too confused with many impressions to tell you of what we saw that afternoon and evening and what was said all the more that the few beautiful paintings we looked at out of the great collection lifted away from into an indeﬁnite great past i dislike to use analogies but before these ancient religious paintings of buddhist divinities symbolical of the elements or of protective powers whose worn surfaces contained marvel s of passionate delicacy and care framed in noble lines i could not help the recall of what i had once felt at the ﬁrst sight of old italian art pg 13 pg 14 the project gutenberg ebook of an artist letters from japan by john la farge https passed from this sense of exalted peace to plunge again into the crowded streets at night it was late we had many miles to go to catch the last train two additional runners had been engaged each kuruma to push one to be harnessed in front then began furious ride mine was the last carriage we were whirled along with warning cries of now into the dark then into some opening lighted by starlight in which i could see the ﬂitting shapes of the other runners and of my companions i remember the creaking of their carriages the jerking of them with each pull of the men then our crossing suddenly other parties lighted by lanterns like ourselves the lights ﬂaring upon yellow faces and dark dresses and black hair then our turning some narrow corner and plunging at full speed into lighted streets crowded with people through whom we seemed to cut our way much shouting of our men and dodging of wayfarers with lanterns and of bystanders who merely turn enough to let us glide by then one of my runners at full gallop struck post and was left behind another was gathered in somehow without stop and we tore through the city still more crowded we came nearer to our railway station we were in time and we slept in the now familiar train we reached the deserted station and were jogged peacefully to our hotel our men in japanese fashion sleepily turning out of the way of the ownerless dogs that lay in the middle of the streets and when i awoke in the morning i found that the day impressions had faded in sleep to what i tell you ancient july i have been asking myself whether it would be possible to have sensations novel to feel perfectly fresh things i knew almost all about beforehand had we come in any other way or arrived from any other quarter it is all this japan is sudden we have last been living at home are shut up in ship if boxed in with our own civilization and then suddenly with transition we are landed in another and under what splendor of light in what contrasting atmosphere it is if the sky in its variations were the great subject of the drama we are looking at or at least its great chorus the beauty of the light and of the air is what i should like to describe but it is almost like trying to account one own describing the key in which one plays and yet i have not begun to paint and i dread the moment of beginning to work again rather have i felt like yieldi ng entirely to the spirit in which i came the intention of rest of bath the brain in some water absolutely alien and i had undertaken that pg 17 the project gutenberg ebook of an artist letters from japan by john la farge https should bring books read books but come innocently we could the only compromise my keeping scientiﬁc japanese grammar which being ancient and unpractical might be allowed it would leave unready on the day i left the doctor took us on sunday afternoon to his name i think means the perfume of the see and to listen to some japanese plays which are given in the club theater built the purpose we went there in the afternoon passing by the shiba temples and our kurumas were drawn up at one end of the buildings there everything was japanese though i hear stories of the other club and its single eyeglasses etc however that may be on this side we were in japan without mistake we sat on the steps and had our shoes taken off according to the japanese fashion so not to injur mats and we could hear during the operation long wailings high notes and the piercing sound of ﬂutes and stringed instruments the curiously sad rhythm mingled with background of high distinct declamation we walked in with careful attention to make noise forgetting that in our we could have made none had we wished and we found the doctor place reserved him and us and marked with his name written large other low boxes with sides higher than our elbows we sat on the mats divided the sloping ﬂoor down to the stage the stage was pretty little building projecting into the great hall from its long side it had its own roof and connected with long gallery or bridge along which the actors moved they came on or disappeared in manner new to us but which gave certain natur al sequence and made beginning and an end dramatic introduction and conclusion added greatly to the picture when the magniﬁcent dresses of stiff brocade dragged slowly along to the cadence of the music the boxes were mostly occupied and by audience the nō this operatic acting is called being reﬁned classical drama and looked upon differently from the more or less disreputable theater hence the large proportion of ladies to whom the theater is forbidden hence also owing to its antiquity and the character of its style difﬁculty of comprehension the general public that explained the repeated rustle of the books of the opera which most of the women held whose leaves turned over at the same moment just ours used to at home when we were favored by french tragedy nō dancer with mask representing the saké imp pg 18 pg 21 the project gutenberg ebook of an artist letters from japan by john la farge https quiet sleepy appreciation hovered over the scene even the devotees near us many of them older people and belonging to the old régime showing their approval or disapproval with restrained criticism i could see witho ut turning my head the expression of the face of my neighbor former daimio man of position his face japanese translation of the universal aristocratic fatigued with the drooping under lip behind him sat former retainers i insinuating remarks and judgments to which he assented with inimitable brevity still i thought that i could distinguish when he showed that the youthful most of the actors were not come up to proper standard that his memory went back to long experience of good acting and so catching are the impressions of crowd that i myself after time believed that i recognized more or less distinctly the tyro and the master even though i only vaguely understood what it was all about i need not tell you that the libretto would have been still more difﬁcult than the pantomime before and very often it was but pantomime the actor making gestures to the accompaniment of music or of the declaration of the choragus who told the poetic story occasionally these movements amounte d to dance that is to say to rhythmic hence called the nō which emphasis was given by rising and falling on either foot and bringing down the sole with sudden blow there were many short plays mostly based on legendary subjects distinguish ed by gorgeous dresses and occasionally some comic scenes of domestic life the monotony of impression was too novel to to become wearisome and i sat several hours through this succession of separate stories patient except the new difﬁculty of sitting on the mats moreover we had tobacco to cheer us on our arrival the noiseless servants had brought to us the inevitable little tray containing the with hot charcoal and the little cylinder ashes and tea and little sugary balls and then besides notwithstanding the repose of the audience there was enough to watch there were the envoys from loo choo seated far off in the dim light of the room dressed in ancient costumes their hair skewered up on the top of the head with double and digniﬁed personages and european prince napoleonic pretender seated alongside with his suite and ourselves the only foreigners the types of the older people were full of interest one felt them formed under other ideas than those of and though there were beauties there were much reﬁnement and sweetness in the faces of the women set off by the simplicity of their dresses of blacks and browns and grays and dull violets in exquisite fabrics we were in an atmosphere of good breeding and i watched one of the young ladies in front of the elder of two sisters she attended to every little want of her father and even to his inconveniences and now it was time to leave though the performance was still going on we wished to return in the early evening our shoes were put on again at the steps our umbrellas handed to sun and rain we must always have we passed the shiba temples and took the train back yokohama pg 22 the project gutenberg ebook of an artist letters from japan by john la farge https july we are doing nothing in particular hesitating very much to what our course shall be one thing is breaking out of the cholera will affect all our plans even the consequent closing of the theaters shows us how many things will be cut off from us we spend much time in such idleness letting ourselves go and taking things they come the doctor kindness is with us all the time one feels the citizen of the world that he is when he touches little details of manners here now familiar to him those of europe i enjoy myself this drifting though is not so well pleased and i try to feel if the heat and the novelty of impressions justiﬁed in idleness once only i was tempted to duty however when we went to the temples of shiba and uyèno where are the tombs of the shoguns rulers of japan of the tokugawa line they are all there but the two greatest iyéyasŭ and iyémitsŭ who lie at nikko the sacred place hundred miles away here in tokio are the tombs of the others and the temples about them splendid with lacquer and carving and gold and bronze and set among trees and gardens on these hills of the shiba and uyèno my dreams of making an analysis and memoranda of these architectural treasures of japan were started many resolutions of work are by the talk of my companion his analy sis of the theme of their architecture and my feeling sort of desire to rival him on ground fair competition but i not think that i could grasp subject in such clear and dispassionate and masterly way with such natural referen ce to the past and its implied comparisons historic sense amounts to poetry and his deductions and remarks always set my mind sailing into new channels but i must put this we discuss whether we shall make our visit to ancient kamakura and the great bronze statue and the island of énoshima or whether to put it off until our return from nikko and our seeing the other shrines of the shoguns there the doctor who has just left nikko tells us of its beauty in the early summer few weeks ago and i feel all the hotter he talks of the cold mountain streams which run by his house and of banks of azaleas covering the high rocks and then the japanese proverb says who has not seen nikko can not say beautiful pg 25 pg 26 pg 28 the project gutenberg ebook of an artist letters from japan by john la farge https lake in uyèno p ark from tokio to nikko july 20 the cholera was upon us and we decid ed to go to nikko and spend month there near the f the doctor who was anxious to get back to its coolness and its other charms was to pilot us and instruct us by the way and much of the miscellaneous information that i shall give you has come more or less from him late in the morning we rode to tokio and lunched in uyèno park looking down on the great pond and the little temple which stands in it and which you know having seen them on the fans and colored prints they were veiled in the haze of the sunlight if in spring or winter mist and through this fog of light shone the multitudinous little sparkles of the ribs and swellings of the lapping one over another and reaching to far streaks of clearer water denser lightness here and there marked the places of the ﬂowers and faint odor came up in lazy whiffs the roof of the temple seemed to be supported by the moisture below above there was cloud all things lay alike in the blaze enveloped in white glimmer of heat and wet and between the branches of the trees around us the sky was veiled in blue the locusts hissed with crackling sound like that of heated wood the ugly bronze buddha at the corner of the shone if melting in the sun then came the moment of leaving the station where owing to delays of trains we waited still longer in the heat in the cleanly we looked at the illustrations in the japanese newspapers and at the last report of the weather bureau printed in english and fastened to the wall or we read little in that morning edition of the excellent yokohama english paper all these comforts of civilization being supplied by the road at length the noise of hundreds of wooden clogs worn by men women and children clattered upon the stones outside and annou nced an end to waiting the train had been baking in the sun all day and we leaned out of the doors on the sides and gasped breath our train skirted the great hill of uyèn and its dark shadow which did not quite reach us monuments and gravestones gray or mossy blurred here and there the green wall of trees the doctor told us of the cooler when the of uyèno cover the ground with snow of blossoms and the whole world turns out to enjoy them we the ﬁrst snows of winter pg 29 pg 30 the project gutenberg ebook of an artist letters from japan by john la farge https this is lame comparison the japanese sensitiveness to the beauties of the outside world is something much more delicate and complex and contemplative and at the same time more natural than ours has ever been outside of arcadia i know of other land whose people hang verses on the trees in honor of their beauty where families travel far before the dawn to see the ﬁrst light touch the new buds where else the newspapers announce the spring openings of the blossoms where else would be possible the charming absurdity of the story that was telling of having seen in time some old gentleman with capacious sakè gourd in hand and big roll of paper in his girdle seat himself below the and look and drink and write verses all by himself with gallery to help him if there is convention in tradition half obligatory and if we western lovers of the tree not quite like the japanese reﬁnement of growing the cherry merely its ﬂowers yet how deliciously from us and how charming is the love of nature at the foundation of the custom from the rustling of leaves and reëchoing of trees we passed into the open count ry and into free air and heat in the blur of hot air trembling beneath the sun lay plantations and the latter vast sheets of water dotted with innumerable spikes of green little paths raised above them made network of irregular geometry occasionally crane spread shining wing and sank again in the outside ditches stood up the pink heads of the lotus above the crowded pads at long intervals small groups of peasants men and women dressed in blue and white deep in the water bent their backs at the task of weeding the skirts of their dresses were caught up in their girdles and their arms were freed from their sleeves the doctor spoke to us of the supposed unhealthiness of which makes life in the short in country where life is not long we are told that the manuring of the taints all the waters great distances and we are warned not to drink without inquiring even from the clearest streams not even high up in the mountains shall we be safe there may be ﬂat spaces and of culture which drain into the picturesque wildness below we learn that with all these hardships the growers themselves can not always afford this staple food of the country cheaper than rice are millet and buckwheat and the plants and fungi that grow without culture contrasting with the tillage we were passing islands of close foliage stood up in the dry plain or were reﬂected with the clouds above in the mirror of the wet occasionally shrine was visible within and the obligatory torii stood at the edge of the grove or within its ﬁrst limits looking through torii one is sure to be in the direction of something sacred whether it be temple or shrine or holy mountain neither closeness nor distance interferes with this ideal intention and the sacred is often seen hundred miles away in the sky framed by these lines built the purpose this assemblage of four lines of stone or wood or bronze is to one of the creations of art like the obelisk or the pyramid most impressive most original of symbolic entrances whether derived from sacred india or from the ancestral innocence of polynesia there is something of the beginning of man something invented while he lived with the birds in this elementary porch whose upper line repeating the slope of hill and wave ﬁrst embodied the curve that curls all upper edges in the buildings of the farther east and if indeed the torii 1 be nothing but the ﬁrst then i can imagine the father of all peacocks spreading his gigantic fan across its bars or i may prefer to suppose it the rest the disk of the whose lower curve is repeated by the torii upper beam sometimes there were traces of inclosu re about these woods sometimes they had edgings but their own contours long ages respectful care sometimes fortunate neglect have made of these reserved spaces types of an ideal wildness these are sacred groves and they are protected by the divine contained within them this

large river and looked down from the height of the new bridges upon the discarded and upon the shape of more fantastic one that was never meant to shaped and trimmed which spread its green mast and sails in garden by the water far away were lines of mountains and the peaks of extinct volcanoes at every station now the country people gathered to stare at the novelty of the train we saw the lighting up of the we passed in the dooryards behind high hedges reminding of normandy bonﬁres were being made to keep off mosquitoes then temples and shrines with lights before them and at eight on festal night we came into utsunomiya the streets were full of people carrying lanterns children ran about together with little toy shrines and the whole town was drowned in noise we got into basha sort of omnibus attached to two wild horses and were hurled through the crowded streets much if carrying the mails with apparent disregard of the lives and limbs of the inhabitants the hotel where we

house and beheld an entire household drawn up in line on the platform which occupied full half of this lower space the doctor did all that was right while we remained in amused embarrassment before our prostrated host and the kneeling attendants we sat helpless on the steps of the platform our shoes were taken off and in stockinged feet we were ushered through the crowd and the lower part of the house through the preparations passing travelers the smell and heat of washing and cookery and an inexpressibly outrageous odor even this land of frightful smells evidently of the same nature that of the notwithstanding this horror we found on clambering up the steep little staircase of dark slippery wood better ﬁtted to stockings than to boots most charming cleanly apartment ready us ready i say but its three big rooms which took all one side of the court contained nothing but drawing hanging in each room and vase ﬁlled with ﬂowers in justice i ought to add european table of the simplest make and three european chairs under them was spread piece of that red cloth which seems to have fascination the being european everything was of the ﬂoor stairs tables everything was dusted wiped rubbed polished it was too hot and we were too tired to go out and see the town noisy with the excitement of festival the doctor directed the preparation of meal on japanese basis of rice mingled and enlivened with the contents of various cans and meanwhile i went down another little staircase of cleanly white wood at the farther end of our apartment to our little private below this was about six feet square and its furniture consisted of deep lacquer tray to lay clothes in the bathtub was sunk in the ﬂoor but so that its edge rose high above the level of the room i had declined the honorable hot water which is the japanese necessity and obtained cold against protest i had yet to learn the luxury and real advantage of the japanese hot bath i closed my door but my window was open and through its wooden bars i could see our opposite neighbors across the garden of the whole family father mother children and young down to the big at the corner whose windows were open to mine i heard them romp and splash and saw heads and naked arms shining through the steam meditating upon the differences which make propriety in various places i joined my friends at dinner and listened to what the doctor had to say upon the japanese indifference to nudity how japanese morals are not affected by the simplicity of their costumes and that of course to the artist it seems great pity that the new ideas should be changing these habits in race so naturally even the government is interfering and enforcing dress within city limits then came the question wheth er this be reminiscence of polynesian ancestry and simplicity or born of climate and cleanliness and indeed all japan spends most of its time washing so that the very runners bathe more times day than our ﬁne ladies meanwhile the were spreading us the mosquito nettings put together with bands of orange silk they were slung by cords from the corners of the beams which serve cornice and they made square tent in the middle of

the women seated upon the ﬂoor the girl repeated some prayer with clapping hands outstretched the lights were put out all but the square ando or ﬂoor and they drew their screens i fell asleep to be waked with start by the watchman who every hour paced through the garden striking wooden clapper and impertinently assured us of the hour this weary noise marked the intervals of night of illness made worse by nightmares of the cholera from which we were ﬂying the earliest dawn was made hideous by the unbarring and rolling of the heavy amados 2 the drawing back of the inside screens shojis and the clattering of clogs over pavement throu gh other parts of the house our japanese family across the way i could hear at their ablutions and later tumultuously departing early trains and at last i slept in broad daylight late in the morning we entered our friend the basha in the daylight i noticed that the horses wore something like dutch collar and were harnessed with ropes two men one the driver

every one in the streets one of our drivers meanwhile blowing wildly through horn to the inspiriting of the horses and the frightening of the japanese soon one of our men plunged off his seat and began running by the horses in the old japanese with him they follow the calling from generation to generation running without pause and without sweating he threw his body back if restraining his pace to that of the horses at the limits of the town in full run he stripped his upper garments and showed himself tattooed at every visible point above the double strip of his waterfall dragon and noble hero made ﬁne network of blue and pink on the moving muscles now the road became heavy wet and full of deep ruts and our miserable ponies came to balked the japanese mildness of our driver disappeared he took to beating their poor backs with heavy bamboo cane while we remonstrated feebly regretting that we had not sufﬁcient strength to beat him too then he explained deferentially that confusion seized him at being unable to keep his promise of delivering us to imaichi the appointed hour and i felt if we had been put in the wrong imagine the difference had he one but japanese we turned aside from the main way into little dry which led us into the hills and moors we got among them we left the annoying odors of the and smelled the ﬁrst time the fragrance of wild roses looking like ours but

sometimes dying an occasional haystack sliced off below by use was fastened in thick projection around some smaller tree once at turn of the road near building with wide roof pushed against the corner bank out of basin fringed with iris sprang into the air little jet of water near by solitary ditcher had placed in bamboo fence some bright red blossom with its stem and leaves apparently to cheer him at his work the heavy road was being ditched on each side to carry off the soaking waters and our weary miserable horses broke down again and i rested by going in advance and i experienced the new sensation of walking among the bamboo stems like an insect among the knotted stalks of gigantic grass the still heat of the sun burned in great smoky streaks across our way spotted by the ﬂight of many yellow butterﬂies there was sound of birds in the high spaces above the few peasants that we met slipped past on their straw sandals their noiseless horses also shod with straw occasionally

village we were now on high ground some two thousand feet above our point of departure and could feel but not see clearly in the blaze of sunlight great mountains lost in great wet clouds we stopped at the village inn drivers and runners were sitting on the stone bench in front drinking tea when we drove up we sat down on the porch inside the whole front of the building open and drank miserable herby tea and tasted the usual sweet balls of sugary stuff alongside the in one of the recesses between the buildings we could see the runners of kurumas being washed off and rubbed down just if they

the avenue of the great cryptomeria we had passed the entrance of another which in old times was the road traveled by the mikado ambassador in the ﬁfth month when he journeyed across the island to carry offerings to iyéyasŭ in his tomb at nikko the big trees grew still taller in this higher air their enormous roots spreading along the embankments in great horizontal lines and stages of buttresses prolonged wafts of cool air blew upon us from the west to which we were hurrying above us spread long avenue of shade high up and pale in the blue and so we got into nikko the sun was setting with the delicious sensation that at last we were in coolness and in shade right before us crossing the setting sun was the island mountain of small enough to be taken in by the eye it stood framed by greater mountains which were almost lost in the glittering of wet sunlight the mountain threw its shade on the little village down its one long street we rode to the bridge that spans the torrent which joining another stream gives nikko the look of an island alongside this bridge at distance of two hundred feet crosses the red lacquer bridge over which we are not allowed to pass it is

whose limpid clearness was made blue by mist where the warmer air was chilled by coldness drawn from mountains before us steps of enormous width passed under the foliage and turned above in many directions and there on the lowest step her dainty feet on straw sandals whose straps divided the toes of the japanese socks with bare ankles stood our hostess in latest european dress most graceful

skirts of the fair american she was summering at nikko and friendly with the buddhist clergy had arranged that one of the priests should let us have his house and kindly walked with us to it little way up in one of the ﬁrst open spaces of the mountain after passing the great outside fringe of trees we found large clear opening broken up by walled inclosures the wall sometimes high and sometimes low and edged by gutters through which the torrents ran these were the former residences of princes whom etiquette obliged to worship ofﬁcially at nikko quarter of mile up we came to our own garden an enormous wide wall or embankment of stone some twenty feet deep also had been prince and now belongs to the little buddhist priest who is our landlord there are two houses in the inclosure one of which he lets to us ours is and two stories high while his is old and low with an enormous roof and an arbor built out from the eaves and connecting with his little garden high behind his house rise rocks and wall and on top of them are planted willows pines maples and the paulownia whose broad leaves are part of the imperial crest little waterfall tumbles over the rocks and gives us water our

shipwreck of heat and fatigue but there was fascination in feeling that this house was ours that it was typical that on entering we left our shoes out on our own threshold and were walking on the soft clean mats that in few minutes we should be stretched on these on bed and that kato would pour out our tea our lowest story which has veranda can be divided so to make servant room and hall beyond in an l behind stretches out with big dresser ﬁxed to the wall under which through trough rolls torrent from the waterfall and farther on is the little square with one side all open to the ﬂoor when the wooden screen is drawn through which we get light and air and through which the box containing burnin g charcoal is brought from the priest house to heat our bath we have little the width of our leads

upon the mantelpiece whic h is at the level of my eye when i lie on the ﬂoor and which is the japanese ideal seat of honor but never occupied this revolver is left there to appease japanese conventional fear of robbers we went down in the twilight to our friends and had very european supper and sat on their veranda looking through the trees toward the bridge in moonlight of mother and we were so sleepy that i can only suppose we must have talked of home and i can only remember our host clapping his hands lanterns and kato leading us back with the light held low and the noise of the torrents running under the little stone bridges that we passed and our taking off our shoes on our own and the thunder of the amado kato rolled them out the night the shrines of iyéy asŭ and iyémitsŭ

his family established rulers of japan in obedience to his dying wishes his son and successor removed the body of his father from its in the south to this ﬁnal tomb at nikko here in 1617 with complicated and mystic ceremonial he was buried and deiﬁed if you have work on japan near by to refer to sub voce iyéyasŭ i can tell you brieﬂy what he did or what he was though i too have books at my hand he was great man patient waiter upon opportunity who at the end of the sixteenth century came upon the scene of great civil war then ﬁlled by two protagonists the military ruler nobunaga and his lieutenant hidéyoshi who was to be known later taiko sama their aim was to settle something more deﬁnitely of course in their favor and in fact the death of the former and the triumphant success of the latter who succeeded him went far toward disposing of many contending claims pg 51 pg 52 the project gutenberg ebook of an artist letters from japan by john la farge https toward crystallizing of the feudal system which had grown of centuries of civil war this is the moment that we see reﬂected in the annals of the ﬁrst christian missionaries to whom the military chiefs of japan were alternately kind or cruel trait atue of iyéy asŭ in ceremonial dress when hidéyoshi died he had grown to be the master of japan he had been made regent of the empire title of honor he was that and more in reality he had become one of the greatest of oriental warriors and had begun life groom the son of humble peasant the name of taiko great gate he took like other regents on retiring nominally from ofﬁce but with the addition of sama lord it is applied to him alone in popular memory naturally then he believed in possible dynasty originating in him at his death he could see his greatest fear the future of the young son to whom he wished to leave his power this man iyéyasŭ tokugawa lord now of many provinces but who had begun humbly and who had assisted him in breaking many enemies receiving reward with every success and consolidating meanwhile his own smaller powers the dying taiko made complicated arrangements to secure the will of iyéyasŭ and also to prevent his encroachments these arrangements including and combining the agencies of numbers of princes and vassals many of them newly christianized seem only the more certainly to have forced on position in which iyéyasŭ with few allies but with clear aims and interests took the ﬁeld against larger number of prince s commanding more men but not united in any intention ﬁxed his was these he defeated once and all on great battleﬁeld sékigahara on some day in october in the year it was the greatest battle that japan ever saw and one of the us because of the death of three of the christian leaders against iyéyasŭ warriors distinguished before in many wars who could not being christians take their own lives in defeat their japanese traditions of honor commanded hence the victor had them shameful death and thereby heroic these were almost his only immediate victims iyéyasŭ wisely forgave when it paid and merely weakened the beaten increasing the possessions but not the powers of his adherents and ﬁnally remained in undisputed power with great titles from the mikado who though poor in power was still dispenser of honors with the greater gods the victrix causa pleased meanwhile the protection of the son of the great taiko sama which all this war had been supposed to grow had not been effected and even this one obstacle or reminder was to disappear from before iyéyasŭ but not several years and only just before his death pg 53 pg 54 the project gutenberg ebook of an artist letters from japan by john la farge https of statue of iyéyasŭ tokugawa avenue to temple of iyéy asŭ he had in japanese custom resigned his apparent power to his son behind him he could act more obscurely and with less friction then began the drama of the extinction of christianity slowly many reasons not the least being that several christian princes with their vassals had supported iyéyasŭ in his struggle and at length the son of taiko sama hidéyori indirectly connected with the christian side fell before iyéyasŭ his strong castle at osaka was said to have become place of refuge the persecuted and the discontented even to the very christians whom his father had cruelly persecuted which was in the wrong and disturbed the waters the wolf or the lamb i not know but only that in june 1615 the great castle was attacked by iyéyasŭ and his son in bloody battle was ever fought and notwithstanding that moment victory hung in the balance the tokugawa luck prevailed the castle took ﬁre thousands perished and hidéyori and his mother disappeared whether iyéyasŭ was the author of the code of laws or rules at which he is supposed to have worked during these years of waiting with the aid of learned scholars to bequeath them to his descendants the maintenance of the order of things he left i not know nor perhaps was the information i once had about them at all accurate they or their spirit however served to guide the nation the next two hundred and ﬁfty years that is to say until the second commodore perry came to japan with the increased weight of an outside world much changed meanwhile the great man died leaving great personal fame behind him over and above the powers he could transmit he was buried here i said the place was chosen in 1616 at the end of the same year the buildings were begun and in the beginning of the next year were partly completed when the funeral procession arrived in nineteen days from iyéyasŭ former amid great ceremonies and religious rites the title of supreme highness lord of the east great incarnation was given to the hero and ruler and son of the small laird of matsudaira while he was being thus deiﬁed the persecution of the christians increased in violence passing into hideous delirium of cruelty wiping out its victims but unable to affect

out to be his these laws based on the old feudal habits and inﬂuenced and directed by the great chinese doctrines of relationship and duties are not laws we think of law nor were they to be published they were to be kept secret the use of the tokugawa house to serve rules conduct in using their power so to secure justice which is in return to secure power that exists its own end in the mind of rulers these laws some of which are reﬂections or moral maxims or references to the great man experience made out sort of criminal code relations of the classes of rank and etiquette and mechanism of government they asserted the supremacy and at the same time destroyed the power of the mikado and by strict rules of succession residence and conti nued possession bound up the feudal nobles they reasserted the great individual virtues of ﬁlial piety and of feudal loyalty and insisted on the traditions of military honor the sword was to be the soul of the samurai 3 and with it these have carried the national honor and intelligence in its peculiar expressions full recognition was given to the teaching thou shalt not lie beneath the same sky nor tread on the same earth with the murderer of thy lord the rights of the avenger of blood were admitted even though he should pay the penalty of his life suicide which had long been japanese development of chivalrous feeling and military honor was still to be regarded purifying of all stain and the ﬁrst time allowed in mitigation of the death penalty indeed half century later the ronin who had lost their natural lord and their rights were to die in glorious suicide carrying out the feudal idea of ﬁdelity you know the story probably at any rate you will ﬁnd it in mitford tales of old japan it is beautiful story full of noble details telling how by the mean contrivance of certain lord the prince of ako was put in the wrong and his condemnation to death and conﬁscation obtained and how then gentlemen faithful vassals of the dead lord swore to avenge the honor of their master and that purpose to put aside all that might stand in the way this end they put aside all else they cared even wife and children and through every obstacle pursued their plan up to the favorable moment when they surprised on winter night in his palace among his guards the object of their vengeance whose suspicions had been allayed by long delay and how his decapitated head was placed by them upon his victim tomb before the surrendered themselves to justice and were allowed to commit suicide by kiri and how they have since lived forever in memory of japan these laws then destroyed nothing they reasserted certain japanese tradition s and customs but made out through many details the relations of dependence of all classes of society upon the shogun vassal indeed of the mikado but supreme ruler who held the key of all all this did iyémitsŭ carry out well the consequent seclusion of the country the only manner of avoiding ideals which might clash with those upon which this consolidation of the past was based and to many of these ideals to the idea of the sacredness of the family to the idea of subjection to the law of the ruler christ ianity by its ideal of marriage by its distinctions of the duty to cæsar name only few reasons be found an insidious dissolvent therefore if it be necessary to ﬁnd high motive iyémitsŭ did what he could to trample out the remains of christianity which were to expire few years after his death in ﬁnal holocaust terrible and glorious nero himself could have wished to see from that time two centuries all went on the same until the arrival of the foreigners found system so complete so interlocked and rigid to go to pieces with the breaking of few links that break was supplied by the necessity of yielding to the christian and foreign demand of entrance and in so far abandoning the old ways with this proof of weakness the enemies of the tokugawa and those of the system began to assert themselves circumstances aiding and in 1868 the last of the race resigned all powers and retired to private life the details of the enormous changes they followed one another are too many and sudden and apparently too contradictory to explain further even now i repeat this deﬁcient summary of the tokugawa story only because of wishing to recall who they were that have pg 59 pg 60 pg 63 the

fatigue and repetition of the innumerable beauties of gold and color carving and bronze the sense of an exquisite art brings the indeﬁnable sadness that belongs to it feeling of humility and of the nothingness of man nowhere can this teaching be clearer than in this place of the tombs it is if they said serenely or splendidly in color and carving and bronze and gold we are the end of the limits of human endeavor beyond us begins the other world and we indeed shall surely pass away but thou remainest eternal beauty tao the way nikko july osomi and tategawa were the architects of nikko osomi planned the lovely pagoda i am told i hasten to put down their names at that time the great tenkai was abbot he was friend and adviser of iyéyasŭ he was the teacher of iyémitsŭ the grandson and of hidetada the less illustrious son it may be with him that iyéyasŭ arranged the plan of ﬁxed endowment the church an endowment not to be added to or diminished so that it should be an element of stability and longer ﬂuctuating danger with this seems to have ended the possible reasons military dependents in the service of the church tenkai is said to have planned or prepared beforehand the temples of iyéyasŭ which might explain the extremely short time given in the record their building so that begun in 1616 the stable the surrounding ediﬁces and the shrine were completed in the third month of i have been careful to give you some account of the temples of iyéyasŭ and iyémitsŭ because i regret having said so little of those temples of shiba in tokio where the remainder of the tokugawa rulers repose in state adorned by similar splendors but these temples of the founders are of more complete type and with one exception seem to more impressive yet even with the beauties that i have tried to describe i am still not quite so carried away i might have been by such complete works of art there is something seemin g of pretense or effort or ingeniousness which i can not seize but which seems to to belong to splendor not quite secure or perhaps only just secured like what i might call the mark of the parvenu yes i think that is it it is still after all this time just little new but what thorough adaptation of means to ends how delicately subtle the arrangements and simple and how impossible to describe through words or drawings how the result alone is aimed at and what little parade is made of the intention and preparation this work which seems to betray an inferiority to its own work which has even touch of the vulgar is charming enough to look like fairyland it displays capacity arrangement which none of us could hope to control has charm that any passer could feel has more details of beauty than all our architects now living all together could dream of accomplishing in the longest life when i began to reﬂect how this wood and plaster had more of the dignity of art and of its accessible beauty than all that we have at home if melted together would result in that these frail materials conveyed to the mind more of the eternal than our granite it seemed to that something was absolutely wrong with us and the cause of this result was not the splendor of line and color it was not the reﬁnement the last time i could recall similar sensation had been before some little church tower of england it was certainly the subordination of all means to single end and their disappearance in one impression since my ﬁrst visit to the temples my mind has been dwelling more and more in an involuntary manner upon the contrast with all modern art and i venture to note down you some of the thoughts forced upon it seems if i were really reminded of what i always knew or ought to have known and perhaps what i may say about ourselves is good way pg 99 pg 100 pg 101 the project gutenberg ebook of an artist letters from japan by john la farge https other of giving an opinion upon what i see here indeed what i see here that i admire i feel though i had always known had already seen it is rather most of our own that seems queer strange and often unreasonable i can make set and orderly arrangement of my rather confused thinking but can only trace it out it occurred to if it were from outside if something whispered to now and then out of small occurrences and said you understand more clearly on leaving the temples we went back to our friends house which was once the residence of the regent of large low wooden building of the kind so carefully described by morse in his book all is extremely simple there is nothing to call any attention the woodwork is merely put together with great care some little panels of the closets are nicely trimmed with metal and highly ornamented this with metal and pretty is all the decoration here we found the mail and papers and enjoyed the feeling of news from town there were copies of life and of the london punch many of whose drawings did not look out of place in this land of clever sketchers indeed that in them which once seemed good across the seas still held its own in presence of the little prodigies of technique that one meets in japanese drawings indeed they recalled one another both call out one sudden recollection of some facts in nature and besides all good sketches resemble one another being the nearest approach to the highest ﬁnished work they have in common with it the essential merit of being better than they appear of indicating more than is necessary to tell the tale of not being strictly measurable quantities we grow so ungrateful when too well treated that we forget how du maurier throws in over and above the social epigram in lines an elegance and grace that might belong to poetic picture that keene tells his story over and over again in the very folds of each individual dress that he will unconcernedly present us with landscape full of nature his human ﬁgures instead of the indifferent background which would have been sufﬁcient the story of the caricaturist now the feeling of disenchantment of having found out appearances of having come to the end of thing is never forgiven by the average healthy mind in greater things one turns some day to those which are always richer and fuller of meaning with time one looks at corot or delacroix or millet once that means that at length our eyes are opened the sketch like the great work of art is better than it appears and recalls to the emperor in the story whom the old woman could not recognize in the presence of the big we can appreciate what suffering the little old woman underwent when she discovered her mistake and how she never forgave the big major mankind has never believed at heart that the work itself is to be judged but has always at least in the case of one neighbor acknowledged that it is the work of art which judges us so says japanese friend and i think that he has it exactly hence an importance attaches to criticism which otherwise would be inexplainable importance there is in being right because we shall be judged ourselves if we are wrong and often by ourselves judges and late numbers of the magazines had come pleasant to look over before dinner the noiseless servants glided over the matting and our hostess put on her japanese costume serving to make the distance greater we feel that all goes on at home with the usual regularity some architectural sketches in facsimile in magazine became entangled with the thread of my thinking and brought to my mind an inevitable lesson they were charming and so different from the realities which they were meant to embody one i dwelt upon bright and clever where every dark of window or of shadow intensiﬁed the joyfulness of the white wall of residence at home which you daily pass in the reality alas its fifth avenue monotony is unrelieved the wall is not bright the windows are paler than the walls and the projections and adornment are duller yet the drawing was an abstraction probably meant the sweet enticement of the client and was what the build ing should have been the draughtsman knew better than he builded my mind analyzed this curious professional misstatement of truth it seemed to that i could see how the art of architecture in japan was real compared to ours even though none of their architects any more than those of the great past of the world could have made such brilliant promise of performance not to be such beautifully engraved check upon bank where there were funds not knowing the science and art of perspective drawing nor the power of representing pg 102 pg 103 the project gutenberg ebook of an artist letters from japan by john la farge https according to rule nor having the habit of ruling lines with ruler to give interest nor of throwing little witty accents of dark to ﬁll up blanks they were perhaps the more obliged to concentrate their powers upon the end of the work and their real motive was the work itself this may be strange and contradictory to the modern western mind gradually accustomed to polished cartoons bad paintings and worse glass to remarkable designs decoration and architecture which look their best in woodcuts to great decorative paintings which are carried out so that they may be photographed without any injury to their color nay to its vast improvement you remember how the famous sculptor used to preach to that day one looked at thing itself one expected to and that the fame of the artist was those whose work could be adequately represented in the newspapers that an excellence which could not be duplicated that tone which could not be matched that line which could not be copied was not to be appreciated and could not be cared in fact that such reﬁnements were only worthy of the mind of an oriental of man accustomed to wear the moon embroidered on his back why spend days in obtaini ng the color of wall which any architect will think can be adequately replaced by his description of something like it to the painting ﬁrm around the corner why make the thing itself if something like it will well why strike the note exactly if any sound near it satisﬁes the average ear us things and realities longer exist it is in their descriptions that we believe even in most cultivated france an architect or designer like will seriously undertake to restore old work every square inch of which has had the patient toil of souls full of love and desire of the best by rubbing it all out and making paper drawing or literary description others to restore again in few modern weeks the value of ancient years of ineffably intelligent care consider this impossibility of getting decent restoration carried out by our best intelligence s and note that while they are unable with all money and talk and to replace the past in way that can deceive us there exist patient obscure workmen who beginning at the other end of the work produce little marvels of deception in false by museums and amateurs sums their authors never could get in their proper name but these latter have only one object the thing itself and are judged by the result while we the arbiters and directors better known who never employ them are satisﬁed and satisfy others by our having ﬁled in the archives of notices that we are going to something in the utterly corre ct way i took an example our friend the remarkable architect whose works we have both studied because he has written well some ways one more acutely and more wisely because of his real learning and on account of his very great experience is all that this man and his pupils did in their own art of making worth art the broken carving that i kick out of my path has such risible calamity ever occurred before in any age destruction there has been replacing of old good work with better or with worse by people who did not understand or care or pretend to care but the replacin g of good with bad by people who understand and who claim to care has never been curse until this failure in all restoration in all doing of the thing itself must be directly connected with our pedantic education and with our belief in convenient appliances in propositions in labor classiﬁcations in action on paper in projects future work in theories and anything excep t being saved by itself indeed i have always felt that perhaps in the case of poor richardson just dead we may begin to see the shape of an exception and can realize what can be accomplished through what we called deﬁciencies he was obliged in the ﬁrst place to throw overboard in dealing with new problems all his educational recipes learned in other countries then you think that if he had drawn charming drawings beforehand he would have been able to change them to keep his building in hand so much plastic material the very tenacity needed carrying out anything large would have forced him to respect his own wish once ﬁnally expressed while the careful studies of his assistants were only ground to inquire into and lastly to choose from many little prettinesses and perfectio ns not make great unity through my mind passes the reminiscence of something i have just been reading the words of an old chinese writer an expounder of tao the way who said what he thought of such matters some centuries ago what he said runs somewhat in this way the snake hissed at the wind saying i at least have form but you are neither this nor that and you blow roughly through the world blustering from the seas of the north to the seas of the south pg 104 pg 105 pg 106 the project gutenberg ebook of an artist letters from japan by john la farge https it is true replied the wind that i blow roughly you say and that i am inferior to those that point or kick at in that i can not the same to them on the other hand i blow strongly and ﬁll the air and i can break huge trees and destroy large buildings out of many small things in which i not excel i make one great one in which i in the domains of the one there may not be managing hence also the difﬁculty i had almost said the impossibility of ﬁnding designer capable of making monument say instance tomb or commemorative ideal cathedral or little memorial there is necessity in such forms of art nothing to call into play the energies devoted to usefulness to getting on to adaptation to cleverness which the same taoist says is the way of man while integrity is the way of god art alone pure by itself can be here the object of the maker contemplation the laws of the universe that men call beauty are the true and only sufﬁcient materials of construction with what preparation does designer of humbugs come to such work failure in which can not be excused because of any practical reasons because of any pressing really belongs to the public to everybody more than to its possessor or to its owner or to those who have paid ﬁnally can be saved from adverse criticism only short time while passing interests are concerned who knows this better than yourself where on earth can you ﬁnd thing done by us designers that an artist will go to look at love the deep desire of enjoyment which makes us visit so many little things of the past and go far them if you can imagine any painter desiring to note so to make them his own by copy modern set of moldings the corner of modern building and yet what rush of delight comes upon us with few greek moldings with fragment of greek or gothic ornament with the mere look of the walls of some good old building how the pleasure and the emotions of those who made them have been built into them and are reﬂected back to us like the smile from human face i know that i have told you often how the fragment of gothic window from old english boston set into the cloister of trinity of the new boston always seemed to to outweigh the entire building in which it rests and yet it is only poor fragment of great period but then the makers thought and felt in the materials that they worked in even if their drawings were rude and incomplete and often incorrect and architect seems to realize that his walls could give us the same emotions that we receive from rembrandt or van eyck or veronese and the same reasons and through similar use of real technique you draw well you can make sketch i am sure which like many others would have spots of light on black surface or pretty wash of sky above it or little patches of shadow like clever lichens spread over it and that would be correct in artiﬁcial perspective and recall something of older design and have great blem ishes to take hold of how far would it help you to have made million such if you seriously wished to thing itself not its effects upon client nor claim upon the public nor salve to your own vanity and now you see how we architects and designers gradually work more and more on paper and not in the real our energies are worked out in accomplishing before we get to our real work of building work of art the result of our drawings grows feebler and feebler and tamer it presses to its end then this weak frame of conception the men who have come in to help and that only becaus the director time would not admit of his doing all himself otherwise he would in his jealous weakness adorn poorly he imagines i say if the painter the sculptor the decorator shows any strength or power there is another danger there is danger that the sculptor relief will be more powerful than the weak projections of solid masonry the lines of the painter will be grander and more ample than those which were meant to guide and conﬁne the paint of the decorator will appear more massive and more supporting than the walls of the architect whence all will be tamed all annulled and made worthless and paltry so not to disturb the weak efforts of the master directing and the ﬁrst time in the history of art we shall have buildings which the greek or the roman the medieval or the oriental would have been unable to adorn while in their times the masters who were architects great and small found trouble in placing within their buildings made famous to all time by this choice the sculptures of the parthenon or of olympia the glass or the statues of christian cathedrals or the carvings of india or of japan pg 107 pg 108 pg 109 the project gutenberg ebook of an artist letters from japan by

art wait perhaps i may be merely preparing your mind and mine what i shall have to say later or rather let us think that i am carried away by the spirit and that i am certainly talking of what i not ﬁnd here and if there is novelty in what i say and that you know it and have always known it we shall come back to what you also know that art is the same everywhere and always and that i need not come this distance to learn its principles if there is anything good here it must resemble some of the good that we have with us but here at least i am freer delivered from world of canting phrases of perverted thought which i am obliged to breathe in at home so to be stained by them whatever pedantry may be here i have not had to live with it and i bear responsibility in its existence and then

and when comes in later he talks of masashige and of others who during centuries at long intervals attempted to realize what has now been restoration of the mikado to his ancient powers and rulership of twenty centuries ago yes the tokugawa splendor was that of parvenus their masters lie in gilded shrines nor under monumental bronze but buried beneath the elements their graves marked only by mounds or trees it might have been with their earliest ancesto rs the peaceful chieftains of primitive family simplicity recalled by the little fragment of dried ﬁsh that accompanies presents in memory of the original humility of the ﬁshing tribes the ancestors of this almost over race these tokugawa then were parvenus and naturally asked of art which lasts and has lasted and is to last an afﬁrmation of their new departure this splendor was made them and its delicious reﬁnement has not quite escaped that something which troubled at anxiety that all should be splendid and perfect an unwillingness to take anything granted and yet by comparison this looks like fairyland of reﬁnement what should we when called to help new man to assist or to sweeten his acquired position what vulgarity of vulgarities should we produce think of the preposterous dwellings the vulgar adornments given to the rich the clothing in which newly acquired power is wrapped the english cad and the

hold in everything else some years ago i told you how once purveyor of decorations the milliona ire great man in his line explained to how and why he had met his clients you despise my work he said though you are too polite to say so we were friendly in manner and yet i can say that i am more thoroughly in the right than those who would seek to give these men an artistic clothing ﬁt princes is there anything more certain than that the artist represents his age and is all the greater embodying it now that is what i you will say that my work is not deeply considered though it is extremely careful in execution that its aims are not high that it is not sober that it is showy perhaps even more that it is loud occasionally it is not tame that it shows all it is worth and is never better than it looks and who pray are the people that live surrounded by what i make are they not represented by what i they not want show of such kind can be easily understood reﬁnement that pg 110 pg 111

reﬂecting others at taking possession of others who belong to themselves but that it is an attempt at keeping possession of one self it is often protest at what is displeasing and mean about us it is

the same writer who lived before our purer and who was japanese friend remarks strategist in thought fond of side attacks of presenting some point appare ntly anecdotic and unimportant which once listened to turns the truthful mind into channels of fresh inquiry the anecdote is old told by the old writer many centuries before christ and before any reﬂections about art troubled our barbarian minds it is about court architect who ﬂourished in celebrity some centuries ago and who answered admiring queries to how he did such wonderful things there is nothing supernatural about it he said i ﬁrst free my mind and preserve my dependence upon god then after few days the question of how much money i shall make disappears few more days and i forget fame and the court whose architect i am

of the ﬁrst you will forgive it in honor of the genius loci these writings of the chinese philosophers form staple of conversation and discussion in social gatherings of cultivated people here the story is of the greatest of chinese rulers the yellow emperor of some centuries ago he was in pursuit of that law of things that sufﬁcient ideal which is called tao the way and he sought it in the wilds beyond the world known of china in the fabulous mountains of he was accompanied by yu and chang jo and others of whom i know nothing and fang ming of whom i know nothing also was their charioteer whe n they had reached the outside wilderness these seven sages lost their way by and by they fell in with boy who was tending horses and they asked him if he knew the mountains i said the boy and can you tell us said the sages where tao the law abides i can replied the boy this is strange said the yellow emperor pray tell how would you govern the empire i should govern the empire replied the boy in the same way that i tend my horses what else should i when i was little boy and lived within the points of the compass my eyes grew dim an old man advised to visit the wilderness outside of the world my sight is now better and i continue to dwell outside of the points of the compass i should govern the empire in the same way what else should i said the yellow emperor government is not your trade but i should be glad to learn what you would the boy refused to answer but being urged again said what difference is there between governing the empire and looking after horses see that harm comes to the horses that is all thereupon the emperor prostrated himself before the boy and calling him divine teacher took his leave i am writing these vagaries by the sound of

original mysticism from which they sprung is full of beauty and of power general has recently stated it well when he says that lao tzŭ its great antique propounder speaks with the tone of prophet he neither preached nor discussed yet those who went to him empty departed full he taught the doctrine which does not ﬁnd expression in words the doctrine of tao or the doctrine that becomes untrue and unproﬁtable when placed in set forms and bound in by pedantry but which allows teaching by parables and side glimpses and innuendoes long they are illuminated by that light which exists in the natural heart of man and i too am pleased to let myself be guided by this light after many years of wilful energy of forced battle that i have not shunned i like to try the freshness of the springs to see if new impressions come they once did in childhood with you i am safe in stating what has come to from outside it has come hence it is true i did not make it i can say with the shadow personiﬁed by my expounder of the way 4 that when the light of the ﬁre or the sun appears then i come forth when the night comes i lie still i wait indeed even they wait they come and i come they go and i go too the

of the landscape illuminates my room the landscape does not come within i have become blank to be ﬁlled i employ my mind mirror it grasps nothing it refuses nothing it receives but does not keep and thus i can triumph over things without injury to am safe in tao jap anese architecture nikko august i fear that of all my description the refrain of the words gold and bronze will be all that you will retain how can i have any conﬁdence in my account of anything so alien whose analysis involves the necessary misuse of our terms based upon another past in art words in such cases are only explanations or easy mnemonics of previous sight but soon i shall have photographs to send and if i can summo n courage work in this extreme heat and moisture i shall make some drawings but again these would not give the essential reasons things being they are and whatever strange beauties would be noted they might appear to have happened if i may so say and not to have grown of necessity it is so difﬁcult our average way of accepting things to think of what is called architecture without expecting structures of solid and evidently and yet if architecture represents the needs of living of people the differences that we see here will have the same reasonableness that other devices show elsewhere the extreme heat the sudden torrents of rain will explain the and curved roofs the galleries and verandas the arrangements opening or closing the sides of buildings by sliding screens which allow an adjustment to the heat or the damp but weightier reasons than all these must have directed in the construction of such great buildings the temples and i think that putting aside important race inﬂuences these sufﬁcient reasons will be found in the volcanic nature of japan and its frequent earthquakes whatever was to be built must have had to meet these difﬁcult problems how successfully in the past is shown by persistence of their buildings which to us seems extraordinary many of them are lasting yet in integrity now over thousand years i speak of the inﬂuences of race because it is evident that very many traditions prejudices and symbolic meanings are built into these forms and that many of them must have come through the teachings of china everywhere the higher architecture embodied in shrines and temples is based on some ideal needs and not essentially upon necessities is in fact record or expression of religious idea or mystery in this case i am too profoundly ignorant most of us are to work out origins but my mind feels the suggestion of an indeﬁnite past that once had meanings and teachings just my eye recognizes in the shape of the massive temples the pg 118 pg 119 pg 120 the project gutenberg ebook of an artist letters from japan by john la farge https of sacred box or ark once to be carried from place to place there is perhaps in this direction line of study the men to come like all true art the architecture of japan has found in the necessities imposed upon it the motives realizing beauty and has adorned the means by which it has conquered the difﬁculties to be surmounted hence foundations which would compro mise the super imposed building by making it participa in the shock given to its base hence solid pedestals if i may so call them or great bases upon which are placed only not built in the posts which support the ediﬁce leaving space between this base and the horizontal beams or ﬂoors of the building the building is thus rendered elastic and resumes its place after the trembling of the earthquake and the waters of bad weather can escape without ﬂooding any foundations the great heavy curved roof far overhanging weighs down this structur and keeps it straight an apparently unreasonable quantity of adjusted timber and beams supports the ceiling and the roof complicated tremendous corbelings brackets grooved and dovetailed ﬁll the cornices with network but all these play an important practical part and keep the whole construction elastic their many small divisions spread the shock still more in such building the charming pagoda at iyéyasŭ shrine which is full one hundred feet high and lithe the great beam or mast which makes its center does not support from the base but is cut off at the foundation and hence it acts sort of pendulum its great weight below retarding the movement above when the earthquake comes i have heard the whisper of legend saying that the architect who devised this to correct the errors of rival and partner was poisoned in due time in jealous return those were happy times when backbiting among artists took the more manly form of poisoning now besides all this which gives only the reason the make of certain parts which together form the unity of single building there are other principles before us the relation of man to nature so peculiarly made out in the japanese beliefs is made signiﬁcant symbolized or typiﬁed through the manner in which these buildings are disposed temple is not single unity with us its own beginning and end temple is an arrangement of shrines and buildings meaningly placed often here in word synonymous with temples each shrine statement of some divine attribute and all these buildings spread with inﬁnite art over large spaces open or inclosed by trees and rocks the buildings are but parts of whole they are enveloped by nature the principle and the adornment of the subtle or mysterious meaning which links them all together besides all this is the religious symbolism underlying or accompanying all once with us of which i know too little to speak but which can be felt and occasionally detected because of many repetitions but this would carry beyond my limits and indeed we ﬁnd it very difﬁcult to obtain any more information from our instructors whether they not know securely or whether they reserve it better minds and worthier apprehensions nor i object to this oriental secrecy or mystery it adds the charm of the veil which is often needed and i should wish that soon some one might undertake to make out in full the harmony of proportions which has presided over these buildings it is evident that delicate and probably minute system of relations under the appearance of fantasy produces here the sense of unity that alone makes one secure of permanent enjoyment my information on the subject is fragmentary i know that the elegant columns are in set relation to the opening s of the temple that the shape of these same columns is in another relation to their exquisite details that the rafters play an important part determini ng the ﬁrst departure i have seen carpenter drawings with manners of setting out work and measurements and i feel that there is only study to carry out nor is my wish mere curiosity or the interest of the antiquarian what we need is belief and conﬁdence in similar methods without which there is nothing ourselves but haphazard success connection with the eternal and inevitable past and none with future which may change our materials but will never change our human need harmony and order you have heard of the little gardens and of their exquisite details in which the japanese makes an epitome of nature arranged if one of his microscopic jewels of metals ivory or lacquer here in our own garden there would seem call an artiﬁcial nature the mountain slope on which we live must have always been beautiful of itself but all that our is to say the space about our landlord house and our been treated with extreme care our inclosure is framed towards the great

with moss rolls torrent making waterfall that breaks three times the pool below edged with iris that grow in the garden sand is crossed by bridge of three big ﬂat stones and empties secretly away on each side of the fall planted in the rock wall stands paulownia with great steady leaves and bending towards it willow whose branches drop far below itself and swing perpetually in the draught of the waterfall bunches of pink azalea grow in the hollows of the rocks and their reﬂections redden the eddies of the pool steps which seem natural lead up the wall of rock old pines grow against it and our feet pass through their uppermost branches on the top is planted monumental stone and from there little path runs along leading nowhere nowadays far i can make out i am right in calling this mass of rock which is spur of the mountain slope wall i look down from its top to the next inclosure far below now overgrown and wild what is natural and what was made by man has become so blended together or has always been so that i can choose to look at it my mood may be and feel the repose of nature or enjoy the disposing choice of art where the little bridge crosses over and where mossy rocks dip down little to allow passage edged by maple and pine i look over across the hidden road to deserted yashiki with one blasted tree all overgrown with green and melting into distances of trees which tier behind tier reach to little conical hill that is divided and subdivided by sheets of mist at every change of heat and damp so that i feel half if i knew its forms if i could never get them all by heart in the sand of our little garden are set out clumps of ﬂowers chrysanthemum mostly and occasionally iris and azalea and the two houses make its other two sides the priest house an old one with large thatched roof projecting in front and supported there by posts covered with creepers is nearer the water i see the little priest with his young neophyte curled on the mats in the big front room whose whole face is open while in break or wing is the opening to the practical housekeeper side of the dwelling our own house which faces south like the priest completes the square i said it is edged on the outside by small plantation of trees with character that stretch away to the back road and to wall terracing higher ground behind there wide space overgrown with bushes and herbage that cover former care and beauty spreads out indeﬁnitely toward conical hills hot in the sun behind which rises the great volcanic slope of little temple shrine red white and gold stands in this heat of sunlight and makes cooler yet the violets and tender greens of the great slopes this is to the north when i look toward the west i see broad spaces broken up by trees and the corner of iyéyasŭ temple wall half hidden by the gigantic cedars and i write late in the afternoon the blue peak of rounded off like globe by the yellow mist the garden embosomed in this vastness of nature feels small though it were meant to be so every part is on small scale and needs few hands to keep things in order we have little fountain in the middle of the garden which gives the water our bath and sends noisy stream rolling through the wooden troug h of the the fountain is made by bucket placed upon two big stones set in basin along whose edge grow the iris still in bloom hidden pipe ﬁlls the bucket and long green bamboo makes conduit the water through the wooden side of our house with another bamboo we tap the water our bath in the early morning i sit in the and paint this little picture through the open side while upstairs in the veranda is reading in dante paradiso and can see when he looks up the great temple roof of the buddhist mangwanji occasionally the good lady who takes care of our priest house during his weeks of service at the temple of iyémitsŭ salutes while at my bath the heating of which her servant has supplied the charcoal she is already dressed the day and in her black silk robe walks across the garden to dip her toothbrush in the running water of the cascade then in desultory way she trims the plants and breaks off dead leaves and later the gardener appears and attends to one thing after another even climbing up into the old pine tree taking care of it he does of the and i recall the japanese gardener whom i knew at our exposition of 1876 i saw him the last time stretched on the ground fanning the opening leaves of some plant that gave him anxiety thus the japanese garden can be made of very slight materials and is occasionally reduced to scarcely anything even to little sand and few stones laid out according to deﬁnite ideal of meaning reference to nature recall of the general principles of all landscapes foreground distance and middle distance that is to say little picture enoug when pg 124 pg 125 pg 126 the project gutenberg ebook of an artist letters from japan by john la farge https can not deal with the thing they they it have another ideal which is not so much the making of real thing the making of picture of it hence the scale can be diminished without detriment in their eyes until it becomes lilliputian to ours all this i take to be an inherit ance from china modiﬁed toward simplicity i not know to what type our little garden belongs they have in their arrangem ents manners of expressing ideas of association drawing them from nature itself or bringin g them out by references to tradition or history so that i am told that they aim to express delicate meanings which western imagination can hardly grasp types instance conveying the ideas of peace and chastity quiet old age connubial happiness and the sweetness of solitude does this make you laugh or does it touch both i wish i knew more about it i am sure that there is much to say i have spoken of simplicity the domestic architecture is simple transitory if it symbolized the life of man you can see it all in the drawings in the lacquers and it has recently been treated completely in the charming book of professor morse within the japanese house is simplicity itself all is framework and moving screens instead of wall accumulations any lady with us will contain more odds and ends than all that i have yet seen together in japan the reserved place of honor sort of niche in the wall the supposed seat of an ideal guest has upon its bench some choice image on stand or vase with elegant disposal of ﬂowers or plants and above it the hanging roll with drawing or inscription perhaps some other inscription or verse or few words on tablet upon some and perhaps small folding screen otherwise all works of art are put aside in the ﬁreproof house to be brought out on occasions the woodwork is simple it can some beautiful joinery always when it can be afforded exquisite workmanship and above all exquisite cleanliness there are wadded coverlets and the little wooden pillow which does not disturb the complicated feminine coiffure in the languors of the night tables food is laid on the cleanly mats in many trays and dishes chairs the same mats that serve bedstead and table serve seats with perhaps cushion added and this is all the same all from emperor palace to little tradesman cottage there is nothing apparently but what is necess ary and reﬁnement in disposing of that the result is sometimes cold and bare there is the set look of insisting upon an idea of doing with little noble one certainly instance when the emperor palace at kioto is adorned merely by the highest care in workmanship and by the names of the artists who painted the screen solitary contradiction to the splendor and pomp of all absolute rulers storehouse the wasted money of the people but an example of the economy which should attend the life of the ruler it is possible that when i return i shall feel still more distaste the barbarous accumulations in our houses and recall the far more civilized emptin ess persisted in by the more esthetic race nikko august i need not tell you that the pervading manner of spending time and money is always within our reach we not go after the owner and seller of he comes to us coming from afar tokio hundred miles away and from ozaka four times that distance of merchandise are unloaded at our door or at our friends us patient horses stand in the inclosure of the yards big parcels and piles of boxes and bundles encumber the verandas weary hours beginning with excitement and ending with gentle disappointment are spent in indecision of judgment and uncertainty of purchase but there remains always at the bottom of the boxes delusive hope and some treasure may perhaps reward our patience and then besides occasional beauties in color or design there is something in looking over all these débris of civilization in their own home and odds and ends having not much more excuse themselves than that they remain help to explain either the art or the habits of the country or its history or the nature we see about us we have found almost nothing among the things pg 127 pg 128 the project gutenberg ebook of an artist letters from japan by john la farge https us which can rank work of high art and i am afraid that we must be looked down upon by our friends purchases which have excuse in any lofty esthetic code but they have the charm of being there and of explaining and in another way of teaching even when they are bad and often because they are bad because their very poverty helps to classiﬁcation and to an analysis of the means throug h which the artist worked and to knowledge of the prevalent subjects and arrangements which he found ready to his hand bequeath ed to him by an earlier and nobler choice from all this poor stuff exhales the faded scent of greater art and reﬁnement which is now invisible or destroyed or subsisting only in fragments difﬁcult of access or which are far away and there is peculiar unity in the arts of the extreme east we must remember that this very sensitive japanese race has develo ped in its art in everything without being subjected to the many direct and contradictory inﬂuences which have made our western art and civilization there have been here within historic times vast invasions of alien races bringing other ways everything in thought and in life and obliging an already complex civilization to be begun over and over again on readjusted bases higher living and advanced thought obliged to yield times and half times until the grosser ﬂames of energy could be puriﬁed dethronement within society tried by every other calamity of the old primeval faith instead of tempest of tastes and manners of feeling blowing from every quarter and in which the cruder dislikes have held centuries the balance against cultured likings and devotion japan has been carried on in one current in which have mingled so to blend the steady inﬂuences of the two most conservative civilizations of india and of china all here and far back is interwoven with chinese thought breaks through it returns to it runs alongside of it and through buddhism its fervor its capacity taking up in its course boulders of other creeds or habits something different higher in aspiration and in form has lived with everything else and af fected all this impressionable race found contrasting with and supporting its nature secure steady undeviating guides so that these foreign ideals have persisted here with transplanted life in fact it is possible to look to japan to ﬁnd something of what ancient china was so much of what has here been done their langua ge does saves us hint or reﬂection of the great chinese ages when china had not yet been conquered by the foreigner and when energies apparently unknown to the china of ﬂourished with the strength of youth the art and literature of japan therefore represent in great part the chinese original which us has practically disappeared we can not easily know what arrangements and compositions what free interpretations of the world or severe imitations of nature the old chinese adopted but they are reﬂected or continued in the styles and subjects and treatments of what we call japanese the limits and deﬁnitions of each may be clear to the japanese critic but to our casual western eye they merge or derive one from the other like some streams which make one river almost all the arrangements that we know so well on japanese drawings screens bronzes lacquers ivories have chinese prototypes and all this is over and above the constant use of chinese legend and story and philosophy which are to japan what greece and rome used to be to storehouse of associated meanings and examples would it amuse you if i made out some of the types that you see here are the and the stork emblems of long life or the bamboo and the sparrow which typify the mildness and gentleness of nature the willow waves in the wind to and fro and the swallows swing forth and back again the names of color and of love are joined by similarity of sound and probably by mystic association and so you will see upon the screens that the leaves of the maple turn red in autumn when the stag calls the doe the splendor is show like the pheasant plumage long centuries ago the plum became the poet tree because of an early poet verses and the nightingale also singer and poet is associated with the

legends and stories are referred to the cuckoo ﬂies across the crescent of the moon and the story of yorimasa is called up who slew with bow and arrow the mysterious monster that had tormented the life of the mikado narihito i despair of telling the story without great waste of words and i having chosen the example but perhaps it is all the more japanese its complication you must know that the was about the year been ill night after night with terrible nightmares to the confusio n of his numerous doctors and that his many feminine attendants had done all they could to soothe him to avail every night at the hour of the bull two an hour when evil power is great the dovecote was ﬂuttered by this fearful visitation but at length either these gentle dames or other watchers noticed that before each access cloud had drifted over the palace and that resting just above the two lights shone out from the dark mass then the bells of the city temples sound ed the hour of the bull the gentlemen of the palace and the imperial guards were set on watch the priests prayed to ward off the evil inﬂuence but uselessly then brave warrior famous archer one of the allowed or ordered to try to destroy the evil thing whatever it might be he with follower watched nightly until the dark cloud and the shining orbs were near when the great bow of yorimasa was dischar ged and strange and wonderful beast fell blinded to the ground the sword of yorimasa despatched it in nine separate blows and the thing to have had something of the monkey the tiger and the serpent burned to ashes this yorimasa was given the girl he loved the lady who therefore had not watched in vain and with her the celebrated sword called king of wild boars now the imperial deputy he presented this sword to

yorimasa answered ﬁlling in the necessary couplet the waning moon sets not at will which might also mean in modest disclaimer of ambitious effort only my bow i bent that alone sent the shaft and so this moon stands in the picture in the verses the bent bow of yorimasa it is shorter story that which makes the allusion in the type of the chrysanthemum and the fox it is variation of the perpetual story the prince royal of india had lovely mistress who had bewitched him and who fell asleep one day in bed of chrysanthemums where her lover shot at and wounded fox in the forehead the bleeding temple of the girl discovered the evil animal she really was the fox in china is in japan wicked animal capable of everything in the way of transformation and suggestion there are endless stories about him and the belief or superstition is still very strong was talking to us lately about the scorcerers and spiritual mediums and and an explanation of the power of some medium told us that he claimed to have in his service tame foxes only when i asked where they might be lodged in the little city house he explained that they were not living in the body and therefore cumbersome but were the spirits of foxes thus subservient and able to penetrate everywhere and report the badger also is misleading creature and the cat is considered uncertain or take the way in which hokusai refer s to ancient story when at the end of one of his books he makes picture of the devoted knight kojima takanori clad in armor covered with the peasant and he is writing on the trunk of the the message of warning his master the emperor tenno but instead of the old verse hokusai has put in the sixth year of the tempo in the month of april my year this is written by formerly by name hokusai but now more correctly known old man gone mad painting here i have been wandering into japan while my theme was rather the persist ence of chinese subjects or of subjects connected with china the list of which would be endle ss from shoki the hunting his prey of imps over and round the corners of boxes to pictures of aphorisms such this saying of confucius of which i found drawing yesterday avoid even the appearance of evil not stop to tie your shoes in the of an enemy and so these innumerable subjects are common property and serve ﬁeld the artist to try to be himself to bring out the story or part of it or his way of looking at it or its decorative capacity or any way of anchoring the japanese imagination i can not say that many of the ordinary arrangements the most simple and conventional one does not often suffer pg 132 pg 133 pg 134 the project gutenberg ebook of an artist letters from japan by john la farge https boredom of repetition we at home with the eagle and the stars and armorial bearings and the stereotyped symbolism of churches but it sufﬁces to see the thing well done again to start once more into some new enjoyment of the choice of subject so there can exist with regard to these subjects apparently mere motives of form and partly because they are conventional deeper convention or meaning more or less visible to the artist when at work according to his temperament or his school in our poetry where an idea may or may not be overlaid with realistic or esthetic decoration painting by i reach out the ﬁrst design that my hand can ﬁnd which turns out to be drawing by i have chosen at haphazard but the choice is perhaps all the better we shall have example of great man to deal with but merely the work of remarkable chinaman who somewhere in the early eighteenth centu ry happened to come to japan or to be born there so to ﬁt into certain chinomania then prevalent the photograph that i send you is poor one you can merely discern the pattern or what might be called the masses of the design horse is tied to tree horse of japan monkey slides down the trunk and clutc hes at the halter that prevents escape i need not ask you to admire the stealthy and yet conﬁdent step of the ape and the motions and repugnance and fright of the horse i think that they could be better given withal there is gravity of general outline and appearances and pleasantly managed balance of the full and empty spaces but these decorative points are not those i wish to refer to just now what i wish to indicate now is that this subject which might have suited dutchman realism and its choice of the accidental will mean if you wish to see it the natural resistance and struggle of the inferior nature against superior mastery which it does not pg 137 the project gutenberg ebook of an artist letters from japan by john la farge https and which at ﬁrst appears capricious and unreasonable without being quite certain of the accuracy of my deﬁnition i know that the design is based upon like convention this may not be spirituality but how far it is from what we call realism and how wise the acceptance by the artist of convention which allows him to give all his energies to new interpretation through his own study of nature with those who have chosen distinctly religious subjects and whose vitality and personality can triumph and coexist with the absence of novelty in the theme so the artist in more ordinary subjects may be wise in keeping to themes which are known to those whom he addresses and in which they can fully grasp and enjoy his success these general them es allow stricter individuality in the artist who uses them when he is capable and make his want of individuality tolerable and even laudable and pleasant when like most of us he has little of his own then he can never be so offensive if we not like him those that we not like are often offensive because their personal vanity appears upon solid ground of their own stupidity perhaps this is why the japanese objet never offends at least in the older work done under the general inﬂuences that have obtained with the race hence also their astonishing variety thousand times many thousand times you will have seen the same subject but never the same rendering never the same object twice repeated that is to say that whenever it is worth while we can get at the most valuable and costly part of the work of art the humanity that made it the love of something that went with the work it is this that makes the mystery of the charm of innumerable little pieces of older work like the work that belongs to the old swords any one of which is superior to anything that we unless in the rare cases when we bring in the expensive life of great master to rival part of the work left by barye cellini pisano all that our great men have done is exactly opposite to the tendency of our modern work and is based on the same ground that the japanese has lived and worked the reality and not the appearance the execution and not the proposition of theme the whole principle is involved in the analysis of say successful study from beautif ul painting instance of beautiful sky in such case the subject is all provided the importance of the result depends upon the artist sensitiveness to the facts supplied to him upon his use of his hereditary and acquired methods of recording them and upon his personal variation of those methods one dreams of praising the art of the sky itself that is to say the fact that the facts existed to praise the artist the thing having occurred from which he worked it is this apparent want of comprehension of the ﬁrst principles of the plastic arts in our poor work and in vast proportion of our best that makes any reasonable man pessimist to our near future every poor element of our civilization is against it and our inﬂuences are now deteriorating the art of japan we value material or the body instead of workmanship or the right use of the body and instead of style and design the intellect and the heart to us gold object seems spiritually precious and we hesitate at working in other than costly materials to the japanese workman wood and gold have been nothing but the means to an end we had rather not anything than anything not enduring so that when our materials are difﬁcult the life has ﬂown that was to animate them the japanese is willing to build temporary architecture and make temporary lacquer which holds more beauty and art than we manage to get in granite or in metal and when the oriental workman takes the hardest surfaces of steel or of jade he has had the preparations using it with mastery it is again plastic and yielding him the less abiding materials have been before nor would the japanese artist understand the point of view of many of our men who their best to put an end to all art so lost are they in our vanity of advertisement the japanese would never have invented the idea of doing poorly the work one is forced to to live so to reserve vast energy more important or inﬂuential work that might draw attention to him the greater part of our decoration is carried out just the contrary way to his our artists accept momentary curse the fact that to live they may have to draw patterns or work in glass or paint or model subsidiary ornamentation they look forward to the glorious time when they may wreak their lofty souls in the dignity of paint mixed with the sacred linseed oil or in the statue done in bronze or carved in marble by other hands than theirs and yet if their nature be not too far removed from ours the habit of doing less than their best the habit of doing poorly the scorn of anything but the ﬁne clothes of ﬁne material will never be gotten over and throughout this little cheapness of soul this essential snobbishness will be felt to puzzle and disconcert those who wish to admire that is to say that they too often not look to the end but to the means while to the artist the means are mere with the greeks whose work will live even if its very physical existence is obliterated because it is built in the mind in the eternity of thought so greek art pg 138 pg 139 pg 140 the project

it is the principle of the proper place of means that makes the little piece of japanese instance the or the epitome of art certainly greater work of art than any modern cathedral and certainly we shall never even produce good ordinary ornamental work until we feel the truth that i have lamely indicated i might perhaps well this said an intelligent architect we looked at some excellent but not noblest details of french renaissance but how could i spend the time on it and not only that but how could i have spent the time previous to this in doing other similar work to train i can only make project have it carried out by the best commercial ﬁrm not anxious to change the course of trade and shut my eyes to the result i should never be criticized because i did not give more than my bargain and yet to give more than your bargain is merely to give art look at this little netsuke 5 or inro 6 or and follow the workman you admire each detail of the execution he has chosen some subject or some design which may have an associated meaning or may be of good omen and bear good wishes or he may have chosen out of the entire world of observation of fancy or of tradition and may have chosen just much because it ﬁts well the space which he has to cover he will take well design that has been used hundred times newer one he has to reinvent it in execution even the greek sculptor who recut again the egg and dart or the orator who is to expound and carry out to success some argument all ready in his the old architect who rebuilt glorious greek temple upon the rules and canons of proportion that others had used before him but he has to see that this design in his nearer yet perhaps on ﬁt the spaces of the material and of the object which he is to make so that it shall be made it were that place only he will then go again to nature working directly from it perhaps only to his memory of sight remember that in what we call working from merely use shorter strain of memory than when we carry back to our studios the vision that we wish to note and more than that the very way in which we draw our lines and mix our pigments in the hurry of instant record in the certainty of successful handling implies that our mind is ﬁlled with innumerable memori es of continuous trials the workman then goes to nature and ﬁnds in it the reality and the details of his design even let us say to the very markings of tree trunk that he has chosen they are all there since they exist in the design and the design is good but they exist only in so far they exist also in the ivory that he the veining of the or malachite that is to render it now with patient pleasure he can hunt out these associations he can use gold or silver or vulgar lead or lacquer or the cutting and ﬁling of steel or the iridescence of mother his leaves or his stems or the water or the birds the clouds or the moonlight the sunshine and the shadow the light and dark the male and female of his little manufactured world these he will model chisel sink or emboss the story needs and it coarsely or loosely or minutely or delicately the unity of his little world requires and he will work in hurry or work slowly he will varnish it and rub it down and polish it again and bake it many times and let it weather out of doors or shut it up carefully from the smallest track of dust or bathe it in acids or salts and all this days and months in the year and when he has ﬁnished to more or less would not be to ﬁnish it has given besides the excellency of what we call workmanship which he must give because that is the bargain betw een has given his desires his memories his pleasures his dreams all the little occurrences of so much life you see he is following the law of tao so that however humble his little world it has life of its own which can not be separated from its materials picture of it reproduction will give its full charm any more than photograph gives that of human being take out the word japanese wherever i have put it take out the actual materials that i have mentioned and the description and the reasoning will apply that is all there is to any work of art it does not exist in ﬁne abstract of again in the application of some method of deﬁne technic so many young idiots most excusably try to persuade themselves it exists in an individual result with origins so powerful and deep that th ey are lost in shade to go on i wish to put it that the same reasons will cause the artist then to elaborate profusely to work in long patience to use precious materials to work slightly or carelessly to ﬁnish his pg 141 pg 142 the project gutenberg ebook of an artist letters from japan by john la farge https with minute details or to sketch rapidly with the end of brush ﬁlled with the single color of india ink there is difference in reality there is only the question of the kind of interest he wishes to evoke the sort of relation he wishes to establish between himself and his work and incidentally to the looker i am afraid that this hazy weather is affecting the sequence of my dreaming or what i am pleased to call my thought so that you may not clearly understand again i wish you to remark that in all fullness of work other things are sugg ested than those directly represented upon the same principle the same reasons that the successful sketch i said before is richer than it looks hence the suggestion of color when there is really but black and white hence the suggestion of modeled light and shadow when there is really but ﬂat color and outlines hence the success of all great periods in what we call decorative work because there was separation there was merely art to be used to ﬁll certain spaces and to recall the fact that it was so used many years ago i used to read ruskin when my sight was bad and i lived within the points of the compass and also the works of other men who laid down the exact geography and the due distances north and south of certain department or land of art which they called decoration some of them are not yet dead the light of tao fell upon the subject from the words of child who had been listening to talk in which i and others wiser than myself were trying to follow out these boundaries that outlined true methods of decorative art and kept to the received instructions of abstention from this and that of refraining from such and such reality of stiffening the ﬂow of outline of ﬂattening the fullness of modeling of turning our backs on light and shade of almost hating the surface of nature and we wondered that when our european exemplars of had fulﬁlled every condition of conventionality had carefully avoided the use of the full methods of art in the great specialties of painting and sculptur their glorious work had less stuff to it than gothic ﬂoral ornament or japanese painted fan father said the child are you not all making believe is the japanese richness in their very ﬂat work so different from what you can see in this sketch by my little brother see how his tree looks if it had light and shadow and yet he has used modeling he has used only the markings of the tree and their variation of color to both he has left out nothing and yet it is ﬂat painting nor have the japanese left out things they have not been forced to overstudy any part so to lose the look of free choice to make the work assume the appearance of work of workman bored nobly bored perhaps but still bored feeling that is reﬂected in the mind of the beholder the japanese artist makes his little world nothing but an world its occupants live within it they are always obedient to all the laws of nature that they know of however piercing the observation of actual fact its record is always synthesis i remember many years ago looking over some japanese drawings of hawking with two other youngsters one of them now celebrated artist the other teacher of science what struck us then was the freedom of record the acute vision of facts the motions and actions of the birds their ﬂight their attention and their resting the alertness and anxiety of their hunters and the suggestions of the entire landscapes made with few one saw the heat and the damp and the dark meandering of water in the swamps marked the dry paths which led over sounding wooden bridges and the tangle of weeds and brush and the stiff swaying of high trees all was to us realism but af fected by an unknown charm now this is what the artist who did this realism has said well i can make it out the ancient mode must be maintained though picture must be made like the natural growth of all things yet it lacks taste and feeling if it simulates the real things evidently the painter had not learned our modern distinctions of the realist and the idealist if you wished to know what i admire most in these forms of art i might say to you keeping i hope within the drift of what i have been writing that it is their obedience to early rules which were once based on the ﬁrst primeval needs of the artist and if you pushed further and wished to make confess what i thought that these necessities might be and to make give you deﬁnition of them and thereby force into deﬁnition of art itself i should hesitatingly pg 143 pg 144 pg 145 the project gutenberg ebook of an artist letters from japan by john la farge https that i not like to deﬁne in matters so far down causes but if you would not tell or take advantage of my having been drawn into such position of doctrine i might acknowledge that i have far within belief that art is the love of certain balanced proportions and relations which the mind likes to discover and to bring out in what it deals with be it thought or the actions of men or the inﬂuences of nature or the material things in which necessity makes it to work i should then expand this idea until it stretched from the patterns of earlie st pottery to the harmony of the lines of homer then i should say that in our plastic arts the relations of lines and spaces are in my belief the ﬁrst and earliest desires and again i should have to say that in my unexpressed faith these needs are needs of the soul and echoes of the laws of the universe seen and unseen reﬂections of the universal mathematics cadence s of the ancient music of the spheres i am forced to believe that there are laws our eyes well our ears and that when if ever these shall have been deciphered has been the good fortune with music then shall we ﬁnd that all best artists have carefully preserved their instinctive obedience to these and have all cared together this before all the arrangements of line and balances of spaces which meet these underlying needs are indeed the points through which we recognize the answer to our natural love and sensitiveness order and through this answer we feel clearly or obscurely the difference between what we call great men and what we call the average whatever the personal charm may be this is why we remember so easily the arrangement and composition of such one whom we call is why the silhouette of millet against the sky why his placing of outlines within the rectangle of his picture makes different ﬁnal and decisive result impressed strongly upon the memory which classiﬁes it when you compare it with the record of the same story say by jules breton it is not the difference of the fact in nature it is not that the latter artist is not in love with his subject that he has not poetic nature that he is not simple that he has not dignity that he is not exquisite it is that he has not found in nature of his own instinct the eternal mathematics which accompany facts of sight indeed to use other words in what does one differ from the other the arrangement of the idea or subject may be the same the costume the landscape the time of day nay the very person represented but the millet if we take this instance is framed within larger line its spaces are of greater or more subtle ponderation its building together more architectural that is to say all its spaces are more surely related to one another and not only to the story told nor only to the accidental occurr ence of the same the eternal has been brought in to sustain the transient fashions change to feelings and sentiments and ways of looking at the world the tasks of the days of angelico or of rubens or of millet are not the same religions live and disappear nations come and go in and out of the pages of history but i can see nothing from the earliest art that does not mean living in like desire law and order in expression it is therefore because we consciously or unconsciously recognize this love of the unwritten harmonies of our arts the power of recalling them to us in some painter or in some architect that we say that such man is great he is great because he is the same man has been and will be and we recognize without knowing them by name our ancestral primordial predilections yes the mere direction or distance of line by the variation of some fraction of an inch establishes this enormous little more curve or less mere black or white or colored space of certain proportion few darks or reds or blues and now you will ask you intend to state that to which i should say i not mean to leave my main path of principles and when i return we shall have time to discuss objections besides i am not ar guing i am telling you this is the unity this is the reality which disengages itself from the art of japan even we know it in common through what we usually call our introduction to it is rather curious when one comes to think of it suddenly owing to enormous social changes in japan involving vast ﬂuctuations in fortunes most of all that was portable was sale and ﬂooded our markets ignorant dealers held in masses small treasures of temples adornments of the wealthy all the odds and ends of real art along with the usual furniture along with all the poor stuff that would naturally be made us barbarians and had been made us centuries through the trade of holland it was if paris or london had suddenly been unloaded of everything portable from works of art to household furniture naturally the of it pg 146 pg 147 pg

bands just it would be with us have somewhat escaped the drain our perceptions have been confused in all this mixture by repetitions imitations which in every form of art we know so well in literature degrade the perception and enjoyment of what is good i can only wonder that the world has not been tired out and disgusted with japanese and had we not been in such bad straits of taste ourselves such would have been the case i have always considered that the artist needed to be forgiven his turn toward not his liking to have odds and ends help and refreshment but having too many because his life is to make not to collect to others that can be forgiven easily the pieces of the past are consolation of the present and one would like to feel that man likings are his important self and are betrayed by his choices ce dirai ce es if one had time and did not what pleasure it might be to describe forever the innumerable objects and things that might be found here even though words are poor rendering of sight and what pleasure it might be to try to describe the greatest of all the greatest remains of the higher and painting i have begun some such letter you but i fear that it may never be ﬁnished nor i see any way of giving an account of the history of painting in japan which would have to stand still further explanation should i study it further can i more than to increase my own knowledge all knowledge is burden to give you cursory proof by names and few examples that the art of painting and the art of sculpture are very old here i should have to begin to ask myself you if the earliest remains not already prove still earlier schools and accepted or debated tradition and i should then have still one thousand years of design to account i shall probably leave my letter to you unﬁnished it has already become unwieldy and i could give you only my own impressions and then in the history of art everything is needed it would not be merely reproduction in words however beautiful of the surfaces of works that have survived time nor of the men who made them of their characters the accidents of their lives and their technical beliefs it would be simply history of humanity at given place it could not be solved by mere account of the place and the race according to some of our later scientiﬁc fads i was writing to you but yesterday and trying to make out that the work of art is often contradiction of the period or step in advance that the moods of feeling of the future are often reﬂected by art the habits of the present but whatever personal sense of solitariness or of antagonism has inspired or oppressed the artist he must have had partners since he has had admirers even when he antagonizes his time however transient certain of his forms however much to us who come afterward they indicate the period he has expressed not his time but the needs of others who have been looking in the same ways and yet have had voice and even if they have not quite sympathized the accumulations of like tendencies have become stronger and clearer in their descendants to reﬂect fully then in words the face of the work of art one would have to melt into it in some way the gaze of those who have looked at it to keep upon it still the gentle looks of the pitiful and the loving the rapt contemplation of the saints the tender or mocking smile of women the hard or contemptuous appreciation of rulers the toleration of the wise all of which have been in reality part of the very work their negations or sympathies have fallen on the work and these ineffable delicacies of impression are transmitted in it to successive generations even the shadowing of innumerable years of has browned the gold and blackened the azure concealment in the shade has sometimes paled sometimes preserved the edges of the outlines and the modeling of the colors or exposure and heat and damp have cracked and channeled and dusted all surfaces you see what i should consider true carrying out of such task and how unsatisﬁed i should be with anything that i could accomplish unless it were to stand to you something fragmentary and evanescent one thing i should like to i remain long enough and be able to get it from the few acquaintances who may know that is to save some part of the artists themselves out of that obscurity by which the lives of great workers are almost

the founder of the great school and family of artists who have lasted through four centuries to the present day and have ﬁlled japan and the temples here with works better or poorer until the family name becomes burden i hear about okio the charmer the painter of everything and of animals who began little child by sketching on the earth with bamboo sticks when he followed his parents into the ﬁelds to work one might perhaps learn about hokusai who is tabooed here and about whom i dare not inquire but whose charming last letter given by morse comes back to my memory is so gay and so sad so triumphant over circumstances so expressive of the view of the world which explains his woodcuts i quote from memory king he writes to friend king the ruler of the under world has become very old and is thinking of retiring from business so that he has ordered little country house to be built and he asks of to come to him that i may paint him so that in few days i must be ready to travel and to

formerly known hokusai but now known gakyo rojin the old man gone mad painting i had been intending to add when i interrupted myself some way back that i enjoyed in this art of least in this drawing which they call strange nearness i seem to be in to the feelings of the men who did the work there is between us only thin veil of consummate skill the habit and the methods resulting from it of an old obedience to an unwritten law common to all art have asked the directest ways of marking an intention or an observation this reference to previous tradition of meaning of ideal arrangement by rule this wish synopsis this feeling manners of expressing one self in the thing seen will naturally make art out of anything and it is not wonderful that what we call handwriting may then give full play to art in written language of which ideography is the key given the chinese characters their original intentions the associations historical and literary connected with them is it anything strange in reality however strange to our habits to ﬁnd writing form of art in japan it may have all i have just referred to and be full of the meaning of ideas and be literature and then it can be made conformable to the laws of beauty of form and spacing and above all to give character of style and character of personality to look more or less grave or elegant or weighty according to circumstances

synopsis of the outlines of things meeting together of their relative intensities of their own colors of their relations to the place they are in that is to say the this art of japan the daughter of the art of china will attain its highest form so that in reality those of us who think of it appearing at its best only in color in external charm have not understood it an etching of rembrandt could fairly be said to represent not so much in itself but in its essence what great chinaman would have liked to in india material of all others which even to us is his especially the line the abstract

mechanism of their technic powers of design and drawing sufﬁcient to furnish out armies of such draftsmen ﬂourish instance in the paris of it is this surplus of richness that conceals the identity our arts have undertaken an enormous accession of truths and ambitions upon which the arts of the extreme east have never ventured they have attained their end the end of all art at an earlier mental period they are younger perhaps even more like children and their work can not involve the greater complications of greater age but it has also all that grasp of the future that belongs to youth and that has to be accompanied by deﬁciencies of knowledge that is to say of later acquirement and the practice of good and evil and it is impossible to look at the expression of nature or of any intention made by the child in full sincerity without realizing that the aim of the artist be he even michael angelo is to return to similar directness and unity of rendering not that the eastern artist any more than the child could be conscious of deﬁciencies of which he had not thought he has been satisﬁed we have been satisﬁed but longer time and under greater prestige the fruit painted by the greek deceived the birds and the curtain painted by the greek painter deceived his so the horses of kanaoka have escaped from their kakemonos and the tigers sculptured in the lattices of temples

again the moon was gone old moons go he was enraged at the painter though he might well have noticed that many days the moon had not been so bright and indeed had seemed to be ill drawn tells that the artist got it back little and waited the necessary number of days to have its crescent reappear again and says that though the picture is lost he hopes to ﬁnd it again in china in following years these stories serve way of stating to you that long new wants were not felt newer accuracies did not begin to exist and these limitations are naturally seen to be more easily put up with in civilization of uninterrupted tradition to acquire something when one hands are full something has to be dropped in the stations of our own progress in art the advance has at every stage involved some deﬁciency or failure or weakening on another side this is the only explanation i can make painting in the extreme east not having taken up is to say not having triumphed in it while sculpture has reached out toward it in splendid way we have seen the same thing in the transition from the middle ages when sculp ture outreaches painting in the direction of reality but then sculpture is to certain extent easie r and in certain way inferior because it gives sort of duplicate of the object not relation of it to other things so that the japanese have not come to the work from the model which has at so many periods and so long been ours theirs are types of types they are not with us persons and the pursuit of beauty in the individual has not been followed apparently by the art of the far east the personal love and preference of the artist embodied in another person their art does not show nor have their artists given nameless immortality to certain human beings so that pg 154 pg 155 pg 156 the project gutenberg ebook of an artist letters from japan by john la farge https from their types their images their moods their characters their most transitory variations of beauty have been proposed to us an example have you ever reﬂected how the nameless model reigns in the memory of man with personal fame more intimate than that of cheops or helen or cæsar because the artist has been obliged to build upon this person his own dream of the with the roman girl who is the madonna of san sisto so again the eastern artists have suggested and implied and used light and shade and perspective and anatomy and the relations of light to color and of color to light only so much they could take into their previous scheme in many cases their success is still an astonishment to us certainly their records of motion their construction of plants and ﬂowers and birds we have all appreciated and their scientiﬁc easy noting of colored light in landscape made even rousseau dream of absorbing its teaching into his pictures which certainly represent the full western contradictory idea in the most complicated acceptance of every difﬁculty the artist here then has not made separate analytical studies of all the points that trouble us that have cost at times some acquirement of the past in the anxiety working out new direction instance in learned france where the very art of painting mirror of the appearance of things has quarter of century been in peril under the inﬂuence of the academy the model in studio light and the vain attempt to rival the photograph and perhaps it is needless to repeat again how we have lost the sense of natura l decoration and expression of meaning by general arrangement of lines and spaces so that again in france we are astonished at puvis chavannes who uses powers that have once been common to almost all our race here the artist does not walk attired in all the heavy armor which we have gradually accumulated upon us his learning in side issues is not unnecessarily obtruded upon so to conceal the sensitiveness of his impressions or the reﬁnement of his mind us we have marched on in track parallel to science striving now centuries to subd ue the material get it into the microcosm of our paintings each successive great generation has taken up the task heavier and heavier time goes on halting and resting when some new ﬁnd has been made working out new discovery often with the risk of the loss of greater one but how often the processes have covered up what is most important at least value of the individual his aspirations and indeed the notions or beliefs that are common between us sometimes this covering has been sordid and mean pedantic or unesthetic sometimes most splendid but how difﬁcult it has been always the many to read instan ce in our great rubens the evidences of lofty nature the devout intentions of healthy mind not that we can turn back and desert from the time when the greek ﬁrst asserted in art the value of personal manhood to the date of the impressionist of the career has been one and certainly in the art of painting vaster future lies before us whenever we are ready to carry the past but remember that whatever has been really great once will always remain great even if i were competent to make more than approaches to reﬂection this place of dreams is not well chosen effort i feel rather if tired i wished to take off my modern armor and lie at rest and look at these pictures of the simplicity of attitude in which we were once children indeed the meaning of our struggle is to

mountains would seem all natural to him would the stories of mountain gods who ages ago met here the advance of the buddhist priests buddhism has joined with the earthly faith in attaching religious value to solitary places and mountain heights and many are the stories which link these two beliefs from the early times instance when shodo shonin in his wanderings came here and opened up the mountains of nikko this saintly discoverer dwelling in early youth among sacred caves and devout reverer of the native and buddhist deities had long dreamed of wondrous things on distant mountains of celestial or spiritual beings visible even to the eye and pursued his search according to holy vows and under celestial guidance bed of the yaga wa nikko where the red lacquer bridge now goes over the

promised to watch over the welfare of japan and the progress of the new religion these three gods were long worshiped thereafter at the foot of the mountain on the bank of the lake named chiuzenji by him along with the buddhist incarnations whose temple he established there so that these primordial divinities were looked upon by certain buddhist eyes what they named temporary manifestations of the great essences known amida buddha and last evening near the back of the rock upon which is the tomb of iyéyasŭ i followed some zigzag stone steps that lead up to little shrine dark among the trees in

behind our house through which runs small road untraveled and pg 167 the project gutenberg ebook of an artist letters from japan by john la farge https somewhere or other with the road of the great temples i had intended to study there several reasons one among others because i saw every day i looked through my screens little typical of japan near by small temple shrine all vermilion in the sun

far beyond tumble of mountains behind the great depression of the river hidden out of sight and above and farther yet the great green slopes that lead to the peak of it was very hot and all the clouds seemed far away the sun very high in the early noon and shade i passed the new priests houses of the old temple near us where are billeted to the inconvenience of the owners many sailor boys sent all the way from the navy yard of okotsuka so that they escape the cholera we are doing they are usually washing their clothes in the torrent that runs under the bridge of three carved stones which i have to pass to get into the little path frequented by gadﬂies that takes up to my were it not the amiably obtrusive curiosity of these youngsters in their leisure hours i should pass through their

vapor rose from the hidden river twisting into draperies that slowly crawled up the slopes of the great mountain far off its top was capped with cloud whose mass descended in shower over its face and

grasses high man head farther on against the northern sky the eastern slope was golden and sharp in the highest sky of ﬁery blue large cumulus clouds shone above and through the fog whose ragged edge

uncomfortably and visited and comforted however by our fair hostess and the doctor murmurs of buddhistic conversation remain in my mind vague stories of life in southern monasteries of reﬁned ascetic life of sublimated delicate food of gentle miraculous powers known to the favored few that behold them at times of ascensions and disappearances like those of the pilgrim saint of whom i was telling you of which talk mingles with the vague intent of my painting i had proposed to make my studies serve the picture of the ascension to use the clouds and the wilderness my background and to be at least moments in some relation to what i have to represent that is to say in an atmosphere not pg 170 the project gutenberg ebook of an artist letters from japan by john la farge https ours is to what we call the miraculous here at least i am not forced to consider external nature separate and opposed and i can fall into moods of thought if you prefer of feeling which the edges of all things blend and man and the outside world pass into each other old p agoda near the priests houses august and so often i like to think of these trees and rocks and streams if from them might be evolved some spiritual essence has not çakyamuni said that all living beings possess the nature of buddha that is to say the absolute nature the sun the moon the earth and the innumerable stars contain within themselves the absolute nature so the little ﬂowers the grass the clouds that rise from the wate rs the very drop of water itself they are begotten of nature absolute and all form part of it however great however small absolute nature is the essence of all things and is the same all things this absolute nature will be are the waters of the sea if we picture it and its modes will be the waves inseparable from the waters thus the absolute and all things will be identical inseparable views of the same existence this nature will be both essence and force and appearance and manner and so my friends here of the sect which holds the temple might teach that the little plants the great mountains and the rushing waters can become buddhas in these pantheistic sympathies i dimly recall that another sect ﬁnds three great mysteries in its esoteric view of the world the wind whistling through the trees the river breaking over its rocks the movements of man and his voice indeed his silence the expression of the great mysteries of body of word and of thought these mysteries are understood of the buddha but evolution cultivated by the true word or doctrine will allow man whose mysteries are like the mysteries of the buddhas to become like unto them but since the path is open all to buddhahood these animals that pass this landscape about can become divine alas are not men more easily

and matter are one in absolute nature which in its essence can neither be born nor be dissolved actual life is absolutely determined by the inﬂuencing action of merit and demerit in past existence the future will be determined by present causes so that it is possible the soul to pass through the six conditions of the infernal being the phantom the beast the demon the human and the celestial and

reality last in the complete calm of absolute truth nir vana have i told you my story of the word nirvana used by the reporter at omaha who managed to interview us the association of reporter with any of the four states of nirvana may seem impossible to this is the way it happened owing to being the brother of the president of the road we were naturally suspected of business designs when we acknowledged that we were going to japan and in my shortsighted wisdom i thought that i should put to rout our interviewer by allowing that the purpose of our going was to ﬁnd nirvana i had misjud ged the mind of the true reporter and did not expect the retort are you not rather late in the season whether he knew or builded better he had certainly pointed out the probable result i often recur to this episode when now i enjoy in dreaming action that nirvana which is called conditioned that state of the terrestrial being who understands truth by the extinction of passions but who is yet indeed very much tied to the i may speak so lightly of what is contemplation of and an absorption in eternal truth rest in supreme salvation of all the images that i see so often the one that touches perhaps

of her by the beautiful scenes about us of which the waterfall is the note and the charm were it not that i hate sightseeing i should have made pilgrimages like the good japanese to all the celebrated

again in the blue above colored with gold where they showed below through the trees then they came nearer then they melted together pg 191 pg 192 pg 193 the project gutenberg ebook of an artist letters from japan by john la farge https suddenly all was veiled the rain came down in sheets and i was glad of the refuge of the tea booths along the eastern wall it was late almost evening one there few pilgrims and attendants and priests scurried away through the court disappearing with bare reddened legs and wet clogs around the corners of the avenues and the rain persisted hanging before like veil of water i had in front i sat in the booths already damp and gusty with drafts the face of the tall red pagoda behind its stone balustrade and at right angles to the great torii that i had been painting the great trees were all of one green their near and far columns ﬂattened out with the branches into masses of equal values through them below in the few openings to the west the sky was colored with the sunset if it were clear far over the gold of the roofs edges and of the painted carvings below was light and pale the sky far away higher up the gold was bright and clear under the rain which made it glisten it glowed between the brackets of the lower cornices and paled like silver higher up all the innumerable painted carvings and projections and ornaments looked pale behind the rain while the great red mass grew richer it rose and the bronze roofs freshly washed were blacker and the green copper glistened like malachite on the edges of the vermilion rails or on the bells which hung from the roof corners against the sky or against the trees the green wet mosses spotted with light the stone ﬂags below or glowed like fairy yellow ﬂame on the adjoining red lacquer of the temple fence so drenched now that i could see reﬂected in it the white divisions and still whiter lichens of the stone balustrade below it the great temple wall was blotched with dark purple and black lichens and the columns of the torii were white at the bottom with mosses its upper glistened yellow with their growths if it had caught the sun but the heavy rain was drenching all and now from all the roofs of the pagoda poured lines of water the one within the other the highest describing great curve that encircled all the others and the whole high tower itself if with lengthened aureole of silver drops it was if water had poured out from the fountain basins one above the other which the italian renaissance liked to picture on tall pilasters even this one was proﬁled against the sky and distant rain below yellow torrent covered the great court with an eddying lake and its course rushed down the great steps or made crested bounding line along the gutters by the walls i watched time the beautiful curves dropping from the roofs of the tower until all grew dark and my coolie arrived to carry paint box and easel and we managed to get home with sketching umbrellas wet however through every layer of clothing from nikko to kamakura nikko august yesterday i went out in another afternoon of blazing sunlight up to the corner of the temple inclosure and along its outside edge where the rocks of the mountain covered with trees make great vague wall under the damp trees runs path paved with small blocks of stone slippery with moss or when bare smoothed by ages of treading this road leads to the little cascade which supplies the sacred water of the temple of iyéyasŭ that square block of water under the gilded and painted canopy in the great courtyard the waterfall drops over rocks into hollow between the hills high trees stand along its edge near black octagonal shrine with great roof green and yellow with moss on this side of the water diminutive shrine with columns and architrave of many colors and roof of thatch all green out of which are growing the small stems of young trees in front torii just tall enough to pass under of gray stone all capped and edged with green velvety moss curved stone cushioned with moss in front of it spans the water that gives escape to the waters of the pool the doors of the shrine are closed if to make more solitary yet the quiet of the little hollow higher up past the black building and above high steps on platform edged by walls stand black buildings shrines of buddhist divinities whose golden bodies i can see through the grating of the unfastened doors i feel their amiable presence while i sit painting in the damp sunlight and the murmur of the waters seems their whispered encouragement pg 194 pg 195 pg 196 the project gutenberg ebook of an artist letters from japan by john la farge https my return i looked again toward the abrupt rocky hill to ﬁnd little monument we had passed at its foot just off the road through the inevitable torii little path of rough ﬂagging all broken up and imbedded in moss leads across the small bridge of two large stones one of whose parapets is gone and up high steps half natural to little altar of big stones with heavy balustrade around three sides little stone shrine with roof stands upon it and behind it tall gray rock upon which is incised and gilded device of ﬁve disks forming circle all around about the path and shrine are trees cover ed with moss the rocks the shrine the path are spotted with green and yellow velvet all looks if abandoned to nature but the gilded armorial bearings in the mossy stone which i take to be those of the divinized mortal in whose honor this little record has been built sama known and worshiped by every schoolboy in japan he is the patron of learning and of penmanship and was during his life great scholar and minister of state under the name of michizane this was just before the year nine hundred faithful minister learned and just man he naturally gave great umbrage especially to younger associate whose sister was empress and who succeeded through malicious slander in bringing about michizane banishment in his place of exile separated from wife and children he died two years later there i suppose he rode about on the saddled bull upon which yosai has placed him in his drawings also he was seen by motonobu in dream of which i have drawing there the great artist has represented him faithful i suppose to what he really saw younger man than he really could have been galloping swiftly and bending down to avoid the branches of the trees above bulls of bronze and marble adorn his temple in kioto recalling how the bull that drew him to the cemetery refused to go further than certain spot where he was buried in grave dug hastily misfortune and remorse followed his enemies with the death of the imperial heir so that the emperor revoking his banishment reinstalled the dead man in the honors of his ofﬁce and bestowed high rank upon his ghost since then his worship has grown i said above you see the mikado has been the fountain of honor this world and the next and i can not help being reminded of the constant relations of chinese and japanese thought in this this constant joining of that which we separate the forms of china may be more bureaucratic such national prejudices and feelings can belong to the idea of the sovereign there must exist in japan with dynasty of rulers japanese japan itself but there has been here there sort of natural duty in the government to look after all the relations of those intrusted to its care in china all religion or religions must depend upon the sanction of the ruling powers nothing is too great or too small to be satisﬁed with ofﬁcial approval may attend the worship of some local heroine ofﬁcial disapproval may be shown to some exaggerations of taoist superstitions the source of this right and this duty is always the idea that in the ruler all is centered he is responsible to heaven and is the tie between the powers above and the deities below hence there is nothing absurd in his following the governed after death in japan the forms of this power may be different but its workings will be similar and worship combined with the respect and worship of ancestors has had most important part in the development of life here in encouraging patriotism and lofty ideas and in stimulating the chivalrous feeling the ideas of honor that seem to the peculiar note of the japanese however misapplied however mistaken however barbarous some forms of these ideas may appear to us i can not make myself deﬁnition of the national character nor see clue to many of their actions unless i bear in mind the ruling power of this feeling while we are in this place where iyéyasŭ name is so important let cite triﬂing anecdote it is said that on some occasion he accompanied hideyoshi the great taiko sama each with few attendants upon some visit and all were afoot now among the retinue of iyéyasŭ was one honda man of preternatural strength who hinted to his master that this might be an opportunity an attack upon his great rival but taiko guessed the danger and turning round said to iyéyasŭ my sword is heavy unaccustomed to walking so may i not ask your servant to carry it taiko knew that it would have been considered disgrace to attack man unarmed when he had intrusted his sword not to his own servant but to the servant of his enemy and iyéyasŭ understood this appeal to the idea of honor august two more days and we shall be gone i sketch in the temples or about them everything seems more beautiful it grows to be more part of my daily existence though i am perpetually harassed through feeling that i can not copy everything and through trying to force my memory to grasp so to retain the multitudinous details of the architectural decoration i pg 197 pg 198 the project gutenberg ebook of an artist letters from japan by john la farge https drawn the curve of this and the patterns of that and noted the colors but i wonder if the thread gets loosened that holds them together whether i shall ever be able to separate one from another in their entanglement and then i still not wish to work there are so many places that i should like to look at again without the oppression of an obligatory record this evening i must take another look at the neglected graves of the followers of iyémitsŭ who committed suicide my japanese account has it that they might accompany him in his dark pilgrimage to the future world at least it says this of hotta masemori and of three others while the graves i remember them are in number and about this i have never thought to ask but i must so and then there may have been retainers of retainers it is pleasure to anyhow to set down at least one name and to help to keep this memory clear when i think of the neglected spot in which they lie it is not far from that part of the land where stood the residence of their master family now destroyed through the days of turbulence which closed the last moments of their reign broken fragments of fencing still lean against the little inclosures of stone posts balustrade and gate that surround each memo rial pillar they stand in two rows in little clearing the valley sunk behind them hidden in part by much wild growth was telling us some little while ago of the feudal habit which gave to chieftain the vow of certain retainers who undertook to follow him faithfully even beyond the grave it was expected of them in war that they should be about him sharing in his struggle and if he died in peace near or far they should be ready to go too and death is the most important thing in life i can not help thinking over the condition of mind of any one who looked forward to such limitation of its lease when age had changed the view of life had created more ties more duties had made the term nearer and more capricious while everything else became more ﬁxed did this bond with its promise of payment to be met at any moment demand become heavy burden of debt i can occasionally conjure up erroneous because my imagination of the circumstances may displace them some older man settled in pleasant places rested in secure possessions with dependants with friends with affections around his life learning at any moment of the probability that the call might come he might be summoned from any festivity or joy if by knocking at the door how curiously he must have watched the runners of the mail who might be bringing into his town the news from the court or wheresoever this other to all purposes was his perhaps ebbing away how then he would have known what to even to its most minute detail and be but part of ceremonial that he himself would direct vague memories come up to of places set apart in the garden and the screens and the hangings and the lights that belonged to the voluntary ordeal but i keep on thinking i feel more certain that my fancy displaces the circumstances of former times and of different civilization instance the concentration of the feudal territory habits of clanship the constant attendance must have narro wed the circle and made the individual more like part of one great machinery one great family than he can ever be again the weakness the insufﬁciency of the individual has been stiffened by the importance of the family of the clan basis of society and i could almost say that i discern in this one of the peculiar courtesy of this nation which seems to go along with great feeling of certain freedom so that the obedience of the inferior does not seem servile the servant who has done his duty of respectful service seems afterward ready to take any natural relation that may turn up the youth trained in respect to his betters and elders and silent in their presence will give his opinion frankly when asked with want of difﬁdence quite unexpected the coming years are certain to bring changes that can not be arrested while i was being baked at my work that i could not leave my compa nions have been away on visit higher up the mountains to the hot baths on the lake and at least part of the time have had the weather almost cold they have much to say about the baths and the fullness of visitors and the difﬁculty of getting place and one of them has gone to her bath in the native dress and another can not yet quite get over the impression made upon him by the pretty young lady near whom he stood under the eaves of the where he had taken refuge from the rain and whose modest manners were charming her youthfulness and had more covering here everything is still hot and damp though our nights are cooler and i am able to make out more conveniently my notes

artist letters from japan by john la farge https to be laden we shall follow the light of their lanterns down the road and they will seem to be carrying parts of us away from nikko nikko to yokohama near u tsunomiy august we left nikko this morning hot moist quiet lovely morning we dawdled at our friends house and breakfasted and said y to our worthy landlord yesterday he had found fault with my sketching him in his ordinary yellow priest dress while he had vestments beautiful any painter or clergyman could desire in proof of which he had rushed into his house and reappeared in those lovely things and moved about the green of the garden looking radiant any ﬂamingo but i knew not of these possessions of his and regretted quite deeply he could himself not having painted him in them it was sad of leaving his little garden good and walking down the road to the enormous steps under the trees by the river where we reversed the picture of our arrival six weeks ago there stood the naked runners and our hostess above us we sat in the kurumas but this time the doctor was not with us except to bid us his place was ﬁlled by the professional guide and factotum who sat anxious departure in his own kuruma and who days had been packing and labeling and helping to make lists and receiving instructions and bustling about at times when he was not generally making life misery we rattled over the bridge passed the children going to school and the polite policeman with spectacles and sword who looks like german rath of some kind or other and the woman of the eta class 7 who has sold us skins of monkeys and of badgers well two baby monkeys whom we have disrespectfully named sesson and sosen after the painters who so beautifully portrayed their ancestors soon we had entered the long avenue of cryptomeria and kept on through shadow and sunlight with our runners at their fullest gait we had to be in time the afternoon train at utsunomiya and it is miles from nikko but we were more than in time and had to wait at an inn near the station i am absurdly stupid and fatigued so that i have given up watching the landscape and merely make these notes besides there is missionary near us so that i feel like withdrawing into my own self and dreaming of the times he was not here i recall little story of utsunomiya connected with my associations of nikko which i shall try to tell you though at the very start i ﬁnd difﬁculty in my having heard it told in several different and contradictory i can only travel one at time i shall tell it it represents legend believed at least in the theater which we know everywhere makes kind of history the story is about the shogun iyémitsŭ whose temple you know is at nikko and who was near missing the honor of being divinized there later owing to plot arranged by his enemies the scene of which was this little town of utsunomiya at that time he was but boy the apparent and was on his way to nikko was his ofﬁcial duty to worship at the tomb of his grandfather iyéyasŭ lately deceased in this story iyémitsŭ is not in the legitimate line of descent but is made the heir by the decision of the great iyéyasŭ his father hidetada was shogun you know having succeeded iyéyasŭ during the latter lifetime old man remaining in reality the master though absolved from external responsibilities now hidetada wife was of the family of nobunaga on her mother and bore him son who was named during his childhood kuni matsu another son whose boy name was take chiyo was the son of kasuga tsubone remarkable woman each son had tutors people of importance and around each boy gathered number of ambitious interests all the ﬁercer that they were dissembled and depended success upon the choice of either heir shogun to succeed father and grandfather the claim of the other son was favored by the father and more generally accepted but the son of kasuga was superior in looks manners and intelligence and his mother hoped to inﬂuence in his favor old iyéyasŭ the grandfather pg 202 pg 203 pg 204 the project gutenberg ebook of an artist letters from japan by john la farge https was then living in retirement at sunpu that is now called shidzuoka which is on the road called the tokaido kasuga took advantage of pilgrimage to the shrines of ise to stop on her road and naturally offer homage to the head of the family the grandfather of her son besides the power of her own personality she was able to place before iyéyasŭ very strong arguments choosing the heir of the line youth promising her take chiyo iyéyasŭ advised her to continue her pilgrimage and not to go out of her woman business which could not be that of interfering with questions of state and she obeyed but iyéyasŭ revolved the entire question in his mind and decided that there was danger in delay that allowed both parties to grow stronger in antagonism so that he came at once to yedo which is now tokio and visited hidetada asking to see both the boys together they came in along with their father and his wife and took their accustomed places now these were on the higher ﬂoor raised by few inches from the ﬂoor on which kneels the visitor of lower degree in the presence of his superior line of black lacquer edges the division thereupon iyéyasŭ taking the boy take chiyo by the hand made him sit by him and alongside of his father and ordered the other son kuni matsu to sit below the line and said the state will come to harm if the boys are allowed to grow up in the idea of equal rank therefore take chiyo shall be shogun and kuni matsu daimio this decision gave to the line of the tokugawa brilliant and powerful continuity take chiyo under his manhood name of iyémitsŭ was an augustus to the cæsar iyéyasŭ and indeed iyéyasŭ had certainly made sufﬁcient inquiries to warrant his decision if he consulted the abbot tenkai of nikko who was preceptor of the boy he must have heard favorably of him according to the judgment of tenkai i ﬁnd it quoted elsewhere iyémitsŭ was very shrewd and of great foresight and in his presence the great abbot felt he said if thorns were pricking his back not but that he was also fond of luxury and splendor and one glimpse of him youth shows quarrel with tutor who found him dressing himself or being dressed performances or private theatricals and who proceeded thereupon to throw away the double mirrors which the youth followed his arrangements the usual classical rebuke condemning such arrangements unworthy of ruler of japan there are many stories of iyémitsŭ more or less to his little anecdote shows young man of quick temper well one who insisted upon proper attendance iyémitsŭ had been hawking in strong wind and with success tired and hungry he went with some to neighbo ring temple where lunch was prepared them by his cook man of rank iyémitsŭ while taking his soup in hurry crushed little stone between his teeth whereupon he immediately insisted upon the cook committing suicide the cook being gentleman man of affairs not mere artist like poor vatel hesitated and then said soup made by ever had stones or pebbles in it otherwise i should gladly kill myself you gentlemen have begun dinner at once without washing hands or changing dress and some pebble has dropped into the soup from your hair or clothes if after having washed your hands and changed your dress you ﬁnd any stones in the soup i shall kill myself whereupon iyémitsŭ did was suggested by the cook repented of his own severity and increased the cook pay but the tutor and guardians of iyémitsŭ watched over him carefully and the story i had begun to tell shows that they had sinecure the tutors and guardians of the brother whom iyéyasŭ had decided to put aside in favor of iyémitsŭ were naturally deeply aggrieved and sought chances to regain their ward future power and their own my story began iyémitsŭ representin g the hereditary shogunate was called upon to travel to nikko and worship ofﬁcially at his grandfather tomb on his way it was natural that he should rest we did at utsunomiya and in the castle of his vassal honda who was one of the tutors of his brother this was the son of the great honda masanobu of whom i spoke above champion of iyéyasŭ here was an opportunity and scheme of getting rid of the young shogun was devised by his enemies that seemed to them sufﬁciently obscure to shield them in case of success or failure at least time this was to have movable ceiling made to the weighted in such way to fall upon any one in the bath and crush him whether it was to be lifted again and leave him drowned in his bath or to remain an accident from faulty construction i not know pg 205 pg 206 pg 207 the project gutenberg ebook of an artist letters from japan by john la farge https build this machine ten carpenters were set to work within the castle and kept jealously secluded when the work was done the young shogun delayed his coming the conﬁnement fretted the men among whom was young lover anxious to get back to his sweetheart and not to be satisﬁed with the good food and drink provided to appease him he told of his longings to the gatekeeper whose duty it was to keep him imprisoned bribed him with his own handsome pay and promise of punctual return and at last managed to get out and be happy few moments the girl of his love was inquisitive but reassured by explanation that the work was done and that he should soon be out again yet not before the shogun should have come and gone on his way to nikko and so he returned to the gatekeeper at the time appointed meanwhile during that very night the ofﬁcers of the castle had gone their rounds and found one man absent in the morning the was full this was reported to the lord of the castle who decided that if he could not know who it was that had been absent it was wise to silence them all therefore each was called to be paid and dismissed and he stepped out was beheaded the gatekeeper getting wind of what was happening and fearing punishment ran away and being asked by the girl about her lover told her what he knew and that he believed all the carpenters to have been killed since her lover was dead she determined to die also having been the cause of his death and of the death of his companions she wrote out all this together with what her lover had told her of his belief and suspicions and left the letter her father and mother who received it along with the tidings of her suicide the father in an agony of distress and fear there was danger to the whole family from every side made up his mind to stop the shogun at all hazards and in the depth of the night made his way to ishibashi where one of the princes had preceded iyémitsŭ who was to pass the night still further back on the road here there was difﬁculty about getting private interview with so great man this prince whose name you will remember being the title of the former owner of our friend house in nikko ii kammon kami the letter was shown to ii who despatched two messengers gentlemen of his own one back to yedo to see to the safety of the castle there the other one to iyémitsŭ but by circuitous route so that he might appear to have come the other way the letter was to the effect that the young shogun father was very ill and desired his son immediate return by the time that iyémitsŭ could get into his litter ii had arrived and shown him the girl letter then the occupants of the litters were changed matsudaira taking iyémitsŭ norimono and iyémitsŭ matsudaira this of course was to give another chance of escape in case of sudden attack by larger force they were now in enemy country and did not know what traps might be laid them the bearers of the palanquin pressed through the night so that leaving at midnight they arrived at yedo the following evening but the strain had been so great that they could go further there was still the fear of attack and among the retinue one very strong man matsudaira ishikawa carried the litter of the prince himself but the gates were closed and the guards refused to recognize the unknown litter that of the shogun nor would they fearing treachery open when told that iyémitsŭ had returned delays ensued but at last admission was obtained iyémitsŭ through wicket he was safe later after cautious delays the guilty were punished and i hope the family of the carpenter love escaped when i ﬁrst read the story years ago the version was different and there was some arrangement of it more with some circumstances through which the young carpenter and his sweetheart escaped and alone the father innocent of harm committed suicide the story sounded sufﬁciently japanese and upside down and was pretty but i have forgotten its convolutions so that i give you this one which i think has pleasant local color it has local color and that charm of action which belongs to such histories those of the great to mention mr froude not forget that these details are given your amusement and not your instruction i am quite uncertain to the historical value of my information soon i come down to close particulars what little i really know comes down from early reading of the missionaries and of the dutch and that is mostly outside impression though thereby valuable because not based on theory or principle i not know that critical history has yet begun here but in the historical place where we have spent our summer talk about the past was but natural and all to be listened to without much chance us to distinguish what was of record and what was of legend what i have been writing about is legend and i am warned of its complicated incorrectness that has not prevented my setting it down you would like the pretty murderous story whose details reﬂect peculiar past it would be nothing to you if it were not at all iyémitsŭ but his father hidetada whose destruction the famous plot of the hanging ceiling was hatched nor would you care pg 208 pg 209 pg 210 the project gutenberg ebook of an artist letters from japan by john la farge https the ceiling and had never existed what is worth having is that many people thought that they saw themselves in the mirror of period now see how the atoms of which the previous story is constituted will give you quite another picture that i would spare you though it is correct historical one but it has the advantage of being quite strange in certain ways though not so ﬁtted the theater and of giving you again picture of feudal japan i said before the story i have just told it has been kept in memory if not invented on purpose through book written in honor of japanese opposed to honda the master of the castle the author of the plot of the hanging ceiling there may have been such story aﬂoat at that time among people of low degree kept out from the many secrets of the court but knowing that things were being done at the same time there is nothing that would account sufﬁcient reason and worse than all the date is impossible young iyémitsŭ was not in any position at that possible date eighth year of the genwa to represent the shogunate his father hidetada would have been the propos ed victim which is again impossible because of the devotion of honda the lord of the castle to hidetada that there was such an accusation i believe is understood it was met at the time and at once disproved to the satisfaction of the shogun it was the lady kano who had denounced honda and apparently invented the plot she was daughter of iyéyasŭ and had perhaps some of the ﬁerce strain said to have shown in her mother and sister her baby grandson had only just been deprived of this very ﬁef the advantage of honda so that she had at least this grievance and she was united in intention with the wife of the shogun hidetada this was beautiful and wilful woman to us by her name of sogenin whose preference iyémitsŭ brother her son also had met honda resistance you can realize that i am not capable of even discussing the question and that i am only doing it to amuse you and to bring in more pictures the shogun was to be received by the lord of utsunomiya new additions were ordered his castle the bridges and roads were repaired which works required all the laborers skilled or otherwise of his domains and even obliged him to draw upon his retainers and soldiers such enormous preparations were of course noised abroad now it so happened that at one time honda father had been concerned in an insurrection or levy of arms of certain members of the buddhist sect to which he belonged and had fought the great iyéyasŭ whom afterwards he served so faithfully among the uphold ers of the faith were ﬁghting monks variety of the militant church well known in the annals of japan at the close of this rebellion band of these like d hundred other warriors were the wardship of their former fellow partisan and there they were handy use but they had retained something of both the clergyman and the warrior keeping their priestly names and wearing their hair unshorn and they refused to work which in their eyes would have assimilated them to common soldiers and laborers thereupon this was thought to be queer even in those days lord of the castle invited them to go about the country and report upon certain matters in various places at which places they were met by bodies of armed men who put an end to them i suppose that according to strict views of the countr y and time this was justiﬁable though excessive and this is one of the little pictures that i wish to frame you see how the unpleasantness of the occasion might help the later stories of assassination and now in correcting another error i can give you another picture of feudal japan japan now broken up against whose last rulers the tokugawa i hear daily so much that lady in the story just given you where she is the mother of iyémitsŭ and the concubine of his father the shogun was very dif ferent person little iyémitsŭ was the legitimate son moreover the one who by date of birth was the probable heir notwithstanding the preference shown by his father and his mother sogenin his younger brother so that the succession was decided abruptly by the stern head of the family iyéyasŭ great attention was paid by the grandfather the great iyéyasŭ to the education of this grandson japanese friend remarked he believed that the important place in the generation was that of the third man so that three distingui shed noblemen were appointed his governors sakai to teach benevolence doi to teach wisdom awoyama to teach valor besides these great professors the future the little boy needed an immediate training by governess good in every way kasuga married woman the daughter of warrior of imperial descent who had lost his life in some conspi racy of the previous generation was chosen by the government the position this was perhaps great an honor could be offered to any lady besides there was an opportunity to clear the memory of her father and she begged her pg 211 pg 212 pg 213 the project gutenberg ebook of an artist letters from japan by john la farge https to divorce her that she might be free to give all her life to this task so devoted was she that the boy being at one time at the point of death she offered herself to the gods his recovery vowing never to take any remedy in her last illness she refused all medicine and even when her to take commended draught from his hand she merely out of politeness allowed it to moisten her lips saying that her work was done that she was ready to die and that her life had long ago been offered the master nor would she allow the master to indulge her with regard to her own son he was in exile deservedly and the shogun asked her permission to pardon him in the belief of possible amendment she refused bidding iyémitsŭ to remember his lesson that the law of the country was above all things and that she had never expected such words from him moreover that had he revoked the law her she could not die in peace there is spartan politeness in all this which i think the stories worth saving to you and they will help to give iyémitsŭ existence you he seems too vague in the temple dedicated to him at nikko even when we look at his bronze tomb and are told that he lies there packed in vermilion our minds have become so far removed from the ways of thinking of japan that divinized mortal is an empty phrase us the details of such stories i have told would not have seemed very antiquated across the seas at their date to those who remembered the days of queen elizabeth the change has been great in europe in japan but here it has been sudden like the shifting of the scene of the theater so that i can realize that when i was boy such things i am telling you would not have seemed very hereabouts and now i make my notes in this little railroad coach with the telegraph wires running in and out of the picture that i see through my window and indeed it is this implied contrast which i think has ur ged most to tell you these more or less accurate anecdotes if you wished to learn more about iyémitsŭ from the japanese biography that i have with you might be puzzled one has felt so distinctly the of the men whose names and stories are the outer history of japan so full is the impression forced upon one by the outside of the life of such ruler iyémitsŭ bounded between the worship of his grandfather in golden temples and his own worship in almost equal splendors and ﬁlled in by despotic use of power that it leaves little place the theory of all this power coming from the mikado who practically lived upon narrow income apportioned to him by his lieutenant the shogun but in my little biography written evidently to keep to present views and theories i learn that toward the emperor our impatient hero was faithful and humble part of his story consists of visits to the emperor and of his receiving honors from this source of all honor thus upon his coming of age and having his hair trimmed cut and shaved in manner to indicate this important event the emperor sends great court ofﬁcer to compliment him gives him the name of iyémitsŭ honors him with the rank of junii and appoints him go dainagon also later he appoints him to be the commander of the right wing of the imperial guard and also superintendent of the right imperial stable thereupon iyémitsŭ calls upon his majesty at kioto to pay his homage and is made commander of the army and navy and moreover naidaizin with the rank of shonii and he is also permitted to ride in an and to have armed the latter privilege one that he had been obliged to enjoy perforce from early days we have seen whereupon says my chronicler iyémitsŭ had the honor of presenting to his majesty yearly income of twenty thousand bags of rice and this goes on until after his death when the emperor gives him these titles the future the name of the rank of shoichi and the premier ofﬁce of the favor of five imperial poems was also extended to the deceased iyémitsŭ was fond of painting and studied under the instruction of kano tanyu he liked to paint the sacred mountain fuji and the same courteous chronicler tells that some of his work was better than tanyu but i should prefer seeing before deciding though tanyu imperturbable security makes one not little bored it is dark we are approaching iyémitsŭ city tokio formerly yedo the city of the tokugawa now ﬁnally returned to the emperor to whom they gave the thousands of bags of rice income we shall sleep at 22 yokohama 8 and

discouragement accompanying the continuance of cholera and this is an unseasonable moment theaters are closed people are away if i had to give an account of my time i could not make it up i know that i went to see an engraver on wood that he showed his work or his way of working of which i knew little that he made drink some tea pretty to look at and of unseizable ﬂavor that he took to see some of his work printed that i climbed up ladder somewhere into hot room where man naked but his sat slapping pieces of paper with big brush upon the block previously touched with color and that the dexterity with which he ﬁtted the paper in proper place so that the colors should not overlap was simple and primitive his dress then i went to see the painter whose drawings had been engraved i ca explain just why the arrangement of his courtyard seemed what i might have expected and yet i still keep that impression without having noticed anything but the heat and the heat accumulated in this big dreary city of innumerable little houses we explained at the door our request and after few moments we were told that the painter though he was ill would see us we entered and sat awhile during which interval boy pupil occupied in copying sketches of the master looked at us surreptitiously through circular opening in the partition that made him room our artist came in and sat down evidently an ill man and offered us the inevitable tea and showed us his methods of preparation the colored and got down examples from the great pile of rolls and bundles of papers and drawings that ﬁlled one side of the room among which i noticed many fragments of illustrated english or american newspapers and we dared not intrude any further and the conversation had turned toward european gifts of drawings from him and promise of exchange what we have really done is again to call at shops and begin over again the pursuit of it is so impossible to believe that we can ﬁnd nothing in all the accumulation of all these shops but even if it be so the manner of hunting is an amusement is the mere seeing of all this stuff in its own home and the little attentions of the dealer the being in house with the privileges of tea and smoking and lazy war of attack and defense and the slow drawing out of pieces from bags and boxes so that time the great enemy is put in the wrong and then what one is not expected to buy or look at is quite good i know of one place to which i have returned to look out of the shoji screens into the garden where there is big pottery statue of kwannon i intend to get it or to bargain about it but i intend to buy other things under its inﬂuence perhaps the daimio seats that we use in our visit or the lanterns that light us when we stay late whose oil will have to be emptied if they are sold and there are places where things are sale to people versed in chinese ways of thinking but where amateurs on the wing like ourselves are not encouraged and that is certainly seductive still i am afraid that we shall miss great deal that we wish to see because of this dawdling in shops and yet there is sadness following these visits such has come upon us when we have gone to see some of the modern workers from them we depart with more hope it is like some puzzles like the having listened to an argument which you know is based on some inaccuracy that you can not at the moment detect this about the better the new perfect work if i can call it perfect means only high ﬁnish and equal care but the individual pieces are less and less individual there is more surprise the means or methods are being carried further and beyond so that one asks one self then why these methods at all the style of this ﬁner modern work is poorer longer connected with the greater design if ambition was going into method and value of material just how far this is owing to us i can not tell but the market is largely european and what is done has vague appearance of looking less and less out of place among our works and has i said before less and less suggestion of individuality none of it would ever give one the slight shock of an exception none of it would have the appearance which we know of our own best work the feeling that we are not going to see more of it this statement applies to the best work the more common work is merely degradation the using of some part of the methods just enough to sell it and to meet some easily deﬁned immediate commercial needs i saw the beginnings years ago and i can remember one of our great new pg 217 pg 218 the project gutenberg ebook of an artist letters from japan by john la farge https dealers marking on his samples the colors that pleased most of his buyers who themselves again were to place the goods in oshkosh or third avenue all other colors or patterns were tabooed in his instructions to the makers in japan this was the rude mechanism of the change the coming down to the worst public taste which must be that of the greatest number at any given time commerce in such matters is of the moment the sale of the wooden nutmeg good enough until used have i not seen through the enormous west any amount of the worst stained glass all derived from what i made myself some years ago step toward development of greater richness and delicacy in the art of glass and my rivalry of precious stones had come to this ignoble end and caricature the commercial man or the professional man whom we call the architect must continually ask something poorer something to meet the advancing ﬂood of clients and purchasers something more easily placed anywhere at random without trouble or responsibility and reﬂecting the publi it is more easy to ﬁt in common tile than the most beautiful persian the average of buildings made themselves to meet the same common demand and so with all applied beauty the degradation is always liable to occur japan is an exceptional place studying these changes we can see them gradually all if by vivisection of some morbid anatomy the study of these diseases and infections of art at home is attended with moral distress and intellectual disgust because we are all in part responsible but here we can see it disinterestedly and speculate dispassionately upon the degradation of good things resulting from the demands of business were it quite in the line of what you expect from i might make out you the lines of the old scheme of civilization under which former work was done the feudal organization of japan divided the country into provinces of distinct habits and modes of or less isolated partly by want of easy or general communication partly by the political interests of their rulers and of the main government partly by the permanence of the provincial feeling which prevented the inhabitant of one place moving to another to ﬁnd occupation and employment the rule of the idea of the family which is still great in japan kept things in the same order preserved all traditions and at the same time offered opportunities by adoption to individuals who might increase or keep up the family reputation or inﬂuence here too i suppose is the basis of certain dignity and personal independence in the manners of the people which runs in with their courtesy every one must have known what was expected of him and have felt quite free after that duty paid within this courtesy that i see all about i feel something of what we might call democratic want of better name i recognize it in the manner of the subordinate who takes an apparently personal interest in things after his duty of politeness and obedience is paid and though there was absolute caste we understand it except in such case that of the eta the lines of life were strictly laid out until the new laws which have made things open more or less to all 9 with these changes with disturbances of fortune with the loss of power and of income on the part of the small rulers with country all laid out now in prefectures with the necessarily increasing power of bureaucracy the whole tone of individual life must change must become less independent in any one thing more independent apparently in ﬂatten out if i may so express it and the artisan will have to follow the course of trade and its ﬂuctuations until some general level has been general level of manufactures i mean there is general level possible in art something will happen which will resemble the ways of france where art still exists but where things have been so managed that any artist out of the general level has had very bad time of whole live forces of the nation in trade and bureaucracy being against his living easily any life of his own when the forces of traditional taste and skill and habits of industry now existing in japan shall have been organized anew japan like france will have undoubtedly great part to play in industrial trade art may live or may not in the future here nothing of what has been done elsewhere to grow it or foster it has made it stronger it has always come by the grace of god to be helped when it is here or choked out but gardener has ever seen its seed some of my friends in japan are plunged in movement to save what there is of the past in art to keep its traditions to keep teaching in the old ways without direct opposition to what may be good in the new they see around them the breaking up of what has been ﬁne and the new inﬂuences producing nothing not even bad imitations of europe i know too little upon what their hopes are based but who is in the tendency sails with us america and europe and i may ﬁnd out more through him meanwhile he is to inquire with professor into the education of the artist and artisan with us and to see how we it i am deeply interested in their undertaking perhaps the most remarkable of all similar honestly conducted but i see vague pg 219 pg 220 pg 221 the project gutenberg ebook of an artist letters from japan by john la farge https of distorted values of commercial authorities looked upon artistic of the same difﬁculties instance that i might meet if i wished now to make an ofﬁcial report not to the public or to government is always easy to myself who have special interest in being misled of the methods of art and industry that have been and exist in the east three days are wasted i scarcely any work and there comes to punishment feeling of the littleness of great deal here coming i think from the actual smallness of many the sizes of the little houses of the little gardens of the frail mate rials of the set manners we shall go to something great to the great statue the daibutsŭ at kamakura and perhaps we may even push far énoshima but i doubt it it will be our last day we shall sail the following morning kobe i run along the streets of tokio in the afternoon with the feeling that i have tried to set down of things having narrowed they become familiar comes the excited melancholy of departure and this same ugliness and prettiness have new value i look upon them the last time i sit in the little near the station waiting and drink the powdered tea which tastes better than ever and i not resent the familiarity of big chinaman proud of his english and of national superiority here in size and commercial value who addresses and seeks to ﬁnd out whether i too have commercial value my answers puzzle him and he leaves uncertain to quantities and walks off with the impudent majesty of his fellows among this smaller and less commercial race at dinner i see at the table near japanese gentleman not very young dining with his wife and another lady who i am told is this information i receive from my more or less trusty courier who also gives some confused intimation that this gentleman had participated in the murder of richardson the englishman many years ago under the old régime which murder somebody else was decapitated the wife is correct and immovable the animated with great deal of color and charm german or russian sits at another table heavy diplomatic the recognizes him rises goes over to his table and bends very low before him almost kneeling then speaks courteously and animatedly if in compliment to which the diplomat without turning his head says word or two distantly then the bends again down to the table and walks respectfully backward and then swings back into her seat i am amused by this complete inversion of our own habits and am reminded of the manners and assiduous attentions of our men at the theaters when they call on the indif ferent fair i see too that the points of attack and defense must be dif ferent the heat was still intense even in the night within ﬁfty yards of the sea we went down to the quay and hired boat with man and boy to drift out into the hazy moonlight the boy did the main part of the work we lay in the boat seeing nothing but this little body and the ﬂapping of its garments and everything else vague space of lightened shadow we rowed or sculled far away came near to shore where there was women opened its closed sides and revealed by their lanterns came down and called to us but we pulled off and later in ocean with shore nor sky came across little summer built on piles through which the volume of the sea pressed and recoiled nothing could be more abandoned more improbable there was nothing in sight had we entered the little pavilion and moored our boat or let it ﬂoat away we might have felt if out in the distant sea we were the center of globe of pearl edges nor outlines of anything visible except faint circular light above from which the pearly color ﬂowed tremulously and few wrinkles of silver and dark below sound but gentle sway of water and we came home having had the sense of the possibility of intense isolation in fairyland of twilight at s ea off i zu september we sailed this morning on the french steamer it is now quite late in the afterno on the paciﬁc keeps its blue under us and blue sea haze separates us from the violets and greens of the mountains of the shore behind which the light is slowly sinking all is gentle and soothing but our captain says that he is not sure and that hors nous aurons la houle du paciﬁque while waiting this long angry roll i shall tell you about yesterday of which there was little we had undertaken too much we left rather too late and drove good way in the foggy morning passing much culture and under many trees of all of which i remember little it was late when we stopped to breakfast at the little inn from which we were to be taken by kuruma ﬁrst to the big statue of buddha then wherever we might have time to go we left the place and reached the hollow between hills where the statue dwells after passing through curious deep cutting right through the rocks pg 222 pg 223 pg 224 the project gutenberg ebook of an artist letters from japan by john la farge https marks some old approach to the former city these hollows and ﬁelds were once covered by great city the city of kamakura the city of yoritomo and the great statue now out of doors was once in temple of that city places are shown you in the dells this was where was once the mansion of such hero here was that of the administrators of the military rule in the ﬁfteenth century here stood the palace where with his two hundred and eighty last followers such one retired to perform harakiri and perish in the ﬂames when overwhelming forces had captured the great city which was once the other capital of japan trees and ordinary culture cover these spaces now and here was the temple pillars supported its roof and many of their bases are still there but great inundation from the sea now some miles distant destroyed the temple and its adjacent buildings this happened far back the end of the ﬁfteenth century and the temple has not been rebuilt the desire of yoritomo to see the great statue made during his lifetime was not granted but one of his after his death collected the necessary funds and it appears to have been cast in 1252 by ono i know nothing about him but if he be the artist it is pleasant to record his name the image is made of bronze cast in pieces brazed together and ﬁnished with the chisel it is nearly ﬁfty feet high it sits and if these points help you to its size learn that its eyes instance are four feet long the length across its lap from knee to knee is feet and the circumference of the thumb is fully three feet but these measures though they show large scale and great size not indicate proportion we should understand it the whole modeling is effect and the means and methods of the modeling are simple and elementary like all work done on archaic principles the main accentuations are overstated and saved in their relations by great subtleties in the large surfaces it is emphatically modeled colossus it is not little thing made big like our modern colossal statues it has always been big and would be so if reduced to we saw it ﬁrst from the side through trees we ran rapidly to the front where are temple gate and long courtyard still in order that leads up to the statue from the side one can see how it bends over and rough it is from behind the impression of something real was strong its gray form moved through the openings of the trees the photographs must long have made you know it and they also show the great base and the immense temple ornaments that stand upon it at the feet of the statue they show also the little lodge at the side where the priest in attendance lives and gives information and sells photographs and takes them and generally acts showman we took many photographs from new points of view and we even removed the thatch of penthouse so to get nearer and under the statue to the side and i painted also more to get the curious gray and violet tone of the bronze than to make faithful drawing that seemed impossible in the approaching afternoon we did not know how long time we had spent lingering about it the clouds had begun to open and faint autumnal light ﬁlled the little hollow which has only small trees and imposing monuments like the great cryptomeria which alone might seem ﬁt to grow about here all on the contrary was gentle and lines of the hills the trees the garden plants about us we might have been anywhere perhaps it is just well the whole impression comes from the statue with the only objection or detraction that we can get near enough to it to see the mechanism the means and details of its expression an accident the breaking of its prison temple by great cataclysm of nature great wave of the sea coming far inland and destroying the great building has given to the statue something that it could never have had to the physical the degree it has now now freed from its shrine the ﬁgure sits in contemplation of entire nature the whole open world that we feel about us or its landscape the hills the trees and ﬁelds the sky and its depths the sunshine playing before the eyes of the seated ﬁgure the air in which dance all the things that live in air from the birds that ﬂy to the atoms of dust and the drifting leaves and blossoms the confusion or the peace of the elements the snow in crystals and the rain in drops all this world of ours which to the contemplative mind is but ﬁgurative fragment of the universe lies before the mental gaze of the buddha unwinking without change of direction he looks forever his will is forever subdued and held beneath him his ﬁngers pressed together indicate his freedom from all the disturbances of that past of being which is subject to time and change and his cognition undisturbed envelops and images the universe in ﬁnal contemplation astounding success of the artist in what he has really done there is trace of means the sum of realism is so slight the conventional has so great part each detail is almost more of an ornament than of representation one almost believes that the result may be partly accidental that one can not fathom the reason of the expressiveness of countenance or of the inﬂuence of few musical notes even though one knows the mechanism so it seems difﬁcult to grant pg 225 pg 226 pg 227 the project gutenberg ebook of an artist letters from japan by john la farge https there was once choice in the other mind that caused it that there were once many paths opened before it and still more i believe that the accident of the great tempest has given yet more patent and subtle meaning to the entire ﬁgure once upon time its details indeed if not its entirety must have looked more delicate in the reﬂected light of the temple building when the upper part of the ﬁgure was bathed in mysterious gloomy light while the lower glittered in answer to the openings of the doors but could anything ever have rivaled the undecidedness of this background of veiled sky and shifting blue which makes one believe at times that the ﬁgure soon must move one looks longer and longer at it with everything around it gently changing and the shadows shifting upon its surface the tension of expectation rises to anxiety the trees rustle and wave behind it and the light dances up and down the green boughs with the wind it must there is change and it shall sit forever we left and i walked down the long pavement in front of the statue in the early autumn sunshine and the rising freshness of the wind i turned again and again each time with the realization that the statue was still sitting until we turned out of sight vague unreasonable sense of having left it alone accompanying until other different light and gay impressions broke the inﬂuence and allowed to think of what i had seen work of art such i could understand and if i wished make also and we lunched at hase near by and from the comfortable inn could see on the gray hill above the temple of kuwannon and its red buildings and balustrades after very long lunch we walked up to the temple and from the platform in front looked toward the afternoon sea right before us and the plain of kamakura then we entered and were taken in behind the great screen doors to narrow but high only from the little stood right by us and over us standing ﬁgure of the divinity all golden in the dark it is over thirty feet high and whether it be great art or not the darkness was too great to judge of form the glitter of smile of gold far up above our heads in the obscurity of the roof was an impression that even so near to the great statue out of doors remains distinct it was late afternoon we dared look at more statues nor at relics of warriors of kamakura and started the beach partly with the hope of seeing fuji behind us but all was veiled in the sky we walked along the beach our kurumas dragging behind us and crossed little stream and while bathed in and thereby took possession of the paciﬁc i walked up the toward the little village at the end of the strand i came near it an unfortunate distorted being scarred with some leprous disease plung ed toward in the twilight from some vague opening in the hills and begged piteously following afterward with thankful wail of danna san danna san danna san that i hear yet we reëntered our kurumas and drove in triumph to the inn of the little village i say in triumph i drove in triumph observed of all obser had my usual costume and was clothed rather than wait to get dry rode along with only partial covering of yukatta and attracted attention had he had nothing on at all he would have been still more in keeping with many of our neighbors night was fallin g

kioto from osaka by rail one ﬁne afternoon i had hope of being surprised memory of days when boy i read of the great forbidden city only few years ago it was still forbidden and now the little respectable car was hurrying us there prosily older life translates the verse of our early dreams we were in september heat and glare we passed over wide spaces of plain edged by sharp mountains looking hot and barren through great plantations and stretches of green with here and there temple half hidden over dried river pg 228 pg 229 pg 230 the project gutenberg ebook of an artist letters from japan by john la farge https station closed all views on our arrival and the sudden transfer to streets showing european inﬂuences was if we had passed through city walls the ﬁrst sensation was merely the usual one of whirl through innumerable buildings low of wood and more or less the same extremely wide streets all very clean many people great bridge across the stony bed of river almost dry then some trees and little gardens and corners of temples with heavy roofs we turned through little roads and drove up to the gate of the hotel inclosure which is placed on the edge of the outside hills and looks down upon kioto we were high up in rooms looking over trees just below next to us the corner of temple grounds that rounded away out of sight kiot in early on most mornings i have sat out on our wide veranda and drawn or painte d from the great panorama before distant mountains making great wall lighted up clearly with patches of burning yellow and white and green against the western sky the city lies in fog sometimes cool and gray sometimes golden and smoky the tops of pagodas and heavy roofs of temples lift out of this sea and through it shine innumerable little white spots of the plastered sides of houses great avenues which divide the city in parallel lines run off into haze far away always shines the white wall of the city castle near us trees and houses and temples drop out occasionally from the great violet shadows cast by the mountain behind us before the city wakes and the air clears the crows ﬂy from near the temples toward us the great bell of the temple sounds and we hear the call of the gongs and indeﬁnite waves of prayer occasionally hawk rests uneasily on the thin branches below then the sun eats up the shadows and the vast view unites in great space of plain behind the monotony of the repeated forms of the small houses broken by the shoulders of the roofs and pagodas of many temples but near us are many trees and and gardens and we are if in the country we have worked conscientiously mere sightseers until all is confused with an indigestion of information i could hardly tell you anything in reasonable sequence in and out of what i go to see runs perpetual warp of looking at curios of which occupation i feel every day disgusted and ashamed and to which i return again gambler might with the hope of making it all right with my conscience by some run of luck this began on our very ﬁrst day when at our ﬁrst visit to an excellent merchant whom we had letters we spent the hours after dinner looking at the brought together our purchase or amusement we had had the presentation and disappearance of the ladies of the house after their customary genuﬂections and european dinner waited upon in part by lesser clients of our entertainer meanwhile his one little girl sat beside him half behind him and occasionally betrayed her secret love him by gently pressing his leg with the sole of her little stockinged foot japanese children are one of the charms of japan and this one is type of their stillness her sweet patient face watching the talk of the elders change in her eyes revealing anything but the whole person taking everything little delicate person which disappeare d in dress and sash not unlike her elders except color then there was visit to another merchant in the pg 231 pg 232 the project gutenberg ebook of an artist letters from japan by john la farge https house of the city built low so that none might perchance look down upon the sovereign lord procession display of family gifts and complete trousseaux of the past marriage dresses of the same time symbolical in color red and ﬁnally black we are told to notice that the gold and silver ﬁttings of precious lacquers are wanting because many years ago some sumptuary edict of the tokugawa government suddenly forbad the display or use of the precious metals in gradation to be determined by inspecting persons who like merchants should not pretend to pass certain line then owing to other letters we have paid our devoirs to the governor and called and subsequently received the polite attentions of his intelligent secretary under his guidance we visit the school of art and see boys sketching and enter rooms of drawing devo ted respectively to the schools of the north and the south and we visit the school girls where the is one bloom of complexions like great where the ladylike teacher of gymnastics and child etiquette wears divided skirts where the rooms the study of chinese classics and history contain smaller number of fair students looking more reasonable and much paler and where on admiring in the empty charming sketch of kioto wharves like the work of some lesser rico i am told that the fair artist has just if it had happened with us at home but with difference worth weighing gravely our guide and teacher informs that the aim of this education is not to make girls independent but rather to make more intelligent and useful daughters sisters or wives and in this view i come to recognize the edges of great truth then temples kioto is city of temples and every day some hours of hot morning have been given to visits all of which make great blur in my mind the general memory is impressive and grand the details run one into the other thus we are paying dear sightseeing but it is impossible to set aside the vague curiosity which hates to leave another chance unturned and when again shall i return and see all these again now however all is associated with heat and glare and with the monotony of innumerable repeated impressions differing only in scale still probably when i shall have left i shall recall more clearly and separately the great solemn masses of unpainted wood which early forests have been spoiled the great size of their timbers the continuous felicity of their many rooﬁngs the dreary or delicate solemnity of their dark interiors the interminable recurrence of paintings by artists of the same schools the dry and arid looked at in this heat of weather from the golden shadows where are hidden sometimes lovely old statues sometimes stupid repetitions images of the whole race of earlier shoguns the harsh features of the great taiko sama the sleek and subtle face of the great iyéyasŭ or the form of carved by early art leaning her cheek on long ﬁngers or noble tapestried ﬁgures rich in color and intensity of spotting painted by the buddhist i should like to describe the temple ceilings in which are set the lacquered coffers of the war junk of taiko or of the state carriage of his wife i have sketched in his reception hall peopled only by specters of the gilt and painted panels on which may have looked the great iyéyasŭ who was to succeed him and the blessed xavier and the early jesuits and the chivalric christian lords who were to die on great battleﬁelds and close to great room where many monks bent over peaceful books the little closet with dainty shelves in which taiko looked at the heads of his dead enemies brought there inspection and we have gone up into the plain little pavilion sacred to the ceremonies of where the rough and shrewd adventurer offered to grim ambitious warriors honoriﬁc guerdon hard service the simple little cups of glazed clay that collectors prize i run over these associated details because certainly the question of the great buildings is too weighty my present mood but the greater part of the romance of japan is called up at every moment by what we see just now at uji among the tea gardens we stopped on our way to nara the older capital to see the temple of and its phœnix hall built in wood that is now over eight hundred years old its statues its painting s of the paradise in the west its high dusty ceiling inlaid with mother and its bell and we saw the legendary bow of yorimasa which you will recall with whenever you see picture of the bow of the moon across which ﬂies the japanese cuckoo it was here that he defended uji bridge with forlorn hope against the army of the taira that his prince might pg 233 pg 234 pg 235 the project gutenberg ebook of an artist letters from japan by john la farge https time to escape and here at while his last followers kept off the rush of the enemy yorimasa ran himself through with his sword ﬁnal duty paid to the honor of japan on this side of the bridge i walked up other temple steps hedged in by trees with our friend the violet butterﬂies and blue crossed our path in every bar of sunshine at the monastery of kurodani on the edge of the mountain near us are show n the graves of nawozane and of the young atsumori whom he killed in battle we are shown the portrait of the victim painted in sorrow by the victor and the still stands upon which the warrior hung his armor when tormented by remorse he carried out his vow of never more bearing arms and sought this place to enter religion and pray the soul of the youth he had unwillingly slain strange ﬂower of human pity blooming out of the blood of civil wars like some story of italy in the coeval day of francis at that time the great war of the genji and the heike was devastating japan and in 1184 in great battle by the sea yoshitsune the hero of romance of japan serving his brother yoritomo whose story i told you at nikko defeated the heike and the death of atsumori took place this delicate boy prince of the heike scarcely sixteen years old met in the battle the veteran nawozane atsumori had fought bravely on the shore having at ﬁrst ﬂed and then returned forcing his horse through the water the greater strength of the older man prevailed and the child fell under the blows of the powerful when nawozane disengaged his enemy helmet intending to take off the usual trophy of head the sight of the youthful face recalled his own son slain in battle and he hesitated in inﬂicting on other parents suffering like his own but if he did not kill him others would and his reputation would be endangered he killed him atsumori bravely meeti ng death and bore off the terrible trophy then in the revulsion of remorse he vowed himself to religious life he restored to atsumori father the son fair head and his armor and going to kioto became disciple in religion of the holy hónen shónin the founder of kurodani and there near its lovely garden are the tombs of the man and of the boy or while we are thinking of heads cut off i pass again and again lofty monument under great trees on wide avenue beautifully macadamized and kept in the trim of our central park along which ride ofﬁcers in western uniform or pass the police in dress whose type is borrowed from at least three european states under this tomb are buried the ears and noses of the koreans slain in the wars that hideyoshi waged at the end of the sixteenth century they were carried here more convenient than the heads the usual evidence of work well done brought by the warriors to their commander the memory of what the great pile means serves to confuse still more my admiration of the success of the wide carriage drive on which it stands osaka september we have come to osaka to spend an entire day in to arrive early at the big shop to have tea offered us in the little back room of the merchant which looks out and steps out upon his garden of few trees and little pebbly walks and some stone garden that is us which his own may or may not be then cigars and pieces of porcelain brought from the storehouses then more tea and an inspection of the many rooms full of odds and ends then more tea and more pieces slowly and reluctantly drawn from the storehouse if we could not be so unreasonable then lunch and tea always in the house then adjournment to the upper rooms when the hundreds of kakemon are unrolled one after the other to crescendo of exasperation then rediscussion of matters and visits to other rooms full of wares not spoken of before then more tea and the last pieces grudgingly produced from the same occult storehouses purchases amid ﬁnal bewilderment tea again and departure we had come to osaka on our way back from nara and we again return to kioto which we left three days ago the trip to nara was fatiguing and delightful and i should like to recall it you but i have time and have made notes and besides my memories are again beginning to merge one into another and they themselves to blend with what i see in kioto but certainly something ﬂoats over which few lines can give we were out in our kurumas early in the morning each with three runners we found waiting us patiently outside at inari where he had expected us from the earliest morning it is from him that i get the little clay fox given good luck in partnership with the one he retained i need not speak of the heat the roads were dusty and dry where they were not muddy and wet in the country paths we took we passed the edge of the city which ends suddenly in rice ﬁelds occupying what were once streets and houses kioto is only part of what it has pg 236 pg 237 pg 238 the project gutenberg ebook of an artist letters from japan by john la farge https and even when it was larger not so many years back it must still have been only the remainder of greater past we get into what is really the country passing from broad road to narrow tracks our runners sometimes lifted us over soft wet places or bumped us over narrow ditches or guided us at full tilt on the edges of the stones that are bridges sometimes more patiently we halted to allow the ﬁles of black bulls to meander past us dragging loads on wheels or carrying bales rarely we met peasants and then usually women sometimes with horses of larger breed than that we saw last month in the east once among rice ﬁelds in the basin of circle of low hills i saw the grove which covers the tomb of some divine emperor of early times we circled around the slope far away from this solitary oasis of trees we could see the grove on every side ﬁnished and complete and rounded by time if sculptured in nature from some of those sketches that japanese artists make carving when they give all four sides and the bottom and the top on single page nothing else but perhaps some uninscribed stone marks the tomb of emperors dotted about the plains of this oldest province of japan strange enough even in this strange country is this evidence of the extreme of simplicity in death in life of the oldest line of oriental despots absolute lords and masters patterns of the deity who make this one solitary exception of simplicity in

out of the darkness the sound of the great bell which rang ﬁrst some eleven centuries ago and the singing of the frogs in the ﬁelds which were once city it is now too late to begin to describe

sitting near the balustrade of the while inside in the greater shade they moved to the music and hymns of the and white ﬁgures with long tresses of black hair and chaplets of ﬂowers with faces all

wandered in the late afternoon and evening through its courts kindly received by the priests whom we had the recommendation of friendly name at least i had time to see the golden hall one of the earliest buildings now more than twelve centuries and half old and the noble paintings on its walls attributed to some famous sculptor of that day their placid elegance the reﬁnement of their lines their breath of religious peace explained those claims to solemn and glorious past japan which look like conventional exaggeration in that is delicate and small and dry the recall of greek perfection was not forced and while still vaguely unwilling to confuse one excellence by referring to another i could not help again thinking of the greek and of tanagra images when i saw by the light of the torches in the great pagoda old the great hall groups modeled in clay by the same old sculptor whose name is given to the and and monju and the scenes of the death of buddha an admirab le antiquity was to be the continuous impression of the evening carried out into our last looks at the treasure house its very air of an old new england barn or crib raised upon posts its rough red painting the high wooden steps of entrance the gigantic wooden with which the guardian priest fumbled at its door gave the note of extreme early feeling of persisting indifference to the adornments and changes of centuries of fashions it has been useless all along to detail anything but the impressions of the last things seen remain with types of all there hung on the old walls of the treasure house framed banner once carried in ancient battles its brocaded pattern exactly like that which we know in babylonian art the circles with the lilies between and in each circle the assyrian monarch struggling with or original of coeval sassanian persia i supp ose but housed here all these thousand years and in its persistence of pattern connecting with that heavy and oppressive antiquity of nineveh which

veneration past greatness to recognize in the veilings and sequences of this painting of the lotus methods i had used myself working at such distance of time and place when i had tried to render the tones and the transparency of our fairy water and i know you will forgive the superstitious sense of approval of my from this indeﬁnite past of art we wandered among the buildings until night had set

whirled past the houses of the small town indiscreetly close to the paper screens lighted from within against which were proﬁled the shadows of faces sometimes with pipes or cups lifted to their lips or the outlines of coiffures piled up on the pictures more japanese than their very originals then between rounded hills on which stood masses of then near to empty spaces of water then sank into dark hollows at the bottom of which rivers ran fast the other way i watched and looked long fatigue allowed but fell asleep in the uncomf ortable kuruma waked every now and then by some sudden jolt to my extended arm and head occasionally i had dreamy glances at what i remember vast plain with lofty colorless mountains at one side and perhaps i saw glimpses of the sea the night air was cool in the hollows after the sweltering day and i found my arm and face damp with the dew japanese poet would have said that it was but the spray from off the oars of some heavenly boat which sailed that night across the starry stream of the milky way in the dawn we saw the white walls of the castle of the city of osaka and ran across its many bridges all silent in the morning september we spent the late afternoon and early evening in the state apartments of the temple of the green lotus where we looked at strange dances and listened to curious music all was sacred and mystic according to traditions transmitted orally from early ages and all the more liable to disappear the heredity of occupation which has been the mark of japan is more and more endangered by modern views and modern openings when we had wandered through those shady apartments in the long low buildings of the temple gardens and had seen the paintings of their screen walls and the carvings of their transoms we sat down in one of the largest rooms the wall screen was removed which divided us from another and we had then stage before us light came in from the open veranda now stripped of all screens against whose platform many unbidden unofﬁcial guests acquaintances of acquaintances and people about the temple leaned in mass of heads and arms and busts outside the light was ﬁltered green and orange through the trees and

three temple crests in white made twilight background their white and blue dresses gilded by the lights in the tall candlest icks on the ﬂoors before them with the sound of the instruments two boys came around the corner of the screen and saluting stepped off in short zigzag movements evidently learned by rote and which had certain strange elegance they were performing the butterﬂy dance and made out very distinctly the crisscross ﬂight of the insects when they lighted or poised before lighting their feet struck the ground and they swayed without stepping away they wore butterﬂy wings and wide sleeves melting into them and their silver diadems ﬁlled up with twigs of ﬂowering plants made out faint fringe of antennæ they wore the ugly ancient trousers of yellow silk and long trains of embroidered green satin trailed on the mats behind them broad bands of blue and white across the chest and white belt recalled the insect original and blue and white wings drooped over their wide green satin garments each carried ﬂowering branch in his hand it was all more strange than beautiful with mysterious impression of remote antiquity if invented some prehistoric polynesian worship in some of the next dances whose names i not remember and which were carried out by men the ﬂat mask with wide triangle eyes and another the mouth made out just this similitude in another dance two men glided about the room listening and ﬁnding their way then warriors in antique chinese costume with great helmets and halberds and coats of mail and long trains appeared singly and by twos and marched and counter marched and ﬁnally standing by their lances laid at their feet drew and held up their swords while each other peaceful hand was extended in the gesture that we know the pontiﬁcal blessing

with loose jaw and projecting mane and long red pointed hood made an impression barbarous meaningless splendid and annoying what we might feel before the painted and gilded idol of some little known and cruel creed this was the dance of ra dragon king and closed the entertainment we exchanged some words with the late performers in their insigniﬁcant everyday clothes and rode home in the twilight through the little roads where kioto gentlemen were rushing their horses up and down wrapped in wide riding trousers which ﬂuttered along the horses ﬂanks we have also given soirée is to say supper with the proper trimmings of musical entertainment and dancing and were probably the most amused of all the people there the amusement consisted in great measure of our not knowing just what we were going to have otherwise the details were simple to monotony we had one of the upper ﬂoors of fashionable inn it was very hot and we were glad to ﬁnd that we should be at supper in our loosest bath robes there was nothing everything is novel to the extreme smallness of the many who sat between us at the end of the dinner passed the sakè said witty things of which we understood not one word gave us much music on the samisen the guitar and on the ﬂute and sang and gave us dances but they were absolutely incredible in the way of littleness it did not seem possible that there were real bones inside their narrow little wrists and dolls ﬁngers what there was in most of their little heads i know but i could have imagined sawdust the doll illusion the painted face and neck and lips all done upon the same pattern from pure conventionality not at all like our suggestive painting and the sudden stopping sharply at line on the little slender neck gave the feeling of their having artiﬁcial heads the gentle little bodies disappeared entirely inside of the folds of the dress and the enormous bows of the sash and when the tall youngsters americans whom we had invited began to romp with the

evening when the fun i suppose was uproarious we went to the extreme of writing and painting on fans and one of our merc hant guests wasted in mock tattooing of his bared arm and shoulder september we leave morning this has been sunday our last day in kioto i have been trundled all day in fearful rain to see last sights to look up shops the last time my runners have taken to this or that place near the great temples where i hope ﬁnally to decide upon some little buddha or amida which have tempted among other sculptures and i have dallied in the other shops that supply the small things that adhere to worship and ﬁnally i have made long visit to the good lady who has sold pottery and who once shocked my western prudery by dilating upon the merits of unmentionable designs and indescribable

couples whom i re cognize how can i tell them from those whom i know at the quaint amusing little children always fresh delight at the little pavilion near us where the archers shoot at the places where horses stand under the trees to be ridden by amateurs at the small tea garden pretty gates at the latticed windows which open in the dusk and then with their coats sticking to their backs and

dragging and bumping us up many steps and ﬁnally escort us almost to the temple itself in procession of double ﬁle which like long tail halts when we stop and again waggles after us in uncertainty when we set off anew we walk along the ascending street and stop to bargain at the innumerable little shops full of little odds and ends half playthings and half religious emblems or images which are sold certainly to the pleasure of the many children who throng the place and i too feel pleased at having children with us and at having occasionally the timid little ﬁngers of miss kimi in mine in her other small hand she holds fan that i painted yesterday her father and i wonder occasionally whether she wishes to notice her possession i surmise that the foreign gentleman gives her sometimes little doubtful fear i catch her eyes looking up cautiously from below her bangs we talk exactly of what it would be hard to say there is not with us enough of any one language to go round and our interpreter has been left out but we feel distinctly that we understand each other and our older companions explain quite number of things in this partnership of few words we ascend the high steps on one side of the tower and pass with the sunday crowd through the great hall like corridor along which are seated on altar steps golden imag es of gods in shadow dusted by the long beams of the afternoon sun that pour across it from one open side through this veil of dancing motes we see the statues and the great gilded lotuses and candelabra and the forms of attendant priests and the crowd that passes and that stops moment in prayer the words that they repeat come into cadence with the shufﬂing of their feet and the creaking of the planks of the ﬂooring and the sounds of the dropping of of ferings the crowd is quiet orderly but amused at being out the women smile out of their slanting eyes and walk leaning forwards and their black hair shines like lacquer and the artiﬁcial ﬂowers in the great folds of the coiffure dance in the sunlight they are quietly dressed all but the young girls who wear bright colors and blue satin sashes the men slide about also in quiet silk or cotton large part of them are dressed in every shade of blue occasionally the bare leg comes out but all wear holiday dress except our runners or their fellows who keep their workday looks and the are all everywhere and all at home they are all dressed up with full skirts and showy sashes and every little head with some new and unexplainable spot of tonsure many of the crowd turn around the building or its veranda touching the columns with their hands and following tracks worn deep like ruts in the planking of enormous thickness san points this out to and indicates its religious intention both he and our other companion clap their hands and pray moment wave of seriousness and abstraction passes over their faces then again all is before and we step out upon the wide balcony which built upon gigantic piles hangs over deep hollow ﬁlled with trees and buildings all in the shadow now from below rise with the coolness of the green trees and grass the sounds of dropping waters in time we descend the path and the steps and drink from one of the streams which fall from gigantic gar goyles out of great mass of wall but it is late we look again upon kioto from the temple above all swimming in light and haze and walk back to our kurumas ﬁnal to the children but we shall see their parents again and then we return and look from our veranda the last time at the city stretched out in the evening lost almost entirely in the twilight of great lake of violet fog few shapes are just felt in the misty space but more than waves in water or greater densities in the undulations of the colored vapor so uncertain is everything that the nearest temple building loses its place and ﬂoats all below its roof but its wet tiles glitter reﬂecting the drift in the highest pale turquoise sky below us the trees make delicate pattern of dark wet lace then the deepens and dulls the upper sky becomes colorless all ﬂoats in unreal space and kioto disappears from before my eyes forever i the

of our memories glistening in the shadow and the dew we turned our backs the last time on kiyomidzu and ran through the great gate of the temple near us then bumping down the steep steps under it skirted the great wall of dai butzu and the interminable side of the sanjiu sangendo the hall of the spaces 10 along which in old times the archers used to shoot then we gradually got out of the city into the road ﬁlled with trafﬁc going both ways there seemed to be break between town and country here and there the mountain side covered with trees descended to the road but the effect was that of long street deep among hills and continuously spotted with buildings long trains of beautiful black bulls drawing lumber or merchandise or carrying straw bales streamed peacefully along we passed peasant women tall sometimes handsome with scarlet under gowns held up occasionally one riding on or in her place child perched on the hump of the wooden saddle or again peasants bearing loads on their backs or carriers with weighty merchandise swung between them on poles priests young and old stepping gravely in their white or yellow or black with umbrellas open others whose quicker step meant that they had not far to go perhaps only to some wayside temple protecting their shaven heads with outsp read fan or kuruma usually with one runner taking into town economically two women

valley melted away and the harbor of otzu and lake biwa and blue mountains over the water and others sketched in the air were spread before us in the blaze of sunlight seen through the cool shadow of the mountains we rode down the hill to little jetty marvelously like north river dock with big sheds where passengers were waiting and little steamer fastened to the wharf we bade the last time to who said many things that we appreciated but did not understand the words of and who pointed to the square japanese sails glittering in the light saying fune fune the boats the boats we dismissed kurumas and kurumaya and sailed off with hakodate the courier alone we stretched ourselves on the upper deck half in sun half in shadow and blinked lazily at the distant blue mountains and the great lake two hours later we had landed at long jetty in heavy sea with tossing dark blue water different from the quiet azure of our sail the brisk wind blowing the white clouds over the blue sky was clear and cold we got out of its reach i felt neuralgic and tried to sleep in little waking to the screams of the girl mairimasho and i had but time pg 253 pg 254 pg 255 the project gutenberg ebook of an artist

railroad ride what with neuralgia and heat and the effects of the dance of the little steamer on lake biwa there were mountains and ravines and vast engineering protections our path and everywhere the evidence of struggle with the many running waters we crossed or skirted the blue and silver of the lake that we had crossed and the sweetness of its air were shut out in the dust and the heat of mountain sides we had not seen the eight beauties of biwa lake 11 the autumn moon from ishiyama had set long before we passed and the idea of other temples to be seen brought out antagonism to more climbing only to be rewarded by promenades through lanterns and shrine s and confused struggling with dates and divinities the evening snow on was not to fall until we should be across the paciﬁc nor could we ask of that blue september morning the blaze of evening at seta nor the evening bell of we heard the bell early and wondered whether it were still uninjured from the time when big benkei

there i might have met perhaps the old man and the old woman you have seen over and over again in the pictures and on the fans they are the spirits of the other old of takasago and sumiyoshi and they are fond of visiting each other nor did we see the wild gees alighting at katada but i felt if i had seen the boats sailing back from yabase and the bright sky with breeze at awadzu if i had not i still had seen boats sailing over and under lovely blue can be spread by early september days i suppose that our friend was trying to recall these last classical quotations to when he bade at the landing in otzu an ocean rolls between his parnassus and ours but he lives much nearer to the mood that once made beautiful the names of tempe and helicon and the winding meander ama from kambara beach with all this dreaming i fell asleep and woke free from pain but stupid and unimpressionable our train stopped at the little station from which we were to ride to gifu this was little new of course i remember its name so like and so unlike one of ours with the same look of the railroad being laid imposed an earth which did not understand what it all struggling to get back to the sides of

ordinary setting out of wayside trees in this province of forestry insisted on the analogy confused perhaps with dream of lombard plains and mountains in cool blue distance the mind insists on clinging to reminiscences if afraid to trust itself to the full sea of new impressions i rode along so neat and clean was each picture framed in sunlight if we were in shadow or in clear shade when we were in sunlight that i thought i could remember enough small facts sketches and notes when i should get to gifu we reached gifu in the early twilight and had special one impression we were framed in by the streets and confused by turning corners and disturbed by anxiety to get in but we had one great triumph our guide was new to the we were and we chose our inn at our own sweet will with feeling of authority and personal responsibility delicious to experience after such ignominy of guidance up we went to our rooms and opening the shojis 12 looked out upon the river which seemed broad great lake our house was right upon it and the open casement framed nothing but water and pointed mountains stealing away in the obscure clearness of colorless twilight the running of the river sloping down from the hills on bed of pebbles cut off the noises of the town if there were any and the silence was like that of country heights in this semi tension the day pictures disappeared from my mind i was all prepared to have something happen which i should have been listening when suddenly our host appeared to say that the boats were coming down the river the chilly evening air gave us new freshness and off we started deaf to the remonstrances of hakodate who had prepared and set out his very best supper we rushed past the artist in cookery whose feelings i could yet appreciate and plunged after our host into the dark streets in few minutes we were by the riverside and could see far off what we took our boat with its roof and lanterns the proffered backs of our attendants gave the solution of how we were to get to it straddling our human nags we were carried far out into the shallow pebbly river landed into the boat and poled out into deeper water nothing to be seen but the night and the conical hills one of which i fancied to be inaba where was once nobunaga castle some faint mists were white in the distance if lighted by rising moon at great distance from us perhaps at quarter of mile light ﬂickered over the water on our approach we could distinguish man connected with it who apparently walked on the dark surface he was evidently ﬁsherman or shrimper and his movements had all the strangeness of some aquatic bird he knew his path and far out followed some track or ford adding to the lonelin ess does crane in marshy landscape then i saw him more he headed up the river toward an opening between the hills suddenly haze of light rounded the corner of the nearest mountain then grew into line of ﬁre coming toward us above the rustle of the river cours and our own against it came the beating of cry in unison the line of ﬂame broke into many ﬁres and we could see the boats rushing down upon us quickly i can write it they came in an even line wide ﬁfty feet or enough us to pass between whereupon we reversed our movement and drifted along with them in the front of each boat hung upon bent pole blazed large cresset ﬁlled with pine knots making above cloud of smoke starred with sparks and long needles of red cinders below in the circle of each light and on its outer rim swam many birds glossy black and white cormorants straining so at the cords that held them that they appeared to be dragging the boats they spread like fan before the dark shadow of the bows the cords which fastened them glistened or were black in the night each string ran through the ﬁngers of the master at the bows and was fastened to his waist and lost in the glittering straw of his like driver he seemed to feel his birds movements his ﬁngers loosened or tightened or suddenly with clutch pulled back then came rebellious ﬂuttering and the white glitter of ﬁsh in the beaks each bird was forcibly drawn up to the gunwale and seized by the neck encircled by its collar then white ﬁsh glittered out again and was thrown back into the boat the bird scuttled away dropped back into the water and shaking itself was at work again they swam with necks erect their eyes apparently looking over everything and so indifferent to small matters to allow the big cinders to lie unnoticed on their oily ﬂat heads but every few seconds one would stoop down then throw back its head wildly with ﬁsh crosswise in its mouth when that ﬁsh was small one it was allowed by the master of the bird to remain in the capacious gullet each pack guided by master varied in numbers but i counted thirteen

rhythm we had heard when the ﬂotilla bore down upon us fishing with cormorants ten minutes quarter of an hour more passed we kept alongside with motionless celerity i tried to sketch in the insufﬁcient sometimes one sketch right upon another so little could i see my lines in the treacherous light then the boats swerved off and were driven to the shore together or far we could get to it in the shallow water above us rose the steep green hillside the trees and rocks lit up in an arabesque of light and dark by the now diminished ﬂames the birds rested standing in the water preening their oily backs and white bellies and ﬂapping their ragged wings which seemed to have been clipped the apprentice caress ed his bird the ﬁshermen and the steerers laughed and exchanged jokes and chatted generally with all the good nature and making light of hard work which is so essentially japanese then the birds began to ﬁght and to show that peace was not their pleasure fresh pine knots were thrown into the cressets each man took his place the polers pushed off the birds strained at the strings and all capo little longer we watched and then we let the boats glide past us the ﬁres faded again into haze of light they went down the river toward the bridges of the town now dotted with people then we were carried to the shore we had left it and were piloted home through the streets now ﬁlled with lanterns and movement we found our outraged artist in cookery still indignant over our neglect of food but he was gradually appeased and made up his hungry masters fairly sufﬁcient meal

water while i watched through the screens the waving of palm tree in the wind which was now blowing autumnally and had cleared the sky and enlivened us with hope of continuous view of fuji along the beach we rode away the breakers ran far up the sand and the water was green emerald from the brown wet shore to the distant blue haze of the ocean in the south at the end of the great curve of the gulf stretched the lines of green and purple mountains which run far off into idzu and above them stood fuji in the sky very pale and clear with one enormous band of cloud up its long slope and melting into inﬁnite distance toward the ocean its nearest point hung half across the mountain base more solid than the mountain itself and cast long shadow upon it miles of distance above the eye could but just detect faint haze in the delicate blue of the sky best of all weather we thought breeder of bad weather according to our men who alas knew more of it than we did mile now perhaps we ran along between the sea and the abrupt green wall of hills so steep that we could not see them and turning sharply around corner beheld fuji now ﬁlling the entire ﬁeld of sight seeming to rise even from below us into the upper sky and framed at its base by near green mountains these opened gate and showed the glittering streak of the swollen fujikawa the swiftest river in japan the lower eastern slope was cut off by clouds but its western line ineffably delicate in clearness stretched to the left out of our range of vision below its violet edge the golden slope spread in the sun of the color of an autumn leaf along the center of this province of space the shadow of the great cloud rested the marks of the spurs of the mountain were faint the streaks of the wind on its cone was of deep violet color and free of snow though this had been the day of poetic tradition upon which the snow entirely disappears to fall again the following night words can recall adequately the simple splendor of the divine mountain remarked it was worth coming to far japan this single day right into this marvelous picture we rode through green plantations and which edged the bases of the nearest hills and lay between us and the river there we found means of crossing all bridges had been carried away by the ﬂood the plain was inundated travelers had been detained week by sea of waters and were scattered there and in neighboring villages ﬁlling every and worst of all the police ofﬁcials would not allow us to tempt the ﬁshermen to make the dangerous crossing pg 266 the project gutenberg ebook of an

off the easy japanese dress which he was wearing in these days of forced idleness and reappeared from behind the screen clad in his ofﬁcial european costume i have doubt that our interpreter explained to him what important persons we were and what important letters we bore to important people of the land he kindly suggested that we might sail past the mouth of the river from near kambara whence we had just come so to land far away from the spread of all this devastation and he offered to send deputy with requisition junk and sufﬁcient sailors from the nearest on the so we returned while hakodate and the messenger went on to make all arrangements and myself stopped at the place where we had had our view of fuji to make more careful sketch you can have idea of how much closer the clearer mind worked out the true outline of the mountain which my excitement had heightened at least couple of thousand feet nor should i forget how my horse of runner held my and seemed to know

great cloud hung ﬁxed apparently in the same place all was still perhaps in the uppermost sky one could distinguish some outlines of white in the blue still we hurried off and arrived upon scene of confusion and wild excitement captain and crew had been found their boat stood high up on the crest of the surf now beating on the shore and carried the line with which to pull out the small junk still far up on the beach the wheels of our kurumas had been taken of f and their bodies had been placed in the hold we got on board at least hundred naked men pushed and tugged to start the junk upon the slope of sand the sun was setting suddenly behind the headland of shizuoka and the air was ﬁlled with the moisture from the sea rosy bloom pink the clouds themselves ﬁlled the entire air near and far toward the light on the other side the distance was fadin g into gray and violet mist the great mountain was still great clear mass but colorless like the northern sky behind it while bathed in the color of fairyland we rose and fell over the spray the waves the boat the bodies of the men glistening and suf fused with pink painter ever saw more ideal light and suddenly it faded leaving us in still brilliant twilight through which we looked at the tossing of the hazy sea the mast was lifted and set the great square sail was hoisted and the captain took hold of the ponderous tiller we stretched ourselves on the poop deck prepared dance of seventeen miles then unde r my protecting blanket i fell wake and see before sheet of rain the predicted storm had ﬂooded us we lay in the water that covered the deck our waterproofs insufﬁcient and glad to be able to ﬁnd some protection under the japanese of straw whose merits i had not yet understood pg 269 pg 270 the project gutenberg ebook

hatches i could hear the groaning of our seasick runners between the gusts of rain came the voice of the captain now in the straining agony of seasickness next keeping up steady chanted talk with mate forward lantern was lashed to the post of the tiller and the captain bare feet rose and fell with his steps at the great oar showing sharply the action of tendons and muscles i tried to sketch under my cover then dozed with the rocking and the cold and the wet with every waking hearing the whistling of the wind and the continuous monotonous voice in language not understood so passed the night we saw the morning break on lonely high gray bank streaked by the sea lines of different tides and crowned with line of pines of all sizes and shapes stretching miles dark green against the white clouds which covered the base of the mountains behind out of these white banks stood dull blue peaks while the highest mountains were lost in cloud and all was gray and desolate with the rain the surf broke on the sand not more than hundred yards from us we lay there some time waiting more light all wind had ceased then four men swam ashore with rope and towed us along the bank the surf had abated but landing was too difﬁcult and we were to be dragged while our other men worked at the big sculls and pushed us along we wore along four miles to little bar over which we were pulled by the men now in the water into singular little harbor with an entrance not more than hundred feet wide on this the surf broke on the gray sea to our left the backs of two dotted the water and on the right looking out to sea rose the edge of grove of pines with four or ﬁve houses heavy roofed and thatched against its green darkness on the curve of the beach before it stood high pointed rock almost touched by the water edged around and covered with but the perpendicular side facing the harbor on its summit stood little red temple whose back we saw on the other side landw ards we left our boat and followed our guides ashore around its base hundred steps ran straight up to the front of the little steep and sudden that we could just look along their edge from the high rock recessed ran back the shore on which stood in row three large junks with their sterns to the them trees and houses on the opposite side of the little harbor four of our men up to their middle or up to their armpits in water slowly dragged our junk nearer to the shore all was quiet and men reﬂected in the moving water the boat creaking along slowly i went up the beach following our guide and the boatmen i thought how like this was to the homeric grove looking out to sea and frequented by fowls maritimal the sacred rock the meadows and the little stream the long galleys drawn up on the beach the little houses of the were surrounded by gardens and their walls largely made of plaited bamboo there was inn but we found house half shop and were welcomed to some tea and to room which the family hastened to abandon us there were only two rooms besides the entrance which was large passage ﬂoored with earth and along one side of it raised surface from which began the level of our ﬂooring sliding partitions hurriedly run up made us room but the outside screens were full of holes through which in few minutes peered all the women and children of the village who occasionally even pushed aside the screens to see more completely the little passage in front of our open room was ﬁlled with girls and children intent upon our ways of smoking of taking tea and of we had biscuits with us and ﬁfteen hours at least without food had made us fairly hungry meanwhile the men landed their wagons and the trunks and took their meal of rice hastily made up on the ledge of the platform on which we sat this they did in row the whole twenty eating quietly but rapidly was going to say ﬁrmly into their mouths the rice from the bowls and tearing with their ﬁngers the ﬁsh just cooked meanwhile among all the ugliness around us in women shone out with beautiful complexions in the others by exposure to wind and sun by hard work and probably by girls who stood before us long time with sweet faces and bright eyes and teeth they stared hard at us until stared at in return when they dispersed to watch us again like children from the doors and from the kitchen our hostess small fat and polite showing teeth between rosy lips

road to buy some more of that heavy yellow oiled paper which replaces the leather apron that we usually ﬁnd attached to our european carriages by and by i consented to have the hood of my wagon put up

discomforts one lies down in it all double d up with legs crossed far they can be made to because the basket which is the body of the litter is only about three feet long and with head to one side because if one lifted it it might strike the the proper way is to lie not quite in the axis this is all the more natural the men at either end not carry it in straight line but at an angle so that from one side you can see little in front of you into the kagos we were folded and in torrent of rain we departed i resisted my being shut up in my litter by the sides that are used in the rain and i

determined to break with this arrangement anger seized fortunately sort of paralysis set in and i became torpid and gradually resigned and gradually also i fell asleep with the curious motion and the chant of the men and woke accustomed and so i am writing i can just remember large trees and roads protected by them some places where we seemed alone in the world where we left trees and stood in

loneliness with few ﬂowers before him then in the rain and mingling with the mist thicker cloudings marked the steam from hot springs which make these parts of the mountains resort invalids and

notwithstanding i give it with all these defects there being nothing ﬁxed in history but documents and this document gives us the real mind of great man his appearance his intimate resemblance to other great managers and statement of the correct ideas of his time to which he gave ﬁxed form letter of iyéy asŭ it is getting warmer daily and life is again quite pleasant how is it with you and your children when last i had the pleasure of visiting you i was charmed by the friendly recep tion which was given to and i beg that you will present my thanks therefor to your lord it pleases much to hear that both my ake 14 and kuni 15 grown when i was with you i advised you to select tutor take have you already done this kuni is really very clever which is thing to rejoice in and you ought to hold him especially dear i have had some experience and therefore proceed to communicate to you my views to how you can bring him up to be good man if child however clever and gifted be allowed to grow up entirely free and without discipline it will become in riper age wilful and positive children are usually disobedient to their parents if they are made to obey their parents they will yet still less accommodate themselves to their surrounding but will they be able men to rule over states not in the least since they have not been able even to rule themselves considering how naïve is youth severe education does not seem at ﬁrst sight to be ﬁtting but herein man resembles plant of tree instance only little sprig ﬁrst shows with careful attendance little by little the branches and leaves are developed then prop is given to the same that it may grow straight and the poor growths are cut off if each year one goes on carefully with this treatment one may obtain straight beautiful trees with man it is just the same the child comes to be four or ﬁve years prop is given him in the person of good tutor who shall remove the bad growths shall subdue wilfulness and make ﬁne man out of him often this foresight of care is neglected allowing the child to grow up in freedom without protecting him against his own only when the child can already think itself the elders begin their admonitions but then it is quite too late the branches of wilfulness are already too far grown and the stem can longer bring forth new branches good tree is longer to be aimed at in this connection i have lively recollection of saburo 16 when he was born i was still young man and i was enchanted by the ﬁrst child he was somewhat weakly and on that account i thought that he should be especially protected and given the greatest liberty i was not severe with him and allowed him all that he wished after he had grown up i often found occasion to blame this and that in him and to give him admonition and advice but i had success therein because in his youth one had taken trouble about his conduct and speech he had never learned to treat his parents with thoughtfulness and to respect them ﬁlial duty ordered but behaved toward them if they were his equals so that ﬁnally it had to come to quarrel and the results are that he hates them now and is quite estranged from them warned by these evil experiences i undertook other rules the education of other children instance i chose persons to attend the child who themselves had been brought up from youth with the greatest severity and i ordered them to let know at once when the slightest trace of wilfulness or other similar defect was discovered and i called the child to gave him rebuke and extended to him some few strong words of advice through following this education the child grew to be faultless straight grown tree knew because pg 282 pg 283 the project gutenberg ebook of an artist letters from japan by john la farge https considered the will of his parents the highest law he practised and learned continually how one should best honor one parents in the families of princes child holds another standing and is subjected to other inﬂuences than in the families of subjects in provision of this and of the future position of the child his education must be different in certain points the parents should always oblige the child to follow the admonitions of those placed about him otherwise after their death the child would succumb entirely to its own wilfulness and at the end forfeit the throne many examples have taught us before this therefore it is the duty of the educator to implant in his scholar from the earliest youth and before everything veneration his parents the yielding of the will to providence gentleness toward subjects and only so can he bring him up to be real man separation between the lord and the subjects is certainly necessary the upholding of social order and is commanded by the circumstances but the lord must also consider that he is the subject of his subjects my tutor abe okura repeated over and over again the following precept to in my youth and i ﬁnd it very well founded if in ordinary circumstan ces the subjects yield to their master even when he is unjust and follow his service even when he acts tyrant yet in extraordinary emer gencies all this may change very easily therefore the ruler should behave compassionately toward his subjects and distribute impartial reward and punishment strictly and with justice he should see in these subjects the foundation of his government without servant there can be master in order that they may have these truths before their eyes in riper age children should be trained in time to value the opinions of those about them and to be guided by them because out of the words and deeds of those who are nearest to us we can best judge the worth of our own deeds wilful man is never contented if he yields only to his own will he forgets the duty of reverence his parents and earns in consequence both from them his relations his friends and even from his servants only displeasure and depreciation and ﬁnally he is unable to reach what he had proposed he notices these failures he comes to hate the disposition of providence his and ﬁnally himself and from discontent will become unsound in mind therefore we should always remind youth that it is given to man to ﬁnd in this world all his wish and will in princely family the second son should also be made to notice that he stands in relation to the elder subject if the second son holds more power than the eldest dissensions in the family are inevitable in the education of the younger people one must attend to this that they acquire polite and digniﬁed demeanor and before everything avoid rash and rude words yet not so exaggerated importance should be attached to digniﬁed carriage that disregard of inferiors should arise otherwise an understanding of the real position is lost and compassionate feeling the ills of dependents can not exist often an opportunity may occur one should explain to the children of sovereigns the use of certain things out of what country they come that they are of this or that province what prince rules there what fortunes the ruling house has passed through and so forth also with their own subjects one should try to make them acquainted in similar way naming example prominent man descended from famous general relating that his family has been centuries in the land and on account of its great services has good fame and such like things in this way the youth will learn to estimate his subjects and when man to take the correct position toward them besides every prince should be carefully trained in youth to all knightly arts such riding drawing the bow and fencing of course the descendant of princely house needs not to go deeply into the studies of scientiﬁc education it is sufﬁcient that he be made acquainted by profession al men with the main features of the particular branches of science but it is important and necessary that he be informed of the deeds of great generals and faithful subjects and conversely of the fate of faithless ofﬁcers who misled their superiors brought mischief to their coun try and ﬁnally ruined houses which had reigned centuries from such examples detestab le or worthy of imitation he can draw the best lessons his own acts one ought not to judge one own doing or not doing after one own view of right and wrong but ought to look at it in the mirror of the people opinion but you can not keep this mirror like one made of metal brilliant by polishing its outside you can only keep it clean and bright through the purity of your own heart evil conduct makes the mirror lose its power of reﬂection it remains then clear only when we listen to the judgment of our upon our acts if ruler is pleased that one should make him mindful of his own faults if he strives to put them aside and recompense those who have done him this service then that mirror will always shine in brightest splendor and the ruler will recognize in it his own image truly rendered and besides he will also see which of his subjects pg 284 pg 285 pg 286 the project gutenberg ebook of an artist letters from japan by john la farge https ill and which well of him and what opinion of him the people have in general if he wishes to hear only his praise from every mouth his hypocritical surrounding will try to please him with suitable ﬂattery while his really loyal subjects will draw near to him only if he be willing to see his faults discovered and to receive admonition willingly ruler should always consider this and never be contented with surrounding perhaps clever but and complying and wanting in deliberation and sincerity if he mistake then doors and towers are open to his hypocritical inferiors loyal outwardly but traitorous in heart ji hiobu talked little and listened continually whenever we were considering matter on which account he made mediocre impression on outsiders but soon he had acquired clear view of the matter he handled it with free mind quite especially was i pleased with him that face to face and privately he drew my attention to possible mistake contempl ated therefore i preferred mostly to consider everything alone with him ﬁrst and then only to discuss the matter publicly tastes and talent are so separate that in some people they seem to be in opposition one man has the greatest liking something which the other detests and this one acquires with ease by virtue of his gifts what the other notwithstanding diligence and energy can not achieve in the judgment of the worth of man and of his faculties one ought not to proceed rashly and sidedly an example from the vegetable world teaches us each ﬂower develops its full splendor in the season of its bloom and each one possesses some particular beauty which we treasure it but there is plant called the dokudami 17 whose ugly exterior and evil smell make us avoid it and consider it useless and yet it fulﬁls very beneﬁcent end instance if you boil it quite long it becomes remarkable remedy lepers so it is with men many man is misunderstood and neglected and yet each is gifted with certain faculties and can become an able and useful member of society if one understand how to employ him rightly to every one shall come time wherein he fulﬁls his destiny we usually hold useless and tiresome things that others study with zeal but which we not like yet that is not reasonable especially with ruler until my maturer age i could not understand the game of go 18 and could not see how man could busy himself with such useless thing which gave trouble but pleasure therefore i thought all people stupid who gave themselves up to it since i have thoroughly understood the game i ﬁnd it very amusing especially in rainy weather when i am not allowed to go out and i play now eagerly with those whom i once derided through this i have come to guess that what has not been handed down from old times is some what useless it is great mistake to think that all that pleases us is good and what displeases us is bad and that one own taste is the only right one it often happens that child in its anger at hearing something unpleasant destroys the nearest available thing parents should not think that this is consequence of worms and therefore let it go unpunished such indulgence works like poison on the character of the child if really disease be the cause of such excitement one ought to use right away the suitable medicine he who in his youth has acquired such habits yields to them later when something displeases him then it will be seen what bad results unsubdued wilfulness can have the object destroyed often matters little but the spoiled child with time vents his wrath mostly upon those around him and often feels contented only when he has punished his victims with death parents can only prevent such excesses in the future by keeping down from the beginning every stirring of wilfulness and impatience in their descendants the most necessary and the most beautiful virtue of every man especially of ruler is whoever commands his own will with regard to any good thing will carry out the will of providence will live in harmony with his will not forfeit lands and castles that his ancestors left him and will dispense rewards and punishments justly among the whole people both among those further away and among those just about him under all circumstances he will keep promise once given and if he serves master be ready to give his life he will not care ﬁrst himself and then only others but he will unselﬁshly strive the welfare of others and early and late keep the rules of high behavior he will not praise himself haughtily and depreciate others he will face his master without ﬂattery or hypocrisy openly and honestly and his parents also all other people he will not strive to everything after his own opinion but will pay regard to traditional forms in every act in all ﬁve senses one can practise to the eyes in not allowing one self to be deceived by beautiful

through close economy inferiors often think that the master appears strange in comparison with other sovereigns who toss about presents but history teaches that just the wisest rulers have been accustomed to make few presents and have avoided all luxury master desiring good and obedient servants should be ready with admonition at every mistake committed my efforts since youth have been continually directed to this wherefor my servants have stripped off all their faults in any case one ought not to give up hope too soon and at once decide that somebody is incorrigible if in one admonition the talk is only about the fault committed the result will be that the person admonished acquires an unjust aversion to his master and even servants who had served diligently before become careless and discontented the cause of this is to be sought in the manner of the admonition if this is to have any result the following method should be employed summon the culprit to one presence and dismiss from the room every one else but one who is to play the part of the mediator then speak with milder words than usual about the former services of the subordinate make some recognition of his zeal both former and present in short try to make him happy possible thereupon show him with due regard his faults and explain to him that you did not expect them of such an attentive subject and that you must hope that in the future you will need more to blame indeed that all the more you reckon upon his former solicitude and loyalty such an admonition brings any one in fault to yield to recognize his own defects and to correct himself the ruler of the house should make it his chief aim to make useful people of his servants in which he can succeed only by resenting every fault even if committed by person of the lowest position it should even be difﬁcult the cleverest servants to obtain the full approbation of the master how much more should this be the case with the average person concerning whom the master should consider it his task to remove imperfections far possible he is to blame if oftener than is necessary faults come about from the manner of those about him one can easily draw conclusion to the manner of the master therefore he should keep watchful eye upon the manner of his attendants especially that those whom he loves and distinguishes serve an example to the other inferiors whether they be good or bad further than this it is very desirable that the master should be quite acquainted with the circumstances of his servants and that on the contrary these should get

overladen with work and i can more attend to other business so must i make work myself in my prayers i rise early every morning and i go to bed in the evening not very early in consequence of which i have very good digestion and believe that i should be thankful this to my prayers an old proverb says if one wishes to know the manner of life of man ask him if he have regular time rising and going
