turned her back on the leucadian promontory turned from the too masculine phaon and sought her anactoria sought and wooed her with lyric sighs has she recaptured this extraordinary mary of aberdeen the soul of aspasia who beguiled pericles and artistic athens with the sinuous irony of the serpent and gismonda louise and violetta all those subtle sonorous she in her anterior existence any or all of them did she know the glory that was greece the grandeur that was rome henry james has warned us not to ask of an author why he selects particular subject treatment it is dangerous question to put the answer might prove disconcerting and with miss garden the same argument holds her preference certain characters is probably dictated by reasons obscure even to herself with her the is imperious it dominates her daylight hours it overﬂows into her again the sounding motive of multiple personalities karma subconsciousness the profound core of human nature and on the palette of her art there is the entire gamut of tones from passionate purple to the iridescent delicacies of grey that mary garden interprets number of widely differentiated characters is critical platitude chapter and verse might be given her excellences well her defects nor does she depend upon any technical formula or formulas versatility is her brevet of distinction an astounding versatility now the ways and means of the are different from actors in the theatre dramatic values are altered the optique of the opera shifts the stock attitudes gestures poses and movements into another and more magniﬁed dimension victor maurel master of all employed sliding scale of values in his delineation of nevers don giovanni iago and falstaf his power of characterization enabled him to portray valentine true to type nevertheless individual and if there is more banal ﬁgure on the operatic boards than valentine we not know his name perhaps faust but every year the space that separates the lyric from the dramatic stage is shrinking richard wagner was not the ﬁrst composer to stress action he is the latest however whose inﬂuence has been tremendously he insisted that the action should suit the singing word acting and singing are inextricably blended and i can conceive of nothing more and outmoded than the wagnerian interpreted in the dramatic terms of the old wagnerian singers they walked rather waddled through the mystic mazes of the score shouted or screamed the music and generally were prodigious when lilli lehmann sang after all wagner must be sung when jean reszke pictured tristan triﬂe of the both sang and acted it was the beginning of the new wagner totally changed wagner else his will remain in dusty pigeonholes debussy has sounded the modern key there is born or is new since the early new opera and in its train new methods of interpretation merely to sing well is futile attempting to act though voiceless the modern trend is away from melodrama whether italian french or german away from its antique creaking machinery debussy patterned after wagner time and then blazed new paths serge prokoﬁef f so acutely observed to in pelléas and mélisande debussy rewrote tristan and the emotional scale is transposed to fewer dynamic values and rhythms made more pg 6 pg 7 pg 8 pg 9 bedouins project gutenberg https the action is shown in dream the play s the thing and reality is mufﬂed elsewhere we have studied the mélisande of mary garden like her monna vanna it reveals the virtues and shortcomings of the new opera too static popular taste it is nevertheless an escape from the tyranny of operatic convention like the rich we shall always have grand opera with us it is the pabulum of the unmusical the unthinking the tasteless its theatricalisms are more depressing than sardou the quinte ssence of art or the arts which the modern frenchmen above all the new russian composers from the mighty slavic races may come the artistic perhaps the religious salvation of the i am

growing public that craves demands something different from the huge paraphernalia of crudely colored music scenery costume lath and plaster and vociferous singing oh the dulness the staleness the brutal obviousness of it all every cadence with its semaphoric signalling every phrase and its accompanying gesture poetry is slain at stroke the ear but imagination goes hungry the new art of precious essences an evocation an enchantment of the senses sixth our planetary ideal and in the new opera mary garden is the supreme exemplar she sounds the complex modern note she does not represent she evokes she sings and she acts and the densely woven web is impossible to disentangle her gaelic temperament is of an intensity she is human dynamo with sudden little retorsions that betray tender sensitive soul through the brilliant hard shell of an emerald personality she is also the opal with it chameleonic hues her rhythms are individual her artistic evolution may be traced she stems from the gallic theatre she has studied sarah bernhardt and yvette the perfect ﬂowering of the diseuse she pins her faith to the effortless art of eleonora duse the old contention that stirred coquelin and henry irving does not interest her so much does duse we have discussed the crux should an actor leave nothing to chance or shou ld he improvise on the spur of high emotions that is what the question comes to miss garden denied her adherence either to coquelin or irving i asked her to give us peep into her artistic cuisine while she prepared her sauces notwithstanding her refusal to let us participate in the brewing of her magic broth i still believe that she sided with coquelin she is eminently cerebral and yet her chief appeal is to the imagination not stroke of her camel brush not the boldest massing of colors are left to chance she knows the ﬂaming way she came she knows the misty return not tone of her naturally rich dark voice but takes on the tinting of the situation this doesn t forbid certain latitude temperamental variations which are plentiful at each of her performances she knows tempo rubato and its value in moods she has mastered too the difﬁcult quality described by william gillette the illusion in acting various are the mary gardens in her map of art and she is ours despite her scottish birth she has remained invincibly yankee despite long residence in her beloved paris enough american has rubbed off on her and the resilient dynamic overﬂowing and proud spirit that informs her art and character are american or nothing race counts can any good come out of our nazareth of art the answer is inevitable yes mary garden she is our mary lyrically dramatically ours yet an orchid dear old flaubert forcibly objected to sarah bernhardt being called social but she was and this despite her dutch ancestry and the exotic strain in her blood miss garden may not emphasize her american side but it is the very skeleton of her artistic organism would that an aubrey beardsley lived to note in evanescent traceries her potent personality rare something that arouses the emotion of recognition but which we can not deﬁne come said berlioz to legouvé in the early years of the third decade of the last century i am going to let you see something which you have never seen and some one whom you shall never berlioz meant the playing and personality of

not worth the look that leaps from the happy ﬂesh the breasts raised if ﬁlled with an eternal milk are pointed to the sky and the smooth limbs still keep the salt of the primal sea you think of mélisande she exquisitely murmurs her pathetic je ne suis pas heureuse some years ago in paris i saw and heard the garden traviata the singing was superlative she then boasted coloratura style that would surprise those who now only know her vocalization it was however the conception and acting that intrigued originality stamped both the death scene was of unusual poignancy evidently the young american had been spying upon bernhardt and duse this episode adumb rated the marvellous death of mélisande the most touching that i can recall in either the lyric or dramatic theatre it is pity that she can not ﬁnd sterner stuff than massenet leroux fevrier and the rest of that decorative school there are composers too of more vital calibre than camille erlanger debussy is master but there must be newer men who could view mary garden the ideal exponent of their music meanwhile she has discovered rôle in which she would pique the curiosity of the most uncritical mossbacks she has added isolde to her long list mary garden and isolde incredible nevertheless an interesting experimen t this if she could be persuaded to voice the sorrows of the irish princess it would be longer wagner it would suffer rich change wagner muted perhaps wagner undone certainly unsung if we remember glorious olive fremstad but magica l isolde with more than hint of the perversely exotic we feel in aubrey

eleonora duse immediately she was compared and unfavorably with sarah bernhardt when she was achieving something vastly different and i think vastly ﬁner sarah was more brilliant duse more human the one an orchestra the other an exquisitely balanced string quartet mary garden is the nearest approach to duse on the lyric stage mary garden too is different in the sense stendhal meant that banal word her cadenced speech is not singing in the italian manner to begin with her tonal texture is not luscious but there are compensations every phrase is charged with signiﬁc ance she paints with her voice and if her palette is composed of the cooler tones if the silver greys and sombre greens of velasquez predominate it is because she needs just such gamut with which to load her brush she is consummate manipulator of values to be sure we not expect the torrential outbursts of margaret matzenauer why confuse two antithetical propositions i don t look at one of the paul cézannes in the rare

damnées from whom he fashioned his beethovenian harmonies fulgurating profound descendez le chemin l enfer éternel ﬂagellés par un vent qui ne vient pas du and there is still another group to which i adhere one that envisages mary in the more lucid light of an admirable artist who has fashion ed of her body and soul rare instrument giving forth the lovely music of attitude gesture pose and rhythm there are moments when she evokes the image of the shadow of on star and often she sounds the shuddering semitones of sex in thaïs the mélisande moods are hers the dim remote poesy of antique sonorous tapestries and the modern note of louise grazing the vulgar though puriﬁed by passion but the dissenters doubt believe in the cambodian proverb when estimating the singing of both geraldine farrar and mary garden it runs thus when in hades it is bad form to speak of the heat you remember the night when mary garden came from the refectory of the monastery in le jongleur the winsome little devil on the stairway to remark to her audience la cuisine est très bonne the accent was indescribable at paris they admired her individual french streaked with exotic intonations that night it revealed the universal accent of lad who had just ﬁlled his tummy real the joy of life how human she was it is the sartorial technique of miss garden that is supreme her taste in costumes is impeccable in the eternal game of making masculine eyes misbehave she is quite irresistible but this orchidaceous circe this uncommon or garden variety does not with her fatal philtres transform men into the unmentionable animal rather does she cause them to scurry after their vocabulary and lift up their voices in rhetorical praise and that is something to have accomplished did you ever read casuals of

audiences when the impersonation of the supersubtle serpent of old nile by mary garden caused much comment critical and otherwise the libretto states that the conception of payen radically differs from shakespeare s rather superﬂuous remark it does considerably differ the principal dif ference being that shakespeare wrote great poetry well great drama payen s attempt resolves itself into series of tableaux the characterization generalized his verse respectably tepid in word not the queen that shakespeare drew of this cléopâtre you dare not say age can not wither her nor custom stale her inﬁnite variety she is more germane to that queen shown us in the sumptuous prose of theophile gautier s une nuit cléop âtre than the imperial courtesan who turned the head of anthony and stirred the

given the screw an enharmonic wrench act iii saw the queen attired at once so sonorously and exquisitely that the vast audience gasped with admiration it is however the tavern scene that will save the tawdry work the anatomical wigwagging of the two golden lads set the lobby buzzing cléopâtre is doomed to packed houses in the future nothing succeeds like true spirituality mary garden is cléopâtre she is mélisande and thaïs it is not rôle that taxes her dramatic resources or her personal pulchritude all she did was to look beautiful and turn on the full voltage of her blandishments men went to

the poet exquisitely girlish she charms with her strange undine airs mélisande is enveloped in the haze of the romantically remote at times she seems to melt into the green tapestry of the forest she is woodland creature more melancholy than miranda she is not without traces of her temperament less real than juliet she is also you recall melusina and rautendelein not altogether comprehensible mélisande piques us by her waywardness her fascinating if infantile change of moods at the spring the two converse of the water and its healing powers you would say that my hands were sick she murmurs she dips her ﬁngers into the pool the dialogue is elliptical if written by browning or henry james but the symbol ﬂoats like ﬂag the mad apostrophe to the hair of mélisande is in key with this moving tableau perhaps maeterlinck took hint from the mournful tale of his friend the belgian poet geor ges rodenbach with its reincarnation of dead woman in the form and features of live one the beautiful hair of the new love serves but to strangle her pelléas is more tender i have never never seen such hair thine mélisande i see the sky longer through thy locks they are alive like birds in my the last

almost theatric in the heyday of his glory sardou never devised anything more arresting than the aside consideration of the psychologic imbroglio there are spots in the dramatic scheme which tax the credulity however something of the improbable must always be granted playwright be he never so logical the rapid mental change of vanna hints at born casuist an italian renaissance type of mind her love of colonna could not have been but she did not betray him in the tent and yet she has been adjudged profoundly immoral in word not to put an edge too ﬁne upon the sophistries of the situation this heroine committed an imaginative inﬁdelity well uttering splendid falsehood the madness of the ﬁnale is the logical outcome of her passion prinzevalle all that has gone before in her life had been bad dream the true the beautiful moment is at hand it will be both her revenge and justiﬁcation she goes to prinzevalle in his cell this must end here it is too perfect it is one blaze about and within oh some death will run its sudden ﬁnger round this spark and sever us from the rest thus browning sings in balcony the play s the thing though it did not seem to catch the conscience of the composer nevertheless monna vanna is more grateful to our ears than gismonda there are too many things that are set to music in the sardou libretto while maeterlinck deals only with the primal jealousy hatred conﬂict of wills there is more unity in action and mood in the older score the music is wagnerian from ﬁrst to ﬁnal curtain but it is cleverly assimilated and swifter more poignant the

reputation in the opening act she did little but suggested the psychology of woman who had begun to loathe supine husband note the nuance with which she uttered j rai mon père and the repetition when she says it to colonna it was like molten steel at ﬁrst it was cold rigid steel the steel of unalterable resolution the second time yet how tender is her si when she turns to her fuming spouse there was tenderness in the tent scene yes true tenderness not expressed by the sentimental symbols of the english theatre but in the restrained terms of the french tradition therefore more eloquent more artistic despair and pride modulating into amazed joyfulness at meeting her early friend stern prinzevalle but the last scene gave us the most moving side of this wonderful woman s art the shock of increduli ty caused by her husband s suspicions merging into the supreme ecstasy she grasps the key that is to unlock the sooth such acting has been witnessed long time the scale was essentially

carmen and lyric more often adumbrated than the et gypsy the disturbing element of the performance was the undeniable fact that granted her idea of the rôle she didn t even get it she missed ﬁre in act ii in the card episode particularly nor did she look bewitching we quite understand her avoidance of the conventional posing hipping strutting and inane postures yet there should have been compensations in the days of calvé the criticism was elle hanche these were slim not her singing nor yet the beautiful shawl that might have been designed by sorolla y bastida the famous fan we missed if mary garden had but lavished tithe of her blandishments on her don josé that she so recklessly so alluringly bestowed upon maguena t in cléopâtre we might have been won over little to her general conception this carmen was distinguished dame lilli lehmann alone outshone her in aristocratic sevillian courtesy but lilli could sing and lilli had not the boston complex of mary we have since learned that the singer was grievously indisposed and she surely missed the don josé of dalmores and muratore and on this rather chilly note of dissent i prefer to end of miss garden s twenty or

i give the illustrations haphazard any great artist will from claude debussy we never ask of what he is the composer pelléas and mélisande is his monument rather mélisande and pelléas in the case of isolde and tristan it is the woman who is protagonist is it because in creating characters of our mother s sex that the eternal masculine is projected across the feminine soul or is woman the genuine the aboriginal force that we unwittingly obey all the while calling her little woman condescendingly of course oh what joke of almost cosmical proportions it would be if the latter supposition be the truer one but mere male mortals may always console themselves with the ineluctable fact that it is man who has endowed woman with vital ﬁgure in the arts he has created ophelia and gretchen beatrice and francesca the milo venus the winged victory and isolde lady macbeth and emma bovary carmen and mélisande honors then are even even if models existed in nature the art of man it was that shaped them and breathed life into their clay but mélisande is the protagonist in the drama the music to maurice maeterlinck s strangely haunting play is so wedded to the moods and situations that absolute music it is unthinkable and these moods are usually con despite his musicianship debussy is obviously literary composer his brain had ﬁrst to be excited by dramatic situation beautiful bouquet of verse an episode in ﬁction or the contemplation of picture why demand if the initial impulse be the monna lisa or quatrain by verlaine composer who can interpret in tone the recondite moods of baudelaire verlaine mallarmé or the dramatic of maeterlinck need not have been daunted by criticism in sooth it is the angle of critical incidence that must be shifted to adapt itself to the new optique pelléas and mélisande is study in musical decomposition the phrase is decomposed rhythms are dislocated the harmonic structure melts and resolves itself into air his themes are developed in opposition to the old laws of music al syntax but what have laws in common with genius once assimilated they may be broken were broken the stone tablets by the mighty iconoclast moses besides every law has its holiday in the debussyan idiom there seems to be normal sequence i say seems much water has gone under the bridge since his appearance and compared with schoenber g stravinsky ornstein and

his tonalities are vague but his values just the introduction to the forest scene when golaud discovers mélisande is of an acid sweetness withou t anxious preoccupation debussy has caught the exact maeterlinckian note it is impossible to divorce music and seems to be maeterlinck s musical other it is needless to dwell upon the characteristic qualities of the score it is like some antique and lovely tapestry that hypnotizes the gaze it has the atmosphere of edgar allan poe the poe of the dark tarn of auber of ligeia of ellenora of berenice and helen those frail apparitions from claustral solitudes and the valley of the grass all exotic they are incorpor eal it is the complete envelopment of the poem by an atmospheric musical haze shot through with gleams of light never shown before on land or sea we pardon the monotone of mood and music the occasional mufﬂed cacophonies the lack of exterior action and the absence of climaxes after so long waiting passionate outburst when it does

originality is not profoundly rooted in the history of his art but his individuality is indisputable he is musician doub led by poet he is almost gallic chopin is polish debussy shows race his artistic pedigree stems from grafting of old french composers upon ultramodern methods wagner chopin certain aspects of liszt and moussor gsky the visit he made to russia in 1879 had important consequences he read the manuscript score of boris at rome he absorbed moussor gsky and the scale and this inﬂuence contributed to the richness and complexity of his style above all he is stylist he has wagner at his ﬁnger and like charpentier he can t keep tristan out of his music it is his king charles s head naturally such highly peptonized aural diet is not nourishing like the poetry and of stéphane mallarmé too much debussy becomes trying to the nerves schumann has spoken of the singularly irritating effect of muted dissonances pelléas is nearly all muted the mental and emotional concentration involv ed in the hearing of this music fatigues does other music not even tristan the range of ideas like the dynamic range is limited yet there is magic in his music the magic of evocation not to describe but to evoke in effortless imagery is the quintessence of his art he is painter of cameos and aquarelles never does he carve from the big block an exquisite miniaturist he does not handle bold brush nor boast the epical sweep of his predecessors berlioz one but he is more intimate he is the poet of crepuscular moods the sadness of tender bruised souls is in his pages of virility there is little trace it is music of the distaf f and seldom sounds the masculine ring of crossed swords chopin too had his nocturnal moments but he also wrote the ﬂat polonaise with its heroic deﬁance of poland crushed yet never conquered with its motto jescze polska nie zginiela long before his death this french master was critically ranged lawrence gilman the most sympathetic of his commentators is also the fairest to his essays i go delectation it would be rash to say that debussy had achieved his artistic apogee he may have had surprises in store but it is safe to conclude that pelléas and mélisande is his masterpiece that the dewy freshness of l après midi d un faune would never have been recaptured the symphonic suite printemps the nocturnes la mer and image s at once reveal the strength and limitations of debussy who was not builder of the lofty rhyme though he is creator of complex rhythms not cerebral vincent d indy an emotional one not master of linear design but colorist poet not an architect his vision is authentic he knew that the core of reality is poetry he lived not at the circum ference but the hub of things he loathed the academic he is the antipodes of he gave us novel nuance in music did maeterlinck in literature think of interior with its fear of fear debussy is composer of nuance of murmurings of the silent thunder aﬂoat in the leaves of the rutilant faun with his metaphysical xenomania of music overheard and of mirrored dreams little wonder he sought to interpret in his weaving tones baudelaire and verlaine mallarmé and maeterlinck he was afﬁliated to that choir of sensitive and unhappy souls of which maurice maeterlinck is the solitary survivor poet himself claude achille debussy even if he had never written bar of

tis his and has been slave to thousands but he that ﬁlches from my style robs of that which not enriches him and makes poor indeed this is reorche strated to suit the simile tristan always seems to be waiting in the wings when pelléas is played awaiting his cue to enter it never fails to be given by debussy later i asked maurice maeterlinck his opinion of debussy s music to pelléas and mélisande it was an imprudent question lucienne bréval had captured the rôle of mélisande not geor gette leblanc maeterlinck is polite man and his answer was guarded nevertheless his dislike of the music pierced his phrases to him it was evident that his play needed tonal embellishment that it was more poetic more dramatic without the debussy frame he is quite right and yet the spiritual collaboration of poet and musician is irresistible and in the garden of the gods there is only one mélisande some little dramas like little books have their destiny the composer of pelléas and mélisande suffered from the

magician is this writer told with naïveté and verve we feel in every page of le petit pierre the charm of personality in clarity anatole france is the equal of renan and john henry newman and while at one time clarity was conventional quality of french prose it is rarer symbolism has supervened if not to darken counsel certainly to trouble verbal values never syncopated moving at moderate tempo in transitions smooth replete with sensitive rejections crystalline in diction lover and master of large luminous words the very marrow of the man anatole france is in his style and what model he should be those wilful young writers who boast that lumpy graceless paragraphs are better suited to their subjects than swift clear concise prose it was not so long ago that one scribe positively gloriﬁed in his own dull style he asserted that it was truthful reﬂection of his drab themes there is indeed such thing an apposite garbing verbal orchestration the pellucid sentences of howells so free from the overblown are happily wedded to his admirable character etching flaubert master of ornate or numerous prose well cool rhythmic prose wrote salammbô in purple splendid key and madame bovary in the greyer tonalities of the province yet nothing could be further removed from the style of either novel than sentimental education which is urban and suffused with sober daylight it was favorite contention of gourmont that at his sovereign best flaubert is to be found in bouvard et pécuchet the style of which is sinewy pregnant powerful the principal mistake of beginners is to believe that ornament is good style in anatole france matter and manner are perfectly welded few writers swim so easily he under their heavy burdens of erudition his knowledge is precise his range wide he is humanist he knows many literatures he loves learning the sake of learning he loves words treasures them fondles them burnishes anew their meanings tarnished by custom he seldom tarries in the house of epigram over all his interest in humanity sheds tranquil glow without marked feeling the dramatic nevertheless he surprises mankind engaged in its minute daily acts those he renders candidly snow in the sunshine just the old dutch painters stir our emotion of recognitio n with simple shaft of light passing through door or upon an old wrinkled woman polishing her spectacles he sees and notes many gestures inutile or tragic and notes them with the enthralling simplicity of complicated artistic nature he deals with ideas so vitally that they seem human yet his personages are never abstractions

with the same love his dog riquet bids fair to endure in literature france is an interpreter of life not precisely after the manner of the novelist but life viewed through the temperament of poet of extreme delicacy and one doubled by tolerant philosopher this ultramodern thinker who has outgr own the despotism of positivist dogma has the soul of chameleon he loves he understands christianity with fervor and knowledge that surprise until we measu re the depth of his affection antique cultures further to confuse us he exhibits sympathy with the hebraic lore he has riﬂed the talmud gotten tales he delights in juxtaposing the greek sophist and the strenuous paul he contrasts mary magdalen repentant with pampered roma n matron he is familiar with the proceeds of science particularly astronomy with the scholastic speculations of the renaissance with the simple afﬁrmations of mediæval piety he is conversant with the destructive pyrrhonism of boulevard philosopher so commingled are

airiest fashion deliciously capering in the metaphysical void and like prestidigitator bidding us doubt the very existence of his rope proofs from life gay pagan anatole does not demand he has the hesitations of profound erudition possessing the gift of paradox he rejoices in his philosophic indifferentism notwithstanding his famous phrase the mania of certitude renan was ever pursued by the idea of an absolute he cried proof to bertholet he wrote i am eager to him numbers promised rigid reality not so however to france who could have asked with ibsen whether two added to two not make ﬁve on the planet jupiter to montaigne s what know i he opposes the injunction of rabelais what thou wilt of plato he might have asked what is truth and if plato in turn would have posed the same question anatole could reply by handing him copy of jardin d epicure that perfect breviary of anatolian scepticism in socrates perhaps he would discover congenial companion yet he might mischievously allude to montaigne concerning cats or quote aristotle to the form of hats and then we spy him adorning the wheel of ixion with garlands wilful child of and philosophy france always may be expected to utter the starting lucent phrase he believes in the belief of god by the gods of all times and climes he swears his the cosmic soul man who infuses into his tales something of the mimes of hero ndas la bruyère

appearances of life lifting betimes the edge of the curtain to curdle the blood of his spectators with the sight of buddha s shadow in some grim cavern beyond he shows his gallic tact in decorating the empty spaces of theory and the blank spots of reality follower of kant in his denial of the objective we can not imagine him approving of that sage s admiration of the starry heavens and the moral law both are relative would be the report of the frenchman yet he yearns faith he humbles himself beneath the humblest he excels in exposing the splendor of the simple soul though faith has not anointed his intellect with its chrism he admires the golde n ﬁligree of the ciborium its spiritual essence escapes him at the portals of paradise he lingers or stoops to pick rare and richly colored

disliked any suggestion of twinship willy wore high heels and fashionably cut clothes so to appear taller than his brother while harry sported bohemia n velvet and hat but both agreed to art and

the place du maine across from the gare the avenue du maine intersected the place and while beyond lay the choicer precincts of the quarter there was spot on the left bank that was gayer in silent

features of byzantine type yes he had been thirteen years in paris and these foolish fellows only three but they knew the argot of the better than he and they openly boasted their americanism he asked

started and looked into her eyes but he might well have questioned two pools of light they reﬂected sentiment nor did they directly return his glance across the table the count made motion and she colored he summoned at the same time the attention of the young composer you write music you he asked in grating voice i am composer myself i studied with great russian musician now dead tell us about

russian he shook his head not he answered in french secrets the brothers adjured at last the crowd began to modulate into that hazy amiable humor which follows copiou s breakfast they drank coffee conversational themes were preluded few developed the ball of dialogue was lightly tossed and oswald noticed that miss tilney could at will be american french german russian and english and again russian like skein she unwound her various temperaments according to her mood with him she was sombre once she ﬂashed anger at the count and showed her teeth the two hollins she played any tune they wished the real june was she oswald wondered but when he fancied himself near the edge of revelation his mind must have collided with her guardian an zorn s expression was repellent invern greatly disliked him the talk drifted to art thence to religion and one of the hollins jested about the devil count van zorn ﬁxed him at once one must mock sacred things in my presence he coldly announced the

and tried to hold him stranger still was the behavior of the old man he reached across the table his hands clasped in supplication my dear young man he panted i meant offense pray be seated i adore your art and practise it daily i am devout wagnerian i was but repeating the wisdom of certain ancient fathers of the church who ascribed not without cause the origin of music to satan not be annoyed

desperate pace of new york artistic life he dared not waste the ﬁrst half of the day larce example insisted upon clock sitting at that precise hour he wished himself writer with liberty to work at

nervously retreated to the back ground but neither one stirred vincen t without pausing to analyze his action offered marden the newspaper it was politely refused possibly because of the mellowness of the moment or the ample repose that follows luncheon marden was not averse from entering into conversation one of hazy indirectness equally suggestive and he made few commonplace remarks about the unseasonable heat the deplorable twilight of new york s tower highways and soon against the prompting of his inner spirit serle chimed an accordance they chatted benedict discreetly moved nearer presently serle asked his neighbor if he would have cigar or perhaps liqueur i don t mind rejoined marden the fact is i feel lazy this afternoon i had expected to meet friend client of mine i fancy he is off somewhere wondering if new york shall ever boast decent he is an architect and enthusiastic over french serle s ears began to burn architecture in new york that s tall joke curiously enough though this very morning i was admiring the new library it has stunning façade if i were emperor of america i d raze every building within the radius of ten blocks so to give the building chance only

impertinent he sent the man away sharply adding that he would be called when needed marden he was languidly drifting on the current of his fancy was it pleasant or unpleasant the watcher could not decide but he had made up his mind that he would draw marden up to the danger and if discovered if discovered he would at least tell him what he thought of the mean scoundrel who had i ve noticed marden broke in on serle s ugly revery that painters seem to have lots of time on their hands i beg your pardon you have quite much reason advancing similar remark about professional man here i am

eagerly responded serle he mentally abused the lawyer his measured pedantic delivery your story marden glanced at the other s ﬂaming cheeks and replied rather abruptly but you haven t heard it yet however it s not much of yarn it years ago lady client came to advice she was married married i say to an artist big fellow who was lazy who drank ran after his models and spent her money marden was interrupted excuse you said the lady was rich did i certainly spent her money was your last oh ell perhaps i shouldn t have said her money she had money i meant that her husband had money and didn t spend it on her mere slip of the good i m regular you true you might prove difﬁcult witness in the chair my client informed that her husband was so lazy that he remained in bed until one or two clock in the afternoon then he would slowly dress and saunter walk and often she did not see him until the next how did he make living oh i suppose he painted portrait or two and managed to get portrait or two that would hardly pay household is unless your mean your client s husband was sargent or boldini then they could have struggled along at the rate of one portrait every serle laughed so harshly that marden looked at him wonderingly i see you are acquainted with the artistic temperament they call it in the newspapers observed the lawyer not they call it but it is my dear sir an artist is not built to put in ton of coal every day man whose brain is delic ately adjusted whose whole soul is in his eyes when he sees pretty girl the sly tone of marden angered the painter hang it painter there are pretty ugly girls pretty ugly landscapes agreeable disagreeable subjects only surface to be transferred to canvas to be truthfully rendered and that s what business men with their lack of imagination will never he spoke hotly i confess i have lack of imagination when it comes to an appreciation of the artistic marden said this so slyly that serle at once begged his pardon after all we are not at delmonico s just to thrash out stale question pray go your story interests strangely it s not very s all i know the woman left the another calmly interjected vincent not at all not at is

he did so he was fool he was killing the goose that laid i ll not be so impolite i meant to say he would endanger his marden dryly laughed that s is good my client informed and she is serious woman that she never met an artist who could be relied upon and she knew she was one serle s jaw dropped how odd what did she oh she painted little just enough to make and to annoy her husband you see it was this way she did not care to take money from man she loathed i she literally loathed him she told why didn t she leave him sooner besides few moments ago you said he never offered her money now she loathed him so she wouldn t take ah that s not in my fable tartly answered marden again he turned gloomy and tapped nervously on the table the afternoon waned soft light slipped through the high curtained windows and modulated into glancing semitones over the richly decorated apartment several men vanguard of the clock brigade of absintheurs serle became nervous what if he determined to take the chance of seeing some imbecile who might salute him by name he leaned forward on his folded arms and asked with show of concern and what became of your charming client my why she married and settled at last is she happy how can i tell the response betrayed an irritable nuance i didn t mean to put the question so bluntly the reason i ask is simple one i studied case not unlike the one you narrated it is just sordid and commonplace my artist also painter had married pupil whom he much she could absorb she hadn t much talent it was the sort you see expressed on fans and boxes she might have been all right if her admiring friends had not told her that she had more talent than her there wasn t enough between them both to set the river on ﬁre however she devilled him so effectually that he took separate studio to get away from the sound of her voice and from their home like your painter he turned day into night but with difference he made illustrations the magazines and newspapers painted cheap portraits demeaned himself generally to get money enough to run the house she enjoyed herself ﬂirted went into society of some sort cheap compromise between bohemia and the frayed fringe of fifth may not know the variety you are member of another profession it is diverting this society because it is false the hair on the head of its women the bohemian side largely consists of bad claret worse music and ghastly studio teas its fashionable side stricken grand ladies with tarnished reputations i ve seen it all one of the sights of greater gotham is this glittering

remarks when woman is heading hell don t try to stop her it s waste of her husband saw it and he did try her friends knew it and helped her on her merry way the painter even sent her to europe and with her some of her friends to keep her company if they couldn t keep her straight is worse than poison such women she was soon back in new york leaving behind her sweet record many unpaid bills and with half dozen fools picked up god knows where at her heels and then he went away it was too much however being woman she won all the sympathy her story was believed not his singular coincidence but wasn t the husband to blame little oh said vincent men are always to could he have given her he did better he got her did she go to the bad sympathetically inquired marden on the contrary she married professional man of some he smiled with malice and is now i mean is she happy she will be happy always selﬁsh little soul you mean is her present husband happy marden leaned back nonchalantly and his hands travers ed the corner of the table to serle the air became dense vapor he continued mercilessly of course he is husband why shouldn t he be he doesn t know doesn t know what really you set on edge exclaimed marden he tried to smile but his upper lip lifted displaying white vincent lighted fresh cigar his arm did not tremble now then swallowing the last of his cold cof fee he continued her

of her was more compelling than in her eyes and mouth brown with hazel nuance the eyes emitted light like cat s in the dark her mouth was contradiction of the jaw the lips were full and indicated rich

the distance and colored lightning played in at the window he reached the big theme of the bass it was that wonderful melody in f minor which beethoven might have been proud to pen and was followed by the exquisite group of double notes so fragrant so tender so uplifting that anne pickett forgot her wine and the other girl her eyes blazing her etched against the skin sat and knotted her ﬁngers and followed with dazed attention the dance of the atoms in her brain she saw harold watching her she went to school harold peeping in at the lodge of her college harold waiting to waylay her when she left her father s house and she saw harold that terrible night he had reached the meditation in b and her pulses slackened after the crash of the storm after the breathless rush of octaves miss

anstruther started so angrily that there was titter behind the lattice but she did not notice it her whole soul was bent on watching harold he spoke to ned and miss pickett s jarring laugh was heard

gutenberg https venus or valkyr paul godard found the ride between nurember g and baireuth discomforting the hot july breezes that blew into the coupé of the train were almost and paul had left stuttgart that morning in savage mood the slowness of the railway service irritated him the faces of his travelling companions irritated him and he had shocked an englishman by remarking early in the afternoon if the old engine doesn t run any faster than this we had better get out and walk the other simply peered at the speaker and then resumed wolzogen s book on three roumanian ladies laughed in oily eastern accents they understood english and the sight of human being strong young man in passion about such little matter european railroad punctuality struck them ridiculous so they laughed again and paul ﬁnally joined in he was an american he had been rude but he couldn t help it besides it looked if they would reach baireuth too late the opening performance and his was the laughter of despair the youthful pilgrim journeying to baireuth was born in new york he had studied music like most young people in his country and had begun with that camel that musical beast of all burdens the piano this he practised most assiduously at intervals because he really loved music but college golﬁng dancing and motor had claims not easily put aside naturally the piano suffered until paul left college then want of something better to he took lessons from josef fy and ediﬁed that master by his spurts of industry his club began to encroach on his attention and again the piano was forgotten paul whose parents were rich was not society butterﬂy but his training instincts and associations forced him to regard good dinner good tailor and racing motor necessary to his existence from his mother he inherited his love of music and his father dead many years had bequeathed him library better still taste reading an average cultivated american intensely too to show himself at his best ashamed of his ﬁner emotions like most of his countrymen and triﬂe spoiled and shallow one day edgar saltus told paul he should read schopenhauer and he at once ordered the two volumes of the world will and representation it was not difﬁcult reading because he had been in professor bowne s class at college and enjoyed the cracking of metaphysical nuts he began to get side glimpses of wagner s philosophy but despite the wit of the german diogenes his pessimism repelled him he could not agree with saltus s ingenious defense of pessimism in his two early books and he looked about diversion elsewhere walter pater s silken chords velvety verbal music had seduced paul from the astringencies of herbert spen cer and chopin made moonlight his soul on morbid nights yet paul with his selﬁsh easy life had encountered convulsions he had never been in love therefore he played the nocturnes of chopin in very unconvincing manner he always declared that poe was bilious and this remark gained him the reputation of wit and scholar among his club associates the calumel club is not given to velléités of speech ii pg 225 pg 226 pg 227 bedouins project gutenberg https paul godard fell into the clutches of richard wagner and swallowed much of him chopin seemed tiny exotic and feminine compared to the sirocco blasts of the baireuth master paul was not too critical and like most americans he measured music by its immediate emotional result the greater the assault upon the senses the greater the music the logic was inescapable friedrich nietzsche was the next milestone in paul s mental journeyings the attack on wagner the attack on the morals that made our state stable the savage irony sparkling wit and brilliant onslaught on all the idols ﬁlled the mind of the young man with joy he dearly loved row and though he recognized nordau s borrowed polemical plumage he liked him because of his cockiness so he devoured nietzsche reckless of his logical inferences reckless of the feelings of his poor mother most devoted episcopalian of the high church variety paul always pained her with his sudden somersaults his amazing change of attitude and above all his heartless contempt her idols the church and good society society sufﬁced her soul hunger and paul s renunciation of mozart and simply loved his sarcastic ﬂouting of churchgoers and his refusal to range himself were additional weeds of woe in her mourning life there was edith vicker but paul was such hopeless case and wouldn t see that nice pretty rich moderately intelligent young woman was slipping through his ﬁngers godard often sighed that winter in her sumptuous uptown apartment nietzsche revealed new intellectual vistas paul and he actually became serio us the notion of regarding one s own personal ity possible work of art to be labored upon and polished to perfection s point set him thinking hard what had he done with his life what wasted opportunities he deserted his club and began again and when reproached by his friends his ﬁckleness he excused himself by quoting nietzsche thinker well snake must shed his skin once year else death he also was ready with emerson s phrase about fools being consistent and felt altogether very ﬁne and superior to his nietzsche feeds the ﬂame of one s vanity and paul was sure that he belonged to the quintessential band of elect souls that is making the superman he really was nice boyish lad and he could never pass pretty countess or making soft eyes at her paul was popula r and so the roumanian ladies laughed at him admiringly paul had left his mother in paris the heat was too trying travel and he was close to baireuth on this torrid summer day one sunday afternoon in july yet another hour before him he turned his critical attention to the laughing trio one was princess she told paul so and spoke of the sultry diversions of bucharest the second was fat singer who startled the englishman by inquiring if there wasn t good coloratura part in parsifal if there were she intended asking frau cosima wagner to let her sing it but if there wasn t she supposed she would have to be content with the forest bird even melba had been waldvogel why couldn t she be one also her sparkling eyes and mountain of ﬂesh amused paul exceedingly he knew heinrich conried very well and he told the singer that when parsifal was sung next season at the metropolitan opera house he would speak to the impresario and get her the part of kundry it was voice such the lady said she possessed and full of bellinian ﬁoritura he gravely related these fables he was conscious of the penetrating gaze of the third woman she was tall with dark skin hair black and glossy and she had the most melancholy eyes in the world paul returned her glance with discretion his eyes were irish and full of the devil at times and they could be very sympathetic and melting when he willed the two young people examined each other with that calm regard which schopenhauer declares mars or makes the destiny of new generation but metaphysics and the biology of the sexes bothered not at all the youth and maiden pg 228 pg 229 pg 230 bedouins project gutenberg https admired the classic regularity of her nose and forehead and wondered why her face seemed familiar her mouth was large irregular perverse it suggested marie bashkirtsef f s and it was just yearning and dissatisﬁed despite their sadness fun lurked in the corners of her eyes and he knew that she enjoyed his harmless hoax then they both burst out laughing and the princess said in surprised voice helena why you laugh with the young american gentleman she also mentioned family name that caused the new yorker to stare what was this girl with the determined chin and brows the identical one who almost set russia quarrelling with another nation and upset the peace of roumania yes it was and paul longer puzzled over her face it had been common property of the photographers and newspaper illustrators few years ago and he mentally indexed its features he almost said aloud that her curious beauty had never been even faintly reproduced his imagination was stirred roumania had always seemed so remote and here was he paul godard plain american citizen face to face with the heroine of one of those mysterious eastern intrigues in which kings crowns queens and were all delightfully mixed up so he chatted with helena about wagner and degeneracy and discovered that she was an admirer of ludwig of bavaria nietzsche guy maupassant poe schumann chopin marie bashkirtsef f and all the rest of the brained people born during the nineteenth century she too had written book which was soon to appear it was full of the weltschmerz of schopenhauer and the bold upspringing individualism of nietzsche she had odd theories concerning the ring of the nibelungs and had read browning s sordello she told paul that she found but one in wagner how she asked gravely with slight could parsifal become lohengrin s father paul said he didn t know it must have occurred long after his experiences with kundry and the flower girls and perhaps it was sort oh godard she quickly answered not that the swan died you know besides parsifal was always pure paul suggested that it might have been another of the same name but of different family and then the conversation went to pieces the soprano called out voilà baireuth the wagner theatre and they all craned their necks to catch the ﬁrst glimpse of that mystic ediﬁce built on the hill the new musical pantheon the new peter s of the bewitched ones and the englishman continued to calml y read about the the train slowly steamed into baireuth iii paul found comfortable lodgings in the lisztstrasse and his new friends went to the hotel sonne at four he was up on the hill looking at the world and immaculately dressed if he stood in the bow window of the calumel club ogling fifth avenue girls he was only vaguely interested in the approaching performance and his pulses did not quicken when donner s motif told the gabbling eager throng that the great trilogy was about to unfold its fables of water wood and wind he took his seat unconcernedly and then the house became black and from space welled up those elemental sounds not merely music but the sighing droning swish of waters the rhine calmly majestically stole over paul s senses he forgot new york and when the curtains parted he was with the rhine daughters with alberich and his heart seemed to stop beating all sense of identity vanished at wave of wagner s magic wand and not being his ego was absorbed by the shining mirror in the hand of hypnotist this then was wagner wagner who attacked simultaneously all the senses vanquished the strongest brain smothered bruised and smashed it wept sang surged roared sighed in it searched and ravished your soul until it was put to ﬂight routed vanquished and brought bleeding and captive to the feet of the master pg 231 pg 232 pg 233 bedouins project gutenberg https eye was the ears sealed with bliss and paul felt the wet of the waters he panted alberich scaled the slimy steeps and the curves described by the three swimming mermaids ﬁlled him with the joy of the dance the rape of the rhinegold the hoarse shout of laughter from alberich s rn lips and the terriﬁed cries of the three watchers were to paul real wall street walhall didn t bore him and he began at last to catch faint clues of the meaning of the mighty epic he went to the underworld and saw the snake the ring and the tarnhelm he heard the anvil different from verdi s saw the giants quarre lling over their booty and the rainbow seemed to bridge the way to another brighter world the walhall march died in paul s ears he found himself in the open air and he thought it all over he slowly went with the crowd down the hill that new mount of olive s trod by the feet of musical martyrs he had programme but he was too confused too overcome by the clangor of his to read it he was not dreaming nor yet was he awake he was wagnerized the ﬁrst attack is not always fatal but it is always severe even to the point of pain paul godard had become wagnerite and his nietzsche and schopenhauer skins melted from him melts the snow in sunshine striking through his many exalted moods was the consciousness of having recognized one of the rhine daughters it was the contralto an eastern girl from maine rue towne was her odd name and she had been once pupil of new england vocal school but she had lived that down and after the usual hard interesting struggle abroad she had reached baireuth paul remembered her well blonde girl eyes indescribably gray with dark lashes face full of interesting accents rhythmic chin and that told of resolution her ﬁgure was lovely and paul resolved to call on her the very next day he soon discovered rue s address baireuth is small and full of information the curious paul on monday morning went to the alexanderstrasse where she resided only to ﬁnd her at rehearsal of die walküre he was rather put out he was accustomed to accomplish what he wanted without much exertion he then bethought him of helena the roumanian beauty and he warmed at the recollection of glance he had received the afternoon previous that and the hand pressure had been unmistakable so he went to the sonne hotel and sent up his card the three ladies were at breakfast would godard call in an hour paul cursed his luck and walked to wahnfried wondering if he was to be bored during his stay the reaction from the exalted condition after rhinegold had set in paul was not so he could not avail himself of the consolations offered by gambrinus the drowsy deity of germany he had taken pint of bad champagne and some tough chicken and slept badly his cigar too was abominable and he felt absolutely disillusioned he paced the historic garden of wahnfried the true wagnerite is always in heaven or hades there is in his picture of life and art at wagner s grave paul felt return of the thrill but it passed away at the barking of boarhound he went slowly toward the hotel and was in such perverse mood that he avoided it and turned into the ludwigstrasse then he met some one girl passed him gave him shy glance hesitated and spoke to him it was rue towne mr godard i found your card moment ago i am very glad to see you how did you like rhinegold paul was standing in the street the girl looking down into his eyes he made conventional answer their hands touched and they went down the street together that afternoon paul received pretty note from the roumanian she wrote of her sorrow at his not having called again and asked him to join them during the ﬁrst entr acte of die walküre he tossed the note away his brain was ﬁlled with the vision of girl in straw hat girl with voice like wooing clarinet and eyes that were dewy with desire paul was hard hit and one nail drives out another the blonde woman supplanted the brunette in his easily stirred imagination pg 234 pg 235 pg 236 bedouins project gutenberg https ﬁrst act of die walküre did not lay the fair ghost in his brain he went out on the esplanade and encountered the three roumanians helena detached herself and came to him with that gracious gait and proud lift of head and throat that gave her touch of royalty she reproached him with her magnetic gaze and soon the pair were strolling in the leafy lanes about the theatre paul had never met woman who mentally tantalized him did helena she had manner of half uttering sentence of putting nuance into her question that interested while it irritated him artistic people are mutually attracted and there was savor in the personality of this distinguished girl that was inﬁnitely enticing to his cultivated taste and at the same time slightly enigmatic without effort they glided into conﬁdences and the sounding the second act found them old friends youth is not the time halting compromise lilli lehmann s art took paul out of himself and the beauty and vigor of the act stirred him again but he could not recapture the ﬁrst ﬁne careless rapture of the night before to the nerves vir ginal of wagner that thrill comes once only in the long intermission paul found helena and took her to the crowded café across the road to get something to eat and drink it was quarter after seven and wagner wears on the stomach even poetical roumanian girl has earthly appetites so they drank champagne and ate pasties of goose liver and confessions were many nothing establishes strong bond of sympathy like the hunger and thirst of two healthy young humans paul seemed to have forgotten rue and the splendour of her hair and complexion he was rapidly losing his head in the subtle blandishments of the eastern woman he saw that she was coquett but her seriousness her ﬁerceness that broke through the shell of silky manners gave him glimpse of woman worth winning and he was just gambler enough american enough to dare when he left her he carried away look that was an unequivocal challenge paul s brain was on ﬁre during the ride of the valkyries and hardly realized that it was hans richter s masterly reading the stage failed to interest him until he discovered rue in valkyrean garb and then he watched with his soul in his eyes her proﬁle so charming in its irregularity her freedom of pose her heroic action ﬁlled him with admiration by the light from the stage he read her name fräulein rue towne and she was the last in the list of the valkyries he watched with indifferent gaze the close of the act and mentally voted the paris version of the scene far superior to baireuth he went toward the hotel sonne he had promised to sup with helena and wondered how he could see rue that night the american girl seemed something inﬁnitely sweet healthy in nature compared with her slavic rival by jove said paul aloud it s case of rouge et noir and i m in it and paul was fond of polyphony iv after supper he suggested to helena the sammet garden the artists always ﬂocked there and it might prove interesting although chaperon was necessity helena persuaded the princess that she could go out just once in the american fashion it would be so novel paul pleaded and of course won the young people hardly spok they went down the dark street to the garden the air was full of electricity touch glance and storm would be precipitated so they reached the garden and found seat near enough the house to be tortured by herr sammet s crazy trombone at the same table was little man dressed in white ﬂannels it is the sâr peladan i know him by his musk said helena discontentedly and they changed their seats what decadent you are said godard laughingly pg 237 pg 238 pg 239 bedouins project gutenberg https yes i believe sometimes i can think with my nose my smelling sense is so keen i can almost divine approaching enemies who is that girl staring at you so hard godard very pretty blonde she looks like an american not near the over there helena reminded paul of cat that lifts threatening furry back when she scents hostile dog oh lord he groaned it must be rue that settles it was rue and she had never looked lovelier the slight bruise under her eyes betokened emotional exhaustion she was dressed in white and the simplicity of her gown and its charming ﬁt made the german women plainer paul s heart knocked against his ribs he returned her constrained bow he saw that she had quietly and earnestly examined helena and the eyes of the women met antagonism kindled but the american girl was mistress of herself she began to talk to the group of artists about her while helena sulked and glowered at paul s too openly expressed admiration you admire your own countrywomen you not godard she asked and the inﬂection in her voice was cruelly sarcastic before paul could answer she touched his arm softly and said if you can t look at when i talk to you why you may take paul at once begged her pardon called his reckoning and they prepared to leave the garden he did not again salute rue towne she was talking earnestly to an ugly old fat man with grey beard and wagnerian forehead half foot high but from the tail of his eye he saw that she was fully conscious of his departure scarlet spots came into her face and paul walked down the garden steps he felt if two eyes burned into his back then he did what other desperate men have done under similar circumstances he made violent love to helena and it relieved the pain of his heart but the girl was capricious and only by dint of magniﬁcent lying did he ﬁnally force her hand into his they were now walking toward the hofgarten down deserted street the many bells of baireuth told them that it was quarter past eleven and the moon rode tenderly in the blue it was night made soft vows and kisses and paul walked he thought of rue helena fell to dreaming of the prince in her native roumania who had played the weakling to her strong woman s heart and thus the pair reached the hotel and after brief parley at its door said good night and parted blessed love that can at least console two hearts glowing the absent paul awoke next morning with what the hardheaded germans call moral headache he had bad taste in his conscience and he decided to call soon possible on rue it was nearly eleven before he got to her house she had rehearsal siegfried she received him he thought that she was distant but he talked fast and earnestly and soon the ice began to thaw paul felt happy helena appealed to his decadent taste but rue was the perfume of the morning he told her so and explained at great length and with considerable ingenuity how he came in the compan y of lone young woman her two fancied two sounded more gone by mistake to the garden of the sonne hotel that is why he left so soon with the lady who was only recent acquaintance he felt rue s eyes on him he wove this roundelay and feeling hot about the neck and little fearful of his ability to keep up the strain much longer he suddenly grasped the girl crying out and most sincerely rue why we waste time talking about woman i never cared and never expect to see again i love you i love you my darling kiss just once and tell you care little he fell upon her she was taken off her guard and the inevitable happene she kissed paul and he placed big ring on her ﬁnger and left the house an hour later an engaged and also much man he was happy until he thought of helena that evening when siegfried was ﬁnish ed paul walked arm and arm with rue down the hill to sammet they entered they brushed against three ladies and paul said pg 240 pg 241 pg 242 bedouins project gutenberg https oh lord the next day rue had to go to rehearsal the rhine daughters in die götterdämmerung and paul was whistling the spring song from die walküre in his room when knock at his door broug ht the news that lady wished to see him he wondered who the lady was and the parlor of the house had been turned into bedroom he put on his hat and went into the hall to be confronted by helena shamefaced but resolute come out into the street he begged in her implacable eyes he read signs of the approaching storm they silently descended to lower étage then she turned and faced him so you didn t come to this mornin g she said roumania excited was stirring spectacle nevertheless paul wished that he was up the hudson playing golf he endeavored to placate her helena angered at her loss of dignity in condescending to call on this man reproached him bitterly and it seemed to him that she was about to sing the picturesque songs of hate which carmen sylva has made known to us when they reached the street then her rage vanished in moment you conceited man and you really took in solemn earnest i fancied the americans had sense of humor pooh you re not man to love more than moment anyhow and she went on her way laughing mockingly leaving paul shamefaced angered his all bruised and his senses aroused helena wrathful was more beautiful than helena amiable he was so distressed in mind that he only sat through one act of die götterdämmerung his wagner madness seemed to have evaporated he hovered around the back of the theatre and caught glimpse of rue getting in carriage with the same fat old he fancied although it was late he called at her house she had not yet arrived the maid told him he mooned about disconsolately until one clock keeping at safe distance from the hotel sonne then he wearily went to bed and dreamed that the nornes were chasing him down fifth avenue the next morning he called again on rue she sent down word that she was tired he called again in the afternoon she was not at home in the evening feeling if he were going mad he was told that she had gone out and would not be back until late he hung around the house in fashion smiling bitterly at times and beginning to doubt even his own intentions but rue he went home at last and in rage of love and jealousy he sat down and wrote to rue this letter rue my rue darling what is the matter have i offended you why did you not see oh how lonely was the street how sad my heart i thought of verlaine s it rains in my heart it rains in the why don t you see you are mine you swore it my sweet girl whose heart is fragrant hay darling you must see i am writing to you in the early early morning you know that you promised to come to next year in america only think sweetheart what joy then the sky is aﬂame with love we walk slowly under few soft spring stars and your hand is in mine and that night that night your heart will sob on my breast my lovely woman and your heart will ﬁercely beat we both slip over the hills to heaven rue you will make poet only tell i beg of you the hour when i may see then paul threw himself on the bed but not to sleep it was daybreak and the teutonic chanticleer of the dawn had lusty lungs and it was almost time coffee he dressed in feverish haste went out of doors secured messenger and despatched the letter he walked up and down the lisztstrasse twenty minutes and his emotion was so great at pg 243 pg 244 pg 245 bedouins project gutenberg https sight of the boy returning letter in hand that he retreated into the doorway and awaited the news it was brief he read this in rue s ﬁrm handwriting your friend helena has told all here is your there was signature then paul did what most cowards he went to the other woman the storm in his soul might be allayed and he could have the pleasure of showing rue that she was not necessary to him of course the jealousy of helena had spoiled his game he really had meant to be sincere with rue so he told himself in the inward eloquent manner which paves hell with composite intent ions it was all clear to him helena loved him else why did she tell rue of his it gave him glowing feeling again in his distracted bosom and he walked into the hotel sonne he said between clutched teeth black wins he was met by polite portier who told him that his friends had left on the early train vienna but there was letter and with trembling hands he tore open the envelope did you really think i loved an ame rican when i can have roumanian better console your singer signature when does the next train leave paris asked paul of the polite

his knuckles with the and threaten him with dismissal yakov knew the crosspatch wouldn t keep his word he was pay pupil not much pay to be sure anyhow not charity scholar the magic of windless june

the more persistent hosts from southeastern europe yakov the change meant nothing but it gave extreme pain to jimmy s parents and so jimmy with his faithful band was in the habit of yelling deﬁant and insulting words at the two blacksmiths though keeping at safe distance the rhythmic tapping of the hammers brought peace to yakov who stood in his window regarding with awakened curiosity the spectacle of the cardinal s lighted the ﬁrst time in weeks presently the sound of ﬁddle oozed through the open space he was back the cardinal with his ﬁddle what was he playing hymn tunes surely first the adeste fideles which yakov remembered because in moment of condescending generosity jimmy had taken him to vespers at the cathedral and had told him the name of the music he had heard then the tune shifted to more solemn celestial tune indeed which the listener couldn t place he didn t know it was the jesu by haydn but that didn t matter his ear was ravished by its pleading strains and he hung out of his perch tremulously absorbing every tone the cardinal s humor shifted he dashed off gay tipperary jig and followed this with the valley lay smiling before and the harp of tara yakov felt that the violinist must be an irishman but ever so different from the noisy jimmy yet irish what what he pinched himself the grave music of the kol nidré the sacre d tune sounded on the day of atonement came swelling across the cardinal s windows the kol nidré that immemorial cantillation of the hebrews in it compressed the dolors of the ages and perhaps ﬁrst chanted in the house of

the playing across in the palace and was pleased because of yakov s evident interest she would welcome the return of the cardinal her boy would be again spurred to study he couldn t leave the window till the last note had been squeezed from the august and mournful melody in fever yakov seized his tiny instrument and lovingly mimicked the cardinal its squeak reached the priest who came to the window and waited until yakov s imperfect interpretation of the kol nidré ended and smiling kind smile that melted the heart within the bosom of the boy he waved slender hand if to say i salute brother artist it was too much yakov who ran to his mother s there to pour out his joy and receive her gentle blessing he too would play the ﬁddle like the the kol nidré hall full of listeners who would applaud him the mighty cardinal had played the kol nidré the poor little jew boy and he hadn t even bowed his profound gratitude on wings of song he mounted the stairway to his garret but the music was longer heard though the windows were still alight not able to control himself yakov took his instrument and all the while playing marched into the court and in the mystic moonshine he played

hopeless that another ﬁddle might be bought him found place in his whirling imagination he had been cruelly treated why should he be so punished he sank on his knees at his attic window tears ﬂowed and sobs followed yakov mourned and would not be comforted and across the court in the chamber of the palace the cardinal played with exquisite melancholy that antique hebraic tune the kol nidré pg

relate the story and so i mean to give it names and all with the faint hope that it may serve warning to callow astrologists and all the younger generation affected by the writings of impious men who deny the existence of the devil more than twenty years ago i was the organist of roman catholic church in the lower part of my city i had studied the instrument in germany and believed in johann sebastian bach i played and pedalled fugues on my own pleasure and on sundays executed with unction easy masses by bordoni mercadante and haydn my choir was not an ambitious one the stipendium was small the work light and the two priests amiable enough one german father oelschlager was the rector his assistant was an irishman with french blood in his veins his i ever forget his name and face father michael moreau he was crazy about music and occultism the former he made secret of the latter i discovered only after long acquaintance moreau came to the when i practised on sang little and feasted much on bach chorales urged often to visit his room i did so and he showed rare missals and later the backs of number of old books whose titles i could not decipher i am latinist yet i knew these volumes were written neither in latin nor greek the characters i had never seen before and when i remarked their strangeness father moreau smiled and even laughed i quoted poe the volumes of the the melancholy volumes of the music led us to discuss religion and my friend astonished by his erudition his sensitive features would become illuminated when he spoke of the strange tales of the talmud oh my god he would cry with patibulary gesture why hast thou not vouchsafed us more light and then would beg bach and on the mighty stream of the d minor fugue his harassed mind seemed to ﬂoat and ﬁnd comfort time wore on he grew morbid morose reticent and devoted himself to his dull duties with fanaticism that was almost harsh the parishioners noticed it and his reputation saintliness increased his confessional was always crowded and his sermons remarkable the acerbity the awful pictures he made of the sufferings of the damned and of the relentlessness of god s wrath his superior father oelschlager bade the other look at the cheerful side of the question to believe more in god s mellowness and sweetness and would quote cardinal newman s lead kindly light and certain comforting texts from the scriptures and then smoke his pipe but the ascetic temperament of moreau barred all attempts at palliation or attenuation of the god of hosts of the god who laid low the pride of greece and rome life to him was cancer to be extirpated and he confessed to one night after rehearsal that he had almost doubted god s existence and courted suicide after reading renan s vie jésus i suggested change of scene less stren uous labors above all the world music and athletics my advice availed not and i saw that father moreau was fast becoming monomaniac his sermons during the hot summer were devoted to the personality of the devil to his corporeal existence to his daily presence in the marts of mankind and so constant was his harping on this theme that father oelschlager had to forbid him the subject it is so warm my son why then you hold forth on hell let the poor pg 261 pg 262 pg 263 bedouins project gutenberg https hear more of the crystal rivers the green meads of the

advent saw him mere wraith of man worn by speculation devoured by an interior ﬂame ﬂame that was wasting his very soul to despair he seldom conversed with although i watched him anxiously and occasionally interrogated him regarding his health at last i spoke to his associate but encountered an philosophic spirit which assured father moreau was going through what most young priests should he was at the period of unfaith was nettled by doubt and after he had wrestled with satan and won the good ﬁght he would again become normal this seemed consoling though vague the day before christmas i promised that i would not send substitute to play the midnight mass at the church our church was the only one in the city where the fashioned mass at twelve clock on christmas eve was celebrated it is located near the river and my journey was long one i lived i ate six clock supper and went to bed telling them to arouse at quarter before eleven i wished to be fresh the early service by eleven i was out on the street and took car bound south i reached the church in time and soon the solemn high mass began my choir had with elaborate care prepared cherubini s mass and despite the poor organ the extra chorus and much enthusiasm made some effect the congregation was attentive and father oelschlager delivered short happy sermon urging his ﬂock to rejoice at the birth of the babe of bethlehem jesus the infant christ uncruciﬁed but newly born into world of toil and sin our redemption at the consecration of the host the good rector s beaming faith was most edifying he was served by father moreau melancholy deacon indeed ite missa est pronounced the faithful dismissed i was overjoyed at the release i was tired the choir chatted about the service the singing and at last i was alone i placed the back in the tall gothic cupboard closed the manuals of my instrument and put on my overcoat it must have been half past one perhaps quarter of two and i relished the prospect of my arrival home where warm breakfast would be awaiting and then once more to bed i had to play the regular half past ten clock christmas mass the beneﬁt of the sleepy ones who loved their couch better than their christ father moreau met at the bottom of the choir steps he was dressed the street his eyes were blazing and he took my arm his ﬁngers were will you come with he asked i was startled i explained that i would not have much rest nor should he waste his sleeping time on the dismal cold streets besides i was hungry i feared that he was about to deluge with more of his studies in the customs of the early gnostics and to be quite frank i was worn out and not in receptive humor such untoward cryptic wisdom any other w ill you come with he reiterated and the clutch on my arm became oppressive where i asked i hated to affront friend w ill you come with by this time the church was quite empty and i pushed out into the street it was dark and snowing hard we walked toward the street and we neared the corner i heard the lucky sound of were trolleys then i excused myself ran and caught the car the priest following sat down beside i paid both fares and i had nothing to say we preserved sad silence the mean light the deserted streets the lonely car and the mufﬂed strokes of the horses hoofs on the snow chilled my soul i looked sideways at father moreau he was reading big book which i saw by the dim lamplight was entitled le satanisme by jules bois i was shocked priest fresh from the holy sacriﬁce of the mass devouring the blasphemies that i was sure were in the gruesome volume alarmed my piety presently he saw and shut its leaves there are curious things in it my dear friend he muttered and his voice came from across waste of sorrow curious things but you are believer are you not he eagerly repeated i am i replied devoutly and i crossed myself he fairly jumped at his eyes wide open and full of devouring ﬂames will you come with he almost screamed and the fourth time east street called out the conductor and rather than let my pg 264 pg 265 pg 266 pg 267 bedouins project gutenberg https surely must have been left the car with him the conductor gazing after us with cynical eyes he evidently took us belated revellers we walked slowly ten minutes until we arrived in front of church and then i stopped the place is not open yet they not have christmas service until ﬁve the last time my companion whispered will you come with and pushing past struck three times on the big doors small postern gate opened at once and we entered the vaulted passageway i trembled at the strangeness of the adventure and held fast to moreau it was pitch black and while i heard soft footfalls beside footfalls of an unknown could not see my hand before my face we must have traversed long yard the wind blew freely about i heard it playing on the housetops like balloon in distress yet it felt if issuing from sepulchre and my heart went to my empty stomach even in my growing terror i craved coffee its aroma would have made stronger this inhuman cruise we went down eleven steps counted conductors on either side of dampness and malodo rs warned of our proximity to some ancient cellarage some forgotten catacombs wherein father moreau expected to give sacerdotal surprise revival perhaps of an antique and early christian ritual i feebly applauded his intentions but wished he had chosen some other time and that the surroundings had been less sinister at last we paused and descended another ﬂight of time i didn t number them the cold was intense and it was with relief that we suddenly arrived in dimly lighted and warm chapel it was empty devoid of pews of chairs of furnishings of any sort except at the upper end small votive altar before it swung lamp of byzantine workmanship in which burned solitary tongue of yellow ﬂame the lamp swayed rhythmically and on the altar were two tall tapers lighted and perfumed and then my eyes rested on the spot where should have been the tabernacle surmounted by the gold cross judge of my consternation when i saw saw distinctly i see the pen which traces these letters huge bronze serpent with overlapping glistening metall ic scales the eyes of this python were almost feminine and their regard gentle reproachful and voluptuous my knees bent beneath and my face was wet with fright you are believer then crooned dull voice in my ear it was moreau he had thrown off his outer wrap and stood in black soutane he was white with emotion and said in tenderest accents listen be my friend not desert at the crisis of my life it is to be my ﬁrst mass my ﬁrst three clock mass my deacon is already at the altar be the solitary worshipper it will be low low mass he spoke clearly rapidly sanely and seeing that i had something more than lunatic to deal with i removed my overcoat and knelt down near the altar just father moreau ascended its steps his assistant holding the end of his black canonicals if it had not been the apparition of the serpent i might have fancied that i was assisting at the lonely pious vigil of parochial curate but the eyes of the serpent devoured mine and i had none the two silhouetted ﬁgures that went through with febrile velocity the familiar motions of the mass it was low mass and from the introit to the preface the space was scarcely appreciable i heard mumblings and the air became chillier the celebrants moved and bowed or extended arms the air grew colder denser and tenser it vibrated like the wires of monstrous zither and my temples throbbed if in the midst of magnetic storm i felt that i was nearing great catastrop he that god had abandoned his universe to its wicked will and that i must sob or scream or pray or die or be damned forever tap of the silvery little bell was if sweet summer air had swum over my agitated soul it was the bell that announced the solemn moment when god became man when the divine spirit by the miracle of transubstantiation became ﬂesh and blood in an ecstasy of faith of awe i plunged on my face and adored and wept and mighty wind swept from the altar with strange moanings and lamentings and the lights were extinguished yet there was luminous fog that enfolded us and in it i saw the great serpent symbol of wisdom symbol of eternity rear spirally aloft and beneath beneath it the beatiﬁc vision in swelling nimbus of ﬂame was counterfeit mother of god and holding the hand of him of the infant jesus born but three hours the horror of it my christ not our christ not the christ of the christians pg

she was mater malorum and her breath sowed discord lust and cruel murder i yearned to pronounce the name of the true mother of god to bid this blinding vision this damnable vision vanish but my tongue was like wet twine and my sight blistered by the pageantry of satan of satan and his dam and i struggled the silvery little bell tapped once more and in fading perspective i saw the madonna and the child give such sweet beseeching glance that my heart dissolved within and i cried aloud my tongue snapping in the roof of my mouth mary mother of god preserve us from the devil and all his works withering streak of light struck my eyeballs and i glimpsed the serpent falling to earth with distended jaws two priestly ﬁgures reeled off the and in the brassy clangor of despair we fell all three and swooning blackness shut down upon us like smothering velvet it was still dark when solicitous hands lifted to my feet my coat was thrown about my shoulders and i was hurried in shivering gloom to
