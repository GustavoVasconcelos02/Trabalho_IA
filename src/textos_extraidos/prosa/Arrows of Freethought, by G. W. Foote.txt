secularist the liberal the national reformer and the freethinker during the last ﬁve or six years i have included nothing i hope of merely ephemeral interest every article in this collection was at least written carefully and with an eye to more than the exigencies of the moment in disentombing them from the cemeteries of periodical literature where so many of their companions lie buried i trust i have not allowed parental love to outrun discretion i have not thought it necessary to indicate in each case the journal in which the reprinted articles were ﬁrst published should anyone object to the freedom of my style or the asperity of my criticism i would ask him to remember that christianity still persecutes to the full extent of its power and that creed which answers argument with prosecution can not expect tender treatment in return and i would also ask him in the words of ruskin to consid er how much less harm is done in the world by ungraceful boldness than by untimely fear london november 15th arrows of freethought by foote https and progress november 1882 the archbishop of york is peculiarly qualiﬁed to speak on religion and progress his form of thanksgiving to the god of battles our victory in egypt marks him man of extraordinary intellect and character such commo n people may admire without hoping to emulate while his position in archbishop tait necessitated absence from the scene makes him the active head of the english church let us listen to the great man archbishop thomson recently addressed meeting in the drill hall shefﬁeld it was densely crowded by six or seven thousand people and this fact was cited by the archbishop proof that the working classes of england have not yet lost interest in the christian faith but we should very much like to know how it was ascertained that all or even the major portion of the vast audience were it is easy enough to give any meeting name we often hear of conservative banquet with tickets at something like guinea each duke at the top of the table and row of lords down each side and our experience leads us to believe that nearly all religious meetings of are attended chieﬂy by the lower middle classes who go regularly to church or chapel every sunday of their lives even however if the whole six or seven thousand were the fact would prove little shefﬁeld contains population of three hundred thousand and it was not difﬁcult the clergy who thronged the platform to get up big ticket meeting at which popular archbishop was the principal speaker and the eloquence was all to be had nothing the archbishop lecture or sermon or whatever it was contained nothing new nor was any old idea presented in new light it was simply summary of the vulgar declamations against the carnal mind with which we are all so familiar progress said his grace was of two kinds intellectual and moral of the former sort we had plenty but of the latter not so much he repudiated the notion that moral progress would naturally keep pace with intellectual progress and he denied that righteousness could ever prevail without some sanction from above this was the sum and substance of his discourse and we have doubt that our readers have heard the same thing in various forms of language some hundreds of times like the rest of his tribe archbishop thomson went abroad all his frightful warnings and especially to france he severely condemned the french pride in progress which led to the revolution his grace has certainly most original conception of history ordinary historians tell us that the revolution was caused by hunger bad government and the rigidity of old institutions that could not accommodate themselves to new ideas but whatever were the causes look at the results compare the state of france before the revolution with its condition now the despotic monarchy is gone the luxurious and privileged aristocracy has disappeared and the incredibly wealthy and tyrannous church is reduced to humbleness and poverty but the starving masses have become the most prosperous on the face of the earth the ignorant multitudes are well educated the platform and the press are free career is open to every citizen science art and literature have made immense strides and although paris like every great capital may still arnold says lack morality there is such ﬂagrant vileness within her walls the corruptions of the ancien régime such impudent affronting of the decencies of life made the parc aux cerfs ever infamous and his christian majesty louis the fifteenth worthy compeer of tiberius such shameless wickedness made the or gies of the duke of orleans and the abbé dubois match the worst saturnalia of nero his grace felt obliged to advert also to the paris commune about which his information seems to be equal to his knowledge of the revolution he has the ignorance or audacit y to declare that the commune destroyed city and ravaged the land when matter of fact the struggle was absolutely conﬁned to paris and the few buildings injured were in the line of ﬁre this worthy prelate thinks destruction of buildings crime on the part of communalists but virtue on the arrows of freethought by foote https christian power and while denouncing the partial wreck of paris he blesses the wholesale ruin of alexandria his grace ventures also to call the leadi ng men of the commune drunken dissolute villains the beaten party is always wicked and perhaps thomson will remember that jesus christ himself was accused of consorting with publicans and sinners drunken dissolute villains not risk their lives an idea the men of the commune may have been mistaken but their motives were lofty and millière falling dead on the church steps before the versailles bullets with the cry of vive on his lips was noble hero any cruciﬁed galilean who questioned why his god had forsaken him that intellectual and moral progress naturally go together the archbishop calls an absurd and insane doctrine and he couples with these epithets the honored names of buckle and spencer now it will be well to have clear understanding on this point are intellectual causes dominant or subordinate even so intensely religious man lamennais unhesitatingly answers that they are dominant he afﬁrms in his du passé et du peuple that intellectual development has produced all other developments and he adds it is represented that evil it appears in history springs entirely from the passions this is quite false the passions disturb the existing order whatever it may be but they not constitute it they have not that power it is the necessary result of the received ideas and beliefs thus the passions show themselves the same in all epochs and yet in different epochs the establ ished order changes and sometimes fundamentally the truth is that the great moral conceptions are securely established and the only possible improvement in them must come from the increased ﬁneness and subtlety of our mental powers civilisation and progress are according to archbishop thomson nothing but cobwebs and terms he besought the working men of shefﬁeld not to go information to big book written in some garret in london his grace who lives in palace at other people expense has very natural dislike of any man of genius who may live in garret at his own what has the place in which book is written to with its value don quixote and the pilgrim progress were written in gaol and all archbishop thomson knows to the contrary every gospel and epistle of the new testament may have been written in an attic or cellar the archbishop seems to hate the very idea of progress what has it done he asks to abolish drunkenness and gambling to which we reply by asking what christianity has done those vices are unmistakably here and on the face of it any objection they may furnish against progress must equally apply to christianity nay more christianity has had an unlimited opportunity to reform the world while progress has been hindered at every turn by the insolent usurpation of its rival thomson admits that he can not ﬁnd text in the bible against gambling and assuredly he can not ﬁnd one in favor of teetotalism on the contrary he will ﬁnd plenty of texts which recommend the wine that cheereth the heart of god and man and he knows that his master jesus christ once played the part of an amateu r publican at marriage feast and turne d large quantity of water into wine in order to keep the spree going when it had once begun we repeat that all the archbishop objections to progress based on the moral defects of men apply with tenfold force against religion which has practically had the whole ﬁeld to itself and we assert that he is grievously mistaken if he imagines that supernatural beliefs can ennoble knaves or give wisdom to fools when he talks about christ blood shed to purchase our souls and speciﬁes the ﬁrst message of his creed come and be forgiven he is appealing to our basest motives and turning the temple into huckster shop let him and all his tribe listen to these words of ruskin your honesty is not to be based either on religion or policy both your religion and policy must be based on it your honesty must be based the sun is in vacant heaven poised the lights in the ﬁrmament which have rule over the day and over the night if you ask why you are to be honest are in the question itself dishonored you are man is the only answer and therefore i said in former letter that to make your children capable of honesty is the beginning of education make them men ﬁrst and religious men afterwards and all will be sound but knave religion is always the rottenest thing about time and t ide p 37 these are the words of real spiritual teacher archbishop thomson will never get within million miles of their meaning nor will anybody be deceived by the unctuous oh that with which he concludes his discourse like mental rolling of the whites of his arrows of freethought by foote https we approach the end of his address we begin to understand his grace hatre d of progress he complains that intellectual progress never makes man conceive eternal hopes never makes man conceive that he has an eternal friend in heaven even the son of god quite true intellectual progress tends to bound our desires within the scope of their realisation and to dissipate the ﬁctions of theology it is therefore inimical to all professional who chatter about another world with understanding of this and especially to the lofty teachers of religion who luxuriate in palaces and ﬂing jibes and sneers at the toiling soldiers of progress who face hunger thirst and death these rich disciples of the poor nazarene are horriﬁed when the scorn is retorted on them and their creed and archbishop thomson expresses his disgust at our ridiculing his bible and endeavoring to bring his convictions into contempt it is he says an offence against the ﬁrst principles of mutual sympathy and consideration yet this angry complainant describes other people convictions absurd and insane all the sympathy and consideration is to be on one side the less said about either the better there can be treaty or truce in war of principles and the soldiers of progress will neither take quarter nor give it christianity must defend itself it may try to kill us with the poisoned arrows of persecution but what defence can it make against the riﬂeshot of or how stand against the shattering artillery of science every such battle is decided in its commencement every religion begins to succumb the very moment it is attacked defence of thomas p aine february 1879 fling mud enough and some of it will stick this noble maxim has been the favorite of traducers in all ages and climes they know that the object of their malignity can not always be on the alert to cleanse himself from the ﬁlth they ﬂing especially if cast behind his back they know that lies and especially slanderous lies are hard to overtake and when caught harder to strangle and therefore they feel conﬁdent to the ultimate fate of their victim if they can only persevere long enough in their vile policy of defamation human nature being more prone to believe evil than good of others it generally happens that the original traducers are at length joined by host of kindred spirits almost eager and venomous themselves the geese of the world who are ever hissing dispraise because their natures are little while multitude of others not so much malignant foolish and given to scandal lend their cowardly assistance and help to vilify characters far beyond the reach of their emulation and should such characters be those of men who champion unpopular causes there is lie too black belief concerning them accusation of secret theft or hateful meanness or loathsome lust that will not readily gain credence mr tennyson speaks that fierce light which beats upon throne and blackens every blot but what is that to the far ﬁercer and keener light which beats upon the lives of the great heroes of progress with all due deference to the poet laureate we conceive that kings and their kind have usually extended to them charity which covers multitude of their sins the late king of italy instance was said to have had the language of guardroom the manners of trooper and the morals of yet at his death how tenderly his faults were dealt with by the loyal press and how strongly were all his merits brought into relief our own royal sardanapalus geor ge the fourth although leigh hunt had the courage to describe him aright and went to the gaol so doing was styled by society the ﬁrst gentleman in europe yet mazzini vittor emmanuel great contemporary whose aims were high and noble his life was pure got little else than abuse from this same loyal press and the society which adored geor ge the fourth charged shelley himself with unspeakable vices equalled only by the native turpitude of his soul perhaps man has suffered more from calumny than thomas paine during his lifetime indeed his traducers scarcely ever dared to vent their malice in public doubtless through fear of receiving castigation from his vigorous and trenchant pen but after his death they rioted in safety and gave free play to the ingenuity of their malevolence gradually their libels became current thousands of people who knew almost nothing of his life and less of his writings were persuaded that arrows of freethought by foote https the inﬁdel was monster of iniquity in comparison with whom judas appeared saint and the devil himself nearly white and this estimate ﬁnally became tradition which the editors of illustrated religious papers and the writers of fraudulent scenes did their best to perpetuate in such hands the labor of posthumous viliﬁcation might have remained without greatly troubling those who feel an interest in thomas paine honor through gratitude his work the lowest scavengers of literature who purvey religious offal to the dregs of orthodoxy were better employed thus than in reverse way since their praise is so very much more dishonorable and appalling than their blame but when other literary workmen of loftier repute descend to the level of these and help them in their villainous task it becomes advisable that some one who honors the memory of the man thus aspersed should interpose and attempt that vindication which he can longer make himself in reviewing edward smith life of cobbett our principal literary paper the athenæum in its number january 1 1th went out of its way to defame paine character this is what it said more despicable man than tom paine can not easily be found among the ready writers of the eighteenth century he sold himself to the highest bidder and he could be bought at very low price he wrote well sometimes he wrote pointedly junius or cobbett neither excelled him in coining telling and mischievous phrases neither surpassed him in he had the art which was almost equal to genius of giving happy titles to his productions when he denounced the british government in the name of sense he found willing reade rs in the rebellious american colonists and rich reward from their grateful representatives whe n he wrote on behalf of the of man and in furtherance of the of reason he convinced thousands by his pages who were incapable of perceivin g the inconclusiveness of his argumen ts his speculations have long since gone the way of all shams and his charlatanism writer was not redeemed by his character man nothing could be worse than his private life he was addicted to the most degrading of vices he was hypocrite however and he can not be charged with showing that regard appearances which constitutes the homage paid by vice to virtue such man was well qualiﬁed earning notoriety by insul ting washington only rascal could have had the assurance to charge washingt on with being unprincipled and unpat riotic certainly smith has either much to learn or else he has forgotten much otherwise he could not venture to suggest the erection of monument the wisdom and political virtues of thomas paine now we have in this tirade all the old charges with new one which the critic has either furnished himself or derived from an obscure that paine sold himself to the highest bidder let us examine the last charge ﬁrst the critic curiously contradicts himself paine he admits could sometimes write pointedly junius or cobbett whose works sold enormously and he had the art of devising happy titles his productions yet although he sold himself to the highest bidder he could be bought at very low price the fact is paine was never bought at all his was not hireling pen whatever he wrote he put his name to and he never parted with the copyright of any of his works lest the government or some friend of despotism should procure their suppression he also publi shed his writings at ridiculously low price so low indeed that he lost by them instead of gaining of his common sense that ﬁne pamph let which stirred the american colonists to battle against their oppressors not less than hundred thousand copies were sold yet he found himself ﬁnally indebted to his printer 12s 1d fifteen years later the english government tried through the publisher to get the copyright of the rights of man but though large sum was offered paine refused on principle to let it pass out of his own hands the ﬁrst part of this work was published at price which precluded any chance of proﬁt the publication of the second part caused him to be tried and condemned treason the penalty of the law being escaped only by ﬂight all publication of his works whether political or religious was afterwards illegal thousands of copies were circulated surreptitiously or openly by men like richard carlile who spent nine years in prison his sale of prohibited books but clearly paine could derive proﬁt from this trafﬁc in his works he never set foot in england again thomas paine wrote in order to spread his political and religious views and other purpose he was not professional author nor professional critic and never needed payment his literary work and assuredly he got none let the athenæum critic inform the world to whom paine sold himself or who ever paid him penny his writings until he does so we shall believe that the author of common sense the rights of man and the age of reason was honest in saying in great affair where the good of mankind is at stake i love to work nothing and so fully am i under the inﬂuence of arrows of freethought by foote https that i should lose the spirit the pride and the pleasure of it were i conscious that i looked reward to use the critic graceless phrase was paine next fault but according to the same authority he was guilty in this respect only in the same sense junius was the burden of his iniquity can not be very great addiction to the most degrading of vices is charge difﬁcult to confute until we know speciﬁcally what vice is meant paine has been accused of drunkenness but by whom not by his intimate acquaintances who would have detected his guilt but by his enemies who were never in his society and therefore could know nothing of his habits cheetham who ﬁrst disseminated this accusation was notorious libeller and was more than once compelled to make public apology his lies but he was shameless creature and actually in his life of paine resuscitated and ampliﬁed falsehoods which he had tendered abject apologies while his victim was alive even however if paine had yielded to the seductions of strong drink he should be judged by the custom of his own age and not that of ours leslie stephen does not rail against boswell his drinking powers burns is not outlawed his devotion to john barlycorn byron and sheridan are not beyond pardon because they often went drunk to bed and some of the greatest statesmen of last century and this including pitt and fox are not considered the basest of men because they exercised that right which major claims all to drink much they can carry but such plea is necessary paine was not addicted to drink but remarkably abstemious fellows with whom he lived more than six months said that he never saw him the worse drink manley said while i attended him he never was inebriated colonel burr said he was decidedly temperate and even jarvis whom cheetham cited his authority charging paine with drunkenness authorised vale of new york editor of the beacon to say that cheetham lied amongst the public men who knew paine personally were burke home tooke priestley lord edward fitzgerald moore jefferson washington volney and condorcet but none of these ever hinted at his love of drink the charge of drunkeness is posthumous libel circulated by man who had publicly quarrelled with paine who had been obliged to apologise former aspers ions and who after paine death was prosecuted and condemned libelling lady whom he had accused of undue familiarity with the principal object of his malice finding the charge of drunkenness unequivocally rebutted paine traducers advance that of licentiousness but this is equally unsuccessful the authority relied on is still cheetham who in turn borrowed from less disreputable source man named carver had quarrelled with paine over money matters in fact he had been obliged with loan which he forgot to pay and like all base natures he showed his gratitude to his benefactor when more favors could be expected by hating and maligning him scurrilous letter written by this fellow fell into the hands of cheetham who elaborated it in his life it broadly hinted that madame bonneville the by means youthful wife of paris bookseller who had sheltered paine when he was threatened with danger in that city was his paramour other reason than that he had in turn sheltered her when she repaired with her children to america after her home had been broken up by buonaparte persecution of her husband this lady prosecuted cheetham libel and jury of american citizens gave her verdict and damages here the matter might rest but we are inclined to urge another consideration one of his many enemies ever accused paine of licentiousness in his virile manhood and can we believe that he began career of licentiousness in his old age when besides the inﬁrmities natural to his time of life he suffered dreadful tortures from an internal abscess brought on by his conﬁnement in the reeking dungeons of the luxembour g which made life terror and death boon only lunatics or worse would credit such preposterous story the athenoum critic alleges that paine insulted washington and was therefore ced rascal but he did nothing of the kind he very properly remonstrated with washington coolly allowing him to rot in french dungeon crime except that he was foreigner when word from the president of the united states of which he was citizen would have effected his release washington was aware of paine miser able plight yet he forgot the obligations of friendship and notwithstanding frequent letters from munro the american ambassador at paris he supinely suffered the man he had once delighted to honor to languish in wretchedness ﬁlth and disease geor ge washington did much american independence but thomas paine did perhaps more arrows of freethought by foote https writings animated the oppressed colonists with an enthusiasm liberty without which the respectable generalship of washington might have been exerted in vain the ﬁrst president of the united states was carlyle grimly says immeasurable man and we conceive that paine had earned the right to criticise even him and his policy every person is of course free to hold what opinion he pleases of paine writings the athenoum critic thinks they have gone the way of all shams he is wrong in fact they circulate very extensively still and he may also be wrong in his literary judgment william hazlitt whose opinion on any subject connected with literature is at least valuable an athenoum critic ranked paine very high political writer and afﬁrmed of his rights of man that it was powerful and explicit reply to burke but hazlitt had read paine which we suspect many glib critics of have not we well remember how puzzled some of them were to explain whence shelley took the motto we pity the plumage but forget the dying bird preﬁxed to his address to the people on the death of the princess charlotte it was taken they should have known from one of the ﬁnest passages of the rights of man critics it is well known sometimes write artemus ward proposed to lecture on science with an imagination untrammeled by the least knowledge of the subject let us close this vindication of paine by citing the estimate of him formed by walt whitman an authority not to be sneered at now even by athenoum critics in 1877 the liberal league of philadelphia celebrated the 140th birthday of thomas paine and large audience was gathered by the announcement that whitman would speak the great poet according to the index report after telling how he had become intimate with some of paine friends years before went on to say i dare not say how much of what our union is owning and enjoying its independence its ardent belief in and substantial practice of radical human rights and the severance of its government from all ecclesiastical and superstitious dare not say how much of all this is owing to thomas paine but i am inclined to think good portion of it decidedly is of the foul and foolish ﬁctions yet told about the circumstances of his decease the absolute fact is that he lived good life after its kind he died calmly philosophically became him he served the embryo union with the most precious service service that every man woman and child in the states is to some extent receiving the beneﬁt of and i one here cheerfully and reverently throw one pebble on the cairn of his memory we are content to let the reader decide between whitman and the athenoum critic in their respective estimates of him who wrote and we think acted up to all the world is my country and to good my religion the gospel of freethought august 1882 christians are perpetually crying that we destroy and never build up nothing could be more false all negation has positive side and we can not deny error without afﬁrming truth but even if it were true it would not lessen the value of our work you must clear the ground before you can build and plough before you sow splendo r gives strength to an ediﬁce whose foundations are treacherous nor can harvest be reaped from ﬁelds unprepared the seed freethought is in this respect like skilful physician whose function it is to expel disease and leave the patient sound and well sick man claims that the doctor shall supply him with something in place of his malady it is enough that the enemy of his health is driven out he is then in position to act himself he has legs to walk with brain to devise and hands to execute his will what more does he need what more can he ask without declaring himself weakling or fool so it is with superstition the dead liest disease of the mind casts it out with its blindness and its terrors and leaves the mind clear and free all nature is then before us to study and enjoy truth shines on us with celestial light goodness smiles on our best endeavors and beauty thrills our senses and kindles our imagination with the subtle magic of her arrows of freethought by foote https boon it is to think freely to let the intellect dart out in quest of truth at every point of the compass to feel the delight of the chase and the gladness of capture what noble privilege to pour treasures of knowledge into the crucible of the brain and separate gold from the dross the freethinker takes nothing on trust if he can help it he dissects analyses and proves everything does this make him barren sceptic not so what he discards he knows to be worthless and he also knows the value of what he prizes if one sweet vision turns out mirage how does it lessen our enjoyment at the true oasis or shake our certitude of water and shade under the palm trees by the well the masses of men not think freely they scarcely think at all out of their round of business they are trained not to think from the cradle to the grave orthodoxy has them in its clutches their religion is settled by priests and their political and social institutions by custom they look askance at the man who dares to question what is established not reﬂecting that all orthodoxies were once heterodox that without innovation there could never have been any progress and that if inquisitive fellows had not gone prying about in forbidden quarters ages ago the world would still be peopled by savages dressed in nakedness and feathers the mental stultiﬁcation which begins in youth reaches ossiﬁcation men grow older lack of thought ends in incapacity to think real freethought is impossible without education the mind can not operate without means or construct without materials theology opposes education freethought supports it the poor well the rich should share in its blessings education is social capital which should be supplied to all it enriches and expands it not only furnishes the mind but strengthens its faculties knowledge is power race of giants could not level the alps but ordinary men equipped with science bore through their base and made easy channels the intercourse of divided nations growth comes with use and power with exercise education makes both possible it puts the means of salvation at the service of all and prevents the faculties from moving about in vacuo and ﬁnally standing still from sheer hopelessness the educated man has whole magazine of appliances at his command and his intellect is trained in using them while the uneducated man has nothing but his strength and his training is limited to its use freethought demands education all it claims mental inheritance every child born into the world superstition demands ignorance stupidity and degradation wherever the schoolmaster is busy freethought prospers where he is not found superstition reigns supreme and levels the people in the dust free speech and freethought go together if one is hampered the other languishes what is the use of thinking if i may not express my thought we claim equal liberty all the priest shall say what he believes and so shall the sceptic law shall protect the one and disfranch ise the other if any man disapproves what i say he need not hear second time what more does he require let him listen to what he likes and leave others to the same let us have justice and fair play all round freethought is not only useful but laudable it involves labor and trouble ours is not gospel those who love the soft pillow of faith the freethinker does not let his ship rot away in harbor he spreads his canvas and sails the seas of thought what though tempests beat and billows roar he is undaunted and leaves the avoidance of danger to the sluggard and the slave he will not pay their price ease and safety away he sails with vigilance at the prow and wisdom at the helm he not only traverses the ocean highways but skirts unmapped coasts and ventures on uncharted seas he gathers spoils in every zone and returns with rich freight that compensates all hazards some day or other you say he will be shipwrecked and lost perhaps all things end somehow but if he goes down he will die like man and not like coward and have his requiem the psalm of the tempest and the anthem of the waves doubt is the beginning of wisdom it means caution independence honesty and veracity faith means negligence serfdom insincerity and deception the man who never doubts never thinks he is like straw in the wind or waif on the sea he is one of the helpless docile unquestioning millions who keep the world in state of stagnation and serve fulcrum the lever of despotism the stupidity of the people says whitman is always inviting the insolence of power buckle has well said that scepticism is the necessary antecedent of all progress without it we should still be groping in the night of the dark ages the very foundations of modern science and philosophy were laid on ground which was wrested from the church and every stone was cemented with the

but his ideas are undermining all the churches and crumbling them into dust the gospel of freethought brands perse cution the worst crime against humanity it stiﬂes the spirit of progress and strangles its pioneers it eliminates the brave the adventurous and the aspiring and leaves only the timid the sluggish and the grovelling it removes the lofty and spares the low it levels all the hills of thought and makes an intellectual ﬂatness it drenches all the paths of freedom with blood and tears and makes earth the vestibule of hell persecution is the right arm of priestcraft the black militia of theology are the sworn foes of freethought they represent it the sin against the holy ghost which there is forgiveness in this world or the next when they speak of the holy ghost they mean themselves freethought is crime against them it strips off the mystery that invests their craft and shows them they really are horde of bandits who levy black mail on honest industry and preach despot in heaven in order to their own tyranny on earth the gospel of freethought would destroy all priesthoods every man should be his own priest if professional gives you wrong advice and leads you to ruin

and act ourselves spiritual and temporal power are brought under the same rule they must justify themselves or go the freethinker is thus politician and social reformer what christian may be he must

veil of death here is our appointed province this world which is the world of all of us and where in the end we find our happiness or not at all let us make the best of this world and take our chance of any other if there is heaven we dare say it will hold all honest men if it will not those who go elsewhere will at least be in good company our salvation is here and now it is certain and not contingent we need not die before we realise it ours is gospel and the only gospel this side of the grave the promises of theology can not be made good till after death ours are all redeemable in this life we ask men to acknowledge realities and dismiss ﬁctions when you have sifted all the learned sermons ever preached you will ﬁnd very little good grain theology deals with dreams and phantasies and gives guidance to practical men the whole truth of life may be summed up in few words happiness is the only good suffering the only evil and selﬁshness the only sin and the whole duty of man may be expressed in one sentence slightly altered from what is true in order to what is right if man can tell you anything about these matters listen to him if not turn deaf ear and let him preach to the wind the only noble things in this world are great hearts and great brains there is virtue in starveling piety which turns all beauty into ugliness and shrivels up every natural affection let the heart beat high with courage and enterprise and throb with warm passion let the brain be an active engine of thought imagination and will the gospel of sorrow has had its day and the time has come the gospel of gladness let us live out our lives to the full radiating joy on all in our own circle and diffusing happiness through the grander circle of humanity until at last we retire from the banquet of life others have done before us and sink in eternal repose freethought in current litera ture paper read at the annual conference of the national secular society in the hall bury june 5th 1881 when i was invited to read paper at this conference i thought that editor of the freethinker i ought to say something about freethonght and the deliberations of this conference are mostly on practical matters it occurred to that i had better select subject of less immediate though not of insigniﬁcant interest so i resolved to address you on freethonght in current literature i have said that this subject if not practical and urgent is assuredly not unimpor tant the power of literature over men minds can not be estimated too highly science is tremendous force but its greatest inﬂuence is exercised over the human mind when it quits the merely practical task of ministering to our material desires and seeks to mould our moral and spiritual conceptions of our position and destiny in the universe to this it must address us through the medium of literature art also is great force more especially in countries which have not been subjected like ours to the bondage of puritanism but art has hitherto appealed to restricted circle although that circle is rapidly widening in our own age the greatest most permanent and most universal force is literature raphael and michael angelo have not inﬂuenced the world so profou ndly shakespeare and dante while so many artistic achievements of antiquity are lost or half decayed its literary masterpieces still survive with undiminished freshness and charm and while the most arrows of freethought by foote https even of contemporary artists are seen only occasionally by few the most eminent writings of the world master minds may and become household possession to thousands who move in the humblest spheres of life in these cosmopolitan days the freethinker and humanitarian naturally looks beyond his own country into the great world which is at present divided by national and other barriers but which will in time become the home of one family and i confess that i was strongly tempted to trace the workings of the spirit of freethought far i could in the general literature of europe but i soon recognised the necessity of limiting myself to the manifestations of that subtle and pervasive spirit in the current literature of our english tongue when the present century commenced europe was stirred to the utter depths by that great french revolution which marked new epoch in the world history the revolutionary wave surged across the western world and passed over england well other countries some thought the huge eclipse of social order which accompan ied it the herald of approaching night and others thought it the dawn of new day but none were indifferent there was an intense excitement of radical passions and desires quickening of all the springs of life this produced blossoming of our literature such had not been witnessed since the great elizabethan age and then before thought mixed with the vital sap of the long array of names i select thomas paine who represented the keen and restless of freethought william godwin who represented its calmer philosophy and shelley who represented its lofty hopes and soaring aspirations godwin has almost faded into name paine great work is nearly done deeper and more scientiﬁc scepticism has possessed itself of the ﬁeld in which he labored but shelley has message generations yet unborn he emer ges the supreme ﬁgure destined to immortality of fame all great and noble and beautiful qualities cohere in him the poet of poets and purest of men and he is ours byron with all his splendid energy and terrible scorn quailed before the supreme problems of life but shelley faced them with courage all the greater because it was unconscious and casting aside all superstitious dreams and illusory hopes yearned prophetically towards the future when freedom truth and love shall supersede all other trinities and realise here on earth that paradise which theologians have only promised in world to come shelley cultus has grown up during recent years and many of our most gifted writers reverently bow themselves before him i have only to mention such names browning swinburne and rossetti to show the intellectual rank of his worshippers their number increases every year and it is touching to witness the avidity with which they seize on all new facts relating to him whether the record of some episode in his life reported conversation or scrap of writing from his hand from the shelley and byron period to the fresh revolutionary outburst of 1848 there was lull in england well elsewhere several great political reforms were achieved in the interval reform bill was carried catholics and jews were emancipated and freedom and cheapness of the press were won by the untameable courage of men like carlile hetherington lovett and watson but quietude reigned in the higher spheres of literature the age was eminently respectable and it acclaimed the highly respectable wordsworth the prophet divinely inspired to teach men how to rest and be thankful but during that interval of apathy and respectability science was slowly gathering strength and making conquests in preparation the time when she might plant her feet ﬁrmly on the solid ground she had won and challenge theology to mortal combat geology and biology in especial were getting themselves ready to overthrow the fables of genesis and destroy its doctrines of special creation and one is glad to admit that they have completely succeeded at last professor huxley declares that he is not acquainted with any man of science or properly instructed person who believes that adam and eve were the ﬁrst parents of mankind or that we have all descended from the eight persons who superintended that wonderful ﬂoating menagerie which survived universal deluge less than ﬁve thousand years ago and all the clergy can say in reply is that professor huxley is not endowed with that theological faculty which enables them to perceive in the language of scripture meaning which is quite undiscernible to the eyes of common sense another inﬂuence was at work during that interval mainly through carlyle the treasures of german literature were opened up to english readers the greatest german writers from leasing göethe and schiller to fichte richter and heine were outrageous freethinkers compared with our own respectable and orthodox writers and their inﬂuence soon made itself evident in the tolerance and courage with which english author s began to treat the great problems of morality and arrows of freethought by foote https scholarship too slowly crept among us its biblical criticism showed us the utter inadequacy of evidential works like paley and made us see that the christian scriptures would have to be viewed in very different light and studied in very different spirit to estimate the extent of this change we have only to place paley evidences of christianity beside such work supernatural religion the gulf between these works is enormous and it is notable that the more scientiﬁc and rigorous is the criticism of the new testament books the more heterodox are the conclusions reached even scotland has been invaded by this german inﬂuence and it now affords us the laughable spectacle of number of grave ministers pursuing damnable heretic man like robertson smith whose only crime is having stated about the bible nothing new but what every scholar in europe knows to be admitted and indisputable these solemn ministers of the old creed are determined to keep the deluge of what they call german inﬁdelity from ﬂooding the valleys and mounting the hillsides of scotland but their are just efﬁcacious against what they so piously dread partington mop against the mighty onrush of atlantic rollers with the revolutionary movement of came fresh impulse from france the great evangel of had not perished it was only in abeyance and again it burst upon europe with its words of ﬁre we all know how the republic which was then established was soon suppressed in blood by the gang of adventurers presided over by napoleon the little but the day of retribution came and the empire went the way of all tyrannies on its ruins the republic has been established anew and now it reckons in its service and among its champions the best intellects and the noblest characters in france while the masses of the people taught by the bitter lessons of adversity are also content to enjoy the beneﬁts of ordered liberty and peaceful progress under its benign sway now french progress has always been question of ideas less than of material advantage the great democratic leaders in france have nearly all been avowed freethinkers they have separated themselves alike from the blood on the hands of the king and the lie at the lips of the priest being perfectly assured that outward freedom in politics is in the long run impossible without inward freedom of thought the chief statesman in france gambetta has publicly declared himself disciple of voltaire and neither at the marriages nor at the funerals of his friend s does he ever enter the doors of church he stays outside and quietly allows those who desire it to go in and listen to the mumbling of the priest my purpose however being literary and not political i must recur to my remark that fresh impulse came to us from france after the revolution of lamartine at ﬁrst exercised considerable inﬂuence here but gradually victor hugo star ascended and from the moment it reached the zenith until now he has been accounted the supreme poet of france and the greatest contemporary evangelist of the ideas of he is freethinker well republican and it was inevitable that the younger school of writers in england who acknowledge him lofty master should drink from his inexhaustible spring the living waters of democracy and freethought french inﬂuence on our very recent literature is evident in such works john morley studies on voltaire rousseau diderot and condorcet christie monumental life of etienne dolet the freethought martyr and parton new life of voltaire all of which demand and will amply requite our attention such are the inﬂuences which have conspired to shape the literary activities of the generation in which we live now freethought like subtle essence penetrates everywhere every book betrays its presence and even the periodical literature of our age is affected by it the archbishop of canterbury laments that christian men can not introduce the most respectable magazines into their homes without the risk of poisoning the minds of their families with heretical ideas one of the signs that freethought had begun to leaven the educated classes was the publication of the famous essays and reviews the heresy of that book was exceedingly small but it roused great storm in the religious world and led to more than one clerical prosecution another sign was the publication of colenso learned work on the pentateuch this ing colonial bishop was denounced heretic by the idler home bishops and ruskin has said that they would have liked to burn colenso alive and make ludgate hill easier the omnibuses with the cinders of him an antagonist very different from the bishops was matthew arnold who severely censured colenso whole method of criticism handling of religious questions in an irreligious spirit greg admirably defended the bishop and the controversy ended in drawn battle but what has happened since the same matthew arnold who censured colenso has himself published two remarkable works on literature and dogma and god and the bible written it arrows of freethought by foote https on different plan from colenso but containing hundred times more heresy than the bishop crammed into all his big volumes arnold deprecates the idea of personal god likens the christian trinity to three lord shaftesburys and says that the bible miracles must all be given up without reservation all the positive religion he leaves us is the belief in an eternal not ourselves that makes righteousness which is about nebulous creed ever was preached now arnold is not an insigniﬁcant person he is recognised of english letters ripe scholar ﬁne poet and an exquisite critic when such man carries destructive criticism to its utmost limits we may well congratulate ourselves on signal triumph of freethought and we may also ﬁnd comfort in the fact that nobody thinks of ﬂinging stone at arnold his heresy the censors of religion in the press will cease to throw stones at the freethought teachers among the masses of the people who only put into homlier english and publish in cheaper form the sentiments and ideas which arnold expresses the educated classes at higher price and in loftier style during the winter gap was made in the front rank of english literature by the deaths of carlyle and geor ge eliot neither of these great writers was orthodox carlyle was freethinker to the extent of discarding christian supernaturalism very early in his life he told edward irving that he did not nor was it likely he ever would regard christianity he did we all remember too his scornful references to hebrew old clothes and his ﬁerce diatribes against the clergy who he said went about with strange gear on their heads and underneath it such theory of the universe he one was thankful to have concern with in the latter pamphlets he likened christianity to great tree sprung from the seed of nazareth and since fed by the opulences of ﬁfty generations which now is perishing at the root and sways to and fro ever farther and farther from the perpendicular and which in the end must come down and leave to those who found shelter beneath it and thought it inﬁnite wholesome view of the upper eternal lights and his contempt controversial or dogmatic theology may be gauged by his reply to one who asked him whether he was pantheist said carlyle never was nor either geor ge eliot was notoriously freethinker early in her literary career she translated strauss and feuerback into english and through all her novels there runs profound secular spirit among her friends she was well known to be positivist and though her creed held forth promise of personal life beyond the grave she found inspiration and comfort in the thought that humanity would advance after she was gone that though she died the race was practically immortal her mind was thoroughly imbued with the scienti ﬁc spirit and her writings give some conception of the way in which the evolution theory affected mind fortiﬁed by culture and abundant common sense against the crudities of enthusiasm the doctrine of evolution did not ﬁll her with despair on the contrary it justiﬁed and strengthened her ardent hopes the future of mankind many other novelists betray strong spirit of freethought it pervades all geor ge meredith later writings and is still more conspicuous in lynn linton true history of joshua davidson and her powerful under which lord the husband of that story being an agnostic gentleman who founds workmen institute and delivers freethought lectures in it almost all the young school of poets are freethinkers browning our greatest and tennyson our most popular belong to generation that is past swinburne is at the head of the new school and he is notorious heretic he never sings more loftily or with stronger passion or with ﬁner thought than when he arraigns and denounces priestcraft and its superstitions before the bar of humanity and truth the reception of thomsons poem s and essays affords another sign of the progress of freethought this gentleman many years contributed to secular journals under the initials of he is pronounced atheist and makes concealment of it in his poem yet while few critics have expressed horror at his heresy the majority have treated it extremely natural in an educated thoughtful man and conﬁned themselves to the task of estimating the genius he has put into his work i must now draw to close freethought i hold is an omnipresent active force in the english literature of it appears alike in the greatest works of scholarship in the writings of men of science in the songs of poets in the productions of novelists in the most respectable magazines and in the multitudinous daily press it is urgent and aggressive and tolerates restraint it indicates the progress we have made towards that time when the mind of man shall play freely on every arrows of freethought by foote https question shall be thought too sacred to be investigated when reason shall be the sovereign arbiter of all disputes when priestly authority shall have perished when every man thought shall decide his own belief and his conscience determine the way in which he shall walk dean st anley la test august 1880 at one of charles lamb delightful wednesday evenings coleridge had usual consumed more than his fair share of time in talking of some regenerated orthodoxy leigh hunt who was one of the listeners manifested his surprise at the prodigality and intensity of the poet religious expressions and especially at his always speaking of jesus our savior whereupon lamb slightly exhilarated by glass of gooseberry cordial stammered out mind what coleridge says he full of fun this jocular and irreverent criticism is perhaps after all the most pertinent that can be passed on the utterances of this school of regenerated orthodoxy coleridge who had unbounded genius and was intellectually capable of transforming british philosophy went on year after year maundering about his sumject and omject mysteriously alluding to his great projected work on the logos and assuring everybody that he knew way of bringing all ascertained truth within the dogmas of the church of england his pupil maurice wasted noble intellect mill says few of his contemporaries had so much intellect to waste in the endeavor to demonstrate that the articles really anticipated all the extremest conclusions of modern thought afﬂicting himself perpetually has been well said with those forty stripes save one and now we have dean stanley certainly much smaller man than maurice and inﬁnitely smaller than coleridge continuing the traditions of the school of which let us hope he will be the last teacher what his theology precisely is mortal can determine he subscribes the doctrines of the church of england but then he interprets them in an esoteric sense that is of course in stanleyan sense when the letter of doctrine is left its occult meaning every man runs private interpretation of his own the nineteenth century august contains characteristic specimen of his exegesis it is entitled the creed of the early christians but is really sermon on the trinity which doubtless has been preached at westminster we shall examine its peculiarities and try to reach its meaning task by means easy and one which we could pardon anyone putting aside with lamb remark it only his fun dean stanley has new theory of the trinity partly deduced from other mystics and partly constructed on the plan of the negro who explained that his wooden doll was made all by myself out of my own head god the father in this in other theories comes ﬁrst not that he is older or greater than the other persons they are all three coequal and coëternal but because you must have ﬁrst the sake of enumeration or else the most blessed trinity would be like the irishman little pig who ran about so that there was counting him there is also another reason god the father corresponds to natural religion which of course has priority in the religious development of mankind coming before revealed religion to which god the son corresponds and still more before spiritual religion to which corresponds the holy ghost we look round the physical world we see indications of order design and good will towards the living creatures which animate it often it is true we can not trace any such design but whenever we can the impression upon us is the sense of single wise beneﬁcent mind the same now that it was ages before the appearance of same in other parts of the universe it is in our own and in our own hearts and consciences we feel an instinct corresponding to voice faculty that seems to refer us to higher power than ourselves and to point to some invisible sovereign will like to that which we see impressed on the natural world and further the more we think of the supreme the more we try to imagine what his feelings are towards us the more our idea of him becomes ﬁxed in the one simple word that he is our father the words we have italicised say that design can not always be traced in nature we should like to know where it can ever be evolution shows that the design argument puts the cart before the horse natural selection schmidt appositely remarks accounts adaptation result arrows of freethought by foote https the supposition of design cause and if you can not deduce god from the animate world you are not likely to deduce him from the inanimate dean stanley himself quotes some remarkable words from newman apologia the being of god is certain to the certainty of my own existence yet when i look out of myself into the world of men i see sight which ﬁlls with unspeakable distress the world of men seems simply to give the lie to that great truth of which my whole being is so full if i looked into mirror and did not see my face i should experience the same sort of difﬁculty that actually comes upon when i look into this living busy world and see reﬂection of its creator how asks the dean is this difﬁculty to be met oh he replies we must turn to god the son in the person of jesus christ and his utterances will supplement and correct the uncertain sounds of nature and then there is the holy ghost to ﬁnally supply all omissions and clear up all difﬁculties now to our mind this is simply intellectual or rather does it not suggest the trick one card is useless two cards are unsafe but with three cards to shufﬂe you are almost sure to win newman gets his god through intuition he maintains that the existence of god is primary fact of conscio usness and entirely declines the impossible task of proving it from the phænomena of nature dean stanley should the same it is not honest to employ an argument and then shirk all the difﬁculties it raises by resorting to the theological trick which confounds instead of satisfying the spectator while emptying his mental pockets of the good cash of common sense the dean treatment of god the son is amusing he writes of jesus christ though he were principle instead of person the mahometan he says rightly objects to the introduction of the paternal and ﬁlial relations into the idea of god when they are interpreted in the gross and literal sense but in the moral spiritual sense it is true that the kindness tenderness and wisdom we ﬁnd in jesus christ is the reﬂection of the same kindness tenderness and wisdom which we recognise in the governance of the universe this may be called mysticism but we think it moonshine gross and literal sense forsooth why was not jesus christ man most literal fact gross mountain open palpable dean stanley approves the mahometan objection and yet he knows full well that it contravenes fundamental dogma of the christian church and is accounted most damnable heresy why this paltering with us in double sense to our mind downright blatant orthodoxy which is at least honest if not subtle is preferable to this hybrid theology which attempts to reconcile contradictions in order to show respect to truth while sticking to the of error and evades all difﬁculties by patent and patently dishonest method of interpretation quoting goethe wilhelm meister dean stanley tells us that one great beneﬁt traceable to god the son is the recognition of humility and poverty mockery and despising wretchedness and suffering divine well if these things are divine the sooner we all become devilish the better nobody thinks them divine when they happen to himself on the contrary he cries out lustily against them but it is different matter when they happen to others then the good christian considers them divine how easily says french wit we bear other people troubles undistracted by personal care pious souls contemplate with serene resignation the suffering of their neighbors and acknowledge in them the chastening hand of divine father god the holy ghost represents spiritual religion the father represents god in nature the son represents god in history and the holy ghost represents to us god in our own hearts and spirits and consciences here be truths an illustration is given theodore parker when boy took up stone to throw at tortoise in pond but felt himself restrained by something within him and that something his mother told him was the voice of god or in other words the holy ghost now if the holy ghost is required to account every kind impulse of boys and men there is required also an unholy ghost to account all our unkind impulses that is place in theology must be found the devil the equilateral triangle of theology must be turned into square with old nick the fourth side but dean stanley does not like the devil he deems him not quite respectable enough polite society let him then give up the holy ghost too the one is the correlative of the other it may be says the dean after interpreting the trinity that the biblical words in some respects fall short of this high signiﬁcation what god own language inferior to that of the dean of westminster surely this is strange arrogance unless after all it only his fun perhaps that is how we should take it referring to some sacred pictures in the old churches of the east on mount athos intended to represent the doctrine of the trinity the dean says that standing on one side the spectator sees only christ on the cross standing on the other he sees only the holy dove while standing in front he sees only the eternal father very admirable doubt but there is more arrows of freethought by foote https described by herbert spenc er in his study of sociology which graphically represents the doctrine of the trinity in the guise of three persons trying to stand in one pair of boots goethe is cited christian believer in the trinity doubtless the dean forgets his bitter epigram to the effect that he found four things too hard to put up with and hateful poison and serpents namely tobacco garlic bugs and the cross heine also is pressed into service and an excellent prose translation of one of his poems is given wherein he celebrates the holy ghost the spirit of god but dean stanley has read his heine to little purpose if he imagines that this radiant and splendid soldier of progress meant by the spirit of god the third person of the christian trinity heine was christian and the very opposite of theologian we might translate passages of scathing irony on the ascetic creed of the cross from the but space does not admit few of heine last words must instead to adolph stahr he said the man in good health christianity is an unserviceable religion with its resignation and precepts the sick man however i assure you it is very good religion to alfred meissner when health is used up money used up and sound human sense used up christianity begins once while lying on his he said with sigh if i could even get out on crutches you know whither i would go straight to church and when his hearer looked incredulous he added most decidedly to church wher else should one go with crutches such exquisite and mordant irony is strange indeed in defender of the holy and blessed trinity dean stanley peroration runs thus wherever we are taught to know and understand the real nature of the world in which our lot is cast there is testimony however humble to the name of the father wherever we are taught to know and admire the highest and best of human excellence there is testimony to the name of the son wherever there is implanted in us presence of freedom purity and love there is testimony to the name of the holy ghost very ﬁne doubt also very soporiﬁc one is inclined to mutter sleepy amen if this passage means anything at all it implies that all who know truth admire excellence and have any share in freedom and virtue are testators to the names of father son and holy ghost so that many atheists are trinitarians without knowing it in christianity says the dean thing is of real concern except that which makes us wiser and better that is precisely what the sceptic says yet that coroners reject his service on juries and rowdy christians try to keep him out of parliament when he has legal right to enter but the dean adds everything which does make us wiser and better is the very thing which christianity intends that is christianity means just what you like to ﬁnd in it how can man of dean stanley eminence and ability write such dishonest trash must we charitably though with touch of sarcasm repeat lamb words of never mind it only his fun god and the queen march 1882 the queen is now safely lodged at mentone political outlook is not very bright there is pretty sure to be good solid majority to vote dowry prince leopold bride and so long royalty is safe it does not much matter what becomes of the people that dreadful bradlaugh is gagged he can not open his mouth in the house of commons against perpetual pensions or royal grants the interests of monarchy are in immediate peril and so the queen is of f to mentone now she is gone and the loyal hubbub has subsided it is just the time to consider her late providential escape from the bullet which was never ﬁred at her what is the meaning of providential god does all or nothing there is special providence in the fall of sparrow well in the fall of empires in that case everything is providential but this is not the ordinary view when railway accident occurs those who not come to grief ascribe their preservation to providence who then is responsible the fate of those who perish centuries ago christians would have answered the devil now they give answer at all but treat the question frivolous or profane thomas cooper in his autobiography says that the perfecting touch was given to his conversion by an interposition of god during collision the carriage in which he sat was lifted clean on arrows of freethought by foote https line of rails and thus escaped the fate of the other carriages which were broken to pieces pious thomas recognised at once the ﬁnger of god and he there and then fell on his knees and offered up thanksgiving he was too vain to carry his argument out to its logical end why did the lord protect him and not his was he of more importance than any of the others and why if it was right to thank god saving thomas cooper would it be wrong to curse him smashing all the rest this superstition of providence is dying out common people are gradually being left to the laws of nature if workhouse were to catch on ﬁre one would speak of those who escaped the ﬂames providentially saved god does not look after the welfare of paupers nor is it likely that he would pluck charwoman brat out of the ﬁre if it tumbled in during her absence such interpositions are absurd but with kings queens princes princesses and big nobs in general the case is different god looks after the quality he stretches forth his hand to save them from danger from the pestilence that walketh by day and the terror that walketh by night and his worshippers take just the same view of the swells when the queen came to london few weeks ago one of her mounted attendants was thrown and badly hurt and the next day one of the loyal tory papers reported that her majesty had completely recovered from the accident to her outrider but if the lord overlooks the great ones of the earth why is he not impartial he did not turn aside guiteau bullet nor did he answer the prayers of whole nation on its knees president garﬁeld was allowed to die after long agony poor garﬁeld believed up to the very last minute that god would interpose and save her husband but he never did why was he so indifferent in this case was it because garﬁeld was president instead of king the elected leader of free men instead of the hereditary ruler of political slaves informer newdegate would say so in his opinion god almighty hates republicans yet the bible clearly shows that the lord is opposed to monarchy he gave his chosen people king punishment after plainly telling them what an evil they had sought and there is perhaps covert irony in the story of saul the son of kish who went to seek his father asses and found instead nation of asses who begged him to mount them and ride take another case why did god permit the nihilists to assassinate the late czar of russia all their previous plots had failed why was the last plot allowed to succeed there is only one answer god had nothing to with any of them and the last succeeded because it was better devised and more carefully executed if god protec ted the czar against their former attempts they were too many him in the end that is they defeated absurdity too ﬂagrant any sane man to believe why should god care princes more than peasants queens more than washerwomen there is difference in their compositions they are all made of the same ﬂesh and blood the very book these loyal gushers call the word of god declares that he is respecter of persons what are the distinctions of rank and wealth mere nothings look down from an altitude of thousand feet and an emperor and his subjects shall appear equally small and what are even thousand feet in the inﬁnite universe nay strip them of all their ﬁctions of dress reduce them to the same condition of featherless bipeds and you shall ﬁnd the forms of strength or beauty and the power of brain impartially distributed by nature who is the truest democrat who raises her shakespeares from the lowest strata of society and laughs to scorn the pride of palaces and thrones providence is an absurdity superstitious relic of the ignorant past sensible men disbelieve it and scientists laugh it to scorn our very moral sense revolts against it why should god help few of his children and neglect all the others explosions happen in mines and scores of honest industrious men doing the rough work of the world and winning bread wife and child are blown to atoms or hurled into shapeless death god does not help them and tears moisten the dry bread of widows and orphans sailors on the mighty deep go down with uplifted hands or slowly gaze their life away on the merciless heavens the mother bends over her dying child the ﬁrst ﬂower of her wedded love the sweetest hope of her life she is rigid with despair and in her hot tearless eyes there dwells dumb misery that would touch heart of stone but god does not help the curtain falls and darkness reigns where all was light who has the audacity to say that the god who will not aid mother in the shelters the queen upon her throne it is an insult to reason and ghastly mockery of justice the impartiality of nature is better than the mercy of such arrows of freethought by foote https newman on infidelity april 1882 cardinal newman is perhaps the only catholic in england worth listening to he has immured his intellect in the catacombs of the romish church but he has not been able to quench it and even there it radiates splendor through the gloom his saintly character is indubitable the subtlety of his mind and vicissitude has impaired the charm of his style which is pure and perfect an exquisite and ﬂawless diamond serene and chaste in its usual mood but scintillating gloriously in the light of his imagination on sunday last cardinal newman preached sermon at the oratory in birmingham on modern inﬁdelity unfortunately we have not full report from which we might be able to extract some notable passages but only newspaper summary even this however shows some points of interest cardinal newman told his hearers that great storm of inﬁdelity and irreligion was at hand and that some dreadful spiritual catastrophe was coming upon them we quite agree with the great preacher but every storm is not an evil and every catastrophe is not disaster the revolutionary storm in france cleared the air of much pestilence it dissipated by enchantment the horrible cloud of tyranny persecution and want which had centuries hovered over the land and certainly to go back stage farther in history the reformation was not misfortune although it looked like spiritual catastrophe to great many amiable people the truth is revolution s must occur in this world both in thought and in action they may happen slowly so that we may accommodate ourselves to them or rapidly and so disturb and injure whole generations but come they must and power can hinder them not even that once mighty church which has always striven to bind humanity to the past with adamantine chains of dogma in cardinal newman own words from perhaps his greatest and most characteristic book here below to live is to change and to be perfect is to have changed often we can not say that cardinal newman indicates how humanity will suffer from the coming storm of inﬁdelity and irreligion he does indeed refer to the awful state of peop le forsaken by god but in our humble opinion this is somewhat ludicrous we can hardly understand how god can forsake his own creatures why all this pother if he really exists in that case our scepticism can not affect him any more than man blindness obscures the sun and surely if omnipotence desired us all to believe the truth the means are ready to hand the god who said let there be light and there was light could easily say let all men be christians and they would be christians if god had spoken the universe would be convinced and the fact that it is not convinced proves either that he does not exist or that he purposely keeps silent and desires that we should mind our own business the only tangible evil cardinal newman ventures to indicate is the indign ity which at this moment has come over the holy father at rome he declares to the pope that there hardly seems place in the whole of europe where he could put his foot the catholics are carrying this pretence of captive pope triﬂe too far his holiness must have tremendous foot if he can not put it fairly down on the ﬂoor of the vatican he and his cardinals really wail over their loss of temporal power it would be wiser and nobler to reconcile themselves to the inevitable and to end the nefarious diplomacy by which they are continually striving to recover what is ever lost the whole world is aware of the scandalous misrule and the ﬂagrant immorality which under the government of the papacy made the eternal city byword and reproach under the secular government rome has made wonderful progress it has better streets cleaner inhabitants less fever and ﬁlth and much smaller army of priests beggars and prostitutes catholics may rest assured that the bad old times will never return they may of course promise reform ation of manners if the holy father dominion is restored but the world will not believe them reforming the papacy carlyle grimly said is like tinkering rusty old kettle if you stop up the holes of it with temporary putty it may hang together awhile but begin to hammer at it solder it to what you call mend and rectify it will fall to shreds sure rust is rust go all into nameless dissolution the fat in the ﬁre will be thing worth looking at poor pope arrows of freethought by foote https sincere christian very rare thing by the way in these days cardinal newman is bound to lament the spread of inﬁdelity he is keen observer and his word may be taken the fact stormy time is undoubtedly coming old creeds and institutions will have to give an account of themselves and nothing that can not stand the test will live but truth will not suffer criticise the multiplication table much you please and twice two will still be four in the storm and stress of controversy what is true and solid will survive only the hollow shams of authority and superstition will collapse humanity has nothing to fear however the churches may groan sunda y tyranny may 1882 last sunday the myriads of paris turned out to the chantilly races the sun shone brilliantly and all went merry marriage bell yet there was drunkenness or disorder on the contrary the multitude behaved with such decorum that one english correspondent said it would not have appeared strange if bishop had stepped forward in full canonicals to give them his benediction why can not englishmen enjoy their sunday leisure like the french because we are still under the bondage of puritanism because our religious dress is nothing but hebrew old clothes because we follow moses instead of jesus because we believe that man was made the sabbath instead of the sabbath man because in short there are in england lot of sour christians who play the dog in the manger and will neither enjoy themselves on sunday nor let anyone else they often prate about liberty but they understand it the yankee did who deﬁned it the right to he pleased and the right to make everybody else so too let us all be unhappy on sunday is the burden of their song now we have objection to their being miserable if they desire it on that or any other day this is supposed to be free country you decide to be wretched and you select your own time the treat but you have right to interfere with your neighbors this however is what the christians with their customary cheek will insist on doing they like going to the church and the on sunday and those establishments are permitted to open they have wish to go elsewhere and so they keep all other establishments closed this is mere impudence let them go where they choose and allow the same freedom to other people those who advocate free sunday ask favor they demand justice they not propose to compel any christian to enter museum library or an art gallery they simply claim the right to go in themselves the denial of that right is violation of liberty which every free man is bound to resent this country is said to be civilised to certain extent it is but all our civilisation has been won against christianity and its brutal laws our toiling masses in factory mine shop and house have one day of leisure in the week rightly considered it is of inﬁnite value it is splendid we cast off the storm and stress of life ﬂing aside the ﬁerce passion of gain and let the spirit of humanity throb in our pulse s and stream from our eyes our fellow man is longer rival but brother his gain is not our loss we enrich each other by the noble of fellowship and feel what it really is to live yet our christian legislature tries its utmost to spoil the boon it can not prevent us from visiting each other or walking far our legs will carry us but almost everything else is tabooed go to church it says millions answer we are sick of going we have heard the same old story until it is unspeakably stale and many of the sermons have been so frequently repeated that we suspect they were bought by the dozen then it says go to the house but huge multitude answer we want to go there either except minute to quench our thirst we have wish spirituous any more than spiritual intoxication we desire some other alternative than gospel or gin then our christian legislature answers you are discontented fools it crushes down their better aspirations and condemns them to wearisome inactivity go through london the metropolis of the world we call it on sunday how utterly dreary it is the shutters are all up before the gay you pace mile after mile of streets with sombre houses on either hand though tenanted by the dead you stand in front of the british museum and it looks if it had been closed since the date of the mummies inside you yearn arrows of freethought by foote https through its galleries to gaze on the relics of antiquity to inspect the memorials of the dead to feel the subtle links that bind together the past and the present and make one great family of countless generations of men but you must wander away disappointed and dejected you repair to the national gallery you long to behold the masterpieces of art to have your imagination quickened and thrilled by the glories of form and color to look once more on some favorite picture which touches your nature to its ﬁnest issues but again you are foiled you desire to visit library full of books you can not buy and there commune with the great minds who have left their thoughts to posterity but you are frustrated again you are cheated out of your natural right and treated less like man than dog this christian legislature has much to answer drunkenness is our great national vice and how is it to be overcome preaching will not it give englishmen chance furnish them with counter attractions and they will abjure intoxication like their continental neighbors elevate their tastes and they will feel superior to the vulgar temptation of drink every other method has been tried and has failed this is the only method that promises success fortunately the sunday question is grow ing christian tyranny is evidently doom ed howard motion the opening of public museums and art galleries although defeated received the support of members of parliament that minority will increase again next year and in time it will become majority broadhurst some peculiar reason voted against it but we imagine he will some day repent of his action the are fools if they listen to the idle talk about sunday labor with which the tories and bigots try to bamboozle them the opening of public institutions on sunday would not necessitate hundredth part of the labor already employed in keeping open places of worship and driving rich people to and fro all the nonsense about the thin end of the wedge is simply dust thrown into their eyes the very people who vote against sunday freedom under pretence of opposing sunday labor keep their own servants at work and visit the zoo in the afternoon where they doubtless chuckle over the credulity of the lower orders christian tyranny unites with tory oppression to debase and enslave the people it is time that both were imperiously stopped the upper classes wish to keep us ignorant and parsons naturally want everybody else shutters up when they open shop we ought to see through the swindle let us check their impudence laugh at their hypocrisy and rescue our sunday from their hands who are the blasphemers june 1882 atheists are often charged with blasphe my but it is crime they can not commit god is to them merely word expressing all sorts of ideas and not person it is properly speaking general term which includes all that there is in common among the various deities of the world the idea of the supernatural embodies itself in thousand ways truth is always simple and the same but error is inﬁnitely diverse jupiter jehovah and are alike creations of human fancy the products of ignorance and wonder which is the god is not yet settled when the sects have decided this point the question may take fresh turn but until then god must be considered generic term like tree or horse or men with just this difference however that while the words tree horse and man express the general qualities of visible objects the word god expresses only the imagined qualities of something that nobody has ever seen when the atheist examines denounces or satirises the gods he is not dealing with persons but with ideas he is incapable of insulting god he does not admit the existence of any such being ideas of god may be good or bad beautiful or ugly and according he ﬁnds them the atheist treats them if we lived in turkey we should deal with the god of the kora n but we live in england we deal with the god of the bible we speak of that god being just convenience sake and not from conviction at bottom we admit nothing but the mass of contradictory notions between genesis and revelation we attack not person but belief not being but an idea not fact but fancy arrows of freethought by foote https brougham long ago pointed out in his life of voltaire that the great french heretic was not guilty of blasphemy his enemies alleged since he had belief in the actual existence of the god he dissected analysed and laughed at ruskin very eloquently defends byron from the same charge in cain and elsewhere the great poet does not impeach god he merely impeaches the orthodox creed we may sum up the whole matter brieﬂy man satirises the god he believes in and man believes in the god he satirises we shall not therefore be deterred by the cry of blasphemy which is exactly what the jewish priests shouted against jesus christ if there is god he can not be half so stupid and malignant the bible declares in destroying the counterfeit we not harm the reality and it is better in the words of plutarch to have notion of the gods than to have notions which dishonor them we are satisﬁed that the lord if he exist will never burn us in hell denying few lies told in his name the real blasphemers are those who believe in god and blacken his character who credit him with less knowledge than child and less intelligence than an idiot who make him quibble deceive and lie who represent him indecent cruel and revengeful who give him the heart of savage and the brain of fool these are the blasphemers when the priest steps between husband and wife with the name of god on his lips he blasphemes when in the name of god he resists education and science he blasphemes when in the name of god he opposes freedom of thought and liberty of conscience he blasphemes when in the name of god he robs tortures and kills those who differ from him he blasphemes when in the name of god he opposes the equal rights of all he blasphemes when in the name of god he preaches content to the poor and oppressed ﬂatters the rich and powerful and makes religious tyranny the handmaiden of political privilege he blasphemes and when he takes the bible in his hand and says it was written by the inspiration of god he blasphemes almost beyond giveness who are the blasphemers not we who preach freedom and progress all men but those who try to bind the world with chains of dogma and to burden it in god name with all the foul superstitions of its ignorant past the bir th of christ december 1880 the time draws near the birth of christ tennyson sings in in memoriam and the pious followers of the nazarene will celebrate it with wonted orgies of pleasure the incarnation will be pondered to the accompaniment of roast beef and the atonement will play lambently around the solid richness of and thus will be illustrated the biological truth that the stomach is the basis of everything including religion but while christians comport themselves thus in presence of the subtlest mysteries of faith the sceptic can not be without his peculiar reﬂections he of course knows that the festal observance of this season is far more ancient than christianity but he naturally wonders how people who imagine it to be unique feature of their sublimely spiritual creed remain contented with its extremely sensual character they profess to believ that the fate of the whole human race was decided by the advent of the man of sorrows yet they commemorate that event by an unhealthy consumption of the meat which perisheth and wild indulgence in the frivolous pleasures of that carnal mind which is at enmity with god astonished at such conduct the sceptic muses on the inconsistency of mankind he may also once more consider the circumstances of the birth of christ and its relation to the history of the modern world jesus called the christ is popularly supposed to have been of the seed of david from which it was promised that the messiah should come it is however perfectly clear that he was in related to the man after god own heart his putative father joseph admittedly had share in bringing him into the world he disdained the assistance of father althou gh he was unable to dispense with that of mother but joseph and not mary according to the genealogies of matthew and luke was the distant blood relation of david and therefore jesus was not of the seed of arrows of freethought by foote https house but bastard slip grafted on the ancient by the holy ghost it is great pity that newspaper correspondents did not exist in those days had joseph been skilfully interviewed it is highly probable that the world would have been initiated into his domestic secrets and enlightened to the paternity of mary eldest son the holy ghost is rather too shadowy personage to be the father of lusty boy and young lady would be credit ed in this age if she ascribed to him the authorship of child born out of wedlock most assuredly magistrate would make an order against him its main tenance even father of the spiritualist persuasion who believed in what is grandly called the materialisation of spirit forms would probably be more than dubious if his daughter were to present him with grandson whose father lived on the other side of death and resided in mansion not made with hands it is we repeat to be ever regretted that poor joseph has not left his version of the affair the immaculate conception might perhaps have been cleared up and theology relieved of mystery which has unfortunately perverted not few minds the birth of jesus was announced to wise men from the east by the appear ance of singular star is not this relic of astrology well does byron ye stars which are the poetry of heaven if in your bright beams we would read the fate of men and empires is to be forgiven that in our aspirations to be great our destinies their mortal state and claim kindred with you ye are beauty and mystery and create in us such love and reverence from afar that fortune fame power life have named themselves star but this star was the most wonderful on record it went before the wise men and stood over where the young child was such an absurdity could be related and credited only by people who conceived of the sky solid vault not far distant wherein all the heavenly bodies were stuck the present writer once asked an exceedingl y ignorant and simple man where he thought he would alight if he dropped from the comet then in the sky oh said he naming the open space nearest his own residence somewhere about finsbury circus that man astronomical notions were very imperfect but they were quite good those of the person who seriously wrote and of the persons who seriously believe this fairy tale of the star which heralded the birth of christ luke version of the episode differs widely from matthew he makes reference to wise men from the east but simply says that certain shepherds of the same country who kept watch over their ﬂock by night were visited by the angel of the lord and told that they would ﬁnd the savior christ the lord just born at bethlehem the city of david wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in manger luke does not is generally supposed represent mary conﬁned in stable because joseph was too poor to pay decent accommodation but because there was room them in the inn it is perfectly consisten t with all the gospel references to joseph status to assume that he carried on ﬂourishing business and jesus himself in later years might doubtless have earned good living in the concern if he had not deliberately preferred to lead the life of mendicant preacher this however is by the way our point is that luke says nothing about the star or the wise men from the east who had an important interview with herod himself while matthew says nothing about the mang er or the shepherds and their angelic visitors surely these discrepancies on points so important and to which there could be little mistake are enough to throw discredit on the whole story it is further noticeable that luke is absolutely silent about herod massacre of the innocents what can we think of his reticence on such subject had the massacre occurred it would have been widely known and the memory of so horrible deed would have been vivid generations matthew or whoever wrote the gospel which bears his name is open to suspicion his mind was distorted by an intense belief in prophecy subject which old bishop south said either ﬁnds man cracked or leaves him so after narrating the story of herod massacre he adds then was fulﬁlled that which was spoken by jeremy the prophet saying etc now he makes similar reference to prophecy less than ﬁve times in the ﬁrst two chapters and in each case we ﬁnd that the prophetical utterance referred to has not the faintest connexion with the incident related besides man who writes history with one eye on his own period and the other on period centuries anterior is not likely to be veracious however earnestly he may intend to there is an arrows of freethought by foote https which is strong any statement about the history of the primitive church that matthew gospel was originally written in hebrew and it has been supp osed that the writer gratuitously threw in these references to jeremy and others in order to please the jews who were extremely fond of prophecy but this supposition is equally fatal to his credibility an historian in any case the evangelists differ so widely on matters of such interest and importance that we are constrained to discredit their story it is evidently scholarship reveals fairy tale which slowly gathered round the memory of jesus after his death some of its elements were creations of his disciples fancy but others were borrowed from the mythology of more ancient creeds yet this fairy tale is accepted by hundreds of millions of men veritable history it is incorporated into the foundation of christianity and every year at this season its incidents are joyously commemorated how slowly the world of intelligence moves but let us not despair science and scholarship have already done much to sap belief in this supernatural religion and we may trust them to still more they will ultimately destroy its authority by refuting its pretensions and compel it to take its place among the general multitude of historic faiths if jesus was the christ the messiah the deliverer why is the world still so full of sin and misery the redeemer has come say the christians yes we reply but when will come the redemption apostrophising jesus in his lines before cruciﬁx swinburne reminds him that the nineteenth wave of the ages rolls now usward since thy birth began and then inquires hast thou fed full men souls or are there less oppressions done in this wide world under the sun only negative answer can be given christ has in wise redeemed the world he was god of power but weak fallible man like ourselves and his cry of despair on the cross might now be repeated with tenfold force the older myth of prometheus is truer and more inspiring than the myth of christ if there be gods they have never yielded man aught of their grace all his possessions have been cunningly patiently and valorously extorted from the powers that be even prometheus ﬁlched the ﬁre from heaven in that realm of mythology whereto all religions will eventually be consigned jesus will dwindle beneath prometheus one is feminine and typiﬁes resigned submission to supernatural will the other is masculine and typiﬁes that insur gent audacity of heart and head which has wrested kingdom of science from the vast empire of nescience and strewed the world with the wrecks of theological power the reign of christ january 1880 christmas and easter are fruitful in panegyrics on jesus and the religion which fraudulently bears his name on these occasions not only the religious but even the secular newspapers give the rein to their rhetoric and imagination and indulge in much fervid eloquence on the birth or the cruciﬁxion of the nazarene platitudes are brought out from their and dexterously moved to tune and fallacies which have been refuted ad nauseam are paraded afresh though their logical purity were still beyond suspicion papers that differ on all other occasions and on all other subjects concur then and when they agree their unanimity is wonderful while the more sober and orthodox discourse in tones beﬁtting their dignity and repute the more profane riotously join in the chorus and not to be behind the rest the notoriously misbelieving greatest circulator orders from the profanest member of its staff rousing article on the cruciﬁxion or on the birth of jesus the case may be all this however is of small account except an indication of the slavery of our independent journals to bumble and his prejudices before whom they are obliged to masquerade when he ordains celebration of his social or religious rites but here and there more serious voice is heard through the din with an accent of earnest veracity and not that of an actor playing part such voice may be worth listening to and certainly other can be let us hear the rev baldwin brown on the reign of christ he is i believe honorably distinguished among dissenters his sermons often bear marks of originality and the goodness of his arrows of freethought by foote https may be thought of the strength of his head is sufﬁciently attested by his emphatic revolt against the doctrine of eternal torture in hell before criticising brown sermon in detail i can not help remarking that it is far too rhetorical and far too empty of argument sentimentality is the bane of religion in our day subservience to popularity degrades the pulpit it degrades the press if we desire to ﬁnd the language of reason in theology we must seek it in the writings of such men newman who contemplate the ignorant and passionate multitude with mingled pity and disdain the advanced school of theologians from dean stanley to the humblest reconciler of reason and faith are sentimentalists almost to man the reason being i take it that although their emotional tendencies are very admirable they lack the intellectual consistency and rigor which impel others to stand on deﬁnite ﬁrst principles sure basis of operation and an impregnable citadel against attack brown belongs to this advanced school and has liberal share of its failings he is full of eloquent passages that lead to nothing and he excites expectations which are seldom if ever satisﬁed he faces stupendou s obstacles raised by reason against his creed and just we look to see him valiantly surmount them we ﬁnd that he veils them from base to summit with dense cloud of words out of which his voice is heard asking us to believe him on the other side yet of all men professional students of the bible should be freest from such fault seeing what magniﬁcent masterpiece it is of terse and vigorous simplicity brown and his advanced friends would well to ponder that quaint and pregnant aphorism of old bishop waste words addle questions when i ﬁrst read it i was thrown into convulsions of laughter and even now it tickles my risibility but despite its irresistible i can not but regard it one of the wisest and pithiest sentences in our literature newman has splendidly ampliﬁed it in passage of his university sermons which i gratuitously present to brown and every reader who can make use of it half the controversies in the world are verbal ones and could they be brought to plain issue they would be brought to prompt termination parties engaged in them would then perceive either that in substance they agreed together or that their difference was one of ﬁrst principles this is the great object to be aimed at in the present age though confessedly very arduous one we need not dispute we need not prove need but deﬁne at all events let us if we can this ﬁrst of all and then see who are left us to dispute with and what is left us to prove brown sermon on the reign of christ is preached from verse of paul ﬁrst epistle to timothy wherein jesus is styled the blessed and only potentate from this inspired statement he derives inﬁnite consolation this he admits is far from being the best of all possible worlds it is full of strife and cruelty the wail of anguish and the clamor of frenzy but christ is the blessed and only potentate moral order will ﬁnally be evolved from the chaos and good be triumphant over evil now the question arises who made the chaos and who is responsible the evil not christ of course brown will not allow that is it the devil then oh to say that would be blasphemy against god he admits however that the notion has largely prevailed and has even been formulated into religious creeds that malignant spirit spirit who loves cursing god loves blessing has large and independent share in the government of the world but he adds in christendom men dare not say that they believe it with the throne of the cruciﬁed and risen christ revealed in the apocalypse to their gaze ordinary people will rub their eyes in sheer amazement at this cool assertion is it not plain that christians in all ages have believed in the power and subtlety of the devil god sleepless antagonist have they not held and they not still hold that he caused the fall of adam and eve and thus introduced original sin which was certain to infect the whole human race ever afterwards until the end of time was not john milton christian and did he not in his paradise lost develope all the phases of that portentous competition between the celestial and infernal powers the virtual possession of this world and lordship over the destinies of our race if we accept brown statements we shall have to reverse history and belie the evidence of our senses but who is responsible the moral chaos and the existence of evil that is the question if to say christ is absurd and to say the devil blasphemy what alternative is left the usual answer is man freewill christ the blessed and only potentate leaves us liberty of action and our own evil passions cause all the misery of our lives but who gave us our evil passions to this question answer is vouchsafed and so we are left exactly at the point from which we started yet brown has very decided opinion to the part these evil passions play in the history cf mankind he refers to them the devil brood of lust and lies and wrongs and hates and murderous passion and insolent power which through all the ages of earth sad history have made it liker hell arrows of freethought by foote https atheist could use stronger language brown even believes that our insur gent lusts and passions are predetermining causes of heresy so that in respect both to faith and to works they achieve our damnation how then did we come by them the evolutionist frankly answers the question without fear of blasphemy on the one hand or of moral despair on the other brown is bound to give his answer after raising the question so vividly but he will not he urges that it presents points of tremendous difﬁculty although we shall unravel the myste ry we shall solve the problems in god good time thus the solution of the problem is to be postponed until we are dead when it will longer interest us howe ver convenient this may be the teachers of mystery it is most unsatisfactory to rationalists brown must also be reminded that the tremendous difﬁculties he alludes to are all of his own creation there is difﬁculty about any fact except in relation to some theory it is brown theory of the universe which creates the difﬁculties it does not account all the facts of existenc it is logically contravened by the most conspicuous and persistent of them instead of modifying or transforming his theory into accordance with the facts he rushes off with it into the of faith there let him remain he has perfect right to our objection is neither to reason nor to faith but to mischievous playing fast and loose with both brown opines that christ will reign until all his enemies are under his feet and who are these enemies not the souls of men says brown christ loves them with an inﬁnite tenderness this inﬁnite tenderness is clearly not allied to inﬁnite power or the world anguish would long since have been appeased and extinguished or never have been permitted to exist at all the real enemies of christ are not the souls of men but the hates and passions which torment them oh those hates and passions they are the dialectical balls with which brown goes through his performance in that circle of petitio principii so hated by all logicians the middle sphere of intellects too light the solid earth of fact and too gross the aerial heaven of imagination it will be ﬁtting conclusion to present to brown very serious matter which he has overlooked christ the blessed and only potentate came on earth and originated the universal religion nearly two thousand years ago up to the present time of the world inhabitants are outside its pale and more than half of them have never heard it preached amongst the quarter which nominally professes christianity disbelief is spreading more rapidly than the missionaries succeed in converting the heathen so that the reign of christ is being restricted instead of increased to ask us despite this to believe that he is god and possessed of inﬁnite power is to ask us to believe marvel compared with which the wildest fables are credible and the most extravagant miracles but dust in the balance the prima on modern infidelity september 1880 bishop once twitted curate with preaching indifferent orthodoxy well answered the latter i see how you can expect to be orthodox yourself i believe at the rate of hundred year and you at the rate of ten thousand in the spirit of this anecdote we should expect an archbishop to be orthodox the frailty of human nature will allow man who faithfully believes at the rate of ﬁfteen thousand year should be able to swallow most things and stick at very little and there can be doubt that the canny scotchman who has climbed or wriggled up to the archbishopric of canterbury is prepared to go any lengths his salary may require we suspect that he regards the doctrines of the church very much did that irreverent youth mentioned by sidney smith who on being asked to sign the articles replied oh yes forty if you like the clean linen of his theology is immaculately pure never has he fallen under suspicion of entertaining dangerous or questionable opinions and he has in remarkable degree that faculty praised by saint paul of being all things to all men or at least many men make lumping majority what else could be expected from scotchman who has mounted to the spiritual primacy of england arrows of freethought by foote https grace has recently been visiting the clergy and churchwardens of his diocese and delivering what are called char ges to them the third of these was on the momentous subject of modern inﬁdelity which seems to have greatly exercised his mind this horrid inﬂuence is found to be very prevalent much to the disconcertion of his grace who felt constrained to begin his char ge with expressions of despondency and only recovered his spirits towards the end where he conﬁdently relies on the gracious promise of christ never to forsake his darling church some of the admissions he makes are worth i can he says have doubt that the aspect of christian society in the present day is somewhat troubled that the church of christ and the faith of christ are passing through great trial in all regions of the civilised world and not least among ourselves there are dark clouds on the horizon already breaking which may speedily burst into violent storm it is well to note in history how these two and and react in strengthening each other still i can not doubt that the most more formidable of the two us at present is inﬁdelity it is indeed frightful thought that numbers of our intelligent mechanics seem to be alienated from all religious ordinances that our secularist halls are well ﬁlled that there is an active propagandism at work shaking belief in all creeds these facts are of course patent but it is something to get an archbishop to acknowledge them his grace also ﬁnds from above in the regions of literature and art efforts to degrade mankind by denying our high original the high original being we presume certain simple pair called adam and eve who damned themselves and nearly the whole of their posterity by eating an apple six thousand years ago the degradation of denial of this theory is hardly perceptible to untheological eyes most candid minds would prefer to believe in darwin rather than in moses even if the latter had which he has not single leg to stand on the theory of our simian origin at least involves progression in the past and perhaps salvation in the future of our race while the high original theory involved our retrogression and perdition his grace wonders how these persons can conﬁne their hopes and aspirations to life which is so irresistibly hastening to its speedy conclusion but surely he is aware that they so the very simple reason that they know nothing of any other life to hope about or aspire to one bird in the hand is worth twenty in the bush when the bush itself remains obstinately invisible and if properly cooked is worth all the dishes in the world ﬁlled only with expectations his grace likewise refers to the unequal distribution of worldly goods to the poverty and misery which exist notwithstanding all attempts to regenerate society by specious schemes of socialistic reorganisation it is of course very natural that an archbishop in the enjoyment of vast income should stigmatise these specious schemes distributing more equitably the good things of this world but the words blessed be ye poor go ill to the tune of ﬁfteen thousand year and there is grim irony in the fact that palaces are tenanted by men who profess to represent and preach the gospel of him who had not where to lay his head modern christianity has been called civilised heathenism with less justice it might be called an organised hypocrisy after dolorous complaint to the magazines lying everywhere the use of our sons and daughters in which the doctrines both of natural and of revealed religio n are assailed the archbishop proceeds to deal with the ﬁrst great form of inﬁdelity namely agnosticism with feeble attempt at wit he remarks that the name itself implies confession of ignorance which he marvels to ﬁnd unaccompanied by the logical result of philosophical humilit y fair account of the agnostic position is then given after which it is severely observed that the better feelings of man contradict these sophisms in proof of this his grace cites the fact that in paris the stronghold of atheistical philosophy the number of burials that take place without religious rites is scarcely appreciable percentage we suspect the accuracy of this statement but having statistics on the subject by us we are not prepared to dispute it we will assume its truth but the important question then kind of persons are those who dispense with the rites of religion notoriously they are men of the highest intellect and character whose quality far outweighs the quantity of the other side they are the leaders of action and thought and what they think and will be thought and done by the masses when man like gambetta occupying such high position and wielding such immense inﬂuence invariably declines to enter church whether he attends the marriage or the funeral of his friends we are entitled to say that his example on our side is inﬁnitely more important than the practice of millions who are creatures of habit and the most part blind followers of tradition the archbishop argument tells against arrows of freethought by foote https position and the fact he cites when closely examined proves more our side than he thought it proved his own atheism is disrelished by his grace even more than agnosticism his favorite epithet it is dogmatic surely he cries the boasted enlightenment of this century will never tolerate the gross ignorance and arrogant which presumes to dogmatise to things confessedly beyond its ken quite so but that is what the theologians are perpetually doing to use matthew arnold happy expression they talk familiarly about god though he were man living in the next street the atheist and the agnostic confess their inability to fathom the universe and profess doubts to the ability of others yet they are called dogmatic arrogant and on the other hand the theologians claim the power of seeing through nature up to nature god yet they forsooth must be accounted modest humble and retiring wad some pow r the giftie gie us to see oursels ithers see us these abominable atheists are by means scarce says his grace practical atheists we have everywhere if atheism be the denial of god just so that is precisely what we inﬁdels have been saying years christianity is utterly alien to the life of modern society and in ﬂagrant contradiction to the spirit of our secular progress it stands outside all the institutions of our material civilisation its churches still echo the old strains of music and the old dogmatic tones from the pulpit but the worshippers themselves feel the anomaly of its doctrines and rites when they return to their secular avocations the sunday does nothing but break the continuity of their lives steeping them in sentiments and ideas which have relation to their experience during the rest of the week the profession of christendom is one thing its practice is another god is simply acknowledged with the lips on sunday and on every other day profoundly disregarded in all the pursuits of life whether of business or of pleasure even in our national legislature although the practice of prayer is still retained any man would be sneered at fool who made the least appeal to the sanctions of theology an allusion to the sermon on the mount would provoke smile and citation of one of the articles be instantly ruled irrelevant nothing from the top to the bottom of our political and social life is done with any reference to those theological doctrines which the nation professes to believe and to the maintenance of which it devotes annually so many millions of its wealth in order to pose any member of the two great divisions of inﬁdelity the archbishop advises his clergy to ask the following rather comical questions you believe nothing which is not capable of being tested by the ordinary rules which govern experience in things natural how then you know that you yourself exist how you know that the perceptions of your senses are not mere delusions and that there is anything outside you answering to what your mind conceive s have you mind and if you have not what is it that enables you to think and reason and fear and hope are these conditions of your being the mere results of your material organism like the headache which springs from indigestion or the high spirits engendered by too much wine are you something better than vegetable highly cultivated or than your brothers of the lower animals and if so what is it that differentiates your superiority why things outside you obey your will who gave you will and if so what is it i think you must allow that intellect is thing almo st divine if there be anything divine and i think also you must allow that it is not thing to be propagated we propagate and cattle whence came alexander the great whence charlemagne and whence the first napoleon was it through mere process of spontaneous generation that they sprang up to alter by their genius and overwhelming will the destinies of the world whence came homer shakespeare bacon whence came all the great historians whence came plato and all the bright lights of divine philosophy of divinity of poetry their inﬂuence after all you must allow to be quite wide and enduring any produced by the masters of those positive material sciences which you worship you think that all these great they are minds and their work was not the product of merely highly organised material the outcome of some system of material genera tion which your called science can subject to rule and teach men how to produce by growth they grow vegetables the archbishop is not very skilful physician his prescription shows that he has not diagnosed the disease these strange questions might strike the inﬁdel all of heap the expressive vernacular has it but although they might dumbfounder him they would assuredly not convince arrows of freethought by foote https archbishop of canterbury were not so exalted personage we should venture to remark that to ask man how he knows that he exists betrays marvellous depth of ignorance or folly ultimate facts of consciousness are not subjects of proof or disproof they are their own warranty and can not be transcended there is besides some thing extraordinary in an archbishop of the church to which berkeley belonged supposing that extreme idealism follows only the rejection of deity whether the senses are after all delusory does not matter to the atheist straw they are real enough to him they make his world in which he lives and moves and it is of practical consequence whether they mirror an outer world or not what differentiates you from the lower animals asks his grace the answer is higher development of nervous structure who gave you will is just sensible question who gave you nose we have every reason to believe that both can be accounted on natural grounds without introducing supernatural donor the question whether alexander napoleon homer bacon and shakespeare came through process of spontaneous generation is excruciatingly ludicrous that process could only produce the very lowest form of organism and not wonderfully complex being like man who is the product of an incalculable evolution but the archbishop did not perhaps intend this it may be that in his haste to silence the inﬁdel he stumbled over his own meaning lastly there is remarkable naïveté in the aside of the ﬁnal they are minds he should have added you know and then the episode would have been delightfully complete the assumption of the whole point at issue in an innocent parenthesis is perhaps to be expected from pulpiteer but it is not likely that the inﬁdel will be caught by such simple stratagem all these questions are so irrelevant and absurd that we doubt whether his grace would have the courage to put one of them to any sceptic across table or indeed from any place in the world except the pulpit which is beyond all risk of attack and whence man may ask any number of questions without the least fear of hearing one of them answered the invitation given by his grace to descend to the harder ground of strictest logical argumentation is very appropriate whether the movement be ascending or descending there is undoubtedly vast distance between logical argumentation and anything he has yet advanced but even on the harder ground the archbishop treads more ﬁrmly he demands to know how the original protoplasm became endowed with life and if that question can not be answered he calls upon us to admit his theory of divine agency though that made the subject more intelligible supernatural hypotheses are but refuges of ignorance earl beaconsﬁeld in his impish way once remarked that where knowledge ended religion began and the archbishop of canterbury seems to share that opinion his grace also avers that one has ever yet been able to refute the argument necessitating great first cause it is very easy to assert this but rather difﬁcu lt to maintain it one assertion is good another and we shall therefore content ourselves with saying that in our opinion the argument great first cause was to mention only one name completely demolished by john stuart mill who showed it to be based on total misconception of the nature of cause and effect which apply only to phænomenal changes and not to the apparently unchangeable matter and force of which the universe is composed but the overwhelming last argument is that man has something in him which speaks of god of something above this ﬂeeting world and rules of right and wrong have their foundation elsewhere than in man opinion that there is an immutable eternal distinction between right and that there is god who is on the side of right again we must complain of unbounded assertion every point of this rhetorical ﬂourish is disputed by inﬁdels who are not likely to yield to anything short of proof if god is on the side of right he is singularly incapable of maintaining it in this world at least according to some penetrating minds the devil has hitherto had it pretty much his own way and good men have had to struggle very hard to make things even equitable we ﬁnd them but after all says his grace the supreme defence of the church against the assaults of inﬁdelity is christ himself weak in argument the clergy must throw themselv es behind his shield and trust in him before his brightness the mists which rise from gross materialistic atheism evaporate and are scattered like the clouds of night before the dawn it is useless to oppose reason to such preaching this we shall therefore simply retort the archbishop epithets gross and materialistic are just the terms to describe religion which trafﬁcs in blood and declares that without the shedding of it there is remission of sin whose ascetic doctrines malign our purest affections and deﬁle the sweetest fountains of our spiritual health whose heaven is nothing but an exaggerated jeweller shop and its hell den of torture in which god punishes his children the consequences of his own ignorance incapacity or arrows of freethought by foote https bishop february 1880 bishops should speak men having authority and not the scribes and pharisees even the smallest of them should be great man an archbishop with ﬁfteen thousand year ought to possess transcendent intellect almost beyond comprehension while the worst paid of all the reverend fathers of the church with less than ﬁfth of that salary ought to possess common powers of mind the bishop of carlisle is not rich bishops go but he enjoy s yearly income of besides the patronage of livings now this quite equals the salary of the prime minister of the greatest empire in the world and the bishop of carlisle should therefore be truly great man we regret however to say that he is very much the reverse if we may judge from newspaper report which has reached us of his lecture on man place in nature recently delivered before the keswick scientiﬁc and literary society newspaper reports we know are often misleading in consequence of their summ ary character nevertheless two columns of small type must give some idea of discourse however abstruse or profound here and there if such occured ﬁne thought or shrewd observation would shine through the densest veil yet unless our vision be exceptionally obtuse nothing of the kind is apparent in this report of the bishop lecture being his lordship confessed the development of sermon delivered to the men at the royal agricultural society show last summer the lecture was perhaps like the sermon adapted to the bucolic mind and thus does meagre justice to the genius of its author his lordship however chose to read it before society with some pretentions to culture and therefore such plea cann ot avail the case stands we are constrained to accuse the bishop of having delivered lecture on question of supreme importance which would little credit to the president of young men christian association and when we reﬂect that parson occupied the chair at the meeting and that the vote of thanks to the episcopal lecturer was moved by canon who coupled with it some highly complimentary remarks we are obliged to think the church more short of brains than even we had previously believed and that mene mene tekel upharsin has already been written on its temple walls by the ﬁnger of doom very early in his lecture the bishop observed that the scriptures are built on the hypothesis of the supreme and unique position of man well there is nothing novel in this statement what we want is some proof of the hypothesis his lordship way of supplying this need is to say the least peculiar after saying that he would rather trust the poet an exponent of man than he would student of natural history he proceeds to quote from shakespeare pope and plato and ends that part of his argument with rhetorical ﬂourish though he had thus really settled the whole case of darwin versus moses our reverence of great poets is probably deep and sincere the bishop but we never thought of treating them scientiﬁc authorities or witnesses to events that happened hundreds of thousands of years before their birth poets deal with subjective facts of consciousness or with objective facts related to these the dry light of the intellect radiated from the cloudless sun of truth is not their proper element but belongs exclusively to the man of science they move in softer element suffused with emotion whose varied clouds are by the sun of imagination touched to all forms of beauty and splendor the scientiﬁc man description of lion instance would be very different from poet because the one would describe the lion it is in itself and the other it affects us living whole through our organs of sight and sound both are true because each is faithful to its purpose and expresses fact yet neither can stand the other because they express different facts and are faithful to different purposes shakespeare poetically speaks of the ruddy drops that visit this sad heart but the scientiﬁc truth of the circulation of the blood had to await its harvey in like manner it was not milton but newton who expounded the cosmos the great poet like dante before him wove cosmical ideas into the texture of his sublime epic while the great scientist wove all the truth of them into the texture of his sublime theory let each receive his meed of reverent praise but not let us appeal to newton on poetry or to milton on physics and when bishop of carlisle or other diocese complains that the views advanced by scientiﬁc men tend painfu lly to degrade the views of poets and philosophers let arrows of freethought by foote https that in almost every case the great truths of science have been found to transcend inﬁnitely the marvels of theology and that the magniﬁcence of song persists through all ﬂuctuations of knowledge because its real cause lies less in the subject than in the native grandeur of the poet mind man place in nature is indeed great question and it can be settled only by wide appeal to past and present facts and those facts besides being objective realities must be treated in purely scientiﬁc and not in poetic or didactic spirit let the poet sing the beauty of consummate ﬂower and if such things are required let the moralist preach its lessons but neither should arrogate the prerogative of the botanist whose special function it is to inform us of its genesis and development and its true relations to other forms of vegetable life so with man the poet may celebrate his passions and aspirations his joys and sorrows his laughter and tears and ever body forth anew the shapes of things unseen the moralist may employ every fact of his life to illustrate its laws or to enforce its duties but they must leave it to the biologist to explain his position in the animal economy and the stages by which it has been reached with regard to that darwin is authoritative while moses is not even entitled to hearing although the bishop is very ready to quote from the poets he is not always ready to use them fairly instance he cites the splendid and famous passage in hamlet w hat piece of work is man how noble in reason how inﬁnite in faculties in form and moving how express and admirable in action how like an angel in apprehension how like god the beauty of the world the paragon of animals there his lordship stops and then exclaims shakespe are knew nothing of the evolution of man from inferior forms but why did he not continue the quotation hamlet goes on to say and yet what to is this quintessence of dust how now your lordship we have you on the hip quintessence of dust comes perilously near to evolution does not your lordship remember too hamlet pursuing the dust of cæsar to the ignominious bunghole and have you never reﬂected how the prescient mind of shakespeare created an entirely new and wonderful ﬁgure in literature the caliban with his god truly marvellous resuscitation of primitive man that in our day has inspired browning caliban on setebos which contains the entire essence of all that tylor and other investigators in the same ﬁeld have since written on the subject of animism it seems that the lord bishop of carlisle reads even the poets to small purpose haughtily waving the biologists aside his lordship proceeds to remark that man superiority is not the same that dog would claim over lobster or an eagle over worm the difference between man and other animals being not one of degree but of kind such stateme nt without the least evidence being adduced to support it places the bishop almost outside the pale of civil discussion when will these lordly ecclesiastics learn that the time dogmatic assertion is past and that the intellectual temper of the present age can be satisﬁed only by proof we defy the bishop of carlisle to indicate single phase of man nature which has parallel in the lower animals man physical structure is notoriously akin to theirs and even his brain does not imply distinction of kind every convolution of the brain of man is reproduced in the brain of the higher apes his lordship draws distinction between instinct and reason which is purely fanciful and evinces great ignorance of the subject that however is question we have at present room to discuss nor indeed is there any necessity to so since his lordship presently admits that the lower animals share our reason to some extent just to much larger extent we share their instinct and thus evacuates the logical fortress he took such pains to construct quitting that ground which proves too slippery his feet the bishop goes on to notice the moral and aesthetic difference between man and the lower animals anima l says his lordship shows anything approaching to love of art now we are quite aware that animal except man ever painted picture or chiselled statue these things involve very high development of the artistic faculty but the appreciation of form and color which is the foundation of all ﬁne art is certainly manifested by the lower animals and by some fathem to an extreme degree if his lordship doubts this let him study the ways of animals himself or if he can not that let him read the chapters in darwin descent of man on sexual selection among birds if he retains any doubt after that we must conclude that his head is too hard or too soft to be inﬂuenced in either of which cases he is much to be pitied his lordship thinks that the moral sense is entirely absent in the lower animals this however is absurdly untrue so much so indeed that we shall not trouble to refute it good and noble he avers are epithets inapplicable to animals even to the horse or dog what vain creat ures men are to arrows of freethought by foote https does his lordship remember byron epitaph on his newfoundland dog and the very uncomplimentary distinction drawn therein between dogs and men look at that big pet with the lordly yet tender eye how he submits to the boisterous caresses of children because he knows their weakness and shares their spirit of play let their elders the same and he will at once show resentment see him peril his life ungrudgingly those he loves or even comparative strangers and shall we deny him the epithet of noble or good whatever theologians may say the sound heart of common men and women will answer lastly we are told that the religious sentiment is characteristically and supremely human but here again we must complain of his lordship mental confusion the religious sentiment is not simple but highly complex emotion resolve it into its elemental feelings and it will be found that all these are possessed in some degree by lower animals the feeling of dog who bays the moon is probably very similar to that of the savage who cowers and moans beneath an eclipse and if the savage has superstitious ideas well awesome feelings it is only because he possesses higher development of thought and imagination canon battersby who moved the vote of thanks to the bishop ridiculed the biologists and likened them to topsy who accounted her existence by saying specs i growed just so that is precisely how we all did come into existence growth and not making is the law man well every other form of life moses stand s manufacture and darwin stands growth and if the great biologist ﬁnds himself in the company of topsy he will not mind perhaps indeed he is said to enjoy joke and to be able to crack one might he jocularly observe to tremendous personages like the bishop of carlisle that this is not the ﬁrst instance of truth s being hidden from the wise and revealed unto babes professor flint on atheism january 1877 professor flint delivered last week the ﬁrst of the present year course of baird lectures to numerous audience in blythswood church glasgow taking his subject the theories opposed to theism he said is more general now than atheism and includes all systems opposed to theism atheism he deﬁned the system which teaches that there is god and that it is impossible man to know that there is god at least this is how professor flint is reported in the newspapers although we hope he was not guilty of so idiotic jumble where are the atheists who say there is god what are their names having mingled much with thoroughgoing sceptics and read many volumes of heretical literature we can conﬁdently defy professor flint to produce the names of half dozen dogmatic atheists and we will give him the whole world literature to select from does he think that the brains of an atheist are addled if not why does he make the atheist ﬁrst afﬁrm that there is god and then afﬁrm the impossibility of man ever knowing whether there is god or not how could man who holds his judgment in suspense or who thinks the universal mystery insoluble to us dogmatise upon the question of god existence if professor flint will carefully and candidly study sceptical literature he will ﬁnd that the dogmatic atheist is rare the phoenix and that those who consider the extant evidences of theism inadequate not go on to afﬁrm an universal negative but content themselves with expressing their ignorance of nature why the most part they endorse thomas cooper words i not say there is god but this i say i know not of course this modesty of afﬁrmation may seem impiously immodest to one who has been trained and steeped in theism so long that the inﬁnite universe has become quite explicable to him but to the sceptic it seems more wise and modest to confess one ignorance than to make false pretensions of knowledge professor flint characterised the objections which atheism urges against the existence of god extremely feeble against the existence of what god there be gods many and lords many which of the long theological list is to be selected the god god like everything else from the heights to the depths can be known only by his attributes and what the atheist does is not to argue against the existence of any god which would be sheer lunacy but to take the attributes afﬁrmed by arrows of freethought by foote https composing its deity and inquire whether they are compatible with each other and with the facts of life finding that they are not the atheist simply sets theism aside not proven and goes on his way without further afﬂicting himself with such abstruse questions the atheist must be very dreary creature thinks professor flint but why does he know any atheists and has he found them one half dreary scotch calvinists it may seem hard to the immoderately selﬁsh that some inﬁnite spirit is not looking after their little interests but it is assuredly thousandfold harder to think that this inﬁnite spirit has yawning hell ready to engulph the vast majority of the world miserable sinners if the atheist has heaven he has also hell which is most merciful relief far better were universal annihilation than that even the meanest life should writhe ever in hell gnawed by the worm which never dieth and burnt in the ﬁre which is never quenched even nature thinks professor flint can not be contemplated by the athe ist the theist contemplates it while the latter views it god vesture wherewith he hides from us his intolerable glory the latter views it the mere embodiment of force senseless aimless pitiless an enormous mechanism grinding on of itself from age to age but towards god and good here we must observe that the lecturer trespasses beyond the truth the atheist does not afﬁrm that nature drives on to god and good he simply says he knows not whither she is driving and how many theists are there who think of god in the presence of nature who see god smile in the sunshine or hear his wrath in the storm very few we opine in this practical sceptical age to the atheist to the theist indeed to all blessed with vision nature is an ever new wonder of majesty and beauty sun moon and stars earth air and sky endure while the generations of men pass and perish but every new generation is warmed lighted nurtured and gladdened by them with most sovereign and perfect impartiality the loveliness and inﬁnite majesty of nature speak to all men of all ages climes and creeds not in her inanimate beauty we ﬁnd fatal objectio ns to the doctrine of wise and bountiful power which overrules her but rather in the multiplied horrors woes and pangs of sentient life when all actual and recorded misery is effaced when intolerable grief corrodes and immedicable despair poisons life when the tears of anguish are assuaged when crime and vice are unknown and unremembered and evil lusts are consumed in the ﬁre of holiness then and then only could we admit that wise and righteous omnipotence rules the universal destinies until then we can not recognise the fatherhood of god but must ﬁnd shelter and comfort in the more efﬁcacious doctrine of the brotherhood of man professor flint concluded his lecture according to the newspaper report thus history bears witness that the declension of religion has ever been the decline of nations because it has ever brought the decay of their moral life and people have achieved noble things only when strongly animated by religious faith all this is very poor stuff indeed to come from learned professor what nation has declined because of relapse from religious belief surely not assyria egypt greece or carthage in the case of rom the decline of the empire was coinci dent with the rise of christianity and the decline of paganism but the roman empire fell abroad mainly from political and not from religious causes every student of history well knows christianity that is the religion of the bible has been dying nearly three centuries and during that period instead of witnessing general degradation of mankind we have witnessed marvellous elevation the civilisation of compared with that which existed before secular science began her great battle with tyrannous and obscurantist church is summer morn to star winter night again it is not true that men have achieved noble things only when strongly animated by religious faith unless by religious faith be meant some vital idea or fervent enthusiasm the three hundred spartans who met certain death at thermopylae died religious idea but not theological idea which is very different thing they perished to preserve the integrity of the state to which they belonged the greatest athenians were certainly not religious in professor flint sense of the word and the grand old roman patriots had scarcely scintillation of such religious faith he speaks of their religion was simply patriotism but it was quite operant and effective christian piety has ever been was it religious faith or patriotism which banded frenchmen together in deﬁance of all europe and made them march to death bridegroom hastens to his bride and in our own history have not our greatest achievers of noble things been very indifferent to theological dogmas nay in all ages have not the noblest laborers human welfare been impelled by an urgent enthusiasm of humanity rather than by any supernatural faith professor flint may rest assured that even though all the old faiths ruin and rend the human heart will still burn and arrows of freethought by foote https beauty still gladden the earth although divorced from the creeds whic h held them in the thraldom of an enforced marriage hidden god october 1879 the christian world is distinguished among religious journa ls by certain breadth and vigor on all social and political subjects it is remarkably advanced and outspoken and its treatment of theological questions is far more liberal and intelligent than sceptics would expect of late years it has opened its columns to corresponde nce on many topics some of watery character like the reality of noah ﬂood and others of burning kind like the doctrine of eternal punishment on all of which great freedom of expression has been allowed the editor himself who is we suspect far more sceptical than most of his readers has had his say on the question of hell and it is to be inferred from his somewhat guarded utterance that he has little belief in any such place this however we state with considerable hesitation the majority of christians still regard the doctrine of everlasting torture indubitable and sacred and we have desire to lower him in the estimation of the christian world in which he labors or to cast doubt on the orthodoxy of his creed but the editor will not take it amiss if we insist that his paper is liberal in its christianity and unusually tolerant of unbelief yet while entitled to praise on his ground the christian world deserves something else than praise on another it has recently published series of articles the purpose of stimulating faith and allaying doubt if undertaken by competent writer able and willing to face the mighty difference between christianity and the scientiﬁc spirit of our age such series of articles might be well worth reading we might then admire if we could not agree and derive beneﬁt from friendly contact with an antagonist mind but the writer selected the task appears to possess neither of these qualiﬁcations instead of thinking he gushes instead of reason he suppli es us with unlimited sentiment we expect to tread solid ground or at least to ﬁnd it not perilously soft and lo the soil is moist and now and then we ﬁnd ourselves up to the knees in unctuous mud how difﬁcult it is nowadays to discover really argumen tative christian the eminent favorites of orthodoxy write sentimental romances and call them lives of christ and preach sermons with conceivable relation to the human intellect while the apologists of faith imitate the tactics of the and when pursued cast out their opaque ﬂuid of sentimentality to conceal their position they mostly dabble in the shallows of scepticism never daring to venture in the deeps and what they take pride in ﬂashes of spiritual light resembles neither the royal gleaming of the sun nor the milder radiance of the moon but rather the phosphorescence of corruption in the last article of the series referred to entitled thou art god that hidest thyself there is an abundance of ﬁctitious emotion and spurious rhetoric from beginning to end there is painful strain that never relaxes reminding us of singers who pitch their voices too high and have to render all the upper notes in falsetto an attempt is made to employ poetical imagery but it ludicrously fails the heaven of the book of revelation with its gold and silver and precious stones is nothing but magniﬁed jeweller shop and study of it has inﬂuenced the style of later writers at present christian gushers have descended still lower dealing not even in gold and jewels but in brummagem and paste the word gem is greatly in vogue talmage uses it about twenty times in every lecture parker delights in it and it often ﬁgures on the pages of serious books in the article before us it is made to frequent service promise of redemption is represen ted shining like on the brow of revelation elims gem the dark bosom of the universal desert and the morning gleams on the earth perhaps good recipe this kind of composition would be an hour gloat on the ﬂaming window of jeweller shop in the west end but let us deal with the purport and purpose of the article it aims at showing that god hides himself and why he does so the fact which it is attempted to explain none will deny moses ascended mount sinai to see god and converse with him abraham and god walked and talked together and according to paul the almighty is not far from any one of us but the modern arrows of freethought by foote https not prone to believe these things the empire of reason has been enlar ged at the expense of faith whose provinces have one after another been annexed until only small territory is left her and that she ﬁnds it difﬁcult to keep coincidently god has become less and less reality and more and more dream the reign of law is perceived everywhere and all classes of phenomena may be explained without recourse to supernatural power when napoleon objected to laplace that divine design was omitted from his mechanical theory of the universe the french philosopher characteristically replied i had need of that hypothes is and the same disposition prevails in other departments of science darwin instance underta kes to explain the origin and development of man physical intellectual and moral without assuming any cause other than those which obtain wherever life exists god is being slowly but surely driven from the domain of intermediate causes and transformed into an ultimate cause mere ﬁgment of the imagination he is being banished from nature into that poetical region inhabited by the gods of polytheism to keep company there with jupiter and apollo and neptune and juno and venus and all the rest of that glorious pantheon he longer rules the actual life and struggle of the world but lives at peace with his old rivals the lucid interspace of world and world where never creeps cloud or moves wind nor ever falls the least white star of snow nor ever lowest roll of thunder moans nor sound of human sorrow mounts to mar their sacred everlasting calm tennyson lucretius the essence of all this is admitted by the writer in the christian world he admits the facts but denies the inference they show us one of god ways of hiding himself order prevails but it is the expression of god will and not mere result of the working of material forces he operates by method not by caprice and hence the unchanging stability of things while doing nothing in particular he does everything in general and this idea must be extended to human history god endows man with powers and allows him freedom to employ them he will but strangely enough god has way of ruling our freedom and always there is restraining and restoring hand how man will can be free and yet overruled passes our merely carnal understanding although it may be intelligible enough to minds steeped in the mysteries of theology according to this writer god government of mank ind is constitutional kingdom quite so it was once arbitrary and despotic now it is far milder and less exacting having dwindled into the constitutional stage wherein the king reigns but does not govern will the law of human growth and divine decay stop here we think not the despotism has changed to constitutional monarchy so that will change to republic and the empty throne be preserved among other curious relics of the past god also hides himself in history although unapparent on the surface of events his spirit is potent within them what the writer asks is all its dark passages of horror its stormy revolutions its ceaseless conﬂict its tears its groans its the chronicle of an widening realm of light of order of intelligence wisdom truth and charity but if we admit the progress we need not explain it the work of god bunsen wrote book on god in history which profane wag said should have been called bunsen in history yet his attempt to justify the ways of god to men was not very successful it is simply mockery to ask us to believe that the slow progress of humanity must be attributed to omniscient omnipotence god who can evolve virtue and happiness only out of inﬁnite evil and misery and elevate us only through the agency of perpetual blood and tears is scarcely being to be loved and worshipped unless we assume that his power and wisdom are exceedingly limited are we to suppose that god has woven himself garment of violence evil and deceit in order that we might not see too clearly his righteousness goodness and truth it must further be observed that christian theists can not be permitted to ascribe all the good in the world to god and all the evil to man or else leave it absolutely unexplained in the name of humanity we protest against this indignity to our race let god be responsible good and evil both or neither and if man is to consider himself chargeable with all the world wrong he should at least be allowed credit all the compensating good the theory of evolution is being patronised by theists rather too fulsomely not long ago they treated it with obloquy and contempt but now they endeavor to use it an argument their faith and in doing so they distort language only theological controversialists can changing survival arrows of freethought by foote https ﬁttest into survival of the best they transform physical fact into moral law and thus they think take new passage to the old harbor of whatever is is right but evolution may be construed progress which some would contest it can not be construed the invariable survival of the best nor if it were could the process by which this result is achieved be justiﬁed evolution works through universal struggle existence in which the life and being of some can be secured only through the suffering and ﬁnal extinction of others and even in its higher stages cunning and unscrupulous strength frequently overcomes humane wisdom fettered by weakness nature red in tooth and claw with ravin shrieks against the creed of the theist if god is working through evolution we must admit that he has marvellously hidden himself and agree with the poet that he does move in mysterious way his wonders to perform the writer in the christian world borrows an image from the puling scepticism of in memoriam which describes man an infant crying in the night and with language but cry this image of the infant is put to strange use the writer says that god is necessarily hidden from us because we can grasp his inscrutable nature and methods only an infant can grasp the thought and purpose of man similes are dangerous things when it is demanded that they shall run upon all fours they often turn against their masters this one does so the infant grows into man in due course and then he can not only grasp the thought and purpose of his father but also it may be comprehend still greater things will the infant mind of man when it reaches maturity be thus related to god if not the analog y is fallacious man is quite mature enough already and has been so thousands of years to understand something of god thought and purpose if he had only chosen to reveal them this however if there be god he has not condescended to an appeal to the various pretended revelations of the world serves to convince us that all are the words of fallible men their very discord discredits them said if god had spoken the universe would surely be convinced and the same conviction would ﬁll every breast the reason given god hiding himself is very curious if says the writer the way of god were not in large measure hidden it would mean that we could survey all things from the height and the depth of god truly an awful conte mplation may it not be that god is hidden from us because there is none to be revealed that all the oracles are dumb or cheat because they have secret to express but says the writer in the christian world there is one revelation of god that can never be gainsaid while the cross stands earth most sacred symbol there can be utter hiding of his love this however we venture to dispute that cross which was laid upon the back of jesus poor mankind has been compelled to carry ever since with simon to ease it of the load jesus was cruciﬁed on calvary and in his name man has suffered centuries of cruciﬁxion the immolation of jesus can be revelation of god love if the nazarene was god his cruciﬁxion involves complicated arrangement murder the jews who demanded his death were divinely instigated and judas iscariot was to betray his master in which case his treachery was necessary element of the drama entitling him not to vituperation but to gratitude even perhaps to the monument which benjamin disraeli suggested his proper reward looking also at the history of christianity and seeing how the cros s has sheltered oppressors of mind and body sanctioned immeasurable shedding of blood and frightened peoples from freedom while even now it symbolises all that is reactionary and accursed in europe we are constrained to say that the love it reveals is noxious the vilest hate general joshua april 1882 mountebank talmage has just preached funeral sermon on general joshua it is rather behind date the old warrior has been dead above three thousand years but better late than never arrows of freethought by foote https tells us many things about joshua which are not in the bible and some sceptics will say that his panegyric is sheer invention they may however be mistaken the oracle of the brooklyn jabbernacle is known to be inspired god holds converse with him and he is thus enabled to supply us with fresh facts about jehovah from the lost books of jasher and the wars of the lord joshua says talmage was magniﬁcent ﬁghter we say he was magniﬁcent butcher jehovah did the ﬁghting he was the virtual commander of the jewish hosts he won all their victories and joshua only did the slaughter he excelled in that line of business he delighted in the dying groans of women and children and loved to dabble his feet and hands in the warm blood of the slain chamber of horrors contains the efﬁgy of any wretch half so bloodthirsty and cruel according to talmage joshua always fought on the right side wars of conquest are never right thieving other people lands is an abominable crime the jews had absolutely claim to the territory they took possession of and which they manured with the blood of its rightful owners we know they said that god told them to requisition that ﬁne little landed estate of canaan half the thieves in history have said the same thing we believe them god never told any man to rob his neighbor and whoever says so lies the thief statement does not sufﬁce let him produce better evidence rascal who steals and murders can not be believed on his oath and is more likely that he is liar than that god is scoundrel talmage celebrates ﬁve great victories of joshua he omits two mighty achie vements general joshua circumcised million and half jews in single day his greatest battle never equalled that wonderful feat the amputations were done at the rate of over thousand minute samson bone was nothing to joshua knife this surprising old jew was great in oratory in surgery on one occasion he addressed an audience of three millions and everyone heard him his voice must have reached two or three miles wonder the walls of jericho fell down when joshua joined in the shout we dare say the jews wore to guard their tympanums against the dreadful artillery of his speech joshua ﬁrst victory says tahnage was conquering the spring freshet of jorda matter of fact jehovah transacted that little affair see says talmage one mile ahead go two priests carrying glittering box four feet long and two feet wide it is the ark of the covenant he forgets to add that the jew god was supposed to be inside it jack in the box is nothing to god in box what would have happened if the ark had been buried with jehovah safely fastened in would his godship have mouldered to dust in that case he would never have seduced carpenter wife and there would have been god the son the fruit of his adultery talmage credits general joshua with the capture of jericho the bible says that jehovah overcame it seven priests went blowing rams horns round the city seven days on the seventh day they went round it seven times it must have been tiresome work jericho was large city several miles in circumference but priests are always good walkers after the last blowing of horns all the jews shouted down jericho down jericho this is talmage inspired account the bible states nothing of the kind just the islamites cry allah il allah it is probable that the jews cried jahveh jahveh but talma ge and the bible both agree that when their shout rent the air the walls of jericho fell ﬂat the fools who believe it then says talmage the huzza of the victorious israelites and the groan of the conquered canaanites commingle ah that groan its sound still curses the bible god men women and children were murdered the very cattle sheep and asses were killed with the sword only one woman house was spared and she was harlot it is if the german army took paris and killed every inhabitant except cora pearl this is inspired war and talmage glories in it he would consider it an honor to be to such pious hero general joshua when ai was taken all its people were slaughtered without any regard to age or sex talmage grins with delight and cries bravo joshua the king of ai was reserved sport they hung him on tree and enjoyed the fun talmage approves this too everything joshua did was right talmage is ready to stake his own poor little soul on that joshua victory over the ﬁve kings calls forth burst of supernatural eloquence talmage pictures the catapults of the sky pouring volley of hailstones on the ﬂying amorites and words almost fail him to describe the glorious miracle of the lengthening of the day in order that jehovah ﬁghters might go on killing one passage is almost sublime it is only one step off what arrows of freethought by foote https is the matter with joshua has he fallen in an apoplectic ﬁt he is in prayer our profanity would not have gone to that length but we take talmage word it that prayer and apoplexy are very much alike the ﬁve kings were decapitated ah says talmage i want ﬁve more kings beheaded king alcohol king fraud king lust king superstition and king inﬁdelity soft you priestly calumniator what right have you to associate inﬁdelity with fraud and lust that freethought which you call inﬁdelity is more faithful to truth and justice than your creed has ever been and it will not be disposed of so easily you think you will never behead us but we shall strangle you we are crushing the life out of your wretched faith and your spasmodic sermon s are only the groans of its despair talmage boldest step on the line which separates the ludicrous from the sublime occurs in his peroration he makes general joshua conquer death by lying down and giving up the ghost and then asks headstone and the holy corpse i imagine he says that the head it shall be the sun that stood still upon gibeon and the foot the moon that stood still in the valley of ajalon this is about the ﬁnest piece of yankee buncombe extant if the sun and moon keep watch over general joshua grave what are we to when we get to the new jerusalem we shall want neither of these luminaries the glory of the lord will shine upon us but until then we can not dispense with them and we decidedly object to their being retained perpetual mourners over joshua grave if however one of them must service we humbly beg that it may be the moon let the sun illumine us by day so that we may see to transact our affairs and if ever we should long to behold pale dians beams again we might take talmage our guide to the unknown grave of general joshua and while they played softly over the miraculous two yards of turf we should see his ﬁtting going to hell june 1882 editing freethought paper is dreadful business it brings one into contact with many baked people who have little patent recipes hastening the millennium with ambitious versiﬁers who think it disgrace to journalism that their productions are not instantly inserted with discontented ladies and gentlemen who fancy that heterodox paper is the proper vehicle every species of complaint and with multitude of other bores too numerous to mention and too various to classify but the worst of all are the anonymous bores who send their insults advice or warnings through the post the beneﬁt of the queen revenue we generally pitch their puerile missives into the basket but occasionally we ﬁnd one diverting enough to be introduced to our readers few days ago we received the following lugubrious epistle ostensibly from parson in worcestershire the envelope bore the postmark of tything the fool hath said in his heart is have seen one of your blasphemous papers and i say solemnly clergyman of the church of england that i believe you are doing the work of the devil and are on the road to hell and will spend eternity with the devil unless god in his mercy lead you by the holy spirit to repentance nothing is impossible with him dean in the church of england says wise and laugh not through speck of time and then wail through an immeasurable eternity except you change your views you will most certainly hear christ say at the judgment day ye cursed into everlasting ﬁre prepared the devil and his angels matt xxv this is tolerably warm though not very elegant effusion and it is really pity that so grave counsellor should conceal his name if it should lead to our conversion we should not know whom to thank having turned us out of the primrose path to the everlasting bonﬁre our mentor assures us that with god nothing is impossible we are sorry to learn this we must conclude that he does not take sufﬁcient trouble with parsons to endow them with the courage of their convictions or to make them observe the common decencies of epistolary arrows of freethought by foote https anonymous parson who acts like an irish moonlighter and masks his identity while venting his spleen presumes to anticipate the day of judgment and tells exactly what jesus christ will say to us on that occasion we are obliged to him the information but we wonder how he obtained it the of matthew to which he refers us contains not word about unbelievers it simply states that certain persons who have treated the son of man very shabbily in his distress shall be sent to keep compa ny with old nick and his imps now we have never shown the son of man any incivility much less any inhumanity and we therefore repudiate this odious insinuation whenever jesus christ sends us message that he is sick we will pay him visit if he is hungry we will ﬁnd him dinner if he is thirsty we will stand whatever he likes to drink if he is naked we will hunt him up clean shirt and an old suit and if he is in prison we will according he is innocent or guilty try to procure his release or leave him to serve out his term we should be much surprised if any parson in the three kingdoms would any more some of them we believe would see him condemned new version before they would lift ﬁnger or spend sixpence him we are charged with doing the work of the devil this is indeed news we never knew the devil required any assistance he was always very active and enterprising and quite able to manage his own business and although his rival jehovah is so dotingly senile to yield up everything to his mistress and her son one has ever whispered the least hint of the devil decline into the same abject position but if his satanic majesty needed our aid we should not be loth to give it after carefully reading the bible many times from beginning to end we have come to the conclusion that he is about the only gentleman in it we are on the road to hell well if we must go somewhere that is just the place we should choose the temperature is high and it would doubt at ﬁrst be incommodious but old sir thomas browne says afﬂictions induce callosities and in time we should get used to anything when once we grew accustomed to the heat how thankful we should be at having escaped the dreary insipidity of heaven with its perpetual psalms its dolorous trumpets its gruesome elders and its elderly beasts how thankful at having missed an eternity with abraham isaac jacob david and all the many blackguards and scoundrels of the bible how thankful at having joined ever the society of rabelais bruno spinoza voltaire thomas paine john stuart mill and all the great poets sages and wits who possess so much of that carnal wisdom which is at enmity with the pious folly of babes and sucklings on the whole we think it best to keep on our present course let the bigots rave and the parsons wail they are deeply interested in the doctrine of heaven and hell beyond the grave we believe in heaven and hell on this side of it hell of ignorance crime and misery heaven of wisdom virtue and happiness our duty is to promote the one and combat the other if there be just god the fulﬁlment of that duty will sufﬁce if god be unjust all honest men will be in the same boat and have the courage to despise and defy him christmas eve in hea ven december 1881 christmas eve had come and almost gone it was drawing nigh midnight and i sat solitary in my room immersed in memory dreaming of old days and their buried secrets the ﬁre before which i mused was burning clear without ﬂame and its intense glow which alone lighted my apartment cast red tint on the furniture and walls outside the streets were mufﬂed deep with snow in which footstep was audible all was quiet death silent the grave save the faint murmur of my own breathing time and space seemed annihilated beyond those four narrow walls and i was cofﬁned living centre of an else lifeless inﬁnity my reverie was rudely broken by the staggering step of whose devotion to bacchus was the one symptom of reverence in his nature he reeled up stair after stair and he passed my door he lurched against it so violently that i feared he would come through but he arrows of freethought by foote https himself after some profane mutterings reeled up the next ﬂight of stairs and ﬁnally deposited his clay on the bed in his own room immediately over mine after this interruption my thoughts changed most fancifully why i know not but i began to brood on the strange statement of saint paul concerning the man who was lifted up into the seventh heaven and there beheld things not lawful to reveal while pondering this story i was presently aware of an astonishing change the walls of my room slowly expanded growing ever thinner and thinner until they became the ﬁlmiest transparent veil which at last dissolved utterly away then whether in the spirit or the ﬂesh i know not i was hurried along through space past galaxy after galaxy of suns and stars separate systems yet all mysteriously related swifter than light we travelled i and my unseen guide through the inﬁnite ocean of ether until our ﬂight was arrested by denser medium which i recognised an atmosphere like that of our earth i had scarcely recovered from this new surprise when marvel of marvels i found myself before huge gate of wondrous art and dazzling splendor at word from my still unseen guide it swung open and i was urged within beneath my feet was solid pavement of gold gorgeous mansions interspersed with palaces rose around and above them all tower ed the airy pinnacles of matchless temple whose points quivered in the rich light like tongues of golden ﬁre the walls glittered with countless rubies diamonds pearls amethysts emeralds and other precious stones and lovely presences arrayed in shining garments moved noiselessly from place to place where am i i ejaculated half faint with wonder and my hitherto unseen guide who now revealed himself softly answered in heaven thereupon my whole frame was agitated with inward laughter i in heaven whose ﬁery doom had been prophesied so often by the saints on earth i the sceptic the blasphemer the scoffer at all things sacred who had laughed at the legends and dogmas of christianism though they were incredible and effete the myths of olympus and i thought to myself better i had gone straight to hell here in the new jerusalem they will doubt punish worse than there but my angelic guide who read my thought smiled benignly and said fear not harm shall happen to you i have exacted promise of safety you and here promise can be broken but why i asked have you brought hither and how did you obtain my guarantee of safety and my guide answered it is our privilege each year to demand one favor which may not be refused i requested that i might bring you here but i did not mention your name and if you nothing outrageous you will not be noticed one here meddles with another business and our rulers are too much occupied with foreign affairs to troubl about our domestic concerns yet i rejoined i shall surely be detected i wear heaven ly robe then my guide produced one from little packet and having donned it i felt safe from the fate of him who was expelled because he had not on at the marriage feast we moved along i inquired of my guide why he took such interest in and he replied looking sadly i was sceptic on earth centuries ago but i stood alone and at last on my weakened by sickness i again embraced the creed of my youth and died in the christian faith hence my presence in heaven but gladly would i renounce paradise even hell those ﬁgures so lovely without are not all lovely within and i would rather consort with the choicer spirits who abide with satan and hold high revel of heart and head in his court yet wishe s are fruitless the tree falls it lies and my lot is cast ever whereupon i laid my hand in his being speechless with grief we soon approached the magniﬁcent temple and entering it we mixed with the mighty crowd of angels who were witnessing the rites of worship performed by the elders and beasts before the great white throne all happened exactly saint john describes the angels rent the air with their acclamations after the inner circle had concluded and then the throne was deserted by its occupants my dear guide then led through some narrow passages until we emer ged into spacious hall at one end of which hung curtain advancing towards this with silent tread we were able to look through slight aperture where the curtain fell away from the pillar into the room beyond it was small and cosy and ﬁre burned in the grate before which sat poor dear god the father in big divested of his godly paraphernalia he looked old and thin though an evil ﬁre still gleamed from his cavernous eyes on table beside him stood some phials one of which had seemingly just been used god the son stood near looking much younger and fresher but time was beginning to tell on him also the ghost ﬂitted about in the form of dove now perching on the father shoulder and now on the head of the arrows of freethought by foote https the massive bony frame of the father was convulsed with ﬁt of coughing jesus promptly applied restorative from the phial and after terrible struggle the cough was subdued during this scene the dove ﬂuttered violently from wall to wall when the patient was thoroughly restored the following conversation ensued you well now my father es yes well enough alack how my strength wanes where is the pith that ﬁlled these arms when i fought my chosen people where the ﬁery vigor that ﬁlled my veins when i courted your mother here the dove ﬂuttered and looked queer sire not speak thus you will regain your old strength nay and you know it you not even wish to recover in my weakness you exercise sovereign power and rule you please sire sire now none of these demure looks we know each other too well practise before the saints if you like but waste your acting on dear father pray curb your temper that is the very thing the people on earth so much complain of dearly beloved son in whom i am not at all well pleased desist from this hypocrisy your temper is bad mine you shed blood enough in your time and need not rail at sire only the blood of heretics forsooth they were very worthy people the most part and their only crime was that they neglected you but why should we wrangle we stand or fall together and i am falling satan draws most souls from earth to his place including all the best workers and thinkers who are needed to sustain our drooping power and we receive nothing but the refuse weak slavish ﬂabby souls hardly worth saving or damning gushing preachers pious editors crazy enthusiasts and old ladies of both sexes why did you preach different gospel while you were about it you had the chance once and let it slip we shall never have another dear father i am reforming my gospel to make it suit the altered taste of the times f and nonsense it ca be done thinking people see through it the divine is immutable the only remedy is to start afresh could i beget new son all might be rectiﬁed but i can not i am too old our dominion is melting away like that of all our predecessors you can not outlast i am the fountain of your life and all the multitude of immortal angels who throng our court live only while i uphold them and with they will vanish into eternal limbo here followed another ﬁt of coughing worse than before jesus resorted again to the phial but the cordial seemed powerless against this sharp attack just then the dove ﬂuttered against the curtain and my guide hurried swiftly away in corridor of the temple we met michael and raphael the latter scrutinised so closely that my blood ran cold but just when my dread was deepest his countenance cleared and he turned towards his companion walking behind the great archangels we were able to hear their conversation raphael had just returned from visit to the earth and he was reporting to michael most alarming defection from the christian faith people he said were leaving in shoals and unless fresh miracles were worked he tremble d the prospects of the dynasty but what most alarmed him was the spread of profanity while in england he had seen copies of blasphemous paper which horriﬁed the elect by ridiculing the bible in what bishop had justly called heartless and cruel way but my dear michael continued raphael that is not all nor even the worst this scurrilous paper which would be quickly suppressed if we retained our old inﬂuence actually caricatures our supreme lord and his heavenly host in woodcuts and thousands of people enjoy this wicked profanity i dare say our turn will soon come and we shall be held up to ridicule like the rest impossible cried michael surely there is some mistake what is the name of this abominable print with grave look raphael replied michael there is mistake the name of this imp of blasphemy hesitate to say was it the freethinker arrows of freethought by foote https at this moment my guide again hurried along we reached the splendid gate once more which slowly opened and let us through again we ﬂew through the billowy ether sweeping past system after system with intoxicating speed until at last dazed and almost unconscious i regained this earthly shore then i sank into stupor when i awoke the ﬁre had burnt down to the last cinder all was dark and cold and i shivered i tried to stretch my limbs was it all dream who can say whether in the spirit or the ﬂesh i know not said saint paul and i am compelled to echo his words sceptics may shrug their shoulders smile or laugh but there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in their philosophy professor blackie on atheism january 1879 professor blackie is man with whom we can not be angry however greatly his utterances are calculated to arouse that feeling he is so impulsive frank and essentially that even his most provoking words call forth rather smile of compassion than frown of resentment those who know his character and position will yield him the widest allowance his ﬁery nature prompts him to energetic speech on all occasions but when his temper has been fretted it frequently is by the boisterous whims of his greek students in that most boisterous of universities it is not surprising if his expressions become splenetic even to rashness the ingenuous professor is quite impartial in his denunciations he strikes out right and left against various objects of his dislike everything he dissents from receives one and the same kind of treatment so that opinion he assails has any special reason to complain and every blow he deals is accompanied with such jolly smile sometimes verging into hearty laugh that opponent can well refuse to shake hands with him when all is over this temper however is somewhat inconsistent with the scientiﬁc purpose indic ated in the title of professor blackie book zoologist who had such particular and unconquer able aversion to one species of animals that the bare mention of its name made his gorge rise woul d naturally give us very inadequate and unsatisfactory account of it so in this case instead of getting true natural history of atheism which would be of immense service to every thinker we get only an emphatic statement of the authors hatred of it under different aspects atheism is styled hollow absurdity that culmination of all speculative absurdities disease of the speculative faculty monstrous disease of the reasoning faculty and so on the chapter on its speciﬁc varieties and general root is signiﬁcantly headed with that hackneyed declaration of the psalmist the fool hath said in his heart there is god though impertinence were better from jew than from christian or more respectable being three thousand years old perhaps professor blackie has never heard of the sceptical critic who exonerated the psalmist on the ground that he was speaking jocosely and really meant that the man who said in his heart only there is god without saying so openly was the fool but this interpretation is profane the other is impertinent and in fact does great injustice to the atheist who has never been accustomed to say there is god an assertion which involves the arrogance of inﬁnite knowledge since nothing less than that is requisite to prove an universal negative but simply i know not of such an existence which is modest statement intellectually and morally and quite unlike the presumption of certain theolo gians who arnold says speak familiarly of god though he were man living in the next street his own sake professor blackie should little curb his proneness to the use of uncomplimentary epithets he does himself injustice when he condescends to describe david hume theory of causation wretched cavil carlyle is more just to this great representative of an antagonistic school of thought he exempts him from the sweeping condemnation of his contemporaries in scottish prose literature and admits that he was too rich man to borrow from france or elsewhere and surely hume was less honest than rich in thought jest and captiousness were entirely foreign to his mind wincing under his inexorable logic the ontologist may try to console himself with the thought that the great sceptic was playing with arguments like arrows of freethought by foote https of wondrous skill but in reality hume was quite in earnest and always meant what he said we may also observe that it is professor blackie and not darwin who suffers from the asking of such questions these what monkey ever wrote an epic poem or composed tragedy or comedy or even sonnet what monkey professed his belief in any articles or compacted calvinistic confession or gave in his adhesion to any church established or disestablished if darwin heard these questions he might answer with good humored smile my dear sir you quite mistake my theories and your questions travesty them i would further observe that while the composition of poems would unquestionably be creditabl to monkeys i who have some regard them relatives however distant am heartily glad they have never done any of the other things you mention which i deem negative proof that their reaso n though limited is fortunately sane professor blackie opening chapter on presumptions fully justiﬁes its title the general consent of mankind in favor of theism is assum ed to have established its validity and to have put atheists altogether out of court and long list of illustrious theists from solomon to hegel is contrasted with meagre catalogue of atheists comprising only the names of david hume jeremy bentham and john stuart mill confucius and buddha are classed apart lying outside of our western european culture altogether but with promise that in so far they seem to have taught morality without religion or religion without god we shall say word or two about them by so far buddha is concerned this promise is kept but in relation to confucius it is broken probably the chinese sage was found too tough and embarrassing subject and so it was thought expedient to ignore him the more tractable prophet of india whose doctrine of transmigration might with little sophistry be made to resemble the christian doctrine of immortality and his nirvana the kingdom of heaven professor blackie is singularly silent to james mill the father of the celebrated utilitarian philosopher far more robust in intellect and character than his son he is the dominant figure of mill autobiography and has about him more august air than his son ever wore what does the general consent of mankind prove in regard to beliefs like theism simply nothing professor blackie himself sees that on some subjects it is worthless particularly when special knowledge or special faculty is required but there are questions he contends which public opinion rightly decides even though opposed to the conclusions of subtle thinkers perhaps he says we shall hit the mark here if we say broadly that nature is always right the general and normal sentiment of the majority must always be right in so far it is rooted in the universal and abiding instincts of humanity and public opinion the opinion of the majority will be right also in all matters which belong to the general conduct of life among all classes and with respect to which the mind of the majority has been allowed perfectly free natural and healthy exercise now in the ﬁrst place we must reiterate our opinion that the general consent of mankind on subject like theism proves absolutely nothing it is perfectly valid on questions of ordinary taste and feeling but loses all logical efﬁcacy in relation to questions which can not be determined by direct appeal to experience and undeniably theism is one of those questions unless we admit with the transcendentalist what is contrary to evident fact that men have an intuitive perception of god in the next place the minor premise of this argument is assumed there is general consent of mankind in favor of theism but only very extensive consent gladstone not long since in the nineteenth century went so far to claim the general consent of mankind in favor of christianity by simply excluding all heathen nations from right to be heard professor blackie does not go to this length but his logical process is different lastly our author concluding proviso vitiates his whole case if there be one question on which the mind of the majority has not been allowed perfectly free natural and healthy exercise it is that of the existence of god we are all prepossessed hi its favor by early training custom and authority our minds have never been permitted to play freely upon it centu ry ago atheists stood in danger of death only recently have penal and invidious statutes against them been cancelled or mitigated and even now bigotry against honest disbelief in theism is so strong that man often incurs greater odium in publicly avowing it than in constantly violating all the decalogue save the commandment against murder murderers and thieves though punished here are either forgotten or compassionated after death but not even the grave effectually shields the atheist from the malignity of pious zeal fortunately however wise and humane tolerance is growing in the world and extending towards the most ﬂagrant arrows of freethought by foote https we shall ultimately admit with sage old felltham that we ﬁll the world with cruel brawls in the obstinate defence of that whereof we might with more honor confess ourselves to be ignorant and that it is shame man not to know that which is not in his possibility the causes of atheism are according to professor blackie very numerous he ﬁnds seven or eight distinct ones the lowest class of atheists are atheists of imbecility persons of stunted intellect incapable of comprehending the idea of god these however he will not waste his time with nor will we he then passes to the second class of reprobates whose atheism springs not from defect of intellect but from moral disorder and who delight to conceive the universe resembling their own chaos these we shall dismiss with passing remark that if moral disorder naturally induces atheism some very eminent christians have been marvellous hypocrites lack of reverence is the next cause of atheism and is indeed its natural soil but professo r blackie thinks this may be congenital like lack of taste music or an incapacity of understanding mathematical problem we are obliged to consider this third class of atheists hopeless the ﬁrst having admitted that their malady may be congenital our author inﬂicts upon these unfortunates great deal of superﬂuous abuse apparently forgetting that they are less to blame than their omnipotent maker the fourth cause of atheism is pride or but this seems very erratic in its operations since the only two instances napoleon the great and napoleon the little were certainly theists next comes democracy between which and irreverence there is natural connexion and from which from hotbed atheism in its rankest stage naturally shoots up professor blackie may be surmised tilts madly against this horrible foe but it will not thus be subdued democracy is here and daily extending itself overwhelming slowly but surely all impediments to its supremacy if theism is incompatible with it then the days of theism are numbered professor blackie peculiar natural history of atheism is more likely to please the opposite ranks than his own who may naturally cry out with sense of being sold call you that backing of your friends pride of intellect is the next cause of atheism don juan sells himself to perdition liberal share of pleasure but faust hankers only after forbidden knowledge this is of various kinds but of all kinds that which has long had the most evil reputation of begetting atheism is physical science again does the fervid professor set lance in rest and dash against this new foe to theism much don quixote charged the famous windmill but science like the windmill is too big and strong to suffer from such assaults the father of this sort of nonsense in modern times was david hume who we are elegantly informed was very clever fellow very agreeable gentlemanly fellow too his nonsense about causation is to be traced to want of reverence in his character indeed it seems that all persons who adhere to philosophy alien to professor blackie have something radically wrong with them let this edinbur gh professor rail he may david hume theory of causation will suffer harm and his contrast of human architecture which is mechanism with natural architecture which is growth will still form an insuperable obsta cle to that natural theology which garth wilkinson says with grim humor seeks to elicit or rather construct scientiﬁc abstraction answering to the concrete ﬁgure of the vulcan of the is to say universal smith eventually professor blackie gets so sick of philosophers that he turns from them to poets who may more safely be trusted in matters of healthy human sentiment but here fresh difﬁculties arise although poet is naturally religious animal we ﬁnd that the greatest of roman poets lucretius was an atheist while even some of our most brilliant notorieties in the mode rn world of song are not the most notable piety but our versatile professor easily accounts this by assuming that there may be an idolatry of the imagin ative well of the knowing faculty never did natural historian so jauntily provide every fact contravening his theories professo r blackie will never understand atheism or write proﬁtably upon it while he pursues this course let him restrain his discursive propensities and deal scientiﬁcally with this one fact which explodes his whole theory of atheism the supreme glory of our modern poetry is shelley and if ever man combined splendor of imagination with keen intelligence and saintly character it was he raphael incarnate he seems yet he stands outside all the creeds and to his prophetic vision in the sunlight of the world great age begun anew faiths and empires gleam like wrecks of dissolving dream in his treatment of buddhism professor blackie is candid and impartial until he comes to consider its atheistic character then his reason seems almost entirely to forsake him after saying that arrows of freethought by foote https preached was gospel of pure human ethics divorced not only from brahma and the brahminic trinity but even from the existence of god and describing buddh himself rare exceptional and altogether transcendent al incarnation of moral perfection he ﬁrst tries to show that nirvana is the same the christian eternal life and transmigration of souls faithful counterpart of the christian doctrine of future reward and punishment feeling perhaps how miserably he has failed in this attempt he turns with exasperation on buddhism and afﬁrms that it can in wise be looked upon anything but an abnormal manifestation of the religious life of man we believe that professor blackie himself must have already perceived the futility and absurdity of this the last chapter of professor blackie book is entitled the atheism of reaction in it he strikes characteristically at the ﬁve points of calvinism at original guilt eternal punishment creation out of nothing and special providence which he charges with largely contributing to the spread of atheism while welcoming these assaults on superstition we are constrained to observe that the christian dogmas which professor blackie impugns and denounces are not speciﬁc causes of atheism again he is on the wrong scent the revolt against theism at the present time is indeed mainly moral but the preparation it has been an intellectual one modern science has demonstrated all practical purposes the inexorable reign of law the god of miracles answering prayer and intimately related to his children of men is an idea exploded and henceforth impossible the only idea of god at all possible is that of supreme universal intelligence governing nature by ﬁxed laws and apparently quite heedless whether their operation brings us joy or pain this idea is intellectually permissible but it is beyond all proof and can be entertained only speculation now the development of knowledge which makes this the only permissible idea of god also changes immortality from religious certitude to an unveriﬁable supposition the rectiﬁcation of the evils of this life can not therefore be reasonably expected in another so that man stands alone ﬁghting terrible battle with aid save from his own strength and skill to believe that omnipotence is the passive spectator of this fearful strife is many minds altogether too hard they prefer to believe that the woes and pangs of sentient life were not designed that madness anguish and despair result from the interplay of unconscious forces they thus set theism aside and unable to recognise the fatherhood of god they cling more closely to the brotherhood of man salvationism april 1882 there is new thing under the sun said the wise king many surprising novelty is only an old thing in new dress and this is especially true in respect to religion ever since the feast of pentecost when the apostles all jabbere d like madmen christianity has been marked by periodical ﬁts of insanity it would occupy too much space to enumerate these outbursts which have occurred in every part of christendom but we may mention few that have happened in our own country during the commonwealth some of the numerous sects went to the most ludicrous extremes preaching rousing sermons praying through the nose assuming biblical names and prophesying the immediate reign of the saints there was reaction against the excesses of puritanism after the death of cromwell and until the time of whitﬁeld and wesley religion continued to be sober and respectable inﬂuence chieﬂy useful to the sovereign and the magistrate but these two powerful preachers rekindled the ﬁre of religious enthusiasm in the hearts of the common people and methodism was founded among those whom the church had scarcely touched not many years ago the hallelujah band spread itself far and wide and then went out like straw ﬁre and now we have salvationism doing just the same kind of work and employing just the same kind of means will this new movement die away like so many others it is difﬁcult to say salvatio nism may be only ﬂash in the pan but on the other hand it may provide the only sort of christianity possible in an age of science and freethought the educat ed classes and the intelligent artisans will more and more desert the christian creed and there will probably be left nothing but the dregs and the scum whom salvationism is exactly suited christianity began among the poor ignorant and depraved and it may possibly end its existence among the very same arrows of freethought by foote https all these movements we see striking illustration of what the biologists call the law of atavism there is constant tendency to return to the primitive type we can form some idea of what early christianity was by reading the acts of the apostles the true believers went about preaching in season and out of season they cried and prayed with loud voice they caused tumult in the streets and gave plenty of trouble to the civil authorities all this is true of salvation ism and we have doubt that the early church under the guidance of peter was just counterpart of the salvation army under general the jews or men of the world and to the greeks or educated thinkers folly early christians were full of the holy ghost that is of wild enthusiasm scoffers said they were drunk and they acted like madmen leap across seventeen centuries and we shall ﬁnd methodists acting in the same way wesley states in his journal 1739 of his hearers at wapping that some were torn with kind of convulsive motion in every part of their bodies and that so violently that often four or ﬁve persons could not hold one of them and lecky tells us in his history of the eighteenth century that religious madness which from the nature of its hallu cinations is usually the most miserable of all the forms of insanity was in this in many later revivals of unfrequent occurrence now salvation ism produces the very same effects it drives many people mad and it is common thing men and women at its meetings to shout dance jump and ﬁnally fall on the ﬂoor in pious ecstacy while they are in this condition the holy ghost is entering them and the devil is being driven out poor creatures they take us back in thought to the days of demoniacal possession and the strange old world that saw the d swine of gadara drowned in the sea the free and easy mingling of the sexes at these pious assemblies is another noticeable feature were ﬂagrant scandal in the early church and women who returned from them virtuous must have been miracles of chastity methodism was not quite so bad but it tolerated some very strange pranks the rev richard polwhele in his anecdotes of methodism very rare book says that at agnes the society stay up the whole night when girls of twelve and fourteen years of age run about the streets calling out that they are possessed he goes on to relate that at probus the preacher at late hour of the night after all but the higher classes left the room would order the candles to be put out and the saints fall down and kneel on their naked knees when he would go round and thrust his hand under every knee to feel if it were bare salvationism does not at present go to this length but it has still time enough to imitate all the freaks of its predecessor there was an meeting in whitechapel few months ago which threatened to develope into thoroughgoing the light was rather dim voices grew low cheeks came perilously near and hands met caressingly of course it was nothing but the love of god that moved them yet it looked like something else and the uninitiated spectator of the mystery of godliness found it easy to understand how american tend to increase the population and why magistrate in the of england observed that one result of revivals in his district was number of fatherless weans in one respect salvationism excels all previous revivals it is unparalleled in its vulgarity the imbecile coarseness of its language makes one ashamed of human nature had it existed in swift time he might have added fresh clause to his terrible indictment of mankind its metaphors are borrowed from the slaughter its songs are frequently coarser than those of the lowest hall and the general style of its preaching is worthy of congregation of drunken pugilists the very names assumed by its ofﬁcers are enough to turn one stomach christianity has fallen low indeed when its champions boast such titles the hallelujah fishmonger the miner the devil dodger the devil walloper and gipsy sal the constitution of the salvation army is pure despotism general booth commands it absolutely there is council of war consisting of his own family all the funds ﬂow into his exchequer and he spends them he likes questions are allowed accounts are rendered and everything is under his unqualiﬁed control the general may be perfectly honest man but we are quite sure that none but pious lunatics would trust him with such irresponsible power we understand that the ofﬁcials are all paid and some of them extremely well they lead very pleasant life full of agreeable excitement they wear uniform and are dubbed captain major or some other title add to all this that they suppose themselves when honest to be particular favorites of god and it will be easy to understand how so many of them prefer career of singing and praying to earning an honest living by hard work the hallelujah lads and lasses could not the most part get decent wages in any other occupation all they require this work is arrows of freethought by foote https and good lungs and if they can only boast of having been the greatest drunkard in the district the worst thief or the most brutal character they are on the high road to fortune and may count on living in clover the rest of their sojourn in this vale of tears pious showman october 1882 we all remember how that clever showman barnum managed to fan the jumbo fever when the enterprising yankee writes his true autobiography we shall doubtless ﬁnd some extraordinary revelations yet barnum after all makes pretence of morality or religion he merely goes in making handsome fortune out of the curiosity and credulity of the public if he were questioned to his principles he would probably reply like artemus princerpuls i nare one i in the show bizniz general booth is quite much showman barnum but he is pious showman he is perfect master of the vulgar art of attracting fools every day brings fresh change in his walk up walk up tambourine girls hallelujah lasses converted clowns and ﬁddlers sham italian organ grinders bands in which every man plays his own tune ofﬁcers in uniform davidic dances and tunes are all served up with plentiful supply of blood and ﬁre the general evidently means to stick at nothing that will draw and we quite believe that if pair of ezekiel cherubim were available he would worry god almigh ty into sending them down exhibition at the city road show booth latest dodge is to say the least peculiar most fathers would shrink from trafﬁcking in son marriage but booth is above such nice scruples the worst deeds are sanctiﬁed by love of god and religion condones every indecency bramwell booth whom the general has singled out his apostolic successor and heir to all the army property got married last week and the pious showman actually exhibited the bridegroom and bride to the public at shilling head about three hundred pounds were taken at the doors and big collection was made inside booth anxiety the cash was very strongly illustrated commissioner bailton who has had very eccentric career was enjoying his long deferred opportunity of making speech when many of the crowd began to press towards the door stop cried booth go yet there going to be collection but the audience melted faster than ever whereupon booth jumped up again stopped poor railton unceremoniously and shouted hold on we make the collection now this little manouvre was quite in keeping with the showman instruction to his subalterns to have plenty of good strong collecting boxes and pass them round often booth facetious remarks during his son marriage according to the army forms were well adapted to tickle the ears of his groundlings the whole thing was roaring farce and well sustained the reputation of the show there was also the usual spice of blasphemy before bramwell booth marched on to the platform board was held up bearing the inscription behold the bridegroom cometh these mountebanks have reverence even what they call sacred they make everything dance to their tune they prostitute god word caricature jesus christ and burlesque all the watchwords and symbols of their creed one of booth remarks after the splicing was ﬁnished is full of suggestion he said that his enemies might cavil but he had found out road to fortune in this world and the next well the lord only knows how he will fare in the next world but in this world the pious showman has certainly gained big success he can neither write nor preach and singing half dozen notes from his brazen throat would empty the place easily cry of fire but he is dexterous manager he knows how to work the oracle he understands catering the mob in short he is very clever showman who deals in religion just other showmen deal in wild animals giants dwarfs headed sheep fat women and siamese arrows of freethought by foote https has brought to our hands copy of private circular issued by commissioner railton soliciting wedding presents bramwell booth with the exception of reuben may begging letters it is the ﬁnest cadging document we ever saw booth was evidently ashamed to sign it himself so it bears the name of railton but the pious showman can not disown the responsibility it he will not allow the ofﬁcers of the army to marry without his sanction he forbids them to accept any private present he keeps sharp eye on every detail of the organisation surely then he will not have the face to say that he knew nothing of railton circular he has face enough almost anything but hardly this there is one damning fact which he can not shirk bailton asks that all contributions shall be made payable to william booth usual bailton spreads the butter pretty freely on booth and his family he says that their devotion to the army has loaded them with care and often made them suffer weakness and pain to bramwell booth in particular we are informed that he has worked so hard behind the scenes chief of the staff that many of his hairs are grey at poor bramwe ll the army should present him with dozen bottles of hair restorer perhaps his young wife will renew his raven head by imitating the lady in the fable and pulling out all the grey hairs in order to compensate this noble family in some degree their marvellous devotion to the great cause bailton proposes that wedding presents in the shape of cash should be made to bramwell booth on the day of his marriage whatever money is received will go not to the young gentleman personally but to reducing the army debt of but the army property is all in booth hands and bramwell is his heir and successor it is obvious that any reduction of the debt will be so much clear gain to the ﬁrm the general evidently saw that the case was delicate one so bailton sends out private circular which he excuses on the ground that any public appeal would not be at all agreeable to bramwell own feelings of course not but we dare say the wedding presents will be agreeable enough this is strong point with the ﬁrm bailton repeats it later on i not wish he says to make any public announcement of this the reason of this secrecy is doubt less the same that which prompts the general to exclude reporters and interlopers from his t meetings only the initiated are allowed in and they of course may be safely trusted with the circular bailton sent out envelopes in which the pious dupes were to forward their contributions and printed slips headed wedding presents to bramwell booth on which they were asked to specify the amount of their gift and the sin from which the salvation army had rescued them this printed slip contains list of sins which would credit to jesuit confessor booth has we think missed his vocation he might have achieved real distinction in the army of ignatius loyola the circular is wonderful mixture of piety and business nearly every sentence contains little of both the cash will not only gladden the hearts of the booths but make the devil tremble and give earth and hell another shock this last bit of extravagance is rather puzzling that hell should receive another shock is very proper but why is there to be an earthquake at the same time we have said enough to show the true character of this cadging trick it throw s strong light on the business methods of this pious showman booth is playing very astute game by reducing the army to military discipline and consti tuting himself its general he retains an absolute command over its resources and is able to crush out all opposition and silence all criticism he wields more than papal despotism all the higher posts are held by members of his own family his eldest son is appointed his successor the property thus remains in the family and the booth dynasty is established on solid foundation such an impudent imposture would scarcely be credible if it were not patent that there is still amongst us vast multitude of sheep who are ready to follow any plausible shepherd and to yield up their ﬂeeces to his shears end of the project gutenberg ebook arrows of freethought arrows of freethought by foote https editions will replace the previous old editions will
