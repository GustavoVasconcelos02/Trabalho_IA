pitiful state of hers yet she shewed herself within by her outward looks and countenance when caesar had made her lie down again and sat by her bedside cleopatra began to clear and excuse herself that she had done laying all to the fear she had the project gutenberg ebook of book of english prose part ii arranged secondary and high schools by percy lubbock https caesar in contrary manner reproved

he would send her away before with her children when this was told cleopatra she requested caesar that 10 it would please him to suffer her to offer the last oblations of the dead unto the soul of

twenty years of age he was master of noble fortune which descended to him by the gift of 31 grandfather without passing through his father or mother who were then both alive and not well enough contented to ﬁnd themselves passed by in the descent his education some years had been in ireland where his father was lord deputy so that when he returned into england to the possession of his fortune he was unentangled with any acquaintance or friends which usually grow up by the custom of conversation and therefore was to make pure election of his company which he chose by other rules than were prescribed to the young nobility of that time and it can not be denied though he admitted some few to his friendship the agreeableness of their natures and their undoubted affection to him that his familiarity and friendship the most part was with men of the most eminent and sublime parts and of untouched reputation in point of integrity and such had title to his bosom he was great

administrations he was such dispenser if he had been trusted with it to such uses and if there had been the least of vice in his expense he might have been thought too prodigal he was constant and pertinacious in whatsoever he resolved to and not to be wearied by any pains that were necessary to that end and therefore having once resolved not to see london which he loved above all places till he had perfectly learned the greek tongue he went to his own house in the country and pursued it with that indefatigable 32 industry that it will not be believed in how short time he was master of it and accurately read all the greek historians in this time his house being within little more than ten miles of oxford he contracted familiarity and friendship with the most polite and accurate men of

visit the trenches and nearest approaches and to discover what the enemy did being so much beside the duty of his place that it might be understood rather to be against it he would say merrily that

golden gates they would cry again there is now legion of shining ones just come to town by which we know that there are more pilgrims upon the road here 36 they come to wait them and to comfort them after all their sorrow then the pilgrims got up and walked to and fro but how were their ears now ﬁlled with heavenly noises and their eyes delighted with celestial visions in this land they heard nothing saw nothing felt nothing smelt nothing tasted nothing that was offensive to their stomach or mind only when they tasted of the water of the river over which they were to go they thought that tasted little bitterish to the palate but it proved sweeter when was down in this place there was record kept of the names of them that had been pilgrims of old and history of all the famous acts that

told her he was heartily glad of the news and could been glad had the post come him then she bid that he should give advice how all things should be prepared her journey so he told her saying thus and thus it must be and we that survive will accompany you to the riverside then she called her children and gave them her blessing and told them that she yet read with comfort the mark that was set in their foreheads and was glad to see them with her there and that they had kept their garments so white lastly she bequeathed to the poor that little she had and commanded her sons and her daughters to

holiest men were the best poets of their nation and language among the greeks the two most renowned sages and lawgivers were lycurgus and solon whereof the last is known to have excelled in poetry and

began to be very uneasy my friend william they had promised to be back again in four days which they might very easily have done however at the end of thirteen days we saw three sail coming directly to us which little surprised us all at ﬁrst not knowing what might be the case and we began to put ourselves in posture of defence but they came nearer us we were soon satisﬁed the ﬁrst vessel was that which william went in who carried ﬂag of truce and in few hours they all came to an anchor and william came on board us with little boat with the chinese merchant in his company and two other merchants who seemed to be kind of brokers the rest 47 here he gave us an account how civilly he had been used how they had treated him with all imaginable frankness and openness that they had not only given him the full value of his spices and other goods which he carried in gold by good weight but had loaded the vessel again with such goods he knew we were willing to trade and that afterwards they had resolved to bring the great ship out of the harbour to lie where we were that so we might make what bargain we thought ﬁt only william said he had promised in our name that we should use violence with them nor detain any of the vessels after we had done trading with them i told him we would strive to outdo them in civility and that we would make good every part of his agreement in token whereof i caused white ﬂag likewise to be spread at the poop of our great ship which was the signal agreed on to the third vessel which came with them it was kind of bark of the country who having intelligence of our design to trafﬁc came off to deal with us bringing good deal of gold and some provisions which at that time we were very glad of in short we traded upon the high seas with these men and indeed we made very good market and yet sold thieves pennywor ths too we sold here about sixty ton of spice chieﬂy cloves and nutmegs and above two hundred bales of european goods such

present of european linen and stuff themselves recompens what we had taken from them so we sent them away exceedingly well satisﬁed here it was that william gave an account that while he was on board the japanese vessel he met with kind of religious or japan priest who spoke some word s of english to him and being very inquisitive to know how he came to learn any of those words he told him that there was in his country thirteen englishmen he called them englishmen very articulately and distinctly he had conversed with them very frequently and freely he said that they were all that were left of men who came on shore on the north side of japan being driven upon great rock in stormy night where they lost their ship and the rest of their men were drowned that he had persuaded the king of his country to send boats off to the rock or island where the ship was lost to save the rest of the men and to bring them on shore which was done and they were used very kindly and had houses 49 built them and land given them to plant provision and that they lived by themselves he said he went frequently among them to persuade them to worship their god an idol i suppose of their own making which he said they ungratefully refused and that therefore the king had once or twice ordered them all to be put to death but that he said he had prevailed upon the king to spare them and let them live their own way long they were quiet and peaceable and did not go about to withdraw others from the worship of the country i asked william why he did not inquire from whence they came i did said william how could i but think it strange said he to hear him talk of englishmen on the north side of japan well said i what account did he give of it an account said william that will surprise thee and all the

it piece of paper where it was written in an englishman hand and in plain english words thus and says william i read it myself w come from gree nland and from the north pole this indeed was amazing to us all and more so to those seamen among us who knew anything of the inﬁnite attempts which had been made from europe well by the english the dutc h to discover passage that way into those parts of the world and william pressed earnestly to go on to the north to rescue those poor men so the ship 50 company began to incline to it and in word we all come to this that we would stand in to the shore of formosa to ﬁnd this priest again and have further account of it all from him accordingly the sloop went over but when they came there the vessels were very unhappily sailed and this put an end to our inquiry after them and perhaps may have disappointed mankind of one of the most noble discoveries that ever was made or will again be made in the world the good of mankind in general but so much that william was so uneasy at losing this opportunity that he pressed us earnestly to go up to japan to ﬁnd out these men he told us that if it was nothing but to recover thirte en honest poor men from kind of captivity which they would otherwise never be redeemed from and the project gutenberg ebook of book of english prose part ii arranged secondary and high schools by percy lubbock https they might some time or other be murdered by the barbarous people in defence of their idolatry it were very well worth our while and it would be in some measure making amends the mischiefs we had done in the world but we that had conce rn upon us the mischiefs we had done had much less about any satisfactions to be made it so he found that kind of discourse would weigh very little with us then he pressed us very earnestly to let him have the sloop to go by himself and i told him i would not oppose it but when he came to the sloop none of the men would go with him the case was plain they had all share in the cargo of the great ship well in that of the sloop and the richness of the cargo was such that they would not leave it by any means so poor william much to 51 his mortiﬁcation was obliged to give it over what becam of those thirteen men or whether they are not there still i can give account of captain singleton jona than swift the art of conversation i have observed few obvious subjects to have been so seldom or at least so slightly handled this and indeed i know few so difﬁcult to be treated it ought nor yet upon which there seemeth so much to be said most things pursued by men the happiness of public or private life our wit or folly have so reﬁned that they seldom subsist but in idea true friend good marriage perfect form of government with some others require so many ingredients so good in their several kinds and so much niceness in mixing them that some thousands of years men have despaired of reducing their schemes to perfection but in conversation it is or might be otherwise here we are only to avoid multitude of errors which although matter of some difﬁculty may be in every man power want of which it remaineth mere an idea the other therefore it seemeth to that the truest way to understand conversation is to know the faults and errors to which it is subject and from thence every man to form maxims to himself whereby it may be regulated because it requireth few talents to which most men are 52 not born or at least may not acquire without any great genius or study nature hath left every man capacity of being agreeable though not of shining in company and there are an hundred men sufﬁciently qualiﬁed both who by very few faults that they might correct in half an hour are not so much tolerable i was prompted to write my thoughts upon this subject by mere indignation to reﬂect that so useful and innocent pleasure so ﬁtted every period and condition of life and so much in all men power should be so much neglected and abused and in this discourse it will be necessa ry to note those errors that are obviou s well others which are seldomer observed since there are few so obvious or acknowledged the project gutenberg ebook of

talking too much yet i rarely remember to have seen ﬁve people together where some one among them hath not been predominant in that kind to the great constraint and disgust of all the rest but among

history of their lives will relate the annals of their diseases with the several sympt oms and circumstances of them will enumerate the hardships and injustice they have suffered in court in parliament in love or in law others are more dexterous and with great art will lie on the watch to hook in their own praise they will call witness to remember they always foretold what would happen in such case but none would believe them they advised such man from the beginning and told him the consequences just they happened but he would have his own way others make vanity of telling their faults they are the strangest men in the world they can not dissemble they own it is folly they have lost abundance of advantages by it but if you would give them the world they can not help it there is something in their nature that abhors insincerity and constraint with many other insuf ferable topics of the same altitude of such mighty importance every man is to himself and ready to think he is so to others without once making this easy and obvious reﬂection that his affairs can have more weight with other men than theirs have with him and how little that is he is sensible enough where company hath met i often have observed 54 two persons discov er by some accident that they were bred together at the same school or university after which the rest are condemned to silence and to listen while

until his spirits circulate again to the same point there are some faults in conversation which none are so subject to the men of wit nor ever so much when they are with each other if they have opened their mouths without endeavouring to say witty thing they think it is so many words lost it is torment to the hearers much to themselves to see them upon the rack invention and in perpetual constraint with so little success they must something extraordinary in order to acquit themselves and answer their character else the may be disappointed and be apt to think them only like the rest of mortals i

informed or entertained but to display 55 his own talents his business is to be good company and not good conversation and therefore he chooseth to frequent those who are content to listen and profess themselves his admirers and indeed the worst conversation i ever remember to have heard in my life was that at will coffeehouse where the wits they were called used formerly to assemble that is to say ﬁve or six men who had writ plays or at least prologues or had share in miscellany came thither and entertained one another with their triﬂing composures in so important an air if they had been the noblest efforts of human nature or that the fate of kingdoms depended on them and they were usually attended with an humble audience of young students from the inns of court or the universities who at due distance listened to these oracles and returned home with great contempt their law and philosophy their heads ﬁlled with trash under the name of politeness criticism and belles lettr es by these means the poets many years past were all overrun with pedantry i take it the word is not properly used because pedantry is the too frequent or unreasonable obtruding our own knowledge in common

gentleman who does not little value himself upon his ancient descent i expected he would give some account of them we were now arrived at the upper end of the gallery when the knight faced towards one of the pictures and we stood before it he entered into the matter after his blunt way of saying things they occur to his imagination without regul ar introduction or care to preserve the appearance of chain of thought it is said he worth while to consider the force of dress and how the persons of one age differ from those of another merely by that only one may observe also that the general fashion

an excellent husbandman but had resolved not to exceed such degree of wealth all above it he bestowed in secret bounties many years after the sum he aimed at his own use was attained yet he did not

partridge take their places partridge immediately declared it was the ﬁnest place he had ever been in when the ﬁrst music was played he said it was wonder how so many ﬁddlers could play at one time without putting one another out while the fellow was lighting the upper candles he cried out to mrs miller look look madam the very picture of the man in the end of the book before the gunpowder service nor could he help observing with sigh when all the candles were lighted that here were candles enough burnt in one night to keep an honest poor family whole soon the play which was ham let prince of denmark began partridge was all attention nor did he break silence till the entrance of the ghost upon which he asked jones what man was that in the strange dress something said he like what i have seen in picture sure it is not armour is it jones answered that is the ghost to which partridge replied with smile persuade to that sir if you can though i ca say i ever actually saw ghost in my life yet i am certain i should know one if i saw him better than that comes to sir ghosts appear in such dresses that neither in this mistake which caused much 66 laughter in the neighbourhood of partridge he was suffered to continue till the scene between the ghost and hamlet when partridge gave that credit to mr garrick the project gutenberg ebook of book of english prose part ii arranged secondary and high schools by percy lubbock https had denied to jones and fell into so violent trembling that his knees knocked against each other jones asked him what was the matter and whether he was afraid of the warrior upon the stage la sir said he i perceive now it is what you told i am not afraid of anything i know it is but play and if it was really ghost it could one harm at such distance and in so much company and yet if i was frightened i am not the only person why who cries jones dost thou take to be such coward here besides thyself nay you may call coward if you will but if that little man there upon the stage is not frightened i never saw any man frightened in my life ay ay go along with you ay to be sure who fool then will you lud have mercy upon such happens it is good enough you i follow the devil soon nay perhaps it is the they say he can put on what likeness he here he is farther you have gone far enough already farther than i have gone all the king dominions jones offered to speak but partridge cried hush hush dear sir you hear him and during the whole speech of the ghost he sat with his eyes ﬁxed partly on the ghost and partly on hamlet and with his mouth open the same passions which succeeded each other in hamlet succeeding likewise in him when the scene was over jones said why partridge 67 you exceed my expectations you enjoy the play more than i conceived possible nay sir answered partridge if you are not afraid of the devil i ca help it but to be sure it is natural to be surprised at such things though i know there is nothing in them not that it was the ghost that surprised neither i should have known that to have been only man in strange dress but when i saw the little man so frightened himself it was that which took hold of and dost thou imagine then partridge cries jones that he was really frightened nay sir said partridge did not you yourself observe afterwards when he found it was his own father spirit and how he was murdered in the garden how his fear forsook him by degrees and he was struck dumb with sorrow it were just i should have been had it been my own case hush la what noise is that there he is ell to be certain though i know there is nothing at all in it i am glad i am not down yonder where those men are then turning his eyes again upon hamlet ay you may draw your sword what signiﬁes sword against the power of the devil during the second act partridge made very few remarks he greatly admired the ﬁneness of the dresses nor could he help observing upon the king countenance well said he how people may be deceived by faces nulla ﬁdes fronti is i ﬁnd true saying who would think by looking in the king face that he had ever committed murder he then inquired after the ghost but jones who intended that he should be surprised gave him other satisfaction than that 68 he might possibly see him again soon and in ﬂash of ﬁre partridge sat in fearful expectation of this and now when the ghost made his appearance partridge cried out there sir now what say you now is he frightened now or much frightened you think and to be sure nobody can help some fears i would not be in so bad condition what his name squire hamlet is there all the world bless what become of the spirit i am living soul i thought i saw him sink into the earth indeed you saw right answered jones well well cries partridge i know it is only play and besides if there was anything in all this madam miller would not laugh so to you sir you would not be afraid i believe if the devil was here in y the project gutenberg ebook of book of english prose part ii arranged secondary and high schools by percy lubbock https you are in such passion shake the vile wicked wretch to pieces if she was my own mother i would serve her so to be sure all duty to mother is forfeited by such wicked y go about your business i hate the sight of you our critic was now pretty silent till the play which hamlet introduces before the king this he did not at ﬁrst understand till jones explained it to him but he sooner entered into the spirit of it than he began to bless himself that he had never committed murder then turning to mrs miller he asked her if she did not imagine the king looked if he was touched though he is said he good actor and doth all he can to hide it well i would not have so much to answer that wicked man there hath to sit upon much higher 69 chair that he sits upon wonder he runs away your sake i never trust an innocent face again the grave digging scene next engaged the attention of partridge who expressed much surprise at the number of skulls thrown upon the stage to which jones answered that it was one of the most famous about town wonder then cries partridge that the place is haunted but i never saw in my life worse i had sexton when i was clerk that should have dug three graves while he is digging one the fellow handles spade if it was the ﬁrst time he had ever had one in his hand ay ay you may sing you had rather sing than work i believe hamlet taking up the skull he cried out well it is strange to see how fearless some men are i never could bring myself to touch anything belonging to dead man on any seemed frightened enough too at the ghost i thought nemo omnibus horis sapit little more worth remembering occurred during the play at the end of which jones asked him which of the players he had liked best to this he answered with some appearance of indignation at the question the king without doubt indeed mr partridge says mrs miller you are not of the same opinion with the town they are all agreed that hamlet is acted by the best player who ever was on the stage he the best player cries partridge with contemptuous sneer why i could act well he myself i am sure if i had seen ghost i should have looked in the very same manner and done just he did and then 70 to be sure in that scene you called it between him and his mother where you told he acted so ﬁne why lord help any man that is any good man that had such mother would have done exactly the same i know you are only joking with but indeed madam though i was never at play in london yet i have seen acting before in the country and the king my money he speaks all his words distinctly half loud again the other ybody may see he is an actor while mrs miller was thus engaged in conversation with partridge lady came up to mr jones whom he immediately knew to be mrs fitzpatrick she said she had seen him from the other part of the gallery and had taken that opportunity of speaking to him she had something to say which might be of great service to himself she then acquainted him with her lodgings and made him an appointment the next day in the morning which upon recollection she presently changed to the afternoon at which time jones promised to attend her thus ended the adventure at the where partridge had afforded great mirth not only to jones and mrs miller but to all who sat within hearing who were more attentive to what he said than to anything that passed on the the project gutenberg ebook of book of english prose part ii arranged secondary and high schools by percy lubbock https durst not go to bed all that

there it is tom jones 71 samuel johnson journey in in stage coach the passengers are the most part wholly unknown to one another and without expectation of ever meeting again when their journey is at an end one should therefore imagine that it was of little importance to any of them what conjectures the rest should form concerning him yet so it is that all think themselves secure from detection all assume that character of which they are most desirous and on occasion is the general ambition of superiority more apparently indulged on the day of our departure in the twilight of the morning i ascended the vehicle with three men and two women my fellow travellers it was easy to observe the affecte d elevation of mien with which every one entered and the supercilious civility with which they paid their compliments to each other when the ﬁrst ceremony was dispatched we sat silent long time all employed in collecting importance into our faces and endeavouring to strike reverence and submission into our companions it is always observable that silence propagates itself and that the longer talk has been suspended the more difﬁcult it is to ﬁnd any thing to say we began now to wish conversation but one seemed inclined to descend from his dignity or ﬁrst to propose topic of discourse at last corpulent gentleman who had equipped himself this expedition with scarlet surtout 72 and large hat with broad lace drew out his watch looked on it in silence and then held it dangling at his ﬁnger this was i suppose understood by all the company an invitation to ask the time of the day but nobody appeared to heed his overture and his desire to be talking so far overcame his resentment that he let us know of his own accord that it was past ﬁve and that in two hours we should be at breakfast his condescension was thrown away we continued all obdurate the ladies held up their heads i amused myself with watching their behaviour and of the other two one seemed to employ himself in counting the trees we drove by them the other drew his hat over his eyes and counterfeited slumber the man of benevolence to shew that he was not depressed by our neglect hummed tune and beat time upon his snuf thus universally displeased with one another and not much delighted with ourselves we came at last to the little inn appointed our repast and all began at once to recompense ourselves the restraint of silence by innumerable questions and orders to the people that attended us at last what every one had called was got or declared impossi ble to be got at that time and we were persuaded to sit round the same table when the gentleman in the the project gutenberg ebook of book of english prose part ii arranged secondary and high schools by percy lubbock https looked again upon his watch told us that we had half an hour to spare but he was sorry to see so little merriment among us that all were the time upon the level and that it was always his way to make himself one of the company i remember says he it was on just such morning this that i and my lord mumble and the 73 duke of tenterden were out upon ramble we called at little house it might be this and my landlady i warrant you not suspecting to whom she was talking was so jocular and facet ious and made so many merry answers to our questions that we were all ready to burst with laughter at last the good woman happening to overhear whisper the duke and call him by his title was so surprised and confounded that we could scarcely get word from her and the duke never met from that day to this but he talks of the little house and quarrels with terrifying the landlady he had scarcely time to congratulate himself on the veneration which this narrative must have procured him from the company when one of the ladies having reached out plate on distant part of the table began to remark the inconveniences of travelling and the difﬁculty which they who never sat at home without great number of attendants found in performing themselves such ofﬁces the road required but that people of quality often travelled in disguise and might be generally known from the vulgar by their condescension to poor keepers and the allowance which they made any defect in their entertainment that her part while people were civil and meant well it was never her custom to ﬁnd fault one was not to expect upon

vivacity of his looks and frequent diversion of his eyes from one object to another upon this closed his and told us that he had hundred times talked with the chancellor and the judges on the subject of the stocks that his part he did not pretend to be well acquainted with the principles on which they were established but had always heard them reckoned pernicious to trade uncertain in their produce and unsolid in their foundation and that he had been advised by three judges his most intimate friends never to venture his money in the funds but to put it out upon land security till he could light upon an estate in his own country it might be expected that upon these glimpses of latent dignity we should all have begun to look round us with veneration and have behaved like the princes of romance when the enchantment that disguises them is disso lved and they discover the dignity of each other yet it happened that none of these hints made much impression on the company everyone was apparently suspected of endeavouring to impose false appearances upon the rest all continued their haughtiness in hopes to enforce their claims and all grew every hour more sullen because they found their representations of themselves without ef fect 75 thus we travelled on four days with malevolence perpetually increasing and without any endeavour but to outvie each other in superciliousness and neglect and when any two the project gutenberg ebook of book of english prose part ii arranged secondary and high schools by percy lubbock https could separate ourselves moment we vented our indignation at the sauciness of the rest at length the journey was at an end and time and chance that strip off all disguises have discovered that the intimate of lords and dukes is
