my soul could see chance to pay my tribute one and another have written of what was and will be his valuable service to economic thought and progress of the effects of his mediation of labor disputes in the northwest and throughout the nation and of his inestimable qualities friend comrade and teacher he gave federal mediator runs one estimate of him all his unparalleled knowledge and understanding of labor and its point of view that knowledge that understanding he gained not by academic investigation but by working in mines and woods in shops and on farms he had the trust and conﬁdence of both sides in disputes between labor and capital his services were called in whenever trouble was brewing thanks to him strikes were averted of the most vital importance threatened by misunderstandings and smouldering discontent went on but almost every one who has written publication has told of but one side of him and there were such countless sides would it then be so out of place if i his wife could write of all of him even to the manner of husband he was i have hesitated some months to this he had not yet made so truly national name perhaps to warrant any assumption that such work would be acceptable many of his close friends have asked to just this however they realize i so strongly that his life was so big so full so potential that even the story of man it would be worth the the project gutenberg ebook of an american idyll by author https at the risk of sharing intimacies that should be kept in one heart only i long to have the world know something of the life we led together an old friend wrote dear splendid carl the very embodiment of life energized and joyful to degree i have never known and the thought of the separation of you two makes turn cold the world can never be the same to with carl out of it i loved his high spirit his helpfulness his humor his adoration of you knowing you and carl and seeing your life together has been one of the most perfect things in my life an eastern professor who had visited at our home from time to time wrote you have lost one of the ﬁnest husbands i have ever known ever since i have known the parker family i have considered their home life ideal i had hoped that the too few hours i spent in your home might be multiplied many times in coming years i have never known man more in love with woman than carl was with you so i write of him these reasons because i must to ease my own feelings because his life was so well worth writing about because so many friends have sent word to some day when you have the time i hope you will sit down and write about carl newer friends asking especially about his earlier years the older friends wishing to know of his later interests and especially of the last months and i have written to one death i can answer them all this way and lastly there is the most intimate reason of all i want our children to know about their just his academic worth his public career but the life he led from day to day if i live till they are old enough to understand i of course can tell them if not how are they to know and so in the last instance this is document them march 17 1919 an american idyll chapter i such hosts of memories come tumbli ng in on more than ﬁfteen years ago on september 3 1903 i met carl parker he had just returned to college two weeks late the beginning of his senior year there was much concern among his friends he had gone on two months into the wilds of idaho and had planned to return in time college i met him his ﬁrst afternoon in berkeley he was on the top of ladder helping put up an awning our sorority dance that evening uttering his proverbial joyous banter to any one who came along be it the man with the cakes the sedate fellow or the girls busying about thus he was introduced to freshman of two weeks he called down gayly how you young lady within week we were fast friends i looking up to him freshman would to senior and senior seven years older than herself at that within month i remember deciding that if ever i became engaged i would tell carl parker before i told any one else on earth after about two months he called one evening with his pictures of idaho such treat my soul did have i still have the map he drew that night with the trails and marked and i said innocence itself i going to idaho on my honeymoon and he said i not going to marry till i ﬁnd girl who wants to go to idaho on her honeymoon then we both the project gutenberg ebook of an american idyll by author https the deciding event in his eyes was when we planned our ﬁrst long walk in the berkeley hills certain saturday november 22 and that morning it rained one of the tenets i was brought up on by my father was that bad weather was never an excuse postponing anything so i took it granted that we would start on our walk planned carl telephoned anon and said of course the walk is of but why i asked the rain he answered if that makes any dif ference at which he gasped little and said all right he be around in minute which he was in his idaho outﬁt the lunch he had suggested being entirely responsible bulging one pocket off we started in the rain and such day we had we climbed grizzly peak only we did not know it the fog and rain just over the summit in the shelter of very drippy oak tree we sat down lunch fairly sanctiﬁed expression came over carl face he drew forth rather damp and paper king might look who uncovered the chest of his most precious court jewels before courtier deemed worthy of that honor and before my puzzled and somewhat doubtful eyes he spread his nothing but jerked i never had seen jerked anything let alone tasted it i was used to the conventional picnic sandwiches done up in waxed paper plus stuffed egg fruit and cake i was ready lunch after the conservative pattern and here i gazed upon mess of most wrinkled shrunken jerked bear the rain dropping down on it through the oak tree i would have gasped if i had not caught the look of awe and reverence on carl face he gazed eagerly and with what respect on his offering i merely took hunk of what was supplied set my teeth into it and pulled it was salty very it looked queer tasted queer was queer yet that lunch we walked farther sat now and then under other drippy trees and at last decided that we must slide home by that time soaked to the skin and i minus the heel to one shoe i had just got myself out of the bath and into dry clothes when the telephone rang it was carl could he come over to the house and spend the rest of the afternoon it was then about four he came and from then on things were ferent how i should love to go into the details of that freshman year of mine i am happier right now writing about it than i have been in six months i shall not go into to say that the night of the junior prom of my freshman year carl parker asked to marry him and two days later up again in our hills i said that i would to think of that to think of waiting two whole days to decide whether i would marry carl parker or not and fourteen years from the day i met him there was never one small moment of misunderstanding one day that was not when we were parted perhaps there are people who would consider it stupid boresome to live in such peace that all i can answer is that it was not stupid it was not how far from it in fact in those early days we took our vow that the one thing we would never was to let the world get commonplace us that the time should never come when we would not be eager the start of each new day the kipling poem we loved the most it was the spirit of both of us was the long trail you know the last of it the lord knows what we may ﬁnd dear lass and the deuce knows what we may but we back once more on the old trail our own trail the out trail we down hull down on the long trail that is always new the project gutenberg ebook of an american idyll by author https ii after we decided to get married and that soon ever we could being freshman at the ripe and mature age of mentioned just eighteen years he senior with particular prospects not even sure yet what ﬁeld he would go into began discussing what we might and where we might go our main idea was to get far away from everybody we could and live the very fullest life we could and at last we decided on persia why persia i can not recall the steps now that brought us to that conclusion but i know that ﬁrst christmas i sent carl my picture in frilled graduation frock and silk persian ﬂag tucked behind it and that ﬂag remained always the symbol us that we would neve r let our lives get stale never lose the love of adventure never settle down intellectually at any rate can you see my father face that sunny march day day it was we told him we were engaged my father being the conventional traditional sort who had never let have real caller even lest i become interested in boys and think of matrimony too young carl parker was the ﬁrst male person who was ever allowed at my home in the evening he came seldom since i was living in berkeley most of the time and anyway we much preferred prowling all over our end of creation policeman fashion also when i married according to father it was to be some one preferably an attorney of parts about to become judge with large bank account instead at eighteen i and this senior stood before him and said we are going to be married or words to that general effect is where i want you to think of the expression on my conservative father face fairly early in the conversation he found breath to say and what may i ask are your prospects none just at present and where may i ask are you planning to begin this married career you seem to contemplate in persia can you see my father persia yes persia and what goodness sake are you two going to in persia we know just yet of course but we ﬁnd something i can see my father point of view now though i am not sure but that i shall prefer our daughter who would contemplate absolute uncertainty in persia in preference to an assured legal professio n in oakland california it was two years before my father became at all sympathetic and that condition was far from enthusiastic so it was great joy to to have him say few months before his death you know cornelia i want you to understand that if i had had the world to pick from i have chosen carl parker your husband your marriage is constant source of satisfaction to i saw carl parker lose his temper once and once only it was that ﬁrst year that we knew each other because there was such difference between his age and mine the girls in my sorority house refused to believe there could be anything serious about our going together so much and took great pains to assure in private that of course carl meant nothing by his attentions which i agreed volubly they scolded him in private because it would spoil freshman to have senior so attentive we always compared notes later and were much the project gutenberg ebook of an american idyll by author https words were one thing actions another since there could be nothing serious in our relationship naturally there was reason why we should be left alone if there was to be rally or concert the senior sitting at the head of the dinner would ask how many are going with man hands how many of the girls are going together hands then to are you going with carl faint yes the n we all go along with you carl stood it he beheld this cavalcade bear away in our wake then he gritted his teeth and announced never again the next college occasion was rally at the greek theatre again it was announced at the table that all the unescorted ones would accompany carl and i foresaw trouble when i came downstairs later with my hat and coat on there stood carl surrounded by about six girls all hastily buttoning their gloves his sister who knew more of the truth about carl and than the others being one of them never had i seen such look on carl face and i never did again his feet were spread apart his jaw was set and he was glaring when he saw he said come on and we dashed the door sister helen ﬂew after us but other girls carl stuck his head around the corner of the front door called deﬁantly damn the other girls banged the door to and we ﬂed never again were we molested carl ﬁnished his senior year and full year it was him he was editor of the pelican the university funny paper and of the university of california magazine the most serious publication on the campus outside the technical journals he made every honor organization there was to make except the phi beta kappa he and fellow student wrote the successful senior extravaganza he was reader in econom ics and graduated with honors and he saw every single day i feel like digressing here moment to assail that old my father along with countless others held so fellow who is really worth while ought to know by his junior year in college just what his is to be few with an early developed special aptitude but very few carl entered college in august 1896 in engineering but after term found that it had further appeal him but fellow ought to stick to thing whether he likes it or not if one must be dogmatic then i say fellow should never work at anything he does not like one of the things in our case which brought such constant criticism from relatives and friends was that we changed around so much thank god we did it took carl parker until he was over thirty before he found just the work he loved the most and in which his soul was work and he was before he found just the phase of economic study that ﬁred him to his full loved ﬁeld of the application of psychology to economics and some one would have had him stick to engineering because he started in engineering he hurt his knee in his freshman year at college and ﬁnally had to leave going to phoenix arizona and then back to the parker ranch at vacaville the better part of year the family was away during that time and carl ran the place alone he returned to college in august 1898 this time taking up mining after year study in mining he wanted the practical side in the summer of 1899 he worked under ground in the hidden treasure mine placer county california in 1900 he left college again going to the gold and copper mines of rossland british columbia from august 1900 to may 1901 he worked in four different mines it was with considerable feeling of pride that he always added i got to be machine man before i quit it was at that time that he became member of the western federation of historical fact which inimical capitalists later endeavored to make use of from time to time to him harm how i loved to listen by the hour to the stories of those grilling at four in the and snow to crawl to his job with the blessing of dear old scotch landlady and pastie he would tell our sons of tamping in the sticks of dynamite till their eyes bulged the hundreds of times these last six months i wished i had in writing the stories of those all his days from early the project gutenberg ebook of an american idyll by author https on sometimes it would be an old vacaville crony who would appear and stories would ﬂy of those boy the exploits up putah creek with pee wee allen of the prayer when carl bet he could the minister son and won of the tediously assaults upon an ancient hired man on the place that would ﬁll book and delight the heart of tom sawyer himself and how his mother used to sigh and add to it all if only he had ever come home on time to his meals and he has one son just like him carl brothers tell just give up trying to get jim home on time mamma tried every scheme human could devise to make carl prompt his meals but nothing ever had the slightest effect half an hour past dinner he still be ﬁve miles from home one article that recently appeared in new york paper began they say of him that when he was small boy he displayed the same tendencies that later on made him great in his chosen ﬁeld his family possessed distinct tendency toward conformity and respectability but carl was companion of every in vacaville his respectable friends never won him away from his insatiable interest in the under they now know it makes valid his claim to achievement after the british columbia mining days he took what money he had saved and left idaho where he was to meet his chum hal bradley his ﬁrst idaho dream of theirs years the idaho stories he could why can i not remember them word word i have seen him hold roomful of students in berlin absolutely spellbound over those bit of parker coloring to be sure which one ever objected to i have seen him with group of staid faculty folk sitting breathless at his clearwater yarns and how he loved to tell those tales three and half months he and hal were ﬁshing jerking meat trailing after lost horses having his dreams of idaho come true if our sons fail to have those dreams when hal returned to college the wanderlust was still too strong in carl so he stopped off in spokane washington penniless to try there were more tales to delight gathering in spokane he took hand at reporting claiming to be person of large experience since only those of large experience were desired by the editor of the spokesman review he was given sport society and the tenderloin to cover at nine dollars week he never could go anywhere without making folks love him it was not long before he had his cronies among the sports kind souls in society who took him in and at least one strong loyal friend called him bub and gave him much excellent advice that he often used to refer to was the owner of the biggest in town spokane was wide open in those days and some town it was the society friends who seem to have saved his life nine dollars did not go far even then i have heard his hostesses tell of the meal he could consume but i been saving it all day with just ten cents in my pocket i met pal of those days who used to save carl considerable of his nine dollars by smooching his wash into his own home laundry about then carl older brother boyd who was somewhat fastidious ran into him in spokane he tells how carl insisted he should spend the night at his room instead of going to hotel is it far from here oh so they started out with boyd suitcase and walked and walked through the darndest part of town you ever saw finally after crossing untold railroad tracks and ducking around sheds and through alleys they came to that was holy fright it all right inside carl explained when they reached his room there was one not bed in the corner and red head showing snoring contentedly the project gutenberg ebook of an american idyll by author https who that the brother asked oh fellow i picked up somewhere where am i to sleep right in bed plenty big enough three and boyd says though it was 2 and miles from anywhere he lit out of there fast he could move and he adds i believe he even knew that boy name the reporting went rather lamely it seemed however the editor said that it read amateurish and he felt he would have to make change carl made some ﬁles where all the daily papers were kept and read and the yellowest of the yellow luck would have it that very night big ﬁre broke out in crowded apartment house it was not in carl beat but he decided to cover it anyhow along with the ﬁremen he managed to get upon the roof he jumped here he ﬂew there demolishing the only suit of clothes he owned but what an account he handed in the editor discarded entirely the story of the reporter sent to cover the ﬁre ran in carl word word and raised him to twelve dollars week but just the crown of reportorial success was lighting on his brow his mother made it plain to him that she preferred to have him return to college he bought ticket to vacaville was just about christmas time loaf of bread and can of sardines and with thirty cents in his pocket the extent of his worldly wealth he left california traveling in day coach all the way i remember his story of how about the end of the second day of bread and sardines he and with aforethought cultivated man opposite him who looked if he could afford to eat and how the man came through and asked carl if he would have dinner with him in the diner to hear him tell what and how much he order ed and of the expression and depression of the paying host it tided him over until he reached home mind the host all his mining experience plus the dark side of life contrasted with society he saw them both in spokane turned his interest to the ﬁeld of economics and when he entered college the next spring it was to major in that subject may and june 1903 he worked under ground in the of nanaimo in july he met nay moran in idaho his second idaho and it was on his return from this outing that i met him and ate his jerked meat and loved him and never stopped doing that one second chapter iii there were three boys in the parker family and one girl each of the other brothers had been encouraged to see the world and in his turn carl planned fourteen months in europe his serious objective being on his return to act extension secretary to professor stephens of the university of california who was preparing to organize extension work the ﬁrst time in california carl was to study the english extension system and also prepare some extension lecturing by that time we had come bit to our senses and i had realized that since there was money anyhow to marry on and since i was so young i had better stay on and graduate from college carl could have his trip to europe and get an option perhaps on tent in persia friend was telling recently of running into carl on the street just before he left europe and asking him what he was planning to the future carl the project gutenberg ebook of an american idyll by author https twinkle i know but what there room an energetic young man in asia minor i stopped writing here to read through carl european letters and laid aside about seven i wanted to quote from the accounts of three dinners at sidney and beatrice webb in knowing them always meant to him they perhaps have forgotten him but meeting the webbs and graham wallas and that english group could be nothing but events to young economic enthusiast one year out of college studying unionism in the london school of economics then there was his trip he was sent there by london ﬁrm to expert mine near johannesbur although he cabled ﬁve times said ﬁrm sent money the bitter disgust and anguish of those of us ever had much patience under such circumstances but he experted his mine and found it absolutely worthless explored the veldt on bicycle cooked little meals of bacon and mush wherever he found himself and wrote to meanwhile he learned much studied the coolie question investigated ings was entertained by his old college mining experts johanne sburg there was the letter telling of the bull ﬁght at zanzibar or delagoa bay or some seafaring port thereabouts that broke his heart it was such it made kappa tea look gory by comparison and the letter that regretfully admitted that perhaps after all persia would not just to settle down in about that time he wanted california with fearful want and was all done with foreign parts and declared that any place just big enough two suited did not need to be far away persia after all at last he borrowed money to get back to europe claiming that he had learned his lesson and learned it hard and ﬁnally he came home fast ever he could reach not stop even to telegraph i had planned months dress i knew he would love to have greet him in it was hanging ready in the closet it was i had started to the same room with freshman whom i was supposed to be rushing i heard soft my window my heart stopped beating i just grabbed raincoat and threw it over my hair down in braid and in the middle of sentence to the astounded freshman i dashed out my father had said if neither of you changes your mind while carl is away i have objection to your becoming engaged in about ten minutes after his return we were formally engaged on bench up in the deaf and dumb asylum favorite it would have been foolish to waste new dress on that night i was clad in cloth of gold all carl knew or cared or could see in the dark that matter the deserted freshman was sound asleep when i got joined another sorority thereafter time carl went into university extension lecturing on and south africa it did not please him altogether and ﬁnally my father lawye r himself persuaded him to go into law carl parker in law how we used to shudder at it afterwards but it was just one more broadening experience that he got out of life then came the san francisco earthquake that was the end of my junior year and we felt we had to be married when i ﬁnished else mattered quite much that so when an offer came out of clear sky from halsey and company carl to be on salary that assured matrimony within year though in afﬂuence and the bottom all out of the law business and enthusiasm it anyway we held consultation and decided bonds and marriage what carl made those who knew him knew what has been referred to the magic of his personality and could understand how he was having the whole of small country town asking him to dinner on his second visit i somehow got through my senior year but how the days dragged all i could think of was carl carl carl and getting married yet one on this had the fun out of their engaged days that we did when we were together carl used to say that the accumulated expenses of courting almost four years came to the project gutenberg ebook of an american idyll by author https guessed at though any cheap ﬁgure would have done we just did not care about doing things that happened to cost money we never did care in our lives and never would have cared matter what our income might be undoubtedly that was the main reason we were so blissful on such small salary in university could never think at the time of anything much we were doing without i remember that the happiest christmas we almost ever had was over in the country when we spent under two dollars all of us we were absolutely down to that year anyway it was just after we paid off our european debt carl gave book the pastor wife and we gloated over it together all christmas afternoon we gave each of the boys and ﬁve cents worth of were in their paradise i mended three shirts of carl that had been in my basket so long they were really like new to him forgotten he owned them them and hung the trio tied in tissue paper and red ribbon on the tree that was christmas he used to claim too that i got so excited over ﬁve cents worth of there was use investing in dollar worth of french mixed if one had the dollar we always loved tramping more than anything else and just prowling around the streets ending perhaps with an soda not any of it i have kept some little reminder of almost every spree we took in our four engaged years is book of sheer joy from cover to cover except always always the need of saying it got so that it seemed almost impossible to say it and then came the day when it did not have to be said each day of days september 7 1907 when we were married idaho our honeymoon had to be abandoned three weeks was the longest vacation period we could wring from soulless but not even idaho could have brought us more joy than our trip up the rogue river in southern oregon we hired an old buckboard and two ancient almost immobile horses needed scant attention with provisions gun rods and we started forth the woods were in their autumn glory the ﬁsh were biting corn was ripe along the roadside and river ade red blotches under every tree help yourselves the farmers would sing out or would not sing out it was all one to us i found that along with his every other accomplishment i had married an expert camp cook he found that he had married person who could not even boil rice the ﬁrst night out on our trip carl said you start the rice while i tend to the horses he knew i could not had planned to take course in domestic science on graduation however he preferred to marry earlier inexperienced than later experienced but evidently he thought even moron could boil rice the bride of his heart did not know that rice swelled when it boiled we were hungry we would want lots of rice so i put lots in by the time carl came back i had partly cooked rice in every utensil we owned including the cof and the and still he loved that honeymoon lazy horses poking unprodded along an almost deserted mountain road glimpses of the river lined with autumn reds and yellows camp made toward evening in any spot that looked all spots looked appealing two out consultation to ﬂies half an hour parting while one went up the river to try his luck one down joyous reunion with much luck or little luck but always enough supper trout rolled in cornmeal and fried corn on the cob just garnered from willing or unwilling farmer that afternoon most luscious in the world baked camper by the man of the party red red apples eaten by two people who had waited four years just that evenings in sandy nook by the river edge watching the stars come out above the water adventures such losing chocolada the brown horse and ﬁnding her up to her neck in deep stream running through grassy meadow with perpendicular banks on either side we walked miles till we found farmer with the aid of himself and his tools plus stout rope and tree in an afternoon time we dug and pulled and hauled and yanked chocolada up and out onto dry land more nearly dead than ever by that time the ancient senile had just fallen in while the project gutenberg ebook of an american idyll by author https made permanent camp one week miles up the river in spot so deserted that we had to cut the road through to reach it there we laundered our change of overalls and odds and ends using the largest cooking utensil boiling what was boiled and all the food tasted of ivory soap two days but we did not mind even that and then after three weeks back to skirts and collars and civilization and continued honeymoon from medford oregon to seattle washington doing all the coun try banks en route in portland we had to be separated one whole seemed nothing short of harrowing then came seattle and we had hundred dollars month to live on and every apartment we looked at rented from sixty dollars up finally in despair we took two wee rooms kitchen and bath forty dollars it was just before the panic in 1907 and rents were exorbitant and from having dollars spendin g money month before i was married i jumped to keeping two of us on sixty dollars which was what was left after the rent was paid i am not rationalizing when i say i am glad that we did not have cent more it was real sporting event to make both ends meet and we did it and saved dollar or so just to show we could any and every thing we commandeered to help maintain our solvency seattle was quite given to food fairs in those days and we kept weather eye out such we would eat lunch make the food show about three nibble at samples all afternoon and come home about eight having bought enough necessities here and there to keep our consciences from hurting much of the time carl had to be on the road selling bonds and we almost grieved our hearts out over that in fact we got desperate and when carl was offered an assistant cashiership in bank in ellensbur g washington we were just about to accept it when the panic came and it was all retrenchment in banks then we planned farming planned it with determination it was too awful those each got worse and harder than the last we had divine days in between to be sure when we prowl out into the woods around the city with picnic lunch or bummel along the waterfront ending at counter we knew which produced or the man behind it produced delectable and cheap clubhouse sandwiches the bond business and business conditions generally in the northwest got worse and worse in march after six months of seattle we were called back to the san francisco ofﬁce business results were better carl salary was raised considerably but there were still separations chapter iv on july 3 the marvelous son was born and never was there such father even the trained nurse hardened to new fathers by years of experience admitted that she never had seen any one take parenthood quite so hard four times in the night he crept in to see if the baby was surely breathing we were in very quiet neighborhood yet the next day being fourth of july now and then pop would be heard at each report of block away carl would dash out and vehemently protest to group of scornful youngsters that they would wake our son if baby would seriously consider waking if giant went of f under his bed those were magic days three of us in the family instead of separations harder than ever once in all the ten and half years we were married i saw carl parker downright discouraged over his own affairs and that was the day i met him down town in oakland and he announced that he just could not stand the bond business any longer he had come to dislike it heartily business and then leaving the boy and was not worth the whole ﬁnancial world put together since his european experience the webbs and their kind had had hankering university work but he felt the project gutenberg ebook of an american idyll by author https money return was so small he simp ly could not contemplate raising family on it but now we were desperate we longed life that would give us the maximum chance to be together we decided that university work would give us that opportunity and the long vacations would give us our mountains the work itself made its strong appeal too professor henry morse stephens and professor miller of the university of california had long urged carl to go into teaching and at last we decided that even if it meant living on husks and skimmed milk all our days at least we would be eating what there was to eat together three meals day every day we cashed in our savings we drew on everything there was to draw on and on february 1 1909 the three of us embarked dollars and cents to pay at the depot such young ignoramuses we were that trip east was worth any future hardship we might have reaped our old baby was one of the young saints of the once in the ﬁve days did he peep we pin him securely in the lower berth of our compartment his nap and back we would ﬂy to the corner of the rear platform of the observation car and gloat just gloat over how we had come into the inheritance of all creation we owned the world and i who had never been farther from my california home town than seattle who never had seen real snow except that christmas when we spent four days at the scenic hot springs in the cascades and skied and sledded and spilled around like but stretches and stretches of snow and then just traveling and together and to be in boston we took room with bath in the copley square hotel the ﬁrst evening we arrived nandy carleton rolled off the bed so when we went gallivanting about boston shopping the new home we left him in the where he could not fall out we padded it well with pillows there was big window letting in plenty of fresh air and we instructed the chambermaid to peep at him now and then and there we would leave him and asleep by the time that story had been passed around by enough people in the home town it developed that one day the just seven months old up and turned on the water and was found by the chambermaid sinking the third time something happened to the draft from the home bank which should have reached boston almost at the same time we did we gazed into the family one ﬁne morning to ﬁnd it to all intents and purposes empty hurried meeting of the ﬁnance committee by unanimous consent of all present we many another mortal in strange town has the pawnshop i wonder if my dear grandmother will read she probably will carl ﬁrst submitted his gold baby had dropped it once and it had shrunk thereby in the eyes of the pawnshop man though not in ours the only other valuable we had along with us was my grandmother wedding present to which had been my grandfather wedding present to glorious we were allowed ﬁfty dollars on it which saved the day what will my grandmother say when she knows that her bridal gift resided some days in boston pawnshop we moved out to cambridge in due time and settled at bromley court on the very edge of the yard we thrilled to all of drank in every ounce of dignity and tradition the place afforded and our wild western souls exulted we knew one when we reached boston but our ﬁrst sunday we were invited to dinner in cambridge by two people who were ever after our cordial faithful and john graham broo ks they made us feel at once that cambridge was not the socially icy place it is painted in song and story then i remember the afternoon that i had week wash strun g on an improvised line back and forth from one end of our apartment to the other just i hung the last damp garment the bell rang and there stood an immaculate gentleman in cutaway and silk hat who had come to old friend of my mother he ducked under wet clothes and we set two chairs where we could see each other and yet nothing was dripping down either of our necks and there we conversed and he ended by inviting us both to marlborough street at that he must have loved my mother the project gutenberg ebook of an american idyll by author https to have sought further acquainta nce with folk who hung the family wash in the hall and the and his house on marlborough street we boldly and excitedly ﬁgured up on the way home that they spent on the one meal they fed us more than it cost us to live two honestly did then there was the dear jello lady at the market i wish she would somehow happen to read this so to know that we have never forgotten her every saturday the three of us went to the market and there was the jello lady with her samples the helpings she dished us each time she brought the man to whom she was engaged to call on us just before we left i wonder if they got married and where they are and if she still remembers us she used to say she just waited saturdays and our coming then there was dear granny jones who kept half block away i not remember how we came to know her but some good angel saw to it she used to send around little bowls of luscious dessert and half pie or some hot mufﬁns then i was always grateful it made such good story and it was the new england wife of fellow graduate student who remarked when i told her we had one baby and another on the way how like the slums we did our own work of course and we lived on next to nothing i wonder now how we kept so well that year of course we fed the baby everything he should have to holt in those days we ate the mutton left from his broth and the beef after the juice had been squeezed out of it him and bought storage eggs ourselves and queer butter out of barrel and were absolutely absolutely blissful perhaps we should have spent more on food and less on baseball i am glad we did not almost every saturday afternoon that ﬁrst semester we fared forth early nandy in his to get seat in the front row of the baseball grandstand i remember one saturday we were late front seats all taken we had to pack baby and more than up to the top there we barricaded him still in the in the middle of the aisle along about the seventh inning the game waxed particularly were beside ourselves with enthusiasm fellow onlookers seemed even more called out seemed to be calling in our direction fine parents we was nandy and all down the grandstand steps i remember again the stadium on the day of the big track meet every time the ofﬁcial announcer would put the megaphone to his mouth to call out winners and time to hushed and eager throng nandy not yet year old would begin to squeal at the top of his lungs joy nobody could hear word the ofﬁcial said we were distressed any too had pencils poised to jot down records carl studied very hard the ﬁrst few weeks until we got used to the new wonder of things he used to run home from colleg whenever he had spare minute just to be sure he was that near at that time he was rather preparing to go into transportation his main economic subject but by the end of the year he knew labor would be his love his ﬁrst published economic article was short one that appeared in the quarterly journal of economics may 1910 on the decline of membership we had tragic summer carl felt that he must take his master degree but he had foreign langua ge three terrible wicked unfor givable professors assured him that if he could be in germany six weeks during summer vacation he could get enough german to pass the examination the we believed them and he went though of all the partings we ever had that was the very worst almost at the last he just could not go but we were so sure that it would solve the whole problem he went third class on german steamer since we had money nothing better the food did distress even his unﬁnicky soul after particularly sad offering of salt herring uncooked on particularly rough day he wrote i ﬁnd i am not good hambur ger german the latter eat all things in all weather oh the misery of that summer we never talked about it much he went to freiburg to german cobbler family but later changed the cobbler son looked upon him dispensation of providence sent to practise his english upon his heart was breaking the project gutenberg ebook of an american idyll by author https was breaking and he was working at german and languages came fearfully hard him morning afternoon and night with two lessons day his only diversion being daily walk up hill with cake of soap and towel to secluded waterfall he discovered he wrote letter and postcard day to the babe and i have just all of them and my heart aches afresh the homesickness that summer meant to both of us he got back two days before our weddin g like those ﬁrst few after our reunion are not given to many mortals i would say one had ever tasted such joy the baby gurgled about and was kissed within an inch of his life the jello lady sent around dessert of sixteen different colors more or less big enough family of eight her welcome home about six weeks later we called our beloved from banquet he had long looked forward to in order to ofﬁciate at the birth of our second known elizabeth up to october 17 but from about that night james stratton parker we named him after my grandfather the simple reason that we liked the name jim how we chuckled when my father congratulatory telegram came in which he claimed pleasure at having the boy named after his father but cautioned us never to allow him to be nicknamed i remember the boresome youth who used to call week in week out always just before meal we were so hard up and got so that we resented feeding such an impossible person so many times he dropped in at noon friday the 17th lunch few days later carl met him on the street and announced rapturously the arrival of the new son the impossible person hemmed and stammered did it arrive carl all beams replied the very evening of the day you were at our house lunch we never laid eyes on that man again we were almost four months longer in cambridge but never did he step foot inside our apartment i wish some one could have him but it too late now he died about year after we left cambridge i always felt that he never got over the shock of having escaped jim arrival by such narrow mar gin and right here i must tell of he was recommended the best doctor in cambridge but very expensive we may have to economize in everything on earth said carl but we never economize on doctors so we had had him all the minor upsets that families need doctors had him when jim was born had him through queer fever nandy develope d that lasted some time had him through bad case of grippe i got this was at christmastime and carl took care of both babies did all the cooking even to the christmas turkey i was well enough to eat by then got up every two hours three nights to change an i had to the kind of man he was had him vaccinate both children and then just before we left cambridge we sat and held his bill afraid to open the envelope at length we gathered our courage and gazed upon charges of dollars everything with wonderful note which said that if we would be inconvenienced in paying that he would not mind at all if he got nothing such excitement we had expected two hundred dollars at the least we tore out and bought ten cents worth of doughnuts to celebrate when we exclaimed to him over his goodness course we paid the dollars he said was you think doctor is blind and does man go steerage to europe if he has lot of money in the bank bless that doctor heart bless all doctors hearts we went through our married life in the days of our ﬁnancial slimness with kindness shown us by every doctor we ever had i remember our heidelber g german doctor sent us bill year of dollar and half and even in our more prosperous days at carl last illness with that good seattle doctor calling day and night and caring after carl death he refused to send any bill anything and little later when i paid long overdue bill to our blessed oakland doctor tonsil operation he sent the check back torn in two bless doctors when we left harvard we had an idea that perhaps one year of graduate work would be sufﬁcient naturally about two months was enough to show us that one year the project gutenberg ebook of an american idyll by author https us nowhere could we ﬁnance an added year at perhaps wisconsin and then in november professor miller of berkeley called to talk things over with carl anon he remarked more or less casually the thing you to is to have year study in germany and proceeded to enlar ge on that idea we sat dumb and the minute the door was closed after him we ﬂopped what was the man thinking suggest year in germany when we have money and two babies one not year and half and one six weeks old preposterous that was saturday afternoon by monday morning we had decided we would go thereupon we wrote west to ﬁnance the plan and got beautifully sat upon our notions if we needed money we had better give up this whole fool university idea and get decent job and then we wrote my father rather i wrote him without telling carl till after the letter was mailed bless his heart he replied with fat registered letter with check enclosed agreein g to my stipulation that it should be business affair suppose we could not have raised that our lives had been minus that german experience bless fathers they may scold and fuss at romance and have good sensible ideas of their own on such matters fathers chapter v we ﬁnished our year at harvard giving up the idea the present carl got in every subject and was asked to take teaching fellowship under ripley but it was europe us we set forth february 22 1909 in big snowstorm with two babies and one thousand six hundred and bundles bags and presents jim was in one of those that babies use in the east everything we were about to forget the last minute got shoved into that bag with jim and it surely began to look if we had brought young and very lumpy mastodon into the world we went by boat from boston to new york and sailed on the pennsylvania february people wrote us in those days you two brave of starting to europe with two babies brave was the last word to use had we worried or had fears over anything and yet fared forth we should perhaps have been brave it was i can feel again the sensation of leaving new york gazing back on the city buildings and bridges bathed in sunshine after the storm exultant joy was in our hearts that was all not one worry not one concern not one small drop of homesickness we were to see europe together year before we had dreamed it possible it just seemed too glorious to be true brave far from it simply eager glowing ﬁlled to the brim with determination to drain every day to the full i discovered that while my husband had married female who could not cook rice though she learned i had taken unto myself spouse who curled up green half day out on the ocean and stayed that way about six days he tried so desperately to help with the babies but it always made matters worse if i had turned green babies and i prospered without interruption though some ants did try to eat jim scalp off one sugar ants the doctor called them they knew their business our dad remarked we were three days late getting into hambur days on the ocean all told and then to be in hambur g in europe i remember our ﬁrst meal in the queer little cheap hotel we rooted out eier was the only word on the bill of fare we could make out so carl brushed up his german and ordered four us fried and the waiter brought four each he probably declared years that all americans always eat four fried eggs each and every night supper we headed leipzig at once and there carl unearthed the pension schröter on sophien platz there we had two rooms and all the food we could eat too much us to eat and oh so delicious dollars month the entire family although the project gutenberg ebook of an american idyll by author https ranked yet economically speaking part of the consuming public we drained leipzig to the good german idiom carl worked at his german steadily almost frantically with lesson every day along with all his university seven lecture by bücher every morning being the cheery start the day and we blocks and blocks from the university i think of carl through those days with extra pride though it is hard to decide that i was ever prouder of him at one time than another but he strained and labored without ceasing at such an uninspiring job all his hard study that hearted summer at freibur g had given him single word of an economic vocabulary in leipzig he listened hour by hour to the lectures of his german professors sometimes not understanding an important word several days yet exerting every intellectu al muscle to get some light in his darkness then hours each day and almost every evening it was grammar grammar grammar till he wondered at times if all life meant an understanding of the subjunctive then little by little rays of hope i caught ﬁve words in lecture then it was ten then twenty never lecture of any day did he miss we stole moments joy along the way first of course there was the opera at cents seat how wagner bored us at the parts here and there that we had known all our lives neither of us had had any musical education to speak of each of us got great joy out of what we considered good music but which was evidently and wagner at ﬁrst was too much us that night in leipzig we heard the walküre aghast and rather impatient at so much understandable noise then we would drop down to carmen la bohême hoffman erzäblung and think this is life each night that we spared spree we sought out some beer unfrequented one possible to get all the local color we could once carl decided that long we had come so far i must get glimpse of real european might startle bit but would harm so after due deliberation he led to the café bauer the reputed wild and questionable resort of leipzig though the pension glanced and sighed and shook their heads i not know just what i did expect to see but i know that what i saw was countless stolid family all sides grandmas and grandpas and sons and daughters and the babies in high chairs beating the tables with spoons it was quite the most moral atmosphere we ever found ourselves in that is what you get deliberately setting out to see the wickedness of the world from leipzig we went to berlin we did not want to go to was the spot we had in mind just few months at harvard showed us that one year there would be but mere start so one semester in germany showed us that one year there would get us nowhere we must stay longer one to two years longer how alas how ﬁnance it that eternal question we ﬁnally decided that if we took the next semester or so in berlin carl could earn money enough coaching to keep us going without having to borrow more so to berlin we went we accomplished our ﬁnancial purpose but at too great cost in berlin we found small furnished apartment on the ground ﬂoor of gartenhaus in charlottenbur strasse it was at once carl started out to ﬁnd coaching and how he found it always seemed to an illustration of the way he could succeed at anything anywhere we knew one in berlin first he went to the minist er of the american church he in turn gave him names of americans who might want coaching and then carl looked up those people in about two months he had all the coaching he could possibly handle and we could have stayed indeﬁnitely in berlin in comfort carl was making over one hundred dollars month and that in his spare time but the agony of those months to be in germany and yet get so little germany out of it we had splendid letters of introduction to german people from german friends we had made in leipzig but we could not ﬁnd chance even to present them carl coached three youngsters in the three r he was preparing two of the age just above college he had one american youth who had ambitions to burst out monthly in the the project gutenberg ebook of an american idyll by author https post stories there was class of ﬁve women who wanted shakespeare and got it two classes in current events one group of christian scientists who put in modest demand the history of the world i remember carl had led them up to pepin the short when we left berlin he contracted everything and anything except one group who desired course of lectures in pragmatism i not think he had ever heard of the term then but he took one look at the lay of the land and so in his last years when he became such worshiper at the shrine of william james and john dewey we often used to laugh at his berlin profanity over the very idea of ever getting word of such bunk into his head but think of the strain it all and lessons every day on every subject under heaven and in every spare minute continued grinding at his german and of course every day numerous hours at the university and so little time sprees together we assumed in our prosperity the luxury of unparalleled anna bederke aus rothenbur g kreis bumps posen at four dollars month who year and half was the amusement and desperation of ourselves and our friends dear anna she adored the ground we walked on our german friends told us we had ruined her would never be ﬁt the discipline of german household again since war was ﬁrst declared we have lost all track of anna was her poland home in the devastated country did she marry soldier and is she too perhaps widow faithful anna not think one minute you will ever be forgotten by the parkers with anna to leave the young with now and then i was able to get in two sprees week with carl every wednesday and saturd ay noon i met him at the university and we had lunch together usually on wednesdays we ate at the café rheingold the spot i think of with most af fection i look back on berlin we used to eat in the shell room individual pie much chicken rice vegetable and glass of beer each cents both saturdays we hunted different smaller restaurants wednesday nights uncle of the university of wisconsin always came to supper bringing cent rebate his landlady allowed him when he ate out and we had chicken every wednesday night which fat more than ﬁfty cents it was uncle who wrote the world is so different with carl gone once we rented bicycles and rode all through the tiergarten carl and i with the expected stiffness and soreness next day then there was christmas in berlin three friends traveled up from rome to be with us two students came from leipzig and four from dinner and four chairs all told it was regular la bohême guest appearing with bottle of wine under his arm another with jar of caviare sent him from russia we had gay week of it after christmas when the whole eleven of us went on some spree every night before going back to our studies then came those last grueling months in berlin when carl had breakdown and i got sick nursing him and had to go to german hospital and while i was there jim was threatened with pneumonia and nandy got tonsillitis in the midst of it all the lease expired on our wohnung and carl and anna had to move the family out we decided that we had had all we wanted of coaching in berlin came to that conclusion before any of the breakdowns our pride to the winds borrowed more money from my good father and soon the family was well enough to travel we made our adored heidelber chapter the project gutenberg ebook of an american idyll by author https i sit back and words fail i see that year kaleidoscope of one joyful day after another each rushing by and leaving the memory that we both always had of the most perfect year that was ever given to mortals on earth i remember our eighth wedding anniversary in berkeley we had been going night after night until we were tired of going anywhere seemed to have heaped up we decided that the very happiest way we could celebrate that of all dates was just to stay at home plug the telephone pull down the blinds and have an evening by ourselves then we got out everything that we kept mementos of our european days and went over the postcards theatre and opera programmes and lastly read my had kept record of every day in europe when we came to that year in heidelber g we just could not believe our own eyes how had we ever managed to pack year so full and live to tell the tale i wish i could write story of just that year we swore an oath in berlin that we would make heidelber g mean germany to americans far it lay in our power we lived up to it carl and i spoke only german to each other and to the children and we shunned our fellow countrymen if they had had the plague and carl in the characteristic way he had set out to ﬁll our lives with all the real german life we could get into them not waiting that life to come of it might never have done one afternoon on his way home from the university he discovered in back alley the weiser boch little restaurant and so full of local color that it hollered it did not holler it was too real that it was sombre and carved whispered carl made immediate friends in the way he had with the portly frau and herr who ran the weiser boch they desired to meet they desired to see the kinder and would not the herr student like to have the weiser boch lady mention his name to some of the german students who dropped in carl left his card and wondered if anything would come of it the very next afternoon glowing account of the amerikaner the weiser boch lady must have given real truly german student in his corps cap and ribbo ns called at our stiffest most decorou s german student i ever was to see his embarrassment was great when he discovered that carl was out and i seemed to take it quite granted that he was to sit down moment and visit with he fell over everything but we visited and i was able to gather that his corps wished herr student to have beer with them the following evening then he bowed himself backwards and out and ﬂed i could scarce wait carl to get was too good to be true and that was but the beginning invitation after invitation came to carl ﬁrst from one corps then from another almost every saturday night he saw german ﬁrst hand somewhere and at least one day week he was invited to the duels in the hirsch gasse little by little we got the students to our wohnung then we got chummier and chummier till we would walk up haupt strasse saluting here passing word there invited to some student function one night another affair anoth er night the students who lived in heidelber g had us meet their families and those who were batching in heidelber g often had us come to their rooms we made friendships during that year that nothing could ever mar it is two years now since we received the last letter from any heidelber g chum are they all killed perhaps and when we can communicate again after the war think of what i must write them carl was revelation to most of would talk about him to and ask if all americans were like him so fresh in spirit so clean so sincere so full of fun and with it all doing the ﬁnest work of all of them but one in the university the economics students tried to think of some way of inﬂuencing alfred weber to give another course of lectures at the university he was in retirement at heidelber g but still the adored of the students finally they decided that committee of three should represent them and make personal appeal carl was one of the three chosen the report soon ﬂew around how in weber august presence the amerikaner had stood with his hands in his sat few moments on the edge of weber desk the two germans posed like ramrods expected to see such informality shoved out bodily the project gutenberg ebook of an american idyll by author https when they took their leave the herr professor had actually patted the amerikaner on the shoulder and said he guessed he would give the lectures then his report in gothein seminar which went so well that i fairly burst with pride he had worked day and night on that i was to meet him at eight after it had been given and we were to have celebration i was standing by the entrance to the university building when out came an enthused group of jabbering german students carl in their midst they were patting him on the back shaking his hands furiously and when they saw they rushed to tell of carl success and how gothein had said before all that it had been the best paper presented that semester i ﬁnd myself smiling i write was too happy that night to eat the sunday trips we made up the neckar each morning early we would take the train and ride to where we had walked the sunday previous then we would tramp far we could until dark lunch at some untouristed inn along the road or perhaps eat picnic lunch of our own in some old castle ruin and then ride home oh those sundays i tell you two people in all this world since people were have ever had one day like those sundays and we had them almost every week it would have been worth going to germany just one of those days there was the gay glad party that the economic students gave out in handschusheim at the zum bachlenz ﬁrst the banquet with big roomful of jovial young germans then the play in which carl and i both took part carl appeared in mixture of his idaho outﬁt and german peasant costume beatin g large drum he represented materialindex and called out loudly ich bitte mich nicht zu vergessen ich bin auch i was methode which nobody wanted to claim whereat i wept i am looking at the ﬂashlight picture of us all at this moment then came the dancing and then at about four the walk home in the moonlight by the old castle ruin in handschusheim singing the german there was carnival season with its masque balls and frivolity and faschings dienstag when hauptstrasse was given over to merriment all afternoon every one trailing up and down the middle of the street masked and in fantastic costume throwing confetti and tooting horns carl and i tooting with the rest time went on we came to have one little group of nine students whom we were with more than any others each of the men took his degree he gave party to the rest of us to celebrate it every one trying to outdo the other in fun besides these most important degree celebrations there were less dazzling affairs such birthday parties dinners or afternoon coffee in honor of visiting german parents or merely meeting together in our favorite café after socialist lecture or max reger concert in addition to such functions carl and i had our wednesday night spree just by ourselves when every week we met after his seminar our budget allowed just twelve and half cents an evening both of us i put up supper at home and in good weather we ate down by the river or in some park when it rained and was cold we sat in corner of the room by the stove watching the people coming and going in the station then dessert we went every wednesday to tante conditorei where two and half cents apiece we got large slice of special brand of the most divine cake ever baked then two and half cents we saw the reduced rate because we presented certain number of transfers along with the cash and then had to sit in the ﬁrst three rows but you see we used to remark we have to sit so far away at the opera it good to get up close at something thos were real danger of running into robert chambers scenario it was in the days before such developments then across the street was an automat and there cent and quarter apiece we could hold glass under little spigot press button and then we walked home heidelber love your every tree every stone every blade of grass the project gutenberg ebook of an american idyll by author https at last our year came to an end we left the town in bower of we had found it our dear most faithful friends the kecks gave us farewell luncheon and with babies bundles and baggage we were of heidelber g was the only spot i ever wept at leaving i loved it then and i love it now i love other place on earth and carl felt the same way we were mournful indeed that train pulled out chapter vii the next two weeks were ﬁlled with vicissitudes the idea was carl to settle the little family in some rural bit of germany while he did research work in the industrial section of essen and thereabouts coming home we stopped off ﬁrst at bonn carl spent several days searching up and down the rhine and through the moselle country place that would which meant place we could afford that was ﬁt and suitable the babies there was nothing the report always was pensions all expensive and automobiles touring by at mile minute where the children would be playing on wild impulse we moved up to clive on the dutch border after carl went in search of pension it started to drizzle the boys baggage and i found the only nearby place of shelter in inclosure ﬁlled with new and ornate tombstones what was my impecunious horror when i heard small crash and discovered that jim had dislocated loose ﬁgure of christ unconsciously cubist in execution from the top of tombstone eight marks charges the cost of sixteen heidelber g sprees on his return carl reported two pensions one quarantined dipht heria one scarlet fever we slept over hall with such racket going on all night never was and next morning took the ﬁrst train time düsseldorf it is triﬂe momentous traveling with two babies around country you know nothing about and can ﬁnd one to enlighten you at düsseldorf carl searched through the town and suburbs spot to settle us in getting more and more depressed at the thought of leaving us anywhere that freibur g summer had seared us both deep and each of us dreaded another separation more than either let the other know and then one night after another fruitless search carl came home and informed that the whole scheme was off instead of doing his research work we would all go to munich and he would take an unexpected semester there working with brentano what rejoicings oh what rejoicings carl remarked it may be that he travels fastest who travels alone but speed was not the only thing he was after so the next day babies bundles baggage and parents went down the rhine almost through heide lberg to munich with such joy and contentment in our hearts we could not describe all those days of unhappy searchings carl had been through must have sunk deep in his last days of fever he would tell of form of delirium in which he searched again with heart of lead place to leave the babies and i remember our ﬁrst night in munich we arrived about supper hunted up cheap hotel usual near the station fed the babies and started to prepare their retirement this process in hotels was always effected by taking out two and making bed of each while we were busy over this the boys were busy busy this time they both crawled up into large that stood in our room when crash bang lay the front down on the ﬂoor boys inside it such and squallings from the internals of the agitated scurryings from all directions of the his wife waiters and chambermaids all together we managed to stand the once more against the wall and to extricate two sobered young ones the only damage being two doors banged off their the project gutenberg ebook of an american idyll by author https is second in my heart to heidelb erg carl worked hardest of all there hardly ever going out nights but we never got over the feeling that our being there together was sort of gift we had made ourselves and we were ever grateful and then carl did so remarkably well in the university report instance which he read before brentano seminar was published by the university our relations with brentano always stood out one of the high memories of germ any after carl report in brentano class that lovable idol of the german students called him to his desk and had long talk which ended by his asking us both to tea at his house the following day the exciteme nt of our pension over that we were looked upon the anointed of the lord we were really bit overawed ourselves we discussed neckties and brushed and cleaned and smelled considerably of gasoline we strutted forth too proud to tell because we were to have tea with brentano i can see the street their house was on their front door i can feel again the little catch in our breaths we rang the bell then the charming warmth and color of that italian home the charming warmth and hospitality of that professor and his gracious kindly wife there were just ourselves there and what momentous time it was to the little parkers carl was simply radiating joy and in the way he always had when especially pleased would give sudden beam from ear to ear and wink at when one else was looking not long after that we were invited dinner and again tea this time according to orders bringing the sons they both fell into an italian fountain in the rear garden soon we went in refreshments by my desk now is hanging photograph we have prized one of our great treasures below it is written and parker zur freundlichen brentano professor bonn another of carl professors at the university and his wife were kindness itself to us then there was peter dear old peter the austrian student at our pension who took us everywhere brought us gifts and adored the babies until he almost spoiled them from munich we went direct to england vicissitudes again in ﬁnding cheap and ﬁt place that would children to settle in after wanderings we ﬁnally stumbled upon swanage in dorset that was love of place on the english channel where we had two rooms with the mebers in their funny little brick house the netto simple folk they were meber retired sailor the wife rather worn with constant roomers one daughter dressmaker the other working in the knittin shop char ges six dollars week the family which included cooking and serving our bought the food ourselves here carl prepared his examination and worked on his thesis until it got to the point where he needed the british museum then he took room and worked during the week in london coming down to us he wrote eager letters the time had come when he longed to get the preparatory work and examination behind him and begin teaching we had an instructorship at the university of california waiting us and teaching was to begin in january in one letter he wrote i now feel like landing on my exam like bulgarian i am that ﬁerce to lay it out we felt more than ever in those days of work piling up behind us that we owned the world carl wrote in another letter we stick this out this being the separation of his last trip to london whence he was to start heidelber g and his examination without another visit with us gott sei dank the time is so fearful fearful long it is really is it gee i glad i married you and i want more babies and more you and then the whole gang together about years but life is so ﬁne to us and we are getting so much love and big things out of life november 1 carl left london heidelber he was to take his examination there december 5 so the month of november was full one him he stayed with the dear kecks mother keck pressing and mending his clothes hovering over him if he were her own son he wrote once we had small leg of venison which i sneaked in last night every time i note that i burn three quarters of lampful of oil day among the other things i cost them it makes feel like buying out whole conditorei the project gutenberg ebook of an american idyll by author https lived those daily letters telling of his progress once he wrote just saw fleiner professor in law and he was ﬁne but i must get his volkerrecht cold it is ﬁne reading and is mighty good and interesting every word and also stuff which man ought to know this is the last man to see from now on it is only to study and i am tickled i really like to study few days later he wrote it is just plain sit and absorb these days some day i will explain how tough it is to learn an entire law subject in ﬁve days in strange tongue and then on the night of december 5 came the telegram of success to frau parker we both knew he would pass but neither of us was prepared the verdict of summa cum laude the highest accomplishment possible i went up and down the main street of little swanage announcing the tidings right and left the community all knew that carl was in germany to take some kind of an examination though it all seemed rather unexplainable yet they rejoiced with butcher the baker the having the least idea what they were rejoicing about meber tore up and down osborne road to have the fun of telling the immediate neighbors all of whom were utterly at loss to know what it meant the truth being that meber herself was in that same state but she had somehow caught my excitement and anything to tell was scarce in swanage so the little family that fared forth from oakland california that february 1 one year at harvard had ended t four years later summa cum laude from heidelber not persia we had planned it nine years deeper ﬁner life than anything we had dreamed we asked professor miller after we got back to california why in the world he had said just one year in europe if i had said more i was afraid it would scare you altogether out of ever starting and i knew if you once got over there and were made of the right stuff you stay on on december 12 carl was to deliver one of series of lectures in munich the handelshochschule his subject being die einwanderungs und siedelungspolitik in amerika carleton parker privatdocent st francisco that very day however the prince regent died and everything was called off we had our got our pay carl was so tired from his examination that he did not object to foregoing the delivery of german address before an audience of four hundred it was read two weeks later by one of the professors on december 15 we had our reunion and celebration of it all carl took the amerika second class at hambur g the boys and i at southampton ushered thither from swanage and put aboard the steamer by our faithful onkel keck son of the folk with whom carl had stayed in heidelber g who came all the way from london that purpose it was not such brash herr doktor that we found after all the channel had begun to tell on him it were and while it was plain that he loved us it was also plain that he did not love the water so we gave him his six days off and he lay in steamer while i covered miles day tearing after two sons who were far more ﬁlled with wanderlust than they had been three years before when our dad did feel chipper again he felt very chipper and our last four days were perfect we landed in new york on christmas eve in snowstorm paid the crushing sum of one dollar and cents duty jovial agent inspected our belongings i never beheld he must already have had just the christmas present he most wanted whatever it was when he heard that we had been in heidelber g he and several other ofﬁcials began lusty rendering of old heidelber g within an hour we were speeding toward california case of certiﬁed milk added to our already innumerable articles of luggage christmas dinner we ate on the train how those american prices ﬂoored us after three years of all we could eat cents the project gutenberg ebook of an american idyll by author https viii we looked back always on our ﬁrst semester teaching in the university of california one hectic term we had lived our own lives found our own joys four years and here we were enveloped by old friends by relatives by new friends until we knew not which way to turn in addition carl was swamped by campus students many of whom seemed to consider him an oasis in desert of unhuman professors every student organization to which he had belonged an under graduate opened its arms to welcome him faculty member we chaperoned student parties till we heard in our sleep from january 1 to may 16 we had four nights alone together you can know we were desperate carl used to say we may have to make it persia yet the event of that term was when after about two months of teaching president wheeler rang up one evening about seven of the four evenings it happened we were at home together said i thought i should like the pleasure of telling you personally though you will receive ofﬁcial notice in the morning that you have been made an assistant professor we expected you to make good but we did not expect you to make good to such degree quite so soon again an occasion spree we tore out hatless across the campus nearly demolishing the head of the college of commerce we rounded the library he must know the excitement he was pleased he slipped his hand into his pocket saying i must have hand in this celebration and with royal gesture who should say what matter the costs slipped dime into carl hand spend it all thus we were started on our assistant professorship but always before and always after to the students carl was just doc i remember story he told of how his chief stopped him one afternoon at the north gate to the university and said he was discouraged and distressed carl was getting the reputation of being popular with the students and that would never i wish to hear more of such rumors just then the remnants of the internals of ford hung together with picture wire and painted white whizzed around the corner two slouching studes caught sight of carl reared up the car and called hi doc come on in then they beheld the head of the department hastily pressed some lever and went hurrying on to the head it was evidence he shook his head and went his way carl was popular with the students and it is true that he was too much so it was not long before he discovered that he was drawing unto himself the college bum and he rebelled harvard and germany had given him too high an idea of scholarship to have even traditional university patience with the student who in the university of california jargon was looking meal he was petitioned by twelve students of the college of agriculture to give course in the economics of agriculture and they guaranteed him students one hundred and thirty enrolle d and carl surveyed the assortment below him he realized that good half of them did not know and did not want to know pear tree from tractor he stiffened his upper lip stiffened his examinations and cinched forty of the class there should be some latin saying that would just ﬁt such case but i not know it it would start exit and the exit would refer to the exit of the loafer in large numbers from carl courses and the exit from the heart of the loafer of the absorbing love he had held carl his troubles were largely over someone else could care the maimed the halt and the blind it was about this time too that carl got into difﬁculties with the intrenched powers on the campus he had what has been referred to passion justice daily the injustice of campus organization grew on him he saw democracy held high an only student affairs were run by an autocracy which had nothing to justify the project gutenberg ebook of an american idyll by author https its supporters claim of efﬁciency he had little love that is usually bought at too great cost that year usual he had small seminar of carefully picked students he got them to open their eyes to conditions they were when they ceased to accept those conditions just because they were they too felt the inequality the farce of democratic institution run on such autocratic lines after seminar hours the group would foregather at our house to plot to ways and means the editor of the campus daily saw their point of am not sure now that he was not member of the seminar slow campaign of education followed intrenched powers became outraged fraternities that had invited carl almost weekly to lunch now could see him one or two inﬂuential alumnæ who had somet hing to gain from the established order took up the ﬁght soon we had warning from one of the regents that carl efforts on behalf of democracy were unwelcome but within year the entire organization of campus politics was altered and now there probably is not student who would not feel outraged at the suggestion of return to the old system perhaps here is where i can dwell moment on carl particular brand of democracy i see so much of other kinds he was what i should call an utterly unconscious democrat he never framed in his own mind any theory of the brotherhood of man just lived it without ever thinking of it somethi ng that needed expression in words i never heard him use the term to him the individ ual was that i mean that every relation he had was on personal basis he could not go into shop to buy necktie hurriedly without passing word with the clerk when he paid his fare on the street car there was moment conversation with the conductor when we had of an evening he asked the waitress what was the best thing on in the movies when we left oakland harvard the partially toothless maid we had sobbed that parker had been more like brother to her one of the phases of his death which struck home the hardest was the concern and sorrow the small tradespeople cobbler the plumber the clerk you hear men say i often ﬁnd it interesting to talk to and get their such an attitude was absolutely foreign to carl he talked to because he talked to everybody he went along his joyous way at track meet or football game he was on intimate terms with every one within conversational radius our wealthy friends would tell us he ruined their chauf got so that they did know their places likely not he would jolt some constrained bank president by engaging him in genial conversation without an introduction at formal dinner he would matter of course have word or two with the butler when he passed the cracked crab although at times the butlers seemed somewhat pained thereby some of carl intimate friends were occasionally he talks to everybody he more could help talking to everybody than he could he was born that way he had one manner every human of the university students janitors society women cooks small boys judges he never had any material thing to hand out even cigars he did not smoke himself one friend expressed it he radiated generosity heidelber g gives one year after passing the examination to get the doctor thesis in ﬁnal form publication the subject of carl thesis was the labor policy of the american trust his ﬁrst summer vacation after our return to berkeley he went on to wisconsin chieﬂy to see commons and then to chicago to study the stockyards at and the steel industry he wrote have just seen commons who was ﬁne he said soon possible the outline of your thesis and i will pass upon it accordi ng to my lights he is very interested in one of my principal subdivisions ique and unionism or and labor believes it is big new consideration again he wrote i have just ﬁnished working through book on by professor fairchild of yale pages published three weeks ago by professor ross it is the very book i have been looking and is superb i ca get over how stimulating this looking in on group of university men has been it in itself is worth the trip i feel sure of my ﬁeld of work that i am not going off in unfruitful directions that i the project gutenberg ebook of an american idyll by author https up with the wagon i am now set on ﬁnishing my book right it out within year from december from chicago he wrote am here with the reek of the stockyards in my nose and just four blocks from them here lived in this house upton sinclair when he wrote jungle and mary mcdowell at the university settlement where he was staying told friend of ours since carl death about how he came to the table that ﬁrst night and one paid much attention to some young westerner nosing about but by the end of the meal he had the whole group leaning elbows on the table listening to everything he had to say and she added every one of us loved him from then on he wrote after visiting swift plant of seeing illustrations all the lectures on technique i have given and gee it felt good i could not quote him honestly and leave out his gees to actually look at things being done the way one has orated about being done the thing to here is to see and see the things i going to write into my thesis i want to spend week if i can digging into the steel industry with my ﬁne information about the ore he had just acquired that i am anxious to ﬁll out my knowledge of the operation of smelting and making steel then i can orate industrial dope later this morning i called on the of the illinois steel company on the treasurer of armour and lunched with mr crane of crane the time we had when it came to the actual printing of the thesis it had to be ﬁnished by certain day in order to make certain steamer to reach heidelber g when promised i got in corner of and read proof just fast it came off the press while carl worked at home under you can guess what pressure to complete his down with new batches to get in shape the and then racing home to more writing we ﬁnished the thesis about one one morning and all and the next that same day war was declared which meant just the university of heidelber g sent word that it would not be safe carl to send over his thesis were about three or four hundred copies to go according to german university regulations the situation had quieted down somewhat the result was that those three or four hundred copies lay stacked up in the three or four years until at last carl decided it was not very good thesis anyway and he did want any one to see it and he would write another one when peace was declared and it could get safely to its destination so he told the printer to away with the whole batch this meant that we were out about hundred and ﬁfty dollars oh luckless thought small fortune to the young parkers so though in way the thesis it stands was not meant publication i shall risk quoting from part one the problem so that at least his general approach can be gathered remember the title was the labor policy of the american trust when the most astute critic of american labor conditions has said immigration continues in great volume class lines will be forming and reforming weak and instable to prohibit or greatly restrict immigr ation would bring forth class conﬂict within generation what does it mean president woodrow wilson in statement of his fundamental beliefs has said are we in the presence why are we at the threshold of revolution you know that some man with eloquent tongue without conscience who did not care the nation could put this whole country into ﬂame you know that this country from one end to the other believes that something is wrong what an opportunity it would be some man without conscience to spring up and say this is the way follow lead in paths of destruction what does it mean the problem of the social unrest must seek its source in all three classes of society two classes are employer and employee the third is the great middle class looking on what is the relationship between the dominating employing ﬁgure in american industrial life and the men who work antagonism to to the idea of collective bargaining between men and employer can not spring from temperamental aversion of mere the project gutenberg ebook of an american idyll by author https powerful be he carnegie parry or post or from the common opinion in group such the beef trust or the directorate of the united states steel corporation such hostility characterizing it does one of the vitally important relationships in industrial production must seek its in economic causes proﬁts market ﬁnancing are placed in certain jeopardy by such labor policy and this risk is not continued generation after generation casual indulgence in temper deep below the strong charges against the unions of narrow and limitation of output dressed by the citizens alliance in the language of the declaration of independence lies quiet economic reason the hostility just slavery was about to go because it did not pay and america stopped building merchant marine because it was cheaper to hire england to transport american goods so the american trust soon it had power abolished the american because it found it costly what then are these economic causes which account the hostility what did the union stand in the way of what conditions did the trust desire to establish with which the union would interfere or did labor condition arise which allowed the employer to wreck the union with such ease that he turned aside moment to it to commit an act desirable only if its performance cost little danger or money the answer can be found only after an analysis of certain factors in industrial production these are three the control of industrial production not only in whose hands has industrial capitalism the moment fallen but in what direction does the evolution of control tend b the technique of industrial producti on technique at times instead of being servant determines by its own chara cteristics the character of the labor and the geographical location of the industry and even destroys the danger of competition if the machinery demanded by it asks bigger capital investment than raiding competitor will risk c the labor market the labor market can be stationary in england can diminish in ireland or increase in new england if the character of these three factors be studied trust hostility to american labor can be explained in terms of economic measure one national characteristic however must be taken granted that is the commercialized business morality which guides american economic life the responsibility the moral or social effect of an act is so rarely consideration in decision that it can be here neglected without error it is not factor at the close of his investigation he took his ﬁrst vacation in ﬁve up the brulé with hal bradley that was one of our dreams that could never come together we almost bought the canoe at the looked holes through the one we wanted our trip was planned to the remotest detail we never did come into our own in the matter of our vacations although two people could have more fun in the woods than we but the combination of small children and money and new babies and ﬁgured that in three more years we could be sure of at least one wonderful trip year anyway we had the joy of our plannings chapter the project gutenberg ebook of an american idyll by author https second term in california had just got well under way when carl was offered the position of executive secretary in the state immigration and housing commission of california i remember so well the night he came home about midnight and told i am afraid the ﬁnancial end would have determined us even if the work itself had small however was not the case the salary offered was 4000 we were getting 1500 at the university we were 2000 in debt from our european trip and saw earthly chance of ever paying it out of our university salary we ﬁgured that we could be square with the world in one year on 4000 salary and then need never be swayed by ﬁnancial considerations again so carl accepted the new job it was the wise thing to anyway matters turned out it threw him into direct contact the ﬁrst time with the migratory laborer and the it gave him his ﬁrst bent in the direction of labor psychology which was to become his intellectual passion and he was ﬁred with zeal that never left him to see that there should be less unhappiness and inequal ity in the world the concrete result of carl work with the immigration commission was the of labor camps all over california from unsanitary dirty makeshifts were developed ordered sanitary housing accommodations designed and executed by experts in their ﬁelds also he awakened through countless talks up and down the state some understanding of the and his problem although judging from the newspapers nowadays his work would seem to have been almost forgotten the phrase went carleton parker put the migratory on the map i think of the wheatland riot or the ford and suhr case which carl was appointed to investigate the federal government the dramatic incident which focused his attention on the need of deeper approach to sound understanding of labor and its problems and which in turn justiﬁed bruère in stating in the new republic parker was the ﬁrst of our economists not only to analyse the psychology of labor and especially of casual labor but also to make his analysis the basis an applied technique of industrial and social reconstruction also that was the occasion of his concrete introduction to the he wrote an account of it later the survey and an article on the california casual and his revolt the quarterly journal of economics in november it is all interesting enough i feel to warrant going into some detail the setting of the riot is best given in the article above referred to the california casual and his revolt the story of the wheatland s riot is simple the facts of it are new and naïve in strike histories hundred pickers were camped on treeless hill which was part of the ranch the largest single employer of agricultural labor in the state some were in tents some in topless squares of sacking or with piles of straw there was organization sanitatio n the temperature during the week of the riot had remained near and though the wells were mile from where the men women and children were picking and their bags could not be left fear of theft of the hops water was sent into the ﬁelds lemonade wagon appeared at the end of the week later found to be concession granted to cousin of the ranch owner local wheatland stores were forbidden to send delivery wagons to the camp grounds it developed in the state investigation that the owner of the ranch received half of the net proﬁts earned by an alleged independent grocery store which had been granted the concession and was located in the centre of the camp ground the pickers began coming to wheatland on tuesday and by sunday the irritation over the the absence of water in the ﬁelds plus the persistent heat and the increasing indignity of the camp had resulted in mass meetings violent talk and general strike the ranch owner nervous man was harassed by the rush of work brought on by the too rapidly ripening hops and indign ant at the jeers and catcalls which greeted the project gutenberg ebook of an american idyll by author https near the meetings of the pickers confused with crisis outside his slender social philosophy he acted true to his tradition and perhaps his type and called on sherif f posse what industrial relationship had existed was too insecure to stand such procedure it disappeared entirely leaving in control the instincts and vagaries of mob on the one hand and great apprehension and inexperience on the other if stage had been set the posse arrived in automobiles at the instant when the ofﬁcially was addressing mass meeting of excited men women and children after short and typical period of skirmishing and the minor and major events of arresting person under such circumstances member of the posse standing outside ﬁred over the heads of the crowd sober them he explained it four men were of the posse and two strikers the posse ﬂed in their automobiles to the county seat and all that night the roads out of wheatland were ﬁlled with pickers leaving the camp eight months later two proved to be the leaders of the strike and its agitation were convicted of murder in the ﬁrst degree and sentenced to life imprisonment their appeal new trial was denied in his report to the governor written in 1914 carl characterized the case follows the occurrence known the whe atland riot took place on sunday afternoon august 3 growing discontent among the over wages neglected and absence of water in the ﬁelds had resulted in spasmodic meetings of protest on saturday and sunday morning and ﬁnally by sunday noon in more or less involuntary strike at ﬁve on sunday about one thousand pickers gathered about dance pavilion to listen to speakers two automobiles carrying sherif f posse drove up to this meeting and ofﬁcials armed with guns and revolvers attempted to disperse the crowd and to arrest on john doe warrant richard ford the apparent leader of the strike in the ensuing confusion shooting began and some twenty shots were ﬁred two pickers deputy sherif f and the district attorney of the county were killed the posse ﬂed and the camp remained unpoliced until the state militia arrived at dawn next morning the occurrence has grown from casual though bloody event in califor nia labor history into such focus discussion and analysis of the state great migratory labor problem that the incident can well be said to begin the commonwealth new and momentous labor epoch the problem of vagrancy that of the unemployed and the unemployable the vexing conﬂict between the right of agitation and free speech and the law relating to criminal conspiracy the housing and wages of agricultural laborers the efﬁciency and sense of responsibility found in posse of country deputies the temper of the country people faced with the confusion and rioting of labor outbreak all these problems have found starting point their new and vigorous analysis in the wheatland riot in the same report submitted year before the quarterly journal article and almost year before his study of psychology began carl wrote the manager and of the ranch is an example of certain type of california employer the refusal of this type to meet the social responsibilities which come with the hiring of human beings labor not only works concrete and cruelly unnecessary misery upon class little able to combat personal indignity and degradation but adds fuel to the ﬁre of resentment and unrest which is beginning to burn in the migratory worker in california that could refuse his clear duty of real trusteeship of camp on his own ranch which contained hundreds of women and children is social fact of miserable import the excuses we have heard of unpreparedness of alleged ignorance of conditions are shamed by the proven human suffering and humiliation repeated each day of the week from wednesday to sunday even where the employer innate sense of moral obligation fails to point out his duty he should have realized the insanity of stimulating unrest and bitterness in this inﬂammable labor force the riot on the ranch is california contribution to the literature of the social unrest in america the project gutenberg ebook of an american idyll by author https to the legal and economic aspects of the case again quoting from the report to the governor the position taken by the defense and their sympathizers in the course of the trial has not only an economic and social bearing but many arguments made before the court are distinct efforts to introduce sociological modiﬁcations of the law which will have reaching effect on the industrial relati ons of capital and labor it is asserted that the common law on which american jurisprudence is founded is known an developing law which must adapt itself to changing economic and social conditions and in this connection it is claimed that the established theories of legal causation must be enlar ged to include economic and social factors in the chain of causes leading to result concretely it is ar gued first that when unsanitary conditions lead to discontent so intense that the crowd can be incited to bloodshed those responsi ble the unsanitary conditions are to be held legally responsible the bloodshed well the actual inciters of the riot second that if the law will not reach out so far to hold the creator of unsanitary unlivable conditions guilty of bloodshed at any rate such conditions excuse the inciters from liability because inciters are the involuntary transmitting agents of an uncontrollable force set in motion by those who created the unlivable conditions furthermore on the legal side modiﬁcations of the law of property are urged it is argued that modern law longer holds the rights of private property sacred that these rights are being constantly regulated and limited and that in the wheatland case the owner traditional rights in relation to his own lands are to be held subject to the right of the laborers to organize thereon it is urged that worker on land has right in his job and that he can not be made to leave the job or the land merely because he is trying to organize his fellow workers to make protest to living and economic conditions it is urged that the organizing worker can not be made to leave the job because the job is his property and it is all that he has to the remedy it is obvious that the violent strike methods adopted by the type agitators which only incidentally although effectively tend to improve camp conditions are not to be accepted solution of the problem it is also obvious that the conviction of the agitators such ford and suhr of murder is not solution but is only the punishment or revenge inﬂicted by or ganized society past deed the remedy lies in prevention it is the opinion of your investigator that the improvement of living conditions in the labor camps will have the immediate effect of making the recurrence of impassioned violent strikes and riots not only improbable but impossible and furtherm ore such improvement will go far towards eradica ting the hatred and bitterness in the minds of the employers and in the minds of the rovin g migratory laborers this accomplished the two conﬂicting parties will be in position to meet on saner more constructive basis in solving the further industrial problems arising between them they must come to realize that their own laxity in allowing the existence of unsanitary and ﬁlthy conditions gives esired foothold to the very agitator s of the revolutionary doctrines whom they so dread they must learn that unbearable aggravating living conditions inoculate the minds of the otherwise peaceful workers with the germs of bitterness and violence so well exempliﬁed at the wheatland riot giving the agitators fruitful ﬁeld wherein to sow the seeds of revolt and preach the doctrine of direct action and sabotage on the other hand the migratory laborers must be shown that revolts accompanied by force in scattered and isolated localities not only involve serious breaches of law and lead to crime but that they accomplish lasting constructive results in advanc ing their the project gutenberg ebook of an american idyll by author https the commission intends to furnish clearinghouse to hear complaints of griev ances of both sides and act mediator or in the report to the governor appear carl ﬁrst writings on the of this entire labor force at the ranch it appears that some 100 had been men or had had afﬁliations with that organization there is evidence that there was in this camp loosely caught together camp local of the with about 30 active members it is suggestive that these 30 men through spasmodic action and with the aid of the deplorable camp conditions dominated heterogeneous mass of 2800 unskilled laborers in 3 days some 700 or 800 of the force were of the class in every sense potential strikers at least 400 knew in rough way them curiously of the and could also sing some of its songs of the men of the some had been through the san diego affair some had been in fresno dozen had been in the free speech ﬁght in spokane they sized up the ripe opportunity the principal defendant ford puts it start something on friday two days after picking began the practical agitators began working through the camp whether or not ford came to the ranch to foment trouble seems immaterial there are ﬁve fords in every camp of seasonal laborers in california we have devoted ourselves in these weeks to such questions this big per cent of california migratory seasonal labor force know the technique of an strike many of the migratory laborers know when conditions are ripe to start something we are convinced that among the individuals of every labor group are many potential strikers where group of hoboes sit around ﬁre under railroad bridge many of the group can sing song s without the book this was not so three years ago the in california is not closely organized body with steady membership the rank and ﬁle know little of the technical organization of industrial life which their written constitution demands they listen eagerly to the appeal the of their class in the dignifying of vagabondage through their crude but virile song and verse in the bitter viliﬁcation of the jail turnkey and county sherif f in their condemnatio n of the church and its formal social work they ﬁnd the vindication of their hobo status which they desire they can not sustain live organization unless they have strike or ﬁght to stimulate their spirit it is in their methods of warfare not in their abstract philosophy or even hatred of law and judges that danger lies organized society since every one of the 5000 laborers in california who have been at some time connected with the considers himself delegate with walking papers to organize camp local this small army is watching ford did an unsanitary camp or low to start the strike which will not only create new local but bring fame to the organizer this common acceptance of direct action and sabotage the rule of operation the songs and the common vocabulary are we feel convinced the ﬁrst stirring of class expression class solidarity they have not that may never come the migratory laborer has neither the force nor the vision nor tenacity to hold long enough to the ideal to attain it but the is teaching method of action which will give this class in violent ups such that at wheatland expression the dying away of the organization after the outburst is therefore to be expec ted their social condition is miserable one their work even at the best must be irregular they have nothing to lose in strike and leader put it riot and chance to blackguard jailer is about the only intellectual fun we have taking into consideration the misery and physical privation and the barren outlook of this life of the seasonal worker the movement with all its irresponsible motive and unlawful action becomes in reality and the dignity which this characteristic gives it perhaps alone explains the persistence of the organization in the the project gutenberg ebook of an american idyll by author https those attending the protest of the wheatland were singing the song block when the sherif f posse came up in its automobiles the crowd had been harangued by an experienced ford they had been told according to evidence to the blocks off the scissor ford had taken sick baby from its mother arms and holding it before the eyes of the 1500 people had cried out the life of the kids we doing this not quarter of the crowd was of type normally venturesome enough to strike and yet when the sherif f went after ford he was knocked down and kicked senseless by infuriated men in the bloody riot which then ensued distric t attorney manwell deputy sherif f riordan negro porto rican and the english boy were shot and killed many were woun ded the posse literally ﬂed and the camp remained practically unpoliced until the state militia arrived at dawn the next day the question of social responsibility is one of the deepest signiﬁcance the posse was i am convinced and unfortunately this can be explained in part by the apprehension over the in part by the normal california country posse attitude toward labor trouble deputy sherif f at the most critical moment ﬁred shot in the air he stated sober the crowd there were armed men in the crowd every crowd of 2000 casual laborers includes score of gunmen evidence goes to show that even the gentler mountainfolk in the crowd had been aroused to sense of personal injury automobile had brought part of the posse numberless pickers cling to the belief that the posse was police when deputy sherif f dakin shot into the air fusillade took place and when he had ﬁred his last shell an infuriated crowd of men and women chased him to the ranch store wher he was forced to barricade himself the crowd was dangerous and struck the ﬁrst blow the murderous temper which turned the crowd into mob is incompatible with social existence let alone social progress the crowd at the moment of the shooting was wild and lawless animal but to your investigator the important subject to analyze is not the guilt or innocence of ford or suhr the direct stimulators of the mob in action but to name and standardize the early and equally important contributors to psychological situation which resulted in an unlawful killing if this is done how can we omit either the ﬁlth of the the cheap of the ordinary deputy sherif f or the unbridled irresponsible speech of the orator without doubt the propaganda which the had actually adopted the california seasonal worker can be in its fairly normal working out in law criminal conspiracy and under that charge ford and suhr have been found guilty of the wheatlan d murder but the important fact is that this propaganda will be carried out whether unlawful or not we have talked hours with the leaders and they are absolutely conscious of their position in the eyes of the law their only comment is that they are glad if it must be conspiracy that it is criminal conspiracy they have volunteered the beginning of cure it is to clean up the housing and wage problem of the seasonal worker the shrewdest leader we found said ca agitate in the country unless things are rotten enough to bring the crowd along they evidently were in wheatland he was high ace with the wobbly while they invited him to their jungles they carved him presents in jail i remember talk he gave on some phase of the california labor one sunday night at the congregational church in oakland the last three rows were ﬁlled with unshaven hoboes who ﬁled up afterwards to the evident distress of the clean regular to clasp his hand they withdrew their allegiance after time which naturally in way phased carl scientiﬁc interest in them paper hostile to carl attitude on the and his insistence on the of camps published an article portraying him individual who feigned an interest in the under dog really to undo him he was at heart and capitalist being the possessor of an independent income of year some took this up and convinced large meeting that he was really trying to sell them out it is not only the rich who are ﬁckle some of them remained his ﬁrm friends always however that summer two of his students hoboed it till they came down with malaria in the meantime turning in fund of invaluable facts regarding the migratory and his the project gutenberg ebook of an american idyll by author https year later in his article in the quarterly journal and be it remembered after his study of psychology had begun carl wrote there is here beyond doubt great laboring population experiencin g high suppression of normal instincts and traditions there can be greater perversion of desirable existence than this insecure under wandering life with its sordid and reckless and rare pleasures such life leads to one of two consequences either sinking of the class to low and hopeless level where they become through irresponsible conduct and economic inefﬁciency charge upon society or revolt and guerrilla labor warfare the migratory laborers class are the ﬁnished product of an environment which seems cruelly efﬁcient in turning out beings moulded after all the standards society abhors fortunately the psychologists have made it unnecessary to explain that there is nothing willful or personally reprehensible in the vagrancy of these vagran ts their histories show that starting with the long hours and dreary winters of the farms they ran away from through their character experience with irregular industrial labor on to the vicious economic life of the winter unemployed their training predeterm ined but one outcome nurture has triumphed over nature the environment has produced its type difﬁcult though the organization of these people may be coincidence of favoring conditions may place an opportunity in the hands of super if this comes one can be sure that california will be both very astonished and very misused i was told only recently of belgian economics professor out here in californ ia during the war on ofﬁcial business connected with aviation he asked at once to see carl but was told we had moved to seattle my colleagues in belgium asked to be sure and see professor parker he said we consider him the one man in ame rica who understands the problem of the migratory laborer that winter carl got the city of san josé to stand behind model unemployed house one of the two students who had hoboed during the summer taking charge of it the unemployed problem he ran into it at every turn stirred carl to his depths at one time he felt it so strongly that he wanted to start in berkeley himself just to be helping out somehow even though it would be only surface help it was also about this time that california was treated to the spectacle of an unemployed army which was driven from pillar to post in this case from town to town trying to outdo the last in protestations of unhospitality finally in sacramento the hoses were turned on the army at that carl ﬂamed with indignation and expressed himself in mincing terms both to the public and to the reporter who sought his views he was hand to keep clippings but i did come across one of his milder interviews in the san francisco bulletin of march 1 1 1914 that california method of handling the unemployed problem is in accord with the cruel and unscientiﬁc attitude of society on the labor question is the statement made by professor carleton parker assistant professor of industrial economy and secretary of the state immigration committee are two ways of looking at this winter unemployed problem said parker is fatally bad and the other promises good one way is shallow and biased the other strives to use the simple rules of scienc the analysis of any problem one way is to damn the army of the unemployed and the irresponsible irritating vagrants who will not work the other way is to admit that any such social phenomenon this army is just normal product of our social or ganization our own university and ferry analysis of this problem that i have overheard seems to believe that this army created its own degraded self that vagrant is vagrant from personal desire and perversion this analysis is shallow it is untrue if unemployment and vagrancy are the product of our careless indifferent society over the project gutenberg ebook of an american idyll by author https then its cure will come only by careful regretful social labor by this same tardy society riot at sacramento is merely the appearance of the problem from the back streets into the strong light the handling of the problem there is unhappily in accord with the careless cruel attitude of society on this question we are willing to respect the anxiety of sacramento threatened in the night with this irresponsible reckless invasion but how can the city demand of vagrants observance of the law when they drop into assertion the minute the problem comes up to them the illustration he always used to express his opinion of the average solution of unemployment i quote from paper of his on that subject written in the spring of 1915 there is an old test insanity which is made follows the suspect is given cup and is told to empty bucket into which water is running from faucet if the suspect turns off the water before he begins to bail out the bucket he is sane nearly all the current solutions of unemployment leave the faucet running the heart of the problem the cause one might well say of unemployment is that the employment of men regularly or irregu larly is at time an important consideration of those minds which control industry social organization has ordered it that these minds shall be interested only in achieving reasonable proﬁt in the manufacture and the sale of goods society has never demanded that industries be run even in part to give men employment rewards are not held out such policy and therefore it is unreasonable to expect such performance though favorite popular belief is that we must to live we have current adage of to work this winter there are shoeless men and women closed and destitute shoemakers children in new england with woolen clothing woolen mills and unemployed spinners and weavers why simply because the mills can not turn out the reasonable business proﬁt and since that is the only promise that can galvan ize them into activity they stand idle matter how much humanity ﬁnds of misery and death in this decision this statement is not peroration to declaration socialism it seems fair rendering of the matter logic of the analysis it seems hopeless and also unfair to expect insurance employment bureaus or philanthropy to counteract the controlling force of there is every reason to believe that has been tremendous stimulus to economic activity in the past it is doubtful if the present great accumulation of capital would have come into existence without it but it seems it were to be caught up by its own social consequences it is hard to escape from the insistence of situation in which the money workman makes in year fails to cover the upkeep of his family and this impairment of the father income throu gh unemployment has largely to be met by and the federal immigration commission report shows that in not single great american industry can the average yearly income of the father keep his family seven hundred and ﬁfty dollars is the bare minimum the maintenance of the american industrial family the average yearly earnings of the heads of families working in the united states in the iron and steel industry is 409 in bituminous 451 in the woolen industry 400 in silk 448 in cotton 470 in clothing 530 in boots and shoes 573 in leather 511 in sugar 549 in the meat industry 578 in furniture 598 etc he who decries created work municipal or even sentimental charity in the face of the winter destitution has an unsocial soul the most despicable thing is the whine of our cities lest their inadequate catering to their own homeless draw few vagrants from afar but when the agony of our winter makeshifting is by will sufﬁcient minority of our citizens rise and demand that the best technical economic and sociological brains in our wealthy nation devote themselves with all courage and honesty to the problem of unemployment the project gutenberg ebook of an american idyll by author https was diplomat in any sense of the all political diplomat it is wonder that the immigration and housing commission stood behind him long it did he grew rabid at every political appointment which in his eyes hampered his work it was evident so they felt that he was not tactful in his relations with various members of the commission it all galled him terribly and after much consultation at home he handed in his resignation during the ﬁrst term of his secretaryship from october to december he carried his university work from january to may he had seminar only i remember from august on he gave university work at all so after asking to have his resignation from the commission take effect at once he had at once to ﬁnd something to to support his family this was in october 1914 after just one year executive secretary we were over in contra costa county then on little ranch of my father berkeley socially had come to be too much of strain and too we wanted the blessed sons to have real country experience ten months we were there three days after carl resigned he was on his way to phoenix arizona there was threatened union united states government investigator of the labor situation he added thereby to his and stock of labor made ﬁrm friend of governor hunt was especially interested in his prison policy in those few weeks was the richer by one more of the really intimate friendships one counts on to the ill scarlett he wrote on carl death what horrible hideous loss any of us could so easily have been spared that he who was of such value had to go seems such an utter waste he was one of that very very small circle of men whom in the course of our lives we come really to love his friendship meant so though i heard but infrequently from him there was the satisfaction of deep friendship that was always there and always the same he would have gone so far i have looked forward to great career him and had such pride in him it too hideous chapter x in january 1915 carl took up his teaching again in real earnest commuting to alamo every night i would have the boys in bed and the little supper all ready by the ﬁre then i would prowl down the road with my electric torch to meet him coming home he would signal in the distance with his torch and i with mine then the walk back together sometimes in mud then supper making the toast over the coals and an evening absolutely to ourselves and never in all our lives did we ask more joy than that that spring we began building our very own home in berkeley the months in alamo had made us feel that we could never bear to be in the centre of things again nor that matter could we afford lot in the centre of things so we bought high up on the berkeley hills where we could realize much privacy was possible and yet where our friends could reach they could stand the climb the love of nest we built we were longer in that house than anywhere else two years almost to the years of such happiness other home has ever seen there around the redwood table in the by the window overlooking the golden gate we had the suppers that meant much joy to us and i hope to the friend s we gathered around us there on the porches overhanging the very canyon itself we had our sunday each time carl would plead i have to wear stiff collar i and he knew that i would answer you wear anything you want which usually meant blue soft shirt we had little in back the boys and then most wonderful of all came the day when the was born the daughter who was to be the very light of her adoring father eyes her real name is alice lee the project gutenberg ebook of an american idyll by author https mother there never really was such baby was there he would ask ten times day she was not born up on the hill but in ten days we were back from the hospital and out day and night through that glorious july on some one of the porches overlooking the bay and the hills and we added our adored nurse balch friend of the family forever i always think of nurse balch the person who more than any other perhaps understood to some degree just what happiness ﬁlled our lives day in and day out one assumes anything before trained are around too constantly that they see the misery in homes they see what joy there is and nurse balch saw because she was around practically all the time six weeks that there was nothing but joy every minute of the day in our home i not know how i can make people understand who are used to just ordinary happiness what sort of life carl and i led it was not just that we got along it was an active not passive state there was never say at that did not seem an our curve of happiness abruptly rose meals were joyous occasions always perhaps too scant attention paid to the manners of the young but much gurglings and tell some more daddy and always detailed accounts of every little happening during the last few hours of separation then there was ever the difﬁculty of though it meant only few hours until supper and at supper he would come up the front stairs i waiting him at the top perhaps limping that was his little had many little family jokes limping meant that i was to look in every pocket until i unearthed bag of peanut candy usually he was laden with shoes from the cobbler restrung and an armful of books after greetings always the question how my bug and family procession upstairs to peer over crib at fat gurgler and mother there never really was such baby was there nor such father it was that ﬁrst summer back in berkele y the year before the was born when carl was teaching in summer school that we had our deﬁnite enthusiasm over labor psychology aroused will ogburn who was also teaching at summer school that year and whose lectures i attended introduced us to hart psychology of insanity several books by freud mcdougall social psychology etc i remember carl seminar the following last seminar at the university of california he had started with nine seminar students three years before now there were they were all such superior picked lot some seniors mostly graduates that he felt there was one he could ask to stay out i visited it all the term and i am sure that nowhere else on the campus could quite such heated and excited discussions have been simply sitting at the head of the table directing here leading there the general subject was labor the students had to read one book such books hart psychology of insanity keller societal evolution holt freudian wish mcdougall social psychology weeks to that preface to politics veblen instinct of workmanship wallas great society thorndike educational psychology hoxie scientiﬁc management ware the worker and his country parker biology and social problems and so and ending concession to the idealists with royce philosophy of loyalty one of the graduate students of the seminar wrote three years i sat in his seminar on labor and had we both been there ten years longer each season would have found in his class his inﬂuence on my intellectual life was by far the most stimulating and helpful of all the men i have known but his spirit and inﬂuence will live on in the lives of those who sat at his feet and learned the seminar was too large really intimate discussion so after few weeks several of the boys asked carl if they could have little it was very rushed time him but he said that if they would arrange all the details he would save them tuesday evenings so every tuesday night about dozen boys climbed our hill to rediscuss the subject of the seminar of that everything else under the heavens and beyond i laid out ham sandwiches or sausages or some edible dear to the male heart and coffee to be warmed and about midnight could be heard the sounds of the project gutenberg ebook of an american idyll by author https the kitchen three students told on graduation that those tuesday nights at our house had meant more intellectual stimulus than anything that ever came into their lives one of these boys wrote to after carl death when i heard that doc had gone one of the ﬁnest and cleanest men i have ever had the privilege of associating with i seemed to have stopped thinking it did seem possible to and i can remember very clearly of thinking what rotten world this is when we have to live and lose man like doc i have talked to two men who were associated with him in somewhat the same manner i was and we simply looked at one another after the ﬁrst sentences and then i guess the thoughts of man who had made so much of an impression on our minds drove cohere nt speech away i have had the opportunity since leaving college of experiencing something real besides college life and i ca remember during all that period of not having wondered how parker would handle this or that situation he was simply immense to at all times and if love of man kind does exist then i truthfully can say that i had that love him of the letters received from students of those years i should like to quote passage here and there an aviator in france writes there was man like him in my college life believe he has been ﬁgure in all we over here who knew him reason our doing too his loss is so great to all of us he was so ﬁne he will always push us on to ﬁnding the truth about things that was his great spark was it from second lieutenant in france i loved carl he was far more to than just was father brother and friend all in one he inﬂuenced you know everything i have done since i knew it was his enthusiasm which has been the force which determined the direction of my work and the bottom seemed to have fallen out of my whole scheme of things when the word just came to from one of the young ofﬁcers at camp lewis when told about carl illness last wednesday i resolved to go and see him the coming i carried out my resolution only to ﬁnd that i could see neither him nor you this was the day before carl death it was great disappointment to so i left some ﬂowers and went away i simply could not leave seattle without seeing carl once more so i made up my mind to go out to the undertaker the friend s i was with discouraged the idea but it was too strong within there was void within which could only be ﬁlled by seeing my friend once more i went out there and stood by his side quite while i recalled the happy days spent with him on the campus i thought of his kindliness his loyalty his devotion carl parker shall always occupy place in the recesses of my memory true example of nobility it was hard to leave but i felt much better from one of his women students always from the ﬁrst day when i knew him he seemed to give joy of life and an inspiration to work which other person or thing has ever given and it is joy and an inspiration i shall always keep i seldom come to in my work that i stop to wonder what carl parker would were he solving that problem another letter i have chosen to quote from was written by former student now in paris we could not without him he meant too much to us i come now young friend to put myself by your side moment and to try to share great sorrow which is mine almost much it is yours i am sure that after you there were few indeed who loved carl much i oh i am remembering hundred things ﬁrst day i found you both in the little house on hearst dinners we used to have the times i used to come on sunday morning to ﬁnd you both and the day just before i graduated when mother and i had lunch at your house and ﬁnally that day i left you and the project gutenberg ebook of an american idyll by author https both of you come back without seeing some of the cities of europe i have missed some of the cities to have come back and found you both some of him we ca keep the quaint old gray quiet wholly conﬁdent poise with which he deﬁed all inexhaus tible and incorrigible fund of we lose use to lose it write it off gulp go on but other things we keep none the less the stimulus and impetus and inspi ration are not lost and shall not be one has counted the youngsters he has hauled by the scruf f of the neck often not out of slough of mediocrity and sent careering off into some welter or current of ideas and conjecture carl did know where they would end and more any of the rest of us he knew he loathed stagnation and he stirred things and stirred people and the end of the stirring is far from being yet known or realized i like too story one of the regents told he ran into student from his home town and asked how his work at the university was going the boy looked at him eagerly and said i been born again born again were his very words i entered college thinking of it preparation making more money when i got out i come across man named parker in the faculty and am taking everything he gives now i know i be selling out my life to make money the goal i know now too that whatever money i make can never be at the expense of the happiness and welfare of any other human being chapter xi about this time we had friend come into our lives who was destined to mean great things to the rosenber he had heard carl lecture once or twice had met him through our good friend brown and warm friendship had developed in the spring of 1916 we were somewhat tempted by call to another 1700 was really not fortune to live on and to make both ends meet and prepare the coming carl had to use every spare minute lecturing outside it discouraged him he had time left to read and study so when call came that appealed to us in several ways besides paying much larger salary we seriously considered it about then uncle max rang up from san francisco and asked carl to see him before answering this other university and an appointment was made that afternoon i was to be at formal luncheon but told carl to be sure to call up the minute he left wondered so hard what he might mean and what he did mean was the most wonderful idea that ever entered friend head he felt that carl had real message to give the world and that he should write book he also realized that it was impossible to ﬁnd time book under the circumsta nces therefore he proposed that carl should take year leave of absence and let max ﬁnance only just ﬁnance him but allow trip throughout the east him to get the inspiration of contact with other men in his ﬁeld and enough withal so that there should be skimping anywhere and the little family at home should have everything they needed it seemed to us something too wonderful to believe i remember going back to that table after carl had telephoned only the broadest details wondering if it were the same world that had dreamed of writing that book so many material to be in it changed continually but always the longing to write and time hopes of any chance to it and the coming and more need hence more outside lectures than ever i have love the university of california when i think of that 1700 i quote from an article that came out in new york it is an astounding fact which his university must explain that he with his great abilities the project gutenberg ebook of an american idyll by author https and leader his wide travel and experience and training received from the university in his last year of service there salary of 1700 year the west does not repay commercial genius like that days after max offer we hardly knew we were on earth it was so very much the most wonderful thing that could have happened to us our friends had long ago adopted the phrase just parker luck and here was an example if there ever was one parker luck indeed it was this all meant to get the fulness out of it that carl must make trip of at least four months in the east at ﬁrst he planned to return in the middle of it and then go back again but somehow four months spent we planned it out him seemed so absolutely marvelous opportunity of lifetime joy him was greater in my soul than the dread of separation it was differen t from any other parting we had ever had i was bound that i would not shed single tear when i saw him off even though it meant the longest time apart we had experienced three nights before he left being bit blue about things all our ﬁne talk we prowled down our hillside and found our way to our ﬁrst charlie chaplin ﬁlm we laughed until we really did so that night seeing carl off we went over that charlie chaplin ﬁlm in detail and let ourselves think and talk of nothing else we laughed all over again and carl went off laughing and i waved laughing bless that charlie chaplin ﬁlm it would not take much imagination to realize what that trip meant to through him to from the time he ﬁrst felt the importance of the application of modern psychology to the study of economics he became more and more intellectuall y isolated from his colleagues they had interest in sympathy understanding of what he was driving at from may when college closed to october when he left the east he read prodigiously he had mind knew where to store every new piece of knowledge he acquired and kept thereby an orderly brain he read more than book week everything he could lay hands on in psychology anthropology biology philosophy ﬁeld which he felt contributed to his own growing conviction that orthodox economics had served its day and how he glorie d in that reading it had been years since he had been able to anything but just keep up with his daily lectures such was the pressure he was working under bless his heart he was always coming across something that was just too good to hold in and i would hear him come upstairs two steps at time bolt into the kitchen and say just listen to this and he would read an extract from some treasure that would make him glow but outside of myself i was only able to keep up with him by the merest skimmings one or two others at most there was one who understood what he was driving at his reading and convictions grew he waxed more and more outraged at the way economics was handled in his own university he saw student after student having every ounce of intellectual curiosity ground out of them by process of economic education that would stultify genius any student who continued his econom ic studies did so in spite of the introductory work not because he had had one little ounce of enthusiasm aroused in his soul carl would walk the ﬂoor with his hands in his pockets when kindred studen ts who had gone through the mill and seniors or graduates looked back outraged at certain courses they had had to ﬂounder brought up the subject of economics at the university of california off he went then on his pilgrimage research magniﬁcent unknown to almost every man he hoped to see before his return the ﬁrst stop he made was at columbia missouri to see his idol veblen he quaked bit beforehand heard veblen might not see him the second letter from missouri began just got in after thirteen hours with veblen it went wonderfully and i am tickled to death he my idea entirely and said i could not go wrong gee but it is some grand experience to go up against him in the next letter he told of graduate student who came out to get his advice regarding in labor i told him to go to his new england home and study the reaction of on the life of the town that is typical veblen subject it scared the project gutenberg ebook of an american idyll by author https to death and veblen chuckled over my advice in wisconsin he was especially anxious to see guyer of his visit with him he wrote it was whiz of sessi on he is just my meat at yale he saw keller he is wonder and is going to lot in criticism then began the daily letters from new york and every single only from new york but from every other place he happened to be in baltimore philadelphia of at least one intellec tual capital day one ever lived who had more stimulating experience friends would ask what is the news from carl and i would just gasp every letter was so full of the new inﬂuences coming into his life that it was impossible to give even an idea of the history in the making that was going on with the parkers in the ﬁrst days in new york he saw morgan i just walked in on him and introduced myself baldly and he is corker remarkable talker with mind like ﬂash i am to see him again will be big day see hollingworth and very probably thorndike and i know then something of what i get out of new york next day called on hollingworth he gave some invaluable data and opinions i see thorndike and the next day i so joyful and excited over thorndike he was so enthusiastic over my work he at once had ideas said i was strikes usually started because of small and very human violations of man innate dispositions later he called on professor mitchell he went into my thesis very fully and is all it professor mitchell knows more than any one the importance of psychology to economics and he is all my study gee but i get excited after such session i bet i get out real book my girl after one week in new york he wrote the trip has paid itself now and i dead eager to view the time when i begin my writing later just got in from session with the most important group of employers in new york i sat in on meeting of the building trades board where labor delegates and employers appeared after two hours of it awfully interesting the board took to dinner and we talked labor stuff till gee it was ﬁne and i got oceans of stuf then came boas and more visits with thorndike i put in six hours with thorndike and am pleased plum to death under his friendly stimulus i developed heap of new ideas and say wait till i begin writing i have ten volumes at the present rate this visit with thorndike was worth the whole trip and in turn thorndike wrote the days that he and i spent together in new york talking of these things are one of my ﬁnest memories and i appreciate the chance that let meet him he wrote from the harvard club where walter lippmann put him up the dad is clubman just lolled back at lunch in room with animals stuffed all around the walls and waiters ﬂying about and ceiling up mile gee later i just had most wonderful visit with the director of the national committee mental hygiene solman and he is wiz wiz next day had remarkable visit with gregory this he is one of the greatest psychiatrists in new york and up on balkings business tension and the mental effect of monotonous work he was so worked up over my explanation of unrest mental status through other than sex that he asked if i would consider using his big psychopathic ward laboratory ﬁeld my own work then he dated up luncheon at which three of the biggest mental specialists in new york will be present to talk over the manner in which psychiatry will aid my research i ca say how tickled i am over his attitude next letter at ten reached pierce bailey the big psychiatrist and an hour and half we talked and i was simply tickled to death he is really wonder and i was very enthused before leaving he said come to dinner friday night here and i will have paton from princeton and i get in some more to meet you then i beat it to the republic ofﬁces and sat down to dinner with the staff plus robert bruère and the subject became is labor policy the dad he did

beat it new haven on thursday or i die of brain are you realizing what this all meant to my recently reading and pegging away unencouraged in his basement study up on the berkeley hills the next day he heard roosevelt at the then i watched that remarkable man wind the crowd almost around his ﬁnger it was great and pure psychology and say fool women and some fool men but went on blithely if every one was an intellectual giant that night dinner with winston churchill next letter had simply superb talk with hollingworth two and half hours this afternoon the dinner was the four biggest psychiatrists in new york and dad made simply yell it did it was my book simply superb all is going so wonderfully next day now about the thorndike dinner it was grand i ca tell you how much these talks are maturing my ideas about the book i think in different plane and am certain that my ideas are surer there have come up lot of odd problems touching the conﬂict between intelligence and instinct and these i getting thrashed out grandly after the second new republic dinner he wrote lots of important people there felix frankfurter two judges and the two goldmarks pierce bailey and the whole staff had been all day with gregory and other psychiatrists and had met police commissioner woods wonderfully rich day i must run date with professor robinson and then to meet howe the immigration commissioner then trip to ellis island and at midnight that same date he wrote just had most truly to with professor robinson he who wrote that european history we bought in germany then

wonder and big friendly boy i him million then his visit with john dewey i put up to him my regular main one being the importance of the conﬂict between macdougall and the freudians he was cordiality

his second visit there had grand visit and then at six was taken with gay to dinner with the visiting deans at the project gutenberg ebook of an american idyll by author https harvard club holt wrote i met parker brieﬂy in the winter of 17 brieﬂy but so very delightfully i felt that he was an ally and brilliant one i give these many details because you must appreciate what this new wonder meant to man who was considered nobody much by his own university then one day mere card this is honestly day in which two minutes of free time superbly grand has it gone and so fruitful the best of all yet one of the biggest men in the united states cannon of harvard asked to arrange my thesis to be analyzed by group of experts in the ﬁeld next day he wrote up at and at i was at professor cannon i put my thesis up to him strong and got one of the most encoura ging and stimulating receptions i have had he took in to meet his wife and said young man has stimulated and aroused greatly we must get his thesis formally before group later from new york from to i argued with brill who translated all of freud and it was simply wonderful i came home at twelve and wrote up lot later he went to washington with walter lippmann they ran into colonel house on the train and talked foreign relations two and half hours my hair stood on end at the importance of what he said from washington he wrote am having one of the great experiences of my young life hurried full days in philadelphia with most successful talk before the university of pennsylvania political and social science conference successful was the report to later of several who were present and extreme kindness and hospitality from all the wharton group he rushed to baltimore and at midnight december 31 he wrote i had from to one an absolute super grand talk with adolph meyer and john watson he is grand young southerner and simply knows his behavioristic psychology in way to make one hair stand up we talked my plan clear out and they are enthusiastic things are going grandly next day just got in from dinner with adolph meyer he is simply wonder at thirty i watched campbell give girl freudian treatment suicide mania she had been worker in factory and had true industrial kind i am looking then later there is absolutely doubt that the trip has been my making i have learned lot of background things and standards that will put their stamp on my development almost every letter would tell of some one visit which alone was worth the trip east around christmastime got extra wrote ﬁve letters in three days i really wish i could quote some from he said instance my but it is good fellow to be with his family and awful to be away from it and again i want to be interrupted i i all that i remember how jim and nand used to come into my study kiss and then go hastily out upon urgent affairs i that i got my own folk and they make the rest of the world thin and pale the blessedness of babies is beyond words but the blessedness of wife is such that one ca start in on it then came the at too full to begin to quote from them i simply having the time of my life every one is here in talk when he was asked to ﬁll in at the last minute he presented two arguments why alone could not be depended on to bring desirable change in working conditions through collective bargaining one because they were numerically so few in contrast to the number of industrial workers and two because the reforms about to be demanded were technical medical and generally of scientiﬁc character and skilled experts employed by the state would be necessary back again in new york he wrote it just raises my hair to feel i not where dad ought to be my blessed precious family i tell you there is anything in this world like wife and babies and i that life that puts close i near smart enough to last heap of years though when i see how my trip makes feel alive in my head and enthusiastic i know it has been worth while along in january he worked his thesis up in writing last night i read my paper to the robinsons after the dinner and they had and john dewey there most superb and grand discussion followed the project gutenberg ebook of an american idyll by author https going home at and i stayed to talk to one i slept dreaming wildly of the discussion then had an hour and half with dewey on certain moot points that talk was even more superb and resultful to and i just about ready to quit i need now to write and read i quote bit here and there from paper written in new york in 1917 because though hurriedly put together and never meant publication it describes carl newer approach to economics and especially to the problem of labor in 1914 i was asked to investigate riot among 2800 migratory in california which had resulted in ﬁve deaths more wounded hysteria fear and strange orgy of irresponsible persecution by the county on the side of the laborers conspiracy sabotage and open revolutionary propaganda i had been teaching labor year and had studied them in two american universities under sidney webb in london and in four universities of germany i found that i had fundamentals which could be called good tools with which to begin my analysis of this riot and i felt myself merely conventional if astonished onlooker before the theoretically abnormal but manifestly natural emotional activity which swept over california after what must have been most usual intellectual cycle of ﬁrst helplessness then conventional cataloguing some rationalizing some moralizin g and an extensive feeling of shallowness and inferiority i called the job done by accident somewhat later i was loaned two books of freud and i felt after the reading that i had found scientiﬁc approach which might lead to the discovery of important fundamentals study of unrest and violence under this stimulatio n i read during year and half general psychology physiology and anthropology eugenics all the special material i could ﬁnd on mendelism works on mental hygiene feeblemindedness insanity evolution of morals and character and ﬁnally found in ﬁeld which seems to be best designated abnormal and behavioristic psychology my quest throughout this experience seemed to be pretty steadily search those irreducible fundamentals which i could use in getting technically decent opinion on that riot in grand phrases i was searching the scientiﬁc standard of value to be used in analyzing human behavior economics which ofﬁcially holds the analysis of labor has been allowed to devote itself almost entirely to the production of goods and to neglect entirely the consumption of goods and human organic welfare the given by orthodox economics to the ﬁeld of consumption seems to be inspired merely by the feeling that disaster might overcome production if workers were starved or busin ess men discouraged so while ofﬁcial economic science tinkers at its transient institutions which ﬂourish in one decade and pass out in the next abnormal and behavioristic psychology physiology psychiatry are building in their laboratories by induction from human specimens of modern economic life standard of human values and an elucidation of behavior fundamentals which alone we must use in our legislative or personal modiﬁcation of modern civilization it does not seem an overstatement to say that orthodox economics has cleanly overlooked two of the most important generalizations about human life which can be phrased and those are that human life is dynamic that change movement evolution are its basic characteristics that and therefore freedom of choice and movement are prerequisites to satisfying human state after giving description of the instincts he writes the importance to of the following description of the innate tendencies or instincts lies in their relation to my main explanation of economic behavior which is first that these tendencies are persi stent are far less warped or modiﬁed by the environment than we believe that they function quite they have several the project gutenberg ebook of an american idyll by author https years that they motives in their various normal or perverted can at times dominate singly the entire behavior and act if they were clear character dominant secondly that if the environment through any of the conventional instru ments of repression such religious orthodoxy university mental

programme set forth in this paper i have already mentioned that it was written in the spring of 1917 and hurriedly in referring to this very paper in letter from new york he said of course it is written in part to call out comments and so the statements are strong and unmodiﬁed let that fact then be borne in mind and also the fact that he may have altered his views somewhat in the light of his further studies and again such studies may only have strengthened the following ideas i can not now trust to my memory what discussions we may have had on the subject reform means militant

this minority two real sources seem in universities and the ﬁeld of speculation and hospital experiment the one the universities with rare if wonderful exceptions are fairly hopeless the other is not only rich in promise but few realize how full in performance most of the literature which is gripping that great intellectual land of the silent readers is basing its appeal and its story on the rather uncolored and bald facts which come from freud trotter robinson dewey holt lippmann morton prince pierce bailey jung hart overstreet thorndike campbell meyer and watson stanley hall adler white it is from this ﬁeld of comparative or abnormal psychology that the challenge to industrialism and the programme of change will come but suppose you ask to be concrete and give an idea of such programme take simply the beginning of life take childhood that is where the human material is least protected most plastic and where most injury is done in the way of general suggestion i would say

acceptance new standard of morality the ﬁrst step towards this is to break down the to free experimental thinking if only the time had been only the book itself could have been ﬁnished he had great message he was writing about thousand words day on it the following summer at castle crags when the war department called him into mediation work and not another word did he ever ﬁnd time to add to it it stands now about one third done the project gutenberg ebook of an american idyll by author https get that third ready publication together with some of his shorter articles there have been many who have offered their services in completing the book but the ﬁeld is so new carl contribution so unique that few men in the whole country under stand the ground enough to be of service it was not so much to be book on labor on labor that is almost an unexplored ﬁeld chapter xii three days after carl started east on his arrival in seattle president suzzallo called him to the university of washington head of the department of economics and dean of the college of business administration his work to begin the following autumn it seemed an ideal opportunity he wrote i am very very attracted by suzzallo he said that i should be allowed to plan the work i wished and call the men i wished and could call at least ﬁve i can not imagine better man to work with nor better proposition than the one he put up to the job itself will let teach what i wish and in my own way i can give introductory economics and labor and industrial organization etc later he telegraphed from new york where he had again seen suzzallo have accepted washington offer details of job even more satisfactory than before so sandwiched in between all the visits and interviews over the book were many excursions about locating new men the university of washington i like to think of what the three pennsylvania men he wanted had to say about him seattle seemed very far away to were doubtf ul very then they heard the talk before the conference referred to above and every one of the three accepted his call one of them expressed it to his wife later i go anywhere that man between that seattle call and his death there were eight universities some of them the biggest in the country which wished carl parker to be on their faculties one smaller university held out the presidency to him besides this there were nine jobs outside of university work that were offered him from managing large mine to doing research work in europe he had come into his own it was just before we left berkeley that the university of california asked carl to deliver an address explaining his approach to economics it was doubt the most difﬁcult talk he ever gave there under his very nose sat his former colleagues his fellow members in the economics department and he had to stand up in public and tell them just how inadequate he felt most of their teaching to be the head of the department came in triﬂe late and left immediately after the lecture he could hardly have been expected to include himself in the group who gathered later around carl to express their interest in his stand i shall quote bit from this paper to show carl ideas on orthodox economics this brings one to perhaps the most costly delinquency of modern economics and that is its refusal to incorporate into its weig hings and appraisals the facts and hypotheses of modern psychology nothing in the postulates of the science of economics is ludicrous its catalogue of human wants though the practice of ascribing to man has been passed by psychology into deserved discard economics still maintains basic human qualities galaxy of vague and rather spiritual faculties it matters not that in the place of the primitive concepts of man stimulated to activity by single trucking sense or free and uninﬂuenced force called soul or ﬁnancial independence psychology has established human being possessed of more instincts than any animal and with psychical nature whose activities fall completely within the causal law it would be great task and useless one to work through current economic literature and gather the strange and mystical collection of human dispositions which economists have named the springs of human activity they have relation to the the project gutenberg ebook of an american idyll by author https into human behavior of psychology or physiology they have an interesting relation only to the moral attributes postulated in current religion but more important and injurious than the caricaturing of wants has been the disappearance from economics of any treatment or interest in human behavior and the evolution of human character in econom ic life this is explained in large part by the divorce of economics from the biological ﬁeld but also in an important way by the exclusion from economics of considerations of consumption only under the inﬂuence of the social and educational psychologists and behaviorists could the hobo unemployment poverty and criminality be given their just emphasis and it seems accurate to ascribe the social sterility of economic theory and its programme to its ignorance and lack of interest in modern comparative psychology deeper knowledge of human instincts would never have allowed american economists to keep their faith in simple rise of wages an labor unrest in england with homogeneous labor class active in politics maintaining university extension courses spending their union income on intricate betterment schemes and wealthy in rise in wages meant an increase in welfare but in the united states with heterogeneous labor class beref t of their social norms by the violence of their uprooting from the old world dropped into an unprepared and chaotic american life with its insidious rise in wages could and does often mean added ostentation social climbing superﬁcial polishing new vice this social pervers ion in the consuming of the is without the ken of the economist he can not if he would think of it he has mental tools norms applicable entrance into the medley of human motives called consumption these many reasons economic thinking has been weak and futile in the problems of conservation of haphazard invention of unrestricted advertising of production of the inadequacy of income of criminality these are problems within the zone of the intimate life of the population they are economic problems and determine efﬁciencies within the whole economic life the divorcing inspection of the ﬁeld of production from the rest of the machinery of civilization has brought into practice false method and the values arrived at have been unhappily america is monument to the truth that growth in wealth becomes signiﬁcant national welfare only when it is joined with an efﬁcient and social policy in its consumption economics will only save itself through an alliance with the sciences of human behavior psychology and biology and through complete emancipation from mores the sin of economics has been the divorce of its work from reality of announcing an analysis of human activity with the human element left out one other point remained ever sore spot with carl and that was the american university and its accomplishments in going over his writings i ﬁnd scattered through the manuscripts explosions on the ways means and ends

uncomfortable humor to visualize any of his campuses the origins of social protests the large industry of american college athletics and its concept the tendency to set up an efﬁcient corporation the

intellectual bent toward experimental thinking perhaps here is where i may quote letter carl received just before leaving berkeley and his answer to it this correspondence brings up several points on which carl at times received criticism and i should like to give the two sides each so typical of the point of view it represents february 28 1917 my dear carlet on p arker when we so casually meet it

wondered too if in the great opportu nity that has come to you those simpl country boys and girls of washington were to be thus deprived to ﬁnd not you but your authorities carl parker refused even

village was not happy one and the incongruity of our emotional prayers and ecstasies of imagery and the drifting dullness and meanness of the life outside ﬁltered in some way into my boy mind i saw

of some gentle form of egotism i was then truly in vault i did things system of ethics not because of ﬁne rush of social brotherly intuition my imagination was ever concerned with and my prospects my

brings an emancipation to him i can sincerely make this terrib le charge against the modern world and that is that it is its bent towards mysticism its blinding itself through hysteria which makes possible in its civilization its desperate inequalities of its tortured children its unhappy men and women its wasted potentiality we have not been humble and asked what is man we have not allowed ourselves to weigh sorrow it is in such use that our powers of imagination could be brotherly we look on high in ecstasy and fail to be on ﬂame because the suffering of those whose wounds are bare to

glad you wrote sincerely yours carleton parker chapter xiii in may we sold our loved hill nest in berkeley and started north stopping three months ﬁrst real vacation since we had been castle crags where almost ten years before we had spent the ﬁrst ﬁve days of our honeymoon before going into southern oregon there in among the pines we passed unbelievably cherished play and the family together day in day out there was one little extra trip he got in with the two sons whic h i am so thankful the three of them went off with their and rods two days leaving the girls behind each son caught his ﬁrst trout with ﬂy they put the ﬁsh cleaned in cool sheltered spot because they had to be carried home to see and lo little bear came down in the night and ate the ﬁsh in addition to licking the fat all off the then like bolt from the blue came the fateful telegram from washington difﬁculties in at camp he report there at once government mediator oh the book the book that was to be ﬁnished without fail before the new work at the university of washington began perhaps he would be back in week surely he would be back in week so he packed just enough week and off he went one week when after four weeks there was still let up in his mediation duties fact they increased packed up the family and we left seattle i had rewound his with orange silk and had revarnished it surprise his to castle crags he never ﬁshed with it again how that man loved ﬁshing how he loved every sport that matter and he loved them with the same thoroughness and allegiance that he gave to any cause near his heart played on his team also he could recite casey at the bat with gusto that many friend of the earlier days will remember and here i the project gutenberg ebook of an american idyll by author https of his christopher columnibus i recently ran across postcard college mate sent carl from italy years ago with picture of statue of columbus on it on the reverse side the friend had written quoting from carl monologue joe says the king which is being interpreted i see you ﬁrst cakes says chris which is the egyptian joe he loved football track won three gold medals jumping swimming billiards won loving cup at that tennis skating and yes ye of ﬁner calibre quiver if you loved and played mighty good game of poke r well in the ten and half years that we were married i can not remember that he played poker once or bridge more than ﬁve times he did however enjoy his bridge with simon patton in philadelphia and when he played he played well i tell you there was hardly anything the man could not he could draw the funniest pictures you ever wish i could reproduce the letters he sent his sons from the east he was good joy it meant to his soul to add tool ever so often to his collection sunday morning was special carpenter shelves here bookcase there new steps up to the etc i have heard many man say that he told story better than any one they ever heard he was an expert woodsman and my gracious how he did love babies that hardly ﬁts in just here but i think of it now his love children colored his whole economic viewpoint there is the thing that possessed perception of the destructive signiﬁcance of the repressed and balked instincts of the migratory worker the unskilled the casuals the hoboes the womanless jobless voteless men to him their tragedy was akin to the tragedy of in our commercial ized cities more often than of anything else he used to talk to of the fatuous blindness of civilization that centred its economic activities in places where was perpetually repressed and imperiled the last time i saw him he was ﬂaming indigna tion at the ghastly record of children killed and maimed by trucks and automobiles what business had automobiles where children should be free to play what could be said the human wisdom of civilization that placed trafﬁc above in our denial to children to millions of men and women of the means satisfying their instinctive desires and innate dispositions he saw the principal explanation of crime labor the violence of strikes the ghastly violence of war 1 robert bruère in the new republic may 18 he could never pass any youngster anywhere without word of greeting from friend to friend i remember being in crowded car with him in our engaged days he was sitting next to woman with baby who was most unhappy over the ways of the world carl asked if he could not hold the squaller the mother looked bit doubtful but relinquished her child within two minutes the babe was content on carl knees clutching one of his ﬁngers in fat ﬁst and sucking his watch the woman leane d over to later she was about to depart with very sound asleep of fspring is he lovely that to his own the tenderness of him over his own any hour of the day or night he was alert to be of any service in any trouble big or little he had collection of tricks and stories on hand any youngster who happened along the special pet of our own boys was the submarine obo bird large ﬂapper dad arms fairly rent the air which was especially active early in the morning when small boys appeared to prefer staying in bed to getting up the obo bird went pak pak and lit on numerous objects about the sleeping porch carl two hands would plump stiff ﬁngers down on the railing or on small screw sticking out somewhere scratches then pak and more ﬂaps this time the obo bird would light triﬂe nearer the small boy whose turn it eyes and an agitated grin from ear to ear plus explosive giggles and gurglings emer ging from the covers nearer and nearer came the obo bird gigglier and gigglier got the small boy finally with spring and last pak pak pak the obo bird dove under the covers at the side of the bed and pinched the small boy who would not get up rather premium 1 the project gutenberg ebook of an american idyll by author https not rising promptly was the obo bird final ecstatic squeals from the pinched then now it my turn daddo from the other submarine obo bird lived in alaska and ate spooka biscuits there was just developing wee obo bird that made less vehement paks and pinched less special obo bird in fact the baby was not more than three month s old when the boys demanded subma rine obo bird that ate little spooka biscuits sister his trip to camp lewis threw him at once into the midst of the lumber difﬁculties of the northwest which lasted months the big strike in the lumber industry was on when he arrived he wrote it is strike to better conditions the are only the display feature the main body of opinion is from lot of unskilled workers who are sick of the ﬁlthy and rotten grub he wrote later of conference with the big lumbermen and of how they would not stay on the point but roared over the i told them that condemnation was not solution or businesslike but what we wanted was statement of how they were to open their plants more roars more demands troops etc i said i was college man not used to business but if business men had much trouble this keeping to the real points involved give faculty analysis they laughed over this and got down to business and in an hour lined up the affair in mighty good shape i wish it were proper to go into the details here of the various conferences the telegrams sent to washington the replies carl wrote i am saving all the copies you it is most interesting history each letter would end by three days at least i should start back i am getting frantic to be home home the parkers was always where we happened to be then castle crags was much home any place had ever been we had moved fourteen times in ten years of the eleven christmases we had had together only two had been in the same place there were times when home was pullman car it made difference one of the strange new feelings i have to get used to is the way i now look at places to live in it used to be that carl and i in passing the littles t bit of hovel would say we could be perfectly happy in place like that could we nothing makes any difference if we are together but certain kinds of what we called cuddly houses used to make us catch our breaths to think of the extra joy it would be living together tucked away in there now when i pass place that looks like that i have to drop down some kind of in my brain and not think at all until i get well by it labor conditions in the northwest grew worse strikes more general and ﬁnally carl wrote that he just must be indeﬁnitely on the job i am so you that i feel like packing up and coming i literally feel terribly but with all this feeling i see how i can not only have i been telegraphed to stay on the job but the situation is growing steadily worse last night my proposal day complaint and adjustment board suppression of violence by the state was turned down by the operators in tacoma president suzzallo and i fought six hours but it went down the whole situation is drifting into state of incipient sympathetic strikes later this is the most affair and i think it is going to get anywhere still later things are not going wonderfully in our mediation employers demanding everything and men granting much but not that again each day brings new crisis gee labor is unrestful and gee the pigheadedness of bosses human nature is sure one hundred per cent psychology also he wrote referring to the general situation at the university and in the community am getting absolutely crazy with enthusiasm over my job here it is too vigorous and resultful words and again the mediation between employers and men blew up at 4 and now host of nice new strikes show on the horizon there are lot of ﬁne operators but some hard shells again gee i learning and talk about material the book an article appeared in one of the new york papers recently entitled how carleton parker settled strikes the project gutenberg ebook of an american idyll by author https it was under his leadership that in less than year disputes which concerned government work in the paciﬁc northwest were settled and it was his method to lay the basis permanent relief he went along parker contribution was in the method he used labor leaders of all sorts would ﬂock to him in bitter weltering mass mouthing the set phrases of they use so effectually in stirring up trouble they would state their case and parker would quietly deduce the irritation points that seemed to stand out in the jumbled testimony then it would be almost laughable to the observer to hear the employer side of the case invariably it was just bitter just unreasoning and just violent the statement of their case by the workers parker would endeavor to ﬁnd in all this heap of words the irritation points of the other side but when study was ﬁnished his diagnosis made and his prescription of treatment completed parker always insisted in carrying it straight to the workers and he did not just tell them results he often took several hours sometimes several meetings of several hours each in these meetings he would go over every detail of his method from start to ﬁnish explaining answering questions meeting objections with reason and he always won them over but of course it must be said that he had tremendously compelling personality that carried him far chapter xiv at the end of august the little family was united again in seattle almost the clearest picture of carl i have is the eager look with which he scanned the people stepping out of our car at the station and the beam that lit up his face he spied us there is line in dorothy canﬁeld bent twig that always appealed to us the mother and father were separated few days to the utter anguish of the father especially and he remarked it hell to be happily married every time we were ever separated we felt just that in one of carl letters from seattle he had written the monthly wants to write an article on the so the ﬁrst piece of work he had to after we got settled was that we were tremendously excited and never got over chuckling at some of the people we knew about the country who would feel outrag ed at the atlantic monthly stooping to print stuff by that young radical and on such subject how we tore at the end to get the article off on time the stenographer from the university came about two one sunday afternoon i sat on the ﬂoor up in the and read the manuscript to her while she typed it off carl would rush down more copy from his study on the third ﬂoor i go over it while miss van doren went over what she had typed then the reading would begin again we hated to stop supper all three of us were so excited to get the job done it had to be at the main that night by eleven to arrive in boston when promised at it was in the envelope three limp people tore the car we put miss van doren on was to mail the article on her way home carl and i knowing this was an occasion treat if ever there was one routed out sleepy clerk and ate the remains of his sunday supply i can never express how grateful i am that that article was written and publish ed before carl died the inﬂuence of it ramiﬁed in many and the most unexpected directions i am still hearing of it we expected condemnation at the time there probably was plenty of it but only one condemner wrote on the other hand letters streamed in by the score from friends and strangers bearing the general message god bless you it that article is particularly signiﬁcant showing his method of approach to the whole problem of the after some two years of psychological study the project gutenberg ebook of an american idyll by author https the futility of much conventional american social analysis is due to its description of the given problem in terms of its relationship to some relatively unimportant or artiﬁcial institution few of the current analyses of strikes or labor violence make use of the basic standards of human desire and intention which control these phenomena strike and its demands are usually praised being or economically bearable or are condemned being unlawful or conﬁscatory these four attributes of strike are important only incidental consequences the habit of americans thus to measure up social problems to the current temporary and more or less accidental scheme of traditions and legal institutions long ago gave birth to our national belief that passing new law or forcing obedience to an old one was speciﬁc any unrest the current analysis of the and its activities is an example of this perverted and unscientiﬁc method the analysis which has given both satisfaction and basis treating the organization runs follows the organization is unlawful in its activity in its sabotage unpatriotic in its relation to the ﬂag the government and the war the rest of the condemnation is play upon these three attributes so proper and so sufﬁcient has this condemnatory analysis become that it is risky matter to approach the problem from another angle but it is now so obvious that our internal affairs are out of gear that any comprehensive scheme of national preparedness would demand that full and honest consideration be given to all forces determining the degree of american unity one force being this tabooed or ganization it would be best to announce here more or less dogmatic hypothesis to which the writer will steadfastly adhere that human behavior results from the rather simple arithmetical combination of the inherited nature of man and the environment in which his maturing years are passed man will behave according to the hints conduct which the accidents of his life have stamped into his memory mechanism slum produces mind which has only slum incidents with which to work and spoiled and protected child seldom rises to aggressive competitive behavior simply because its past life has stored up memory imprints from which predisposition to vigorous life can be built the particular things called the moral attribu tes of man conduct are conventionally found by contrasting this educated and trained way of acting with the exigencies and social needs or dangers of the time hence while his immoral or unpatriotic behavior may fully justify his government in imprisoning or eliminating him when it stands in some particular danger which his conduct intensiﬁes this punishment in way either explains his character or points to an enduring solution of his problem suppression while very often justiﬁed and necessary in the ﬂux of human relationship always carries social cost which must be liquidated and also backﬁre danger which must be insured against the human being is born with innate proclivity to crime or special kind of unpatriotism crime and treason are educated into man by environmental inﬂuences favorable to their development the can be proﬁtably viewed only psychological of the neglected childhood of industrial america it is discouraging to see the problem examined almost exclusively from the point of view of its relation to patriotism and conventional ventional commercial morality it is perhaps of value to quote the language of the most inﬂuential of the leaders ask why the is not patriotic to the united states if you were bum without blanket if you left your wife and kids when you went west job and had never located them since if your job never kept you long enough in place to qualify you to vote if you slept in lousy sour and ate food just rotten they could give you and get by with it if deputy sherif fs shot your full of holes and spilled your grub on the ground if your wages were lowered on you when the bosses thought they had you down if there was one law ford suhr and moo ney and another harry thaw if every person who represented law and order and the nation beat you up railroaded you to jail and the good christian people cheered and told them to go to it how in hell you expect man to be patriotic this war is business the project gutenberg ebook of an american idyll by author https and we see why we should go out and get shot in order to save the lovely state of affairs that we now enjoy the argument was rather difﬁcult to keep productive because material prerequisite to wanting in their attitude toward the american government their state of mind could be explained only by referring it was earlier suggested to its major relationships the dominating concern of the is what keller calls the maintenance problem their philosophy is in its simple reduction and their ndustrial revolt could be called without injustice hunger but there is an important correction to this simple statement while their way of living has seriously encroach ed on the urgent minima of nutrition shelter clothing and physical health it has also long outraged the american traditions touching social life and ostentation had the food and shelter been sufﬁcient the revolt tendencies might have simmered out were the migratory labor population not keenly sensitive to traditions of richer psychological life than mere physical maintenance the temper of the country on this subject the general closed attitude of mind which the average man holds thereon prompt to add here few more of carl generalizations and conclusions in this article if only he were here to cry aloud again and yet again on this point yet i know there are those who sense his approach and are endea voring in every way possible to make wisdom prevail over prejudice cynical disloyalty and contempt of the ﬂag must in the light of modern psychology come from mind which is devoid of national gratitude and in which the united states stirs memory of satisfaction or happiness to those of us who normally feel loyal to the nation such disloyal sentiment brings sharp indignation an index of our own sentiment and our own happy relations to the nation this indignation has value stimulus to programme or ethical generalization it is the cause of vast inaccu racy and sad injustice american syndicalism is not scheming group dominated by an unconventional and destructive social philosophy it is merely commonplace not such state of mind machiavelli or robespierre possessed but one stamped by the lowest most miserable labor and outlook which american industrialism produces to those who have seen at the life of the western casual laborer any reﬂections on his gratitude or spiritual buoyancy seem ironical humor an altogether unwarranted importance has been given to the syndicalist philosophy of the few leaders use its phraseology of these few not half dozen know the meaning of french syndicalism or english guild socialism to the great wande ring rank and ﬁle the is simply the only social break in the harsh search work that they have ever had its headquarters the only competitor of the saloon in which they are welcome it is conventional economic truism that american industrialism is guaranteeing to some half of the forty millions of our industrial population life of such limited happiness of such restrictions on personal development and of such misery and desolation when sickness or accident comes that we should be childish political scientists not to see that from such an environment little love of country little of ethics little of gratitude could come it is unfortunate that the scientiﬁc ﬁndings of our social condition must use words which sound strangely like the phraseology of the socialists this similarity however should logically be embarrassing to the critics of these ﬁndings not to the scientists those who have investigated and studied the lower strata of american labor have long recognized the purely symptom of certain distressing state of affairs the casual migratory laborers are the ﬁnishe d product of an economic environment which seems cruelly efﬁcient in turning out human beings modeled after all the standards which society abhors the history of the migratory workers shows that starting with the long hours and dreary winters on the farms they ran away from or the house in coal village through their character debasing experience with the drifting and ﬁre life in the industries on to the the project gutenberg ebook of an american idyll by author https and economic life of the winter unemployed their training predetermine d but one outcome and the environment produced its type the has importance only an illustration of stable american economic process its pitiful syndicalism its opposition to the war are the inconsequential trimmings its strike alone faithful it is to the american type is an illuminating thing the like the grangers the knights of labor the farmers alliance the progressive party is but phenomenon of revolt the cure lies in taking care of its psychic antecedents the stability of our republic depends on the degree of courage and wisdom with which we move to the task in this same connection i quote from another article one doubts the full propriety of the government suppressing ruthle ssly any interference of the with all patriots should just vehemently protest against all suppression of the normal protest activities of the there will be neither permanent peace nor prosperity in our country till the revolt basis of the is removed and until that is done the remains an unfortunate valuable symptom of diseased industrialism i watch along with many others the growth of bitterness and hysteria in the treatment of labor spreading throughout our country and i long with many others carl with his depth and sanity of understanding coupled with his passion justice and democracy to be somewhere in position of guidance these troublous times i am reminded here of little incident that took place just at this time an was to come out to have dinner with other friends faculty people also were to be there about noon the telephone rang carl went rich irish brogue announced ca come to your party why is that he pinched an he wants t know can he have your kant of pure reason to read while he in jail chapter xv i am forever grateful that carl had his experience at the university of washington before he died he left the university of california young assistant professor just one rebellious morsel in huge machine he found himself in washington not only head of the department of economics and dean of the college of commerce and power on the campus but power in the community well he was working under presi dent who backed him in everything to the last ditch who was keenly interested in every ambition he had making big thing of his work he at last could see introductory economics given he wanted to have it alizing at the same time that his plans were in the nature of an experiment the two textbooks used in the ﬁrst semester were mcdougall social psychology and wallas great society during part of the time he pinned the front page of the morning paper on the board and illustrated his by an item of news of that very day his theory of education was that the ﬁrst step in any subject was to awaken keen interest and curiosity in the student that reason he felt that pure theory in economics was too difﬁcult any but seniors or graduates that given too soon it tended only to discourage he allowed in any of his courses insisted on discussion by the class matter how large it was planned to away with written examinations test of scholarship substituting instead short oral discussion with each student individually grading them passed and not passed it was because of the pressure the project gutenberg ebook of an american idyll by author https work he had to resort to written tests the proportion of ﬁrst sections in the ﬁnal examination which was difﬁcult was so large that carl was sure the reader must have marked too leniently and looked over the papers himself his results were the same the reader and he felt could justiﬁably be used some proof of his theory that if student is interested in the subject you can not keep him from doing good work i quote here from two letters written by washington students who had been under his inﬂuence but ﬁve months may i only student add my inadequate sympathy the loss of most liberal man i have known while his going from my educative life can be nothing compared to his loss from very beautif ul family group yet the enthusiasm the radiance of his given in his classes during the semester i was privileged to know possible to greater realization of the fascination of humanity than i obtained during my previous four years of college study i still look him to enter the classroom nor shall i soon forget his ideals his faith in humanity from the second letter to have known parker well i did makes feel that i was indeed privileged and i shall always carry with the charm and inspiration of his glorious personality the campus was never so sad on the day which brought the news of his seemed almost incredible that one man in ﬁve short months could have left so indelible an impress of his character on the student body besides being of real inﬂuence on the campus he had the respect and conﬁdence of the business world both labor and capital and in addition he stood the represe ntative of the government in labor and disputes was of lesser consequence but oh it did we had money enough to live on we had made ourselves honestly think that we had just about everything we wanted on what we got plus outside lectures in california but once we had tasted of the freedom of truly enough once there was gone forever the stirring around to pick up few extra dollars here and there to make both ends meet once we knew the ﬁrst time the satisfaction and added joy that come from some responsible person to help with the felt that we were soaring through life with our feet hardly touching the ground instead of my spending most of the day in the kitchen and riding herd on the young we had our willard and see what that meant every morning at nine i left the house with carl and we walked together to the university i think of those daily walks now rain or shine i not give up the memory of them all creation carl would go over what he was to talk about that morning in introductory economics how it would have raised the hair of the orthodox econ i teacher and of course we always talked some of what marvelous children we possessed carl would begin t ell some more about the he would go to his nine i to mine after my class and on the way to my lecture i always ran in to his ofﬁce second to gossip over what mail he had got that morning and how thing s were going generally then at twelve in his ofﬁce again look at this telegram that just came in how shall i answer about that job and then home together not once week but every day afternoons except the three afternoons when i played hockey i was at home but always there was possibility that carl would ring up about ﬁve i am at meeting ca get things settled so we continue this evening run down and have supper with and perhaps who knows bill hart ﬁlm might be around town there was willard who knew just what to and off i could ﬂy to see my husband you ca on 1700 year i hear people nowadays scold and roar over the pay the working classes are getting and how they are spending it all on nonsens and not saving cent i stand it long i can and then i burst out i too have tasted the joy of at last being able to get things we never thought we would own and of feeling the wings of ﬁnancial freedom feather the project gutenberg ebook of an american idyll by author https before all had been cold calculation can we this if so what must we give up i wish every one on earth could feel it i not care if they not save cent only i wish my carl could have experienced those joys little longer it was so good good while it lasted and it was only just starting every new call he got to another university was at salary from one to two thousand dollars more than what we were getting even at seattle it looked if our days of ﬁnancial scrimping were gone forever we even discussed ford buick and every other sunday we had fricasseed chicken and always always frosting on the cake the ﬁrst two months in seattle we felt if we ought to have company at every meal it did not seem right to sit down to food good that with just the family present and it was such fun to bring home unexpected guests and to know that willard could concoct dream of dish while the guests were removing their hats and i not having to miss any of the conversation from being in the kitchen every other sunday night we had the whole department and their wives to sunday of them oh dear oh dear money does make difference we grew more determined than ever to see that more folk in the world got more of it and yet in sense carl was typical professor in his unconcern over matters ﬁnancial he started in the ﬁrst month we were married by turning over every cent to matter of course and from the beginning of each month to the end he never had the remotest idea how much money we possessed or what it was spent so far his peace of mind went on the whole he was capitalist he knew we needed more money than he was making at the university of california therefore he made all he could on the outside and came home and dumped it in my lap from one year end to the next he spent hardly ﬁve cents on new suit now and then new hat new shirts at sale but never penny that was not essential on the rest of he needed curbing hand i discovered him negotiating to buy set of jade when he was getting one hundred dollars month he would bring home box of peaches or tray of berries when they were ﬁrst in the market and eaten only by bank presidents and railway magnates and beam and say guess what surprise i have you nothing hurt his feelings more than to have him suggest i should buy something myself and have answer that we could not afford it then i dig sewers on the side he would exclaim you buy it and i ﬁnd the money it somewhere if he had turned off at an angle of ﬁfty degrees when he ﬁrst started his earthly career he would have been star example of the individual who presses the palms of his hands together and murmurs the lord will provide i never knew man who was so far removed from the traditional ideas of the proper position of the male head of household he felt i have said that he was not the one to have control over was the wife province then he had another attitude which certainly did not jibe with the idea perhaps there would be something i wanted to and i woul d wait to ask him about it when he got home invariably the same thing would happen he would take my two hands and put them so that i held his then he would place his hands on my shoulders beam all over eyes twinkling and say who boss of this household anyway and i had to answer i am who gets her own way one hundred per cent i who never gets his own way and never wants to get his own way you the project gutenberg ebook of an american idyll by author https well then you know perfectly well you are to anything in this world you want to with chuckle he would add think of in my own home seattle i look back on it meant the every way our little sprees together were not the ones of former years from the day carl left castle crags his time was never his own we could never count on anything from one day to the strike here an arbitration there government orders this some investigation needed that it was harassing it was wearying but always every few days there would be that telephone ring which i grew both to dread and to love often it said i got to go to tacoma it also said you girl put on your hat and coat this minute and come down town while i have few minutes have supper together anyhow and the feeling of the courting days never left almost sharp joy of being together again when we just locked arms block and said almost to repeat and the that always meant wrench always though it might mean being together within few hours and always the waving from the one on the back of the car to the one standing on the corner nothing nothing ever got tame after ten years if carl ever found himself little early to catch the train tacoma say though he had said but half an hour before and was to be back that evening he would ﬁnd and ring up to say perhaps that he was glad he had married willard once said that after hearing carl or talk to the other over the telephone it made other husbands and wives when they telephoned sound if they must be contemplating divorce but telephoning was an event it was little extra present from providence it were and i think of two times when we met accidentally on the street in seemed something we could hardly believe all the war commerce stopped while we tried to realize what had happened then every night that he had to be out he had to be out night after night in seattle would hear his footstep coming down the street it would wake though he wore rubber heels he would ﬁx the catch on the lock then come upstairs calling out softly you awake he always knew i was then sitting on the edge of the bed he would tell all the happenings since i had seen him last once in while he sigh and say little ranch up on the clearwater would go pretty well about now would it my girl and i would sigh and say oh dear would it i remember once when we were ﬁrst married he got home one afternoon before i did when i opened the door to our little seattle apartment there he was walking the ﬂoor looking if the bottom had dropped out of the universe i had the most awful twenty minutes he informed simply terrible promise absolutely that never never will you let get home before you to expect to ﬁnd you home and then open the door into empty i never lived through such twenty minutes we had lark whistle that we had used since before our engaged days carl would whistle it under my window at the theta house in college and i would run down and out the side door to the utter disgust of my sisters who arranged to make cutting remarks at the table about it in the hope that i would reform my tactics that whistle was whistled through those early seattle days through oakland through cambridge leipzig berlin heidelber g munich swanage berkeley alamo in the country berkeley again he would start it way down the hill so i could surely hear castle crags and seattle wherever any of us were in the house it meant dash all to the front welcome the dad home one evening i was scanning some article on marriage by the ﬁre in was one of those rare times that carl too was at home and going over lectures the next day the project gutenberg ebook of an american idyll by author https that to be successful marriage had to be an giving in here by the man there by the woman i said to carl if that is true you must have been doing all the adjusting i never have had to give up or ﬁt in or relinquish one little thing so you been doing it all he thought moment then answered you know i heard that too and wondered about it i know i given up nothing made on the contrary i seem always to have been getting more than human being had any right to count on it was that way even to the merest details such both liking identically the same things to eat seasoned the identical way we both liked to the identical things without single exception perhaps one had fondness in his heart ﬁrearms that i could not share the gleam in his eyes when he got out his collection every so often to clean and oil it i liked guns provide d i did not have to shoot at anything alive with them but pistols i just plain did not like at all we rarely could pass one of these without trying our luck at ﬁve cents so many clay pigeons or rabbits whirling around on whatnots but that was wild i ever wanted to get with gun we liked the same friends without exception the same books the same pictures the same music he wrote once we the two of us love each other like to things together absolutely anything need or want anybody else and the world is ours willard once told that if she had read about our life together in book she would not have believed it she did not know that any one on earth could live like that perhaps that is one reason why i want to tell about it was just so plain wonderf ul day in day out i feel too that i have complete record of our life fourteen years every day that we were not together we wrote to each other with the exception of two short that carl made where mail could be sent out only by chance returning campers somehow i ﬁnd myself thinking here of our wedding anniversaries over half the globe the joy we got out of just those ten occasions the ﬁrst one was back in oakland after our return from seattle we still had elements of convention left in us then rather i still had some i believe carl had streak of it in him ever we dressed in our very best clothes and all and had dinner at the key route inn where we had gone after the wedding year before after dinner we rushed home i nursed the son we changed into natural clothes and went to the circus i had misgivings about the circus being ﬁtting celebration but what was one to when the circus comes to town but one night in the year the second anniversary was in cambridge we always used to laugh each year and say gracious if any one had told us year ago we be here this september seventh every year we were somewhere we never dreamed we would be that ﬁrst september seventh the night of the wedding we were to be in seattle bonds what fearful prospect in retrospect compared to what we really did the second september back in oakland we thought we were to be in the bond business years in oakland more horrible thoughts i look back upon it the third september seventh the second anniversary lo and behold was in cambridge massachusetts whoever would have guessed it in all the world it was three days after carl return from that awful freibur g left nandy with neighbor and away we spreed to boston to the matinée and something good to eat then whoever would have imagined moment that the next year we would be celebrating in at the café rheingold with wine the fourth anniversary was at heidelber of the days i look back upon those magic years we left home early with our lunch which we ate on bed of dry leaves in fairy birch forest good ways the odenwald then we walked and miles all little forest hamlets stopping now and then at some small inn along the roadside cheese sandwich or glass of beer by nightfall the project gutenberg ebook of an american idyll by author https neckarsteinach and the railroad and prowled around the twisted narrow streets till gazing often at our beloved dilsber g crowning the hilltop across the river her ancient castle tower and town walls showing black against the starlight the happiness the foreign untouristed wonder of that day our ﬁfth anniversary was another etter of the days that always made feel in looking back on it that we must have been people in novel an english novel that it could not really have been carl and i who walked that perfect saturday from swanage to studland but it was our own two joyous souls who explored that quaint english corner of creation who poked about the wee old mouldy church and cemetery who had tea and mufﬁns and jam out under an old gnarled apple tree behind cottage what wonder of day it was and indeed it was my carl and i who walked the few miles home toward sunset swinging hands along the downs and fairly speechless with the glory of ﬁve years married and england and our love i should like to be thinking of that day just before i die it was so utterly perfect and so ours our sixth anniversary was another yes yet another of those times that the world seemed to have been leading up to since it ﬁrst cooled down we left our robust sons in the care of our beloved aunt elsie turner was back in berkeley one saturday we fared forth plus and riﬂe we rode to the end of the ocean shore ﬁrst got off the train at half moon bay bought half dozen eggs from female made the beach and fried said eggs supper then we got back on another train and stepped off at the end of the line in utter darkness we decided that somewhere we should ﬁnd suitable wooded nook where we could sequester ourselves the night we stumbled along until we could not see another inch in front of us the dark and the thick fog so made camp meant spreading out two in what looked like auspicious spot was ﬁndable when we opened our eyes to the morning sunlight we discovered we were on perfectly barren open ploughed piece of land and had slept so near the road that if machine passing along in the night had skidded out bit to the side it would have removed our feet that day sunday was our anniversary and the lord was with us early and late though not obtrusively we got farmer out of bed to buy some eggs our breakfast he wanted to know what we were doing out so early anyhow we told him celebr ating our sixth wedding anniversary whereat he positively refused to take cent the wedding present he said around noon we passed hunter who stopped to chat and ended by presenting us with rabbit to cook dinner and such dinner by bit of stream up in the hills that afternoon late we stumbled on deserted farmhouse almost at the laden with apples and the ground red with them pears and few peaches the picking and spring of water with one lost fat trout in it that i tried hours to catch by fair means or foul but he merely waved his tail slowly if to say one wedding present you get we slept that night on some hay left in an old of mice and gnawy things about but i could not get nearly angry at gnawy mouse at fat conceited trout who refused to be caught next day was holiday so we kept on our way rejoicing and slept that night under great redwoods beside stream where trout had better manners after ﬁsh breakfast we potted tin can full of holes with the riﬂe and then bore down circuitously and regretfully on redwood city and the southern paciﬁc railway and home and college and dishes to wash and socks to uproarious and joyful sons to compensate the seventh anniversary was less exciting but that could not be helped we were over in alamo with my father small brother and sister visiting us at the rather of course the place was theirs to begin with there was one to leave the blessed sons with also carl was working the immigration and housing commission and holidays but he managed to get home bit early we had an early supper got the sons in bed hitched up the old horse to the old cart and off we fared in the moonlight the project gutenberg ebook of an american idyll by author https years and not sorry we just poked about ending at danville with danville cream and danville pumpkin pie then walked the horse all the way back to alamo and home our eighth anniversary mentioned was in our very own home in berkeley with the curtains drawn the telephone plugged and our europe spread out before our eyes the ninth anniversary was still too soon after the arrival to get off the hill and back up our two hundred and seventeen steps home so we celebrated under our own roof time with roast chicken and dinner and with the entire family the ug who did almost nothing then but sleep i tell you if ever we had chicken the bones were not worth salvaging by the time we got through we made it last at least two meals and starving torn cat would pass by what was left with scornful snif our tenth and last anniversary was in seattle carl had to be at camp lewis all day but he got back in time to meet at in the lobby of the hotel washington from there we went to our own favorite place dinner shut away behind green lattice arbor we celebrated ten years of joy and riches and deep contentment and usual asked ourselves what in the world shall we be doing year from now where in the world shall we be and usual we answered bring the future what it may we have ten years that power in heaven or earth can rob us of there was another occasion in our lives that i want to put down in black and white though it does not come under wedding anniversaries but it was such celebration uncle max that before we left berkeley we must go off on spree with him and monte the parkers at del monte that was one spot we had never seen ourselves even riding by we got our beloved nurse balch out to stay with the young and when green pierce arrow about the size of our whole honked without we were ready bag and baggage spree such we had never imagined ourselves having in this world or the next we called the daughter of the head of the philosophy department max had said to bring friend along to make four so four we whisked the dust of berkeley from our wheels monte parents of three children who most of their own work besides not need to be told in detail what those four days meant parents of three children know what the hours of say seven to nine mean at home nor does work stop at nine it is one mad whirl to get the family ears washed and teeth

meant was absolutely jaunt the project gutenberg ebook of an american idyll by author https world it was not our world could have been happy forever did we never lay eyes on del monte yet oh it was such fun think of lazing in bed till eight or then taking leisurely bath then dressing and deliberately using up time doing one shoe on and look at it spell then when you are good and ready put on the next just feeling sort of spunky about wanting to show some one that time is nothing to the hurry what motif in music could del monte breakfast justice just yesterday you were gulping down bite in between getting the family fed and off here you were holding hands under the table to make sure you were not dreaming while you took minutes and minutes to eat fruit and mush and eggs and coffee and

pierce arrow appears and all honk off the boxes of picnic lunch stowed away by gracious waiter not piece of bread it did you have to spread yourself basking in the sun under cypress trees talking over every subject under heaven back in time swim rest before dinner then dinner why oh why has the human such biological limitations then concert then dancing glory of an unlimited soda bed oh what four days in thinking over the intimate things of our life together i have difﬁculty in decid ing what the ﬁnest features of it were there was so much that made it rich so much to make realize i was blessed beyond any one else that i am indebted to the world forever the color that living with carl parker gave to existence perhaps one of the most helpful memories to now is the thought of his absolute faith in from the time we were ﬁrst in love it meant new zest in life to know that carl ﬁrmly believed there was nothing i could not all that i hold orthodox belief in immortality i could more get away from the idea that if i fail in anything i ca of carl faith in about four days before he died he looked up at once i was arranging his pillow and said so seriously you know there is university in the country that would give you your without your taking an examination it he was delirious it is true but nevertheless it expressed though indeed in very exaggerated form the way he had of thinking i was somebody i knew there was one in the world like him but i had sound reasons that oh but it is wonderful to live with some one who thinks you are wonderful it does not make you conceited not bit but it makes happy singing feeling in your heart to feel that the one you love best in the world is proud of you and there is always the incentive of vowing that some day you will justify it all the fun of dressing party in dress from some relative knowing that the one you want most to please will honestly believe and say on the way home that you were the one at the party the fun of cooking man who thinks every dish set before him is the best food he ever not only say it but act that way that was just sample give real dish of it now that i know it the best pudding i ever tasted chapter xvi soon the article was done carl had to begin on his paper to be read before the economic association just after christmas in philadelphia that was fun working over come up here and let read you this and we go over that much of the paper together then more reading to miss van doren more correctings ﬁnally ﬁnish ing it just the day before he had to leave but that was partly because he had to leave earlier than expected the government had telegraphed him to go on to washington to mediate threatened longshoremen strike carl worked harder over the longshoremen than the project gutenberg ebook of an american idyll by author https other single labor difﬁculty not excepting the day in lumber here again i not feel free to go into details the matter was ﬁnally at carl suggestion taken to washington the longshoremen interested carl the same reason that the migratory and the interested him in fact there were many among them it was the lower stratum of the labor physical labor irregular work and on the whole undigniﬁed treatment by the men set over them and they reacted carl expected men in such position to react yet on the side of the workers he felt that in this particular instance it was case of men being led by stubborn egotistical union delegates not really representing the wishes of the rank and ﬁle of union members their main idea being to compromise on nothing on the other hand be it said that he considered the employers he had to deal with here the fairest most most anxious to compromise in the name of justice of all the groups of employers he ever had to deal with the whole affair was is best illustrated by the fact that while carl was able to hold the peace long he was on the job three days after his death the situation blew up on his way east he stopped off in spokane to talk with the lumbermen east of the mountains there at big meeting he was able to put over the day the wilson mediation commission was in seattle at the time felix frankfurter telephoned out his congratulations to and said we consider it the single greatest achievement of its kind since the united states entered the war the papers were full of it and excitement ran high president wilson was telegraphed to by the labor commission and he in turn telegraphed back his pleasure in addition the east coast lumbermen agreed to carl scheme of an employment mana ger their industry and detailed him to ﬁnd man the job while in the east my but i was excited not only that but they bade fair to let him inaugurate system which would come nearer than any chance he could have expected to try out on big scale his theories on the proper handling of labor the men were to have the sanest recreation devisable their needs and sports movies housing that would permit of digniﬁed family life recreation centres good and proper food alteration in the old order of hire and ﬁre and general control over the men most employers argued forget that the type of men we have in the lumber camps wo know how to make use of single reform you suggest and probably wo give straw the whole thing to which carl would reply forget that your old conditions have drawn the type of man you have this wo change men by long shot but it will at once relieve the and see in ﬁve years if your type itself has not under gone change from washington he wrote this city is one mad mess of men desolate and hunting folks they should see overchar ged by hotels and away from their wives the event of washington was when he was taken tea to justice brandeis we talked unemployment and he was oh so grand few days later two days before christmas brandeis telephoned and asked him christma s dinner that was great event in the parker brandeis having been hero among us some years carl wrote he is all he is supposed to be and more he in turn wrote after carl death our country shares with you the great loss your husband was among the very few americans who possessed the character knowledge and insight which are indispensable in dealing effectively with our labor appre ciation of his value was coming rapidly and events were enforcing his teachings his journey to the east brought inspiration to many and i seek comfort in the thought that among the students at the university there will be some at least who are eager to carry forward his work there were sessions with gompers meyer bloomﬁeld secretary baker secretary daniels the shipping board and many others then at philadelphia came the most telling single event of our economic paper before the economic association on motives in economic life at the risk the project gutenberg ebook of an american idyll by author https to some extent the ideas quoted from previous papers i shall record here few statements from this one it gives the last views he held on his ﬁeld of work our conventional economics analyzes phase of industrialism or the relationship or citizenship in pecuniary society in manner to offer key to such distressing and complex problems this human nature riots through our economic structure with ridicule and destruction and we economists look on helpless and aghast the menace of the war does not seem potent to quiet revolt or still class cries the anxiety and apprehension of the economist should not be produced by this cracking of his economic system but by the poverty of the criticism of industrialism which his science offers why are economists mute in the presence of most obvious crisis in our industrial society why have our criticisms of industrialism sturdy warnings about this unhappy evolution why does an agitated ofﬁcialdom search in vain among our writings scientiﬁc advice touch ing labor or industrial disloyalty prophecies and plans about the rise in our industrialism of economic classes unharmonious and hostile the fair answer seems this we economists speculate little on human motive we are not curious about the great basis of fact which dynamic and behavioristic psychology has gathered to illustrate the instinct stimulus to human activity most of us are not interested to think of what psychologically full or satisfying life is we are not curious to know that great school of behavior analysis called the freudian has been built around the analysis of the energy outbursts brought by society balking of the native human instincts our economic literature shows that we are but rarely curious to know whether industrialism is suited to man inherited nature or what man in turn will to our rules of economic conduct in case these rules are repressive the motives to economic activity which have done the major service in orthodox economic texts and teachings have been either the vague virtues of thrift justice and solvency or the equally vague moral sentiments of the welfare of others the larger self to equip one self well or lastly the labor deduction that man is stimulated in all things economic by his desire to satisfy his wants with the smallest possible effort all this gentle parody in motive theorizing continued contemporaneously with the output of the rich literature of social and behavioristic psychology which was almost entirely addressed to this very problem of human motives in modern economic society noteworthy exceptions are the remarkable series of books by veblen the articles and criticisms of mitchell and patten and the most signiﬁcant small book by taussig entitled and it is this complementary ﬁeld of psychology to which the economists must turn these writers have turned vitalization of their basic hypotheses there awaits them bewildering array of studies of the motives emotions and folkways of our pecuniary civilization generalizations and experiment statistics abound any structure of economic criticism the human motives are isolated described compared business conﬁdence the release of gy advertising appeal market vagaries the basis of value computations decay of workmanship the labor unrest decline in the thrift habit are the subjects treated all human activity is untiringly actuated by the demand realization of the instinct wants if an artiﬁcially limited ﬁeld of human endeavor be called economic life all its called motives hark directly back to the human instincts their origin there are in truth economic motives such the motives of economic life are the same those of the life of art of vanity and ostentation of war and crime of sex economic life is merely the life in which instinct gratiﬁcation is alleged to take on rational pecuniary habit form man is not less father with father parental instinct just because he passes down the street from his home to his ofﬁce his business raid into his rival market has the same naïve charm that tickled the heart of his remote ancestor when in the night he rushed the herds of clan manufacturer tries to tell conventional world that he resists the closed shop because it is it loses him money or it is inefﬁcient few years ago he was more honest when he said he would run his business he wished and would allow man to tell him what to his instinct the project gutenberg ebook of an american idyll by author https reinforced powerfully by his innate instinctive revulsion to the conﬁn ement of the closed shop gave the true stimulus his opposition is psychological not ethical he then goes on to catalogue and explain the following instincts which he considered of basic importance in any study of economics 1 gregariousness 2 parental bent motherly behavior kindliness 3 curiosity manipulation workmanship 4 acquisition collecting ownership 5 fear and ﬂight 6 mental activity thought 7 the housing or settling instinct 8 migration homing 9 hunting historic revivals of hunting urge make an interesting recital of religious inquisitions college hazings persecution of suffragettes of the of the japanese or of paciﬁsts all this goes on often under naïve rationalization about justice and patriotism but it is pure and innate lust to run something down and hurt it 10 anger pugnacity 11 revolt at conﬁnement at being limited in liberty of action and choice 12 revulsion 13 leadership and mastery 14 subordination submission 15 display vanity ostentation 166 sex after quoting from professor cannon and discussing the contributions that his studies have made to the subject of man reaction to his immediate environment he continues the conclusion seems both scientiﬁc and logical that behavior in anger fear pain and hunger is basically different behavi or from behavior under repose and economic security the emotions generated under the conditions of seem to make the emotions and motives generative in quiet and peace pale and unequal it seems impossible to avoid the conclusion that the most vital part of man inheritance is one which destines him to continue some myriads of years ever ﬁghting anim al when certain conditions exist in his environment though through education man be habituated in social and intelligent behavior or through license in sexual debauchery still at those times when his life or liberty is threatened his nature will inhibit either social thought or sex ideas and present him merely an irrationa l ﬁghting animal the instincts and their emotions coupl ed with the obedient body lay down in scientiﬁc and exact description the motives whic h must and will determine human conduct if physical environment set itself against the expression of these instinct motives the human organism is fully and efﬁciently prepared tenacious and destructive revolt against this environment and if the antagonism persist the organism is ready to destroy itself and disappear species if it fail of psychical mutation which would make the perverted order endurable and in conclusion he states the dynamic psychology of describes the present civilization repressive environment great number of its inhabitants sufﬁcient is denied there is those who care to see deep and growing unrest and pessimism with the increase in knowledge is coming new realization of the irrational direction of economic evolution the economists however view economic inequality and objects in truth outside the science our is m hiding behind phrase if we are to play part in the social readjustment immediately ahead we must put human nature and human motives into our basic hypotheses our must be the yardstick to measure just how fully things and institutions contribute to full psychological life we must know more of the meaning of progress the domination of society by one economic class has its chief evil the thwarting of the instinct life of the subordinate class and the perversion of the upper class the extent and characteristics of this evil are to be estimated only when we know the innate potentialities and inherited propensities of man and the ordering of this knowledge and its applicatio n to the changeable economic structure is the task before the trained economist little later i saw one of the big men who was at that economic association meeting and he said i see why parker is spoiled he was the most man the project gutenberg ebook of an american idyll by author https convention six publishing houses wrote after that paper to see if he could enlar ge it into book somehow it did seem if now more than ever the world was ours we looked ahead into the future and wondered if it could seem good to any one it did to us it was almost too were dazed bit by it it is one of the things i just can not let myself ever think future and the plans we had anything i can ever now would still leave life so utterly dull by comparison chapter xvii one of the days in seattle that i think of most was about month before the end the father of great friend of ours died and carl and i went to the funeral one sunday afternoon we got in late so stood in corner by the door and held hands and seemed to own each other especially hard that day afterwards we prowled around the streets talking of funerals and old age most of the people there that afternoon were family had lived in seattle years and years and these were the friends of years and years back carl said that is something we ca have when you and i old old friends who have stood by us year in and year out it is one of the phases of life you sacriﬁce when you move around at the rate we but in the ﬁrst place neither of us wants funeral and in the second place we feel that moving gives more than it takes we are satisﬁed then we talked about our own old it in detail carl declared i want you to promise faithfully you will make stop teaching when i am sixty i have seen too much of the tragedy of men hanging on and on and students and education being sacriﬁced because the teacher has lost his fallen behind in the parade i feel now if i never grow does mean that i wo so matter how strong i may be going at sixty make then we discussed our plans by that time the children would be looking out themselves much so we could plan we pleased it was to be some suburb outside of london where we could get into big things and yet where we could be peaceful and by ourselves and read and write and have the young economists who were traveling about out to spend with us and then we could keep our grandchildren while their parents were traveling in europe about month from that day he was dead there is path i must take daily to my work at college which passes through the university botanical garden every day i must brace myself it there growing along the path is clump of morning glories always from the time we ﬁrst came back to teach in berkeley and passed along that same path to the university we planned to have morning glories like odor came to meet you yards growing along the path to the little home we would at last settle down in when we were old we used always to remark pictures in the newspapers of on their golden anniversary and would plan about our own golden age together always seemed so good to think about there was time when we used to plan to live in lighthouse way out on some point when we got old it made strong appeal it really did we planned many ways of growing that we talked of it often perhaps twice year but always always it was of course together strange that neither of us ever dreamed one would grow old without the other and yet too there is the other side i found letter written during our ﬁrst summer back in berkeley just after we had said at the station when carl left the project gutenberg ebook of an american idyll by author https other things he wrote it just makes feel bad to see other folks living lives when we two four have loved through harvard and europe and it has only commenced and one is loving so hard or living so happily i am most willing to die now if you die with we have lived one complete life of joy already and then he only the adding of it could have made it come true but we have ﬁfty years yet of love oh it was so true that we packed into ten years the happiness that could normally be considered to last long lifetime sometimes it seems almost if we must have guessed it was to end so soon and lived so to crowd in all the joy we could while our time together was given us i say so often that i stand right now the richest woman in the talk of sympathy i have our three precious marvelously healthy children i have perfect health myself i have all and more than i can handle of big ambitious maturing plans with chance to see them carried out i have enoug h to live on and greatest of all ﬁfteen years of perfect yet to hear snatch of tune and know that the last time you heard it you were it was the very music they played you left the theatre that last night to put on dress you have not worn some time and remember that when you last had it on it was the night you went just the two of you to blanc dinner to meet unexpectedly some friend and recall that the last time you saw him it was that night you two strolling with hands clasped met him on second avenue accidentally and chatted on the corner to come across necktie in trunk to read book he had marked to see his perhaps just the address on an old bagg one can sound so much braver than one feels and then because you have tried so hard to live up to the pride and faith he had in you to be told you know i am surprised that you have taken carl death harder you seem to be just the same exactly what is seeming time and time again these months i have thought what any of us know about what another person feels used to think of course they stood happiness there can be many smiles much laughter and it but surely anything is kinder friend to see than tears when carl returned from the east in january he was more rushed than time more ﬁlled than ever with strike mediations arbitrations cost of living surveys the government conferences on lumber production in all he had mediat ed two strikes sat on two arbitration boards made three surveys the government mediations did gall grew intellectually impatient over this eternal patching up of what he was wont to call rotten system of course he saw the emer gency need of it just then but what he wanted to work on was why were mediations ever necessary what social and economic order would best ensure absence of friction on the campus work piled up he had promised to give course on employment management especially to train men to go into the lumber industries with new vision each big company east of the mountains was to send representative it was also open to seniors in college and splendid group it was almost every one pledged to take up employment management their vocation on fear that they would take it up with capitalist bias friends and i had to laugh it was so like afternoon of the morning he arrived he was in the thick of scrap on the campus over principle he held to abolition of the requirement students in his college to use his own expression he went to the bat on it and at faculty meeting that afternoon it carried he had been working his little campaign couple of months but in his absence in the east the other side had been busy he returned just in time the fray every one knows what farce one year of modern language is at college even several of the language teachers themselves were frank enough to admit it but it was an academic tradition i think the two words that upset carl most were efﬁciency and tradition being used too often an excuse practices that did more harm than the project gutenberg ebook of an american idyll by author https then came one tuesday the ﬁfth of march he had his hands full all morning with the continued threatened upheavals of the longshoremen about noon the teleph one rang strike in all the parker must come at once i am reminded of description which was published of carl mediator he thought of himself physician and of an industry on strike the patient and he did not merely ease the patient pain with opiates he used the knife and tried permanent cures i ﬁnally reached him by telephone his voice sounded tired he had had very hard morning by one he was working on the situation he could not get home dinner about midnight he appeared having sat almost twelve hours steadily on the new he was all in he said the next morning one of the rare instances in our years together he claimed that he did not feel like getting up but there were four important conferences that day to attend to besides his work at college he dressed ate breakfast then said he felt feverish his temperature was i made him get back into all the conferences on earth explode the next day his temperature was 105 this has taught us our more living at this pace i need two reminders that i ought to call halt thursday friday and saturday he lay there too weary to talk not able to sleep at all nights the doctor coming regularly but unable to tell just what the trouble was other than breakdown saturday afternoon he felt little better we planned then what we would when he got well the doctor had said that he should allow himself at least month before going back to college one month given to us just think of the writing i can get done being around home with my family there was an article taussig half done to appe ar in the quarterly journal of economics more technical analysis of the than had appeared in the atlantic monthly he had just begun review the american journal of economics of hoxie then he was full of ideas second article he had promised the atlantic is the united states nation and think of being able to see all i want of the since he had not slept three nights the doctor left powders which i was to give him saturday night still he could not sleep he thought that if i read aloud to him in monotonous tone of voice he could perhaps drop off i got copy of from milton to tennyson and read every poem i could the ancient mariner twice hardly pronouncing the words i droned along then he began to get delirious it is very terrifying see the ﬁrst time person in delirium and that person the one you love most on earth all night long i sat there trying to quiet was always some mediation some committee of employers he was attending he would say i am so you people come to some agreement so that i can go home and sleep at ﬁrst i would say dearest you must be quiet and try to go to sleep but i ca leave the meeting he would look at in such distress so i learned my part and at each new discussion he would get into i would suggest here will ogburn just come take charge of the meeting you you come home with and go to sleep so he would introduce will to the gathering and add gentlemen my wife wants to go home with her and go to few moments he would be quiet then my lord something to investigate what is it this time i would cut in hastily the government feels next week will be plenty of time this investigation he would look at seriously did you ever know the government to give you week time to begin then t telegrams nobody keeps their word nobody about six in the morning i could wait longer and called the doctor he pronounced it absolute ly different case from any he had ever seen sign of it the day before though it was what he had been watching all along every hospital in town was full splendid trained nurse came at once to the the best nurse in the whole city the doctor announced with the project gutenberg ebook of an american idyll by author https afternoon the crisis seemed to have passed that whole evening he was himself and was almost delirious from sheer joy to hear his dear voice again just talking naturally he noticed the nurse the ﬁrst time he was i am going to get some fun out of this now he smiled and oh wo we have time my girl while i am convalescing and we planned the rosiest weeks any one ever planned thursday the nurse shaved not only joked and talked like his dear old looked it well all along he had been told the doctor he was feeling ﬁne never complained of anything it amused the doctor so one morning when he was leaning over listening to carl heart and lungs he lay in more or less of doze and partial delirium twinkle suddenly came into carl eye you sprung new necktie on this morning did you sure enough it was new thursday morning the nurse was preparing things his bath in another room and i was with carl the sun was streaming in through the windows and my heart was too contented words he said you know what i been thinking of so much this morning i been thinking of what it must be to go through terrible illness and not have some one you loved desperately around i say to myself all the while think my girl was here all the girl will be here all the time i lain here this morning and wondered more than ever what good angel was hovering over the day i met you i put this in because it is practically the last thing he said before delirium came on again and i love to think of it he said really more than that in the morning he would start calling nurse would try to soothe him while then would call i wanted to be in his room at night but they would not let was an unborn life to be thought of those days too soon i reached his bed he would clasp my hand and hold it oh so tight i been groping you all night night why they let ﬁnd you then in moment he would not know i was there daytimes i had not left him ﬁve minutes except my meals several nights they had ﬁnally let be by him anyway saturday morning the ﬁrst time since the crisis the doctor was encouraged thin gs are really looking up and you go out few moments in the sun i walked few blocks to the mudgetts in our department to tell them the good news and then back but my heart sank to its depths again soon i entered carl room the delirium always affected that way to see the vacant stare in his look of recognition when i entered the nurse went out that afternoon he doing nicely was the last thing she said she had not been gone half an was just i was lying on her bed watching carl when he called buddie i hold my hand my dashed him i clung to him i told him he could not must not needed him too terribly we loved him too much to spare him i felt so sure of it that i said why my love is enough to keep you here he would not let leave him to call the doctor i just knelt there holding both his hands with all my might talking talking telling him we were not going to let him go and then at last the color came back into his face he nodded his head bit and said i stay very quietly then i was able to rush the stairs and tell willard to telephone the doctor three doctors we had that afternoon they reported the case dangerous but not absolutely hopeless his heart which had been so wonderful all along had given out that very morning the doctor had said i wish my pulse was strong that and there he pulse at all they did everything our own doctor stayed till about ten then left with carl resting fairly easily he lived only block away about the nurse had call the doctor again i could see things were going wrong once carl started to talk rather loud i tried to quiet him and he said twice i pulled and fought and struggled to live just you one of the times had been during the crisis let just talk if i want to i ca make the ﬁght third so tired the project gutenberg ebook of an american idyll by author https the doctor could get there he was dead with our beliefs what they were there was only one thing to be done we had never discussed it in detail but i felt absolute ly sure i was doing he would have his body was cremated without any servi ce present but one of his brothers and great friend the next day the two men scattered his ashes out on the waters of puget sound i feel it was he would have had it out of your welded in spirit and in the comradeship that you had in his splendid
