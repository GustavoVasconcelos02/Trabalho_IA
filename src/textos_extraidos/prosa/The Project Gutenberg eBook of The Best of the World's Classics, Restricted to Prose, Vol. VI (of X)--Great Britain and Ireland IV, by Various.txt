residence at oriel tho proud of my college i was not quite at home there i was very much alone and i used often to take my daily walk by myself i recollect once meeting copleston then provost with one of the fellows he turned round and with the kind courteousness which sat so well on him made bow and said nunquam minus solus quam cum solus at that time indeed from 1823 i had the intimacy of my dear and true friend pusey and could not fail to admire and revere soul so devoted to the cause of religion so full of good works so faithful in his affections but he left residence when i was getting to know him well to whately 2 himself he was too much my superior to allow of my being at my ease with him and to one in oxford at this time did i open my heart fully and familiarly but things changed in at that time i became one of the tutors of my college and this gave position besides i had written one or two essays which had been well received i began to be known i preached my ﬁrst university sermon next year i was one of the public examiners the degree in 1828 i became vicar of mary it was to like the feeling of spring weather after winter and if i may so speak i came out of my shell i remained out of it until the two persons who knew best at that time are still alive beneﬁced clergymen longer my friends they could tell better than any one else what i was in those days from this time my tongue was it were loosened and i spoke spontaneously and without effort one of the two shrew d man said of i have been told here is fellow who when he is silent will never begin to speak and when he once begins to speak will never stop it was at this time that i began to have inﬂuence which steadily increased course of years i gained upon my pupils and was in particular intimate and affectionate with two of our probationer fellows robert isaac wilberforce afterward archdeacon and richard hurrell froude 3 whately then an acute man perhaps saw around the signs of an incipient party of which i was not conscious myself and thus we discern the ﬁrst elements of that movement afterward called tractarian the true and primary author of it however is usual with great motive powers was out of sight having carried off mere boy the highest honors of the university he had turned from the admiration which haunted his steps and sought better and holier satisfaction in pastoral work in the country need i say that i am speaking of john keble 4 the ﬁrst time that i was in room with him was on the occasion of my election to fellowship at oriel when i was sent into the tower to shake hands with the provost and fellows how is that hour ﬁxt in my memory after the changes of years this very day on which i write i have lately had letter in my hands which i sent at the time to my great friend john william bowden with whom i passed almost exclusively my under graduate years i had to hasten to the tower i say to him to receive the congratulations of all the fellows i bore it till keble took my hand and then felt so abashed and unworthy of the honor done to that i seemed desirous of quite sinking into the ground his had been the ﬁrst name which i had heard spoken of with reverence rather than admiration when i came up to oxford when one day i was walking in high street with my dear earliest friend just mentioned with what eagerness did he cry out there keble and with what awe 4 5 6 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics restricted to prose vol vi of x great britain and ireland iv by various https i look at him then at another time i heard master of arts of my college give an account how he had just then had occasion to introduce himself on some business to keble and how gentle courteous and unaffected keble had been so almost to put him out of countenance then too it was reported truly or falsely how rising man of brilliant reputation the present dean of paul milman admired and loved him adding that somehow he was strangely unlike any one else however at the time when i was elected fellow of oriel he was not in residence and he was shy of years in consequence of the marks which i bore upon of the evangelical and libera l schools at least so i have ever thought hurrell froude brought us together about 1828 it is one of the sayings preserved in his remains you know the story of the murderer who had done one good thing in his life well if i was ever asked what good thing i had ever done i should say i had brought keble and newman to understand each other footnotes from the apologia pro vita richard whately bampton

newman in writing the lyra apostolica his health had long been delicate when in 1836 he died his remains were published in the following year with preface by newman three of the tracts the times were

the times were by him he was newman senior by eight years ii on his submission to the ca tholic church 5 i had one ﬁnal advance of mind to accomplish and one ﬁnal step to take that further advance of mind was to be able honestly to say that i was certain of the conclusions at which i had already arrived that further step imperative when such certitude was attained was my submission to the catholic church this submission did not take place till two full years after the resignation of my living in september 1843 nor could i have made it at an earlier date without doubt and apprehension that is with any true conviction of mind or certitude in the interval of which it remains to between the autumns of 1843 and was in lay communion with the church of england attending its services usual and abstaining altogether from intercourse with catholics from their places of worship and from those religious rites and usages such the invocation of saints which are characteristics of their creed i did all this on principle i never could understand how man could be of two religions at once 1 2 3 4 7 8 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics restricted to prose vol vi of x

mind to my friends and others and how i managed to reveal it up to january 1842 i had not disclosed my state of unsettlement to more than three persons to two of them intimate and familiar companions in the autumn of 1839 to the old friend too whom i have also named suppose when i was in great distress of mind upon the affair of the jerusalem bishopric in may 1843 i made it known has been seen to the friend by whose advice i wished far possible to be guided to mention it on set purpose to any one unless indeed i was asking advice i should have felt to be crime if there is anything that was abhorrent to it was the scattering doubts and unsettling consciences without necessity strong presentiment that my existing opinions would ultimately give way and that the grounds of them were unsound was not sufﬁcient warrant disclosing the state of my mind i had guarantee yet that that presentiment would be realized supposing i were crossing ice which came right in my way which i had good reasons considering sound and which i saw numbers before crossing in safety and supposing stranger from the bank in voice of authority and in an earnest tone warned that it was dangerous and then was think i should be startled and should look about anxiously but i think too that i should go on till i had better grounds doubt and such was my state i believe till the end of then again when my dissatisfaction became greater it was hard at ﬁrst to determine the point of time when it was too strong to suppress with propriety certitude of course is point but doubt is progress i was not near certitude yet certitude is reﬂex action it is to know that one knows of that i believe i was not possest till close upon my reception into the catholic church again practical effective doubt is point too but who can easily ascertain it himself who can determine when it is that the scales in the balance of opinion begin to turn and what was greater probability in behalf of belief becomes positive doubt against it in considering this question in its bearing upon my conduct in 1843 my own simple answer to my great difﬁculty had been what your present state of opinion requires in the light of duty and let that doing tell speak by acts this i had done my ﬁrst act of the year had been in february after three months deliberation i had published my retractation of the violent charges which i had made against rome i could not be wrong in doing so much this but i did more at the time i did not retract my anglican teaching my second act had been in september in the same year after much sorrowful lingering and hesitation i had resigned my living i tried indeed before i did so to keep littlemore myself even tho it was still to remain an integral part of mary 6 i had given to it church and sort of parsonage i had made it parish and i loved it i thought in 1843 that perhaps i need not forfeit my existing relations toward it i could indeed submit to become curate at will of another but i hoped an arrange ment was possible by which while i had the curac y i might have been my own master in serving it i had hoped an exception might have been made in my favor under the circumstances but i did not gain my request perhaps i was asking what was impracticable and it is well that it was so these had been my two acts of the year and i said i can not be wrong in making them let that follow which must follow in the thoughts of the world about when they see what i and time went on they fully answered my purpose what i felt it simple duty to did create general suspicion about without such responsibility would be involved in my initiating any direct act the sake of creating it then when friends wrote on the subject i either did not deny or i confest my state of mind according to the character and need of their letters sometimes in the case of intimate friends whom i should otherwise have been leaving in ignorance of what others knew on every side of them i invited the question and here comes in another point explanation while i was ﬁghting in oxford the anglican church then indeed i was very glad to make converts and tho i never broke away from that rule of my mind i may call it of which i have already spoken of 9 10 11 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics restricted to prose vol vi of x great britain and ireland iv by various https disciples rather than seeking them yet that i made advances to others in special way i have doubt this came to an end however soon i fell into misgivings to the true ground to be taken in the controversy then when i gave up my place in the movement i ceased from any such proceedings and my utmost endeavo r was to tranquillize such persons especially those who belonged to the new school were unsettled in their religious views and i judged hasty in their conclusions this went on till 1843 but at that date soon i turned my face romeward i gave up far ever was possible the thought of in any respect and in any shape acting upon others then i myself was simply my own concern how could i in any sense direct others who had to be guided in so momentous matter myself how could i be considered in position even to say word to them one way or the other how could i presume to unsettle them i was unsettled when i had means of bringing them out of such unsettlement and if they were unsettle d already how could i point to them place of refuge when i was not sure that i should choose it myself my only line my only duty was to keep simply to my own case i recollected pascal words je mourrai seul i will die alone i deliberately put out of my thoughts all other works and claims and said nothing to any one unless i was obliged but this brought upon great troubl in the newspapers there were continual reports about my intentions i did not answer them presently strangers or friends wrote begging to be allowed to answer them and if i still kept to my resolution and said nothing then i was thought to be mysterious and prejudice was excited against but what was far worse there were number of tender eager hearts of whom i knew nothing at all who were watching wishing to think i thought and to i did if they could but ﬁnd it out who in consequence were distrest that in so solemn matter they could not see what was coming and who heard reports about this way or that on ﬁrst day and on second and felt the weariness of waiting and the sickness of delayed hope and did not understand that i was perplexed they were and being of more sensitive complexion of mind than myself they were made ill by the suspense and they too of course the time thought mysterious and inexp licable i ask their pardon far i was really unkind to them i left oxford good on monday february 23d on the saturday and sunday before i was in my house at littlemore simply by myself i had been the ﬁrst day or two when i had originally taken possession of it i slept on sunday night at my dear friend johnson at the observatory various friends came to see the last of copeland church buckle pattison and lewis pusey too came up to take leave of and i called on ogle one of my very oldest friends he was my private tutor when i was an under graduate in him i took leave of my ﬁrst college trinity which was so dear to and which held on its foundation so many who had been kind to

this hope resigning his living and in 1845 formally entered the catholic church he says in the apologia that from the end of 1841 i was on my regards my membership with the anglican church tho at the

constant bodily suffering but the hardships of military service had imparted swarthy tinge to complexion naturally fair and his eyebrows meeting over sharp and aquiline nose gave serious and stern expression to his countenance his hair was light and his eyes blue and piercing he was well pleased if any one on approac hing him looked on the ground and affected to be unable to meet their dazzling brightness it was said that his dress concealed many imperfections and blemishes on his person but he could not disguise all the inﬁrmities under which he labored the weakness of the foreﬁnger of his right hand and lameness in the left hip were the results of wounds he incurred in battle with the iapydæ in early life he suffered repeated attacks of fever of the most serious kind especially in the course of the campaign of philippi and that against the cantabrians and again two years afterward at rome when his recovery was despaired of from that time altho constantly liable to be affected by

ﬁrst to preserve his own life and afterward to obtain the splendid prizes which had hitherto been carried off by daring adventure and the good fortune which is so often its attendant his contest

wily of his contemporaries such cicero and cleopatra he succeeded in the end in deluding the senate and people of rome in the establishment of his tyranny and ﬁnally deceived the expectations of the world and falsiﬁed the lessons of the republican history in reigning himself forty years in disguise and leaving throne to be claimed without challenge by his successors fourteen centuries but altho

by other dress than the robes and insignia of the ofﬁces which he exercised he was attended by other guards than those which his consular dignity rendered customary and decent in his court there was none of the etiquette of modern monarchies to be recognized and it was only by slow and gradual encroachment that it came to prevail in that of his successors augustus was contented to take up his

ediﬁc built by him the same relation which the ﬂuctuating variations of organic beings bear to the varied and admirable structures ultimately acquired by their modiﬁed descendants some authors have declared that natural selection explains nothing unless the precise cause of each slight individual difference be made clear if it were explained to savage utterly ignorant of the art of building how the ediﬁce had been raised stone upon stone and why fragments were used the arches ﬂat stones the roof etc and if the use of each part and of the whole building were pointed out it would be

selection explain s nothing because we know not the cause of each individual dif ference in the structure of each being the shape of the fragments of stone at the base of our precipice may be called accidental but this is not strictly correct the shape of each depends on long sequence of events all obeying natural laws on the nature of the rock on the lines of deposition or cleavage on the form

fragments of rock should assume certain shapes so that the builder might erect his ediﬁc if the various laws which have determ ined the shape of each fragment were not predetermined the builder sake can it be maintained with any greater probability that he specially ordained the sake of the breeder each of the innumerable variations in our domestic animals and plants many of these variations being of service to man and not beneﬁcial far more often injurious to the creatures themselves did he ordain that the crop and of the pigeon should vary in order that the fancier might make his grotesque pouter and fantail breeds did he cause the frame and mental qualities of the dog to vary in order that breed might be formed of indomitable ferocity with jaws ﬁtted to pin down the bull man

formation of the most perfectly adapted animals in the world man includ ed were intentionally and specially guided however much we may wish it we can hardly follow professor asa gray in his belief that variation has been led along certain beneﬁ cial lines of irrigation if we assume that each particular variation was from the beginning of all time preordained then that plasticity of organization which leads to many injurious deviations of structure well the redundant power of reproduction which inevitably leads to struggle existence and consequence to the natural selection or survival of the

geology and by collecting all facts which bore in any way on the variation of animals and plants under domestication and nature some light might perhaps be thrown on the whole subject my ﬁrst notebook was open ed in july i worked on true baconian principles and without any theory colle cted facts on wholesale scale more especially with respect to domesticated productions by printed inquiries by conversation with skilful breeders and gardeners and by extensive reading when i set the list of books of all kinds which i read and abstracted including whole series of journals and transactions i am surprized at my industry i soon perceived that selection was the keystone of man success in making useful races of animals and plants but how selection could be applied to organisms living in state of nature remained some time mystery to in october is ﬁfteen months after i had begun my systematic happened to read amusement malthus on population and being well prepared to appreciate the struggle existence which everywhere goes on from observation of the habits of animals and plants it at once struck that under these circumstances favorable variations would tend to be preserved and unfavorabl ones to be destroyed the result of this would be the formation of new species here then i had at last got theory by which to work but i was so anxious to avoid prejud ice that i determined not some time to write even the briefest sketch of it in june 1842 i ﬁrst allowed myself the satisfaction of writing very brief abstract of my theory in pencil in pages and this was enlar ged during the summer of 1844 into one of two hundred and thirty pages which i had fairly copied out and still possess but at that time i overlooked one problem of great importance and it is aston ishing to except on the principle of columbus and his egg how i could have overlooked it and 17 51 52 53 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics restricted to prose vol vi of x great britain and ireland

the manner in which species of all kinds can be classed under genera genera under families families under suborders and so forth and i can remember the very spot in the road while in my carriage when to my joy the solution occurred to and this was long after i had come to down the solution i believe is that the modiﬁed offspring of all dominant and increasing forms tend to become adapted to many and highly diversiﬁed places in the economy of nature early in 1856 lyell advised to write out my views pretty fully and i began at once to so on scale three or four times extensive that which was afterward followed in my origin of species yet it was only an abstract of the materials which i had collected and i got through about half the work on this scale but my plans were overthrown early in the summer of 1858 wallace who was then in the malay archipelago sent an essay on the tendency of varieties to depart indeﬁnitely from the original type and this essay contained exactly the same theory mine wallace exprest the wish that if i thought well of his essay i should send it to l yell perusal the circumstances under which i consented at the request of lyell and hooker to allow of an abstract from my together with letter to asa gray dated septem ber 5th 1857 to be published at the same time with wallace essay are given in the journal of the proceedings of the linnean society 1858 page i was at ﬁrst very unwilling to consent i thought wallace might consider my doing so unjustiﬁable i did not then know how generous and noble was his disposition the extract from my and the letter to asa gray had neither been inten ded publication and were badly written wallace essay on the other hand was admirably exprest and quite clear nevertheless our joint productions excited very little attention and the only published notice of them which i can remember was by professor haughton of dublin whose verdict was that all that was new in them was false and what was true was old this shows how necessary it is that any new view should be explained at considerable length in order to arouse public attention my habits are methodical and this has been of not little use my particul ar line of work lastly i have had ample leisure from not having to earn my own bread even ill health tho it has annihilated several years of my life has saved from the distractions of society and amusement therefore my success man of scienc whatever this may have amounted to has been determined far i can judge by complex and diversiﬁed mental qualities and conditions of these the most important have been the love of science unbounded patience in long reﬂecting over any subject industry in observing and collect ing facts and fair share of invention well of common sense with such moderate abilities

furnished and very neatly arranged there were shelves and stands of books english french and italian and in portfolio on the there were sheets upon sheets of memoranda and calculations in ﬁgures

elegantly framed hanging in the corner by the easy chair oh indeed sir said bella after stopping to ruminate before it oh indeed sir i fancy i can guess whom you think that like but i tell you what it much more impudence having said which she decamped not solely because she was offended but because there was nothing else to look at now ma said bella reappearing in the kitchen with some remains of

merrily searching in dresser i mean to apron it and towel it all over the front and to permission i mean to without you cook said wilfer you who never cooked when you were at home yes ma returned bella that is precisely the state of the case she girded herself with white apron and busily with knots and pins contrived bib to it coming close and tight under her chin if it had caught her round the neck to kiss her over this bib her dimples looked delightful and under it her pretty ﬁgure not less so now ma said bella pushing back her hair from her temples with both hands what ﬁrst first

ﬂour them and twirl them around and there they go sending them spinning at great rate what next ma next said wilfer with wave of her gloves expressive of abdication under protest from the culinary

gave her attention to one thing and forgot the other and gave her attention to the other and forgot the third and remembering the third was distracted by the fourth and made amends whenever she went wrong by giving the unfortunate fowls an extra spin which made their chance of ever getting cooked exceedingly doubtful but it was pleasant cookery too meanwhile miss lavinia oscillating between the kitchen and the opposite room prepared the in the latter chamber this ofﬁce she always doing her household spiriting with unwillingness performed in startling series of whisks and bumps laying the if

something wooden sitting there bolt upright in the corner only suppose returned bella that poor pa was to sit bolt upright in another corner my dear he could it said lavvy pa would loll directly but indeed i not believe there ever was any human creature who could keep so bolt upright ma or put such an amount of aggravation into one back what the matter ma ai you well ma doubtless i am very well

became an unresisting prey to that inscrutable toothache i am surprized said mr sampson feebly that miss bella condescends to cook here miss lavinia descended on the young gentleman with crushing

then sat down bibless and apronless to partake of it an illustrious guest wilfer ﬁrst responding to her husband cheerful what we are about to with sepulchr al amen calculated to cast damp upon the stoutest appetite but what said bella she watched the carving of the fowls makes them pink inside i wonder pa is it the breed i think it the breed my dear returned i rather think it is because they are not done they ought to be said bella yes i aware they ought to be my dear rejoined her father but so the gridiron was put in requisition and the cherub who was often uncherubically employed in his own family if he had been in the employmen t of some of the old masters undertook to grill the fowls indeed except in respect of staring about him branch of the public service to which the pictorial cherub is much addicted this domestic cherub dischar ged many odd functions his prototype with the difference say that he performed with on the family boots instead of performing on enormous wind instruments and and that he conducted himself with cheerful alacrity to much useful purpose instead of foreshortening himself in the air with the vaguest intentions bella helped him with his supplemental cookery and made him very happy but put him in mortal terror too by asking him when they sat down at table again how he supposed they cooked fowls at the greenwich dinner and whether he believed they really were such pleasant dinners people said his secret winks and nods of remonstrance in reply made the mischievous bella laugh until she choked and then lavinia was obliged to slap her on the back and then she laughed the more but her mother was ﬁne corrective at the other end of the table to whom her father in the innocence of his good fellowship at intervals appealed with my dear i am afraid you are not enjoying yourself why so r she would sonorously reply because my dear you seem little out of sorts not at all would be the rejoinder in exactly the same tone would you take my dear thank you i will take whatever you please well but my dear you like it i like it well i like anything the stately woman would then with meritorious appearance of devoting herself to the

own table both our healths drinking the toast with tremendous stif fness i really am little afraid my dear hinted the cherub meekly that you are not enjoying yourself on the contrary returned wilfer quite so why should i not i thought my dear that perhaps your face my face might be martyrdom but what would that import or who should know it if i smiled and she did smile manifestly freezing the blood of geor ge sampson by so doing that young gentleman catching her smiling eye was so very much appalled by its expression to cast in his thoughts concerning what he had done to bring it down upon himself the mind naturally falls said wilfer shall i say into reverie or shall i say into retrospect on day like this lavvy sitting with deﬁantly folded arms replied but not audibly goodness sake say whichever of the two you like best ma and get it over the mind pursued wilfer in an oratorical manner naturally reverts to papa and here allude to my period before the earliest dawn of this day i was considered tall perhaps i was papa and mama were unquestionably tall i have rarely seen ﬁner woman than my mother never than my father the irrepressible lavvy remarked aloud whatever grandpapa was he was female your grandpapa retorted wilfer with an awful look and in an awful tone was what i describe him to have been and would have struck any of his grandchildren to the earth who presumed to question it it was one of mama cherished hopes that i should become united to tall member of socie ty it may have been weakness but if so it was equally the weakness i believe of king frederick of prussia these remarks being offered to geor ge sampson who had not the courage to come out singl combat but lurked with his chest under the table and his eyes cast down wilfer proceeded in voice of increasing sternness and impressiveness until she should force that skulker to give himself up mama would appear to have had an indeﬁnable foreboding of what afterward happened she would frequently urge upon little man promise my child not little man never never never marry little man papa also would remark to he possest extraordinary humor family of whales must not ally themselves with sprats his company was eagerly sought may be supposed by the wits of the day and our house was their continual resort i have known many three copper engravers exchanging the most exquisite sallies and retorts there at one time here sampson delivered himself captive and said with an uneasy movement on his chair that three was large number and it must have been highly entertaining among the most prominent members of that distinguished circle was gentleman measuring six feet four in height he was not an engraver here sampson said with reason whatever of course not this gentleman was so obliging to honor with attentions which i could not fail to understand here sampson murmured that when it came to that you could 115 116 117 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world

suit they inquired was he too tall i replied it was not the stature but the intellect was too lofty at our house i said the tone was too brilliant the pressure was too high to be maintained by mere woman in domestic life i well remember mama clasping her hands and exclaiming will end in little man here sampson glanced at his host and shook his head with despondency she afterward went so far to predict that it would end in little man whose mind would be below the average but that was in what i may deno minate paroxysm of maternal disappointment within month said wilfer deepening her voice if she were relating terrible ghost story within month i ﬁrst saw my husband within year i married him it is natural the mind to recall these dark coincidences on the present day sampson at length released from the custody of wilfer eye now drew long breath and made the original and striking remark that there was accounting these sort of presentiments scratched his head and looked apologetically all round the table until he came to his wife when observing her it were shrouded in more somber veil than before he once more hinted my dear i am really afraid you are not altogether enjoying yourself to which she once more replied on the contrary quite so the wretched sampson position at this agreeable entertainment was truly pitiable not only was he exposed defenseless to the harangues of wilfer but he received the utmost contumely at the hands of lavinia who partly to show bella that she lavinia could what she liked with him and partly to pay him off still obviously

moral foundations that in the long run it is well with the good in the long run it is ill with the wicked but this is science it is more than the old doctrine taught by the hebre w prophets the theories of comte and his disciples advance us after all not step beyond the trodden and familiar ground if men are not entirely animals they are at least half animals and are subject in this aspect of them to the conditions of animals so far those parts of man doings are concerned which neither have nor need have anything moral about them so far the laws of him are calculable there are laws his digestion and laws of the means by which his digestive organs are supplied with matter but pass beyond them and where are we in world where it would be easy to calculate men actions by laws like those of positive philosophy to measure the orbit of neptune with foot rule or weigh sirius in grocer scale and it is not difﬁcult to see why this should be the ﬁrst principle on which the theory of science of history can be plausibly argued is that all actions whatsoever arise from interest it may be enlightened est it may be unenlightened but it is assumed an axiom that every man in whatever he does is aiming at something which he considers will promote his happiness his conduct is not determined by his will it is deter mined by the object of his desire adam smith in laying the foundations of political economy expressly eliminates every other motive he does not say that men never act on other motives still less that they never ought to act on other motives he asserts merely that far the arts of production are concerned and of buying and selling the action of interest may be counted upon uniform what adam smith says of political economy buckle 33 would extend over the whole circle of human activity now that which especially distinguishes high order of man from low order of that which constitutes human goodness human greatness human surely not the degree of enlightenment with which men pursue their own advantage but it is getfulness it is it is the disregard of personal pleasure personal indulgence personal advantages remote or present because some other line of conduct is more

on the contrary to be difference in the very heart and nature of things the martyr goes to the stake the patriot to the scaffold not with view to any future reward to themselves but because it is

still selﬁshness only more enlightened i not think so the essenc of true nobility is neglect of self let the thought of self pass in and the beauty of great action is gone like the bloom from soiled

rema ins in vague and disputable rred with brightness and shade like the edge of her own ocean where the surf and the are mingled with the sky venice is usually conceived an oligarchy she was so during period less than the half of her existence and that including the days of her decline and it is one of the ﬁrst questions needing severe examination whether that decline was owing in anywise to the change in the form of her government or altogether assuredly in great part to changes in the character of the persons of whom it was composed the state of venice existed thirteen hundred and years from the ﬁrst establishment of consular government on the island of the rialto to the mom ent when the of the french army of italy 38 pronounced the venetian republic thing of the past of this period two hundred and years were passed in nominal subjection to the cities of old venetia especially to padua and in an agitated form of democracy of which the executive appears to have been entrusted to tribunes chosen one by the inhabitants of each of the principal islands six hundred years during which the power of venice was continually on the increase her government was an elective monarchy her king or doge possessing in early times at least much independent authority any other european sovereign but an authority gradually subjected to limitation and shortened almost daily of its prerogatives while it increased in spectral and incapable magniﬁcence the ﬁnal government of the nobles under the image of king lasted ﬁve hundred years during which venice reaped the fruits of her former ener gies consumed expired let the reader therefore conceive the existence of the venetian state broadly divided into two periods the ﬁrst of nine hundred the second of ﬁve hundred years the separation being marked by what was called the serrar del consiglio that is to say the 141 142 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics restricted to prose vol vi of x great britain and ireland iv by various https and absolute distinction of the nobles from the commonalty and the establishment of the government in their hands to the exclusion alike of the inﬂuence of the people on the one side and the authority of the doge on the other then the ﬁrst period of nine hundred years presents us with the most interesting spectacle of people struggling out of anarchy into order and power and then governed the most part by the worthiest and noblest man whom they could ﬁnd among them called their doge or leader with an aristocracy gradually and resolutely forming itself around him out of which and at last by which he was chosen an aristocracy owing its origin to the accidental numbers inﬂuen ce and wealth of some among the families of the fugitives from the older venetia and gradually organizing itself by its unity and heroism into separate body this ﬁrst period includes the rise of venice her noblest achievements and the circumstances which determined her character and position among european powers and within its range might have been anticipated we ﬁnd the names of all her hero princes pietro urseolo ordalafo falier domenico michieli sebastiano ziani

prosperity of venice in the close of the ﬁfteenth century blinding her historians to the previou s evidence of the diminution of her internal strength throughout her career the victories of venice and at many periods of it her safety were purchased by individual heroism and the man who exalted or saved her was sometimes oftenest her king sometimes noble sometimes citizen to him matter nor to her the real question is not so much what names they bore or with what powers they were entrusted how they were trained how they were made masters of themselves servants of their country patient of distress impatient of dishonor and what was the true reason of the change from the time when she could ﬁnd saviors among those whom she had cast into prison to that when the voices of her own children commanded her to sign covenant with death the most curious phenomenon in all venetian history is the vitality of religion in private life and its deadness in public policy amidst the enthusiasm chivalry or fanaticism of the other states of europe venice stands from ﬁrst to last like masked statue her coldness impenetrable her exertion only aroused by the touch of secret spring that spring was her commercial the one motive of all her important political acts or enduring national animosities she could forgive insults to her honor but never rivalship in her commerce she calculated the glory of her conquests by their value and estimated their justice by their facility the fame of success remains when the motives of attempts are forgotten and the casual reader of her history may perhaps be surprized to 143 144 145 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics restricted to prose vol vi of x great britain and ireland iv by various https reminded that the expedition which was commanded by the noblest of her princes and whose results added most to her military glory was one in which while all europe around her was wasted by the ﬁre of its devotion she ﬁrst calculated the highest price she could exact from its piety the armam ent she furnished and then the advancement of her own private interests at once broke her faith and betrayed her religion there are therefore two strange and solemn lights in which we have to regard almost every scene in the ﬁtful history of the rivo alto we ﬁnd on the one hand deep and constant tone of individual religion characterizing the lives of the citizens of venice in her greatness we ﬁnd this spirit inﬂuencing them in all the familiar and immediate concerns of life giving peculiar dignity to the conduct even of their commercial transactions and confest by them with simplicity of faith that may well put to shame the hesitation with which man of the world at present admits even if it be so in reality that religious feeling has any inﬂuence over the minor branches of his conduct and we ﬁnd the natural consequence of all this healthy serenity of mind and energy of will exprest in all their actions and habit of heroism which never fails them even when the immediate motive of action ceases to be praiseworthy with the fulness of this spirit the prosperity of the state is exactly correspondent and with its failure her decline i have said that the two orders doric and corinthian are the roots of all european architecture you have perhaps heard of ﬁve orders but there are only two real orders and there never can be any more until doomsday on one of these orders the ornament is convex those are doric norman and what else you recollect of the kind on the other the ornament is concave those are corinthian early english decorated and what else you recollect of that kind the transitional form in which the ornamental line is straight is the center or root of both all other orders are varieties of these or fantasms and grotesques altogether indeﬁnite in number and species this greek architecture then with its two orders was clumsily copied and varied by the romans with particular result until they began to bring the arch into extensive practical service except only that the doric capital was spoiled in endeavors to mend it and the corinthian much varied and enriched with fanciful and often very beautiful imagery and in this state of things came christianity seized upon the arch her own decorated it and delighted in it invented new doric capital to replace the spoiled roman one and all over the roman empire set to work with such materials were nearest at hand to express and adorn herself best she could this roman christian architecture is the exact expression of the christianity of the time very fervid and very imperfect in many respects ignorant and yet radiant with strong childlike light of imagination which ﬂames up under constantine illumine

embalmed repose it with the religion it exprest and so would have remained does remain where its languor has been undisturbed but rough wakening was ordained it the christian art of the declining empire is divided into two great branches western and eastern one centered at rome the other at byzantium of which the one is the early christian romanesque properly so called and the other carried to higher imaginative perfection by greek workmen is distinguished from it byzantine but i wish the reader the present to class these two branches of art together in his mind they being in points of main importance the same that is to say both of them true continuance and sequence of the art of old rome itself ﬂowing uninterruptedly down from the and entrusted always to the best workmen who could be in italy and greeks in greece and thus both branches may be ranged under the general term of christian romanesque an architecture which had lost the reﬁnement of pagan art in the degradation of the empire but which was elevated by christianity to higher aims and by the fancy of the greek workmen endowed with brighter forms and this art the reader may conceive extending in its various branches over all the central provinces of the empire taking aspects more or less reﬁned according to its proximity to the seats of 146 147 148 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics

constantinople and in the districts under their immediate inﬂuence this roman art of pure descent was practised in all its reﬁnement an impure form of patois of carried by inferior workmen into distant provinces and still ruder imitations of this patois were executed by the barbarous nations on the skirts of the empire but these barbarous nations were in the strength of their youth and while in the center of europe reﬁned and purely descended art was sinking into graceful formalism on its conﬁnes barbarous and borrowed art was organizing itself into strength and consistency the reader must therefore consider the history of the work of the period broadly divided into two great heads the one embracing the elaborately languid succession of the christian art of rome and the other the imitations of it execute d by nations in every conceivable phase of early organization on the edges of the empire or included in its now merely nominal extent some of the barbaric nations were of

empire was laid asleep in glittering sepulcher the living light rose upon both horizons and the ﬁerce swords of the lombard and arab were shaken over its golden paralysis the work of the lombard was to give hardihood and system to the enervated body and enfeebled mind of christendom that of the arab was to punish idolatry and to proclaim the spirituality of worship the lombar d covered every

the mossy rocks its roar dies away the dew gushing from their thick branches through drooping clusters of emerald herbage and sparkling in white threads along the dark rocks of the shore feeding the lichens which chase and checker them with purple and silver when water not in very great body runs in rocky bed much interrupted by hollows so that it can rest every now and then in pool it goes along it does not acquire continuous velocity of motion it pause s after every leap and curdles about and rests 160 161 162 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics restricted to prose vol vi of x great britain and ireland iv by various https and then goes on again and if in this comparatively tranquil and rational state of mind it meets with any obstacle rock or stone it parts on each side of it with little bubbling foam and goes round if it comes to step in its bed it leaps it lightly and then after little splashing at the bottom stops again to take breath but if its bed be on continuous slope not much interrupted by hollows so that it can not rest or if its own mass be so increased by ﬂood that its usual are not sufﬁcient it but that it is perpetually pushed out of them by the following current before it has had time to tranquilize itself it of course gains velocity with every yard that it runs the impetus got at one leap is carried to the credit of the next until the whole stream becomes one mass of unchecked accelerating motion now when water in this state comes to an obstacle it does not part at it but clears it like and when it comes to hollow it does not ﬁll it up and run out leisurely at the other side but it rushes down into it and comes up again on the other side ship into the hollow of the sea hence the whole appearance of the bed of the stream is changed and all the lines of the water altered in their nature the quiet stream is succession of leaps and pools the leaps are light and springy and parabolic and make great deal of splashing when they tumble into the pool then we have space of quiet curdling water and another similar leap below but the stream when it has gained an impetus takes the shape of its bed never stops is equally deep and equally swift everywhere goes down into every hollow not with leap but with swing not foaming nor splashing but in the bending line of strong wave and comes up again on the other side over rock and ridge with the ease of bounding leopard if it meet rock three or four feet above the level of its bed it will neither part nor foam nor express any concern about the matter but clear it in smooth dome of water without apparent exertio n coming down again smoothly on the other side the whole surface of the surge being drawn into parallel lines by its extreme velocity but foamless except in places where the form of the bed opposes itself at some direct angle to such line of fall and causes breaker so that the whole river has the appearance of deep and raging sea with this only difference that the always break backward and forward few people comparatively have ever seen the effect on the sea of powe rful gale continued without intermission three or four days and nights and to those who have not i believe it must be unimaginable not from the mere force or size of surge but from the complete annihilation of the limit between sea and air the water from its prolonged agitation is beaten not into mere creaming foam but into masses of accumulated yeast which hang in ropes and wreaths from wave to wave and where one curls over to break form festoon like drapery from its edge these are taken up by the wind not in dissipating dust but bodily in writhing hanging coiling masses which make the air white and thick with snow only the ﬂakes are foot or two long each the surges themselves are full of foam in their very bodies underneath making them white all through the water is under great cataract and their masses being thus half water and half air are torn to pieces by the wind whenever they rise and carried away in roaring smoke which chokes and strangles like actual water add to this that when the air has been exhausted of its moisture by long rain the spray of the sea is caught by it described above and covers its surfac not merely with the smoke of ﬁnely divided water but with boiling mist imagine also the low brought down to the very level of the sea i have often seen them whirling and ﬂying in rags and fragments from wave to wave and ﬁnally conceive the surges themselves in their utmost pitch of power velocity vastness and madness lifting themselves in precipices and peaks furrowed with their whirl of ascent through all this chaos and you will understand that there is indeed distinction left between the sea and air that object nor horizon nor any landmark or natural evidence of position is left that the heaven is all spray and the ocean all cloud and that you see farther than you could see through cataract but i think the noblest sea that turner has ever painted and if so the noblest certainly ever painted by man is that of the slave ship 42 the chief academy picture of the exhibition in it is sunset on the atlantic after prolonged

low broad heaving of the whole ocean like the lifting of its bosom by deep drawn breath after the torture of the storm between these two ridges the ﬁre of the sunset falls along the trough of the sea dyeing it with an awful but glorious light the intense and lurid splendor which burns like gold and bathes like blood along this ﬁery path and valley the tossing waves by which the swell of the sea is restlessly divided lift themselves in dark indeﬁnite fantastic forms each casting faint and ghastly shadow behind it along the illumined foam they not rise everywhere but three or four together in wild groups ﬁtfully and furiously the under strength of the swell compels or permits them leaving between them treacherous spaces of level and whirling water now lighted with green and like ﬁre now ﬂashing back the gold of the declining sun now fearfully dyed from above with the indistinguishable images of the burning clouds which fall upon them in ﬂakes of crimson and scarlet and give to the reckless waves the added motion of their own ﬁery ﬂying purple and blue the lurid shadows of the hollow breakers are cast upon the mist of the night which gathers cold and low advancing like the shadow of death upon the guilty ship it labors amidst the lightning of the sea its thin masts written upon the sky in lines of blood girded with condemnation in that fearful hue which signs the sky

when his appliances at ﬁrst supposed to act supernaturally came to be understood acting naturally his ofﬁce eventually lost its priestly character altogether the resulting physician class originally uniform eventually dividing into distinguishable subclasses while acquiring deﬁnite embodiment less early because implying more developed groups arose those who exhibitors of joy now in the presence of the living ruler and now in the supposed presence of the deceased ruler were at ﬁrst simulta neously singers and dancers and becoming specialized from the people at large presently became distinct

separated from one another vocal and instrumental musicians and eventually composers within which classes also there arose subdivisions ovations now to the living king and now to the dead king while taking saltatory and musical forms took also verbal forms originally spontaneous and irregular but presently studied and measured whence ﬁrst the unrhythmical speech of the orator which under higher emotional excitement grew into the rhythmical speech of the priest poet chanting that ﬁnally became established hymns of praise meanwhile from accompanying rude imitations of the hero acts performed now by one and now by several grew dramatic representations which little by little elaborated fell under the regulation of chief actor who preﬁgured the playwright and out of these germs all 173 174

poets actors dramatists and the subdivisions of these the great deeds of the hero god recited chanted or sung and mimetically rendered naturally came to be supplemented by details so growing into accounts of his life and thus the priest poet gave origin to the biographer whose narratives being extended to less sacred personages became secularized stories of the apotheosized chief or king joined with stories of his companions and ampliﬁed by narratives of accompanying transactions formed the ﬁrst histories and from these accounts of the doings of particular men and groups of men partly

the priests of early civilized peoples to increase their inﬂuence they were ever stimulated to acquire knowledge of natural actions and the properties of things and being in alleged communication with supernatural beings they were supposed to acquire such knowledge from them hence by implication the priest became the primitive man of science and led by his special experiences to speculate about the causes of things thus entered the sphere of philosophy both his science and his philosophy being pursued in the servi ce of his religion not only his higher culture but his alleged intercourse with the gods whose mouthpiece he was made him the authority in cases of dispute and being also historian the authority concerning past transactions and traditional usages or laws he acquired in both capacities the character of judge moreover when the growth of legal administration brought the advocate he tho usually of lay origin was sometimes clerical distinguished in early stages the learned

traditional statements concerning ghosts and gods at ﬁrst to neophytes of his class only but afterward to the cultured classes he presently beyond instruction in supernatural things gave instruction in natural things and having been the ﬁrst secular teacher has retained lar ge share in secular teaching even down to our own days making sacriﬁce was the original priestly act and the building of an altar the sacriﬁce was by implication priestly act it results that the making of shelter over the altar which in its developed form became the temple was also priestly act when the priest ceasing to be himself the executant directed the artiﬁcers he continued to be the designer and when he ceased to be the actual designer the master builder or architect thereafter continued to fulﬁl his general directions and then the temple and the palace in sundry early societies being at once the residence of the apotheosized ruler and the living ruler even now palace usually contains small temple and being the ﬁrst kinds of developed architecture eventually gave origin to secular architecture rudely carved or modeled image of man placed on his grave gave origin to the sculptured representation of god inclos ed in his temple product of priestly skill at the outset it continued in some cases to be such among early civilized peoples and always thereafter when executed by an artizan conformed to priestly direction extending presently to the representation of other than divine and semidivine perso nages it eventually thus passed into its secularized form so was it with painting at ﬁrst used to complete the carved representation of the severed or worshiped personage and being otherwise in some tribes used by the priest and his aids exhibiting the tribal hero deeds it long remained subservient to religion either the coloring of statues it does still in roman catholic images of saints etc or the decoration of temples or the portraiture of decea sed persons on sarcophagi and 176

them up and went about naked shivering in the rain indeed the facts of aboriginal life seem to indicate that dress is developed out of decorations and when we remember that even among ourselves most

all the sham reasons given the real reason is that knowledge of those tongues is thought ladylike it is not that the books written in them may be utilized which they scarcely ever are but that italian and german songs may be sung and that the extent of attainment may bring whispered admiration the births deaths and marr iages of kings and other like historic trivialities are committed to memory not because of any direct beneﬁts that can possibly result from knowing them but because society considers them parts of good the absence of such knowledge may bring the contempt of others when we have named reading writing spelling grammar arithmetic and sewing we have named about all the things girl is taught with view to their direct uses in life and even some of these have more reference to the good opinion of others than to immediate personal welfare thoroughly to realize the truth that with the mind with the body the ornamental precedes the useful it is needful to glance at its rationale this lies in the fact that from the far past down even to the present social needs have subordinated individual needs and that the chief social need has been the control of individuals it is not we commonly suppose that there are governments but those of monar chs and parliaments and constituted authorities these acknowledged governments are supplemented by other unacknowledged ones that grow up in all circles in which every man or woman strives to be king or queen or lesser dignitary to get above some and be reverenced by them and to propitiate those who are above us is the universal struggle in which the chief energies of life are expe nded by the accumulation of wealth by style of living by beauty of dress by display of knowledge or intellect each tries to subjugate others and so aids in weaving that ramiﬁed network of restraints by which socie ty is kept in order it is not the savage chief only who in formidable war paint with scalps at his belt aims to strike awe into his inferiors it is not only the belle who by elaborate toilet polished manners and numerous accomplishments strives to make conquests but the scholar the historian the philosopher use their acquirements to the same end we are none of us content with quietly unfolding our own individualities to the full in all directions but have restless craving to impress our individualities upon others and in some way subordinate them and this it is which determines the character of our education not what knowledge is of most real worth is the consideration but what will bring most applause honor will most conduce to social position and will be most imposing throughout life not what we are but what we shall be thought is the question so in education the question is not the intrinsic value of knowledge so much its extrinsic effects on others and this being our dominant idea direct utility is scarcely more regarded than by the barbarian when ﬁling his teeth and staining his nails footnotes from

said to look upon hanover foreign country whose interests were to be considered of subordinate importance at the same time the last hopes of the house of stuart were now destroyed the pretender himself was languishing in italy where he shortly after died and his son slave to the vices which seemed hereditary in that family was consuming his life in an unpitied and ignominious obscurity and yet these circumstances which appeared so favorable did of necessity involve the most disastrous consequences the fear of disputed succession being removed the sovereign was emboldened to course on which he otherwise would not have ventured all those monstrous doctrines respecting the rights of kings which the revolu tion was supposed to have destroyed were suddenly revived the clergy abandoning the now hopeless cause of the pretender display ed the same zeal the house of hanover which they had formerly displayed the house of stuart the pulpits resounded with praises of the new king of the domestic virtues of his piety but above all his dutiful attachment to the english church the result was the establishment of an alliance between the two parties more intimate than any had been seen in england since the time of charles under their auspices the old tory faction rapidly rallied and were soon able to dispossess their rivals of the management of the government this reactionary movement was greatly aided by the personal character of geor ge iii he being despotic well superstitious was equally anxious to extend the prerogative and strengthen the church every liberal sentiment

ability not one whose name is associated with any measure of value either in domestic or in foreign policy even pitt only maint ained his position in the state by forgetting the lessons of his illustrious father and abandoning those liberal principles in which he had been educated and with which he enter ed public life because geor ge iii hated the idea of reform pitt not only relinquished

notion of frivolous and unedifying activity in the quarterly review some little time ago was an estimate of the celebrated french critic and very inadequate estimate of it in my judgment it was and its inadequacy consisted chieﬂy in this that in our english way it left out of sight the double sense really involved in the word curiosity thinking enough was said to stamp with blame if it was said that he was impelled in his operations critic by curiosity and omitting either to perceive that himself and many other people with him would consider that this was praiseworthy and not blameworthy or to point out why it ought really to be accounted worthy of blame and not of praise there is curiosity about intellectual matters which is futile and merely disease so there is certainly curiosity desire after the things of the mind simply their own sakes and the pleasure of seeing them they is in an intelligent being natural and laudable nay and the very desire to see things they are implies balance and regulation of mind which is not often attained without fruitful effort and which is the very opposite of the blind and diseased impulse of mind which is what we mean to blame when we blame curiosity montesquieu says the ﬁrst motive which ought to impel us to study is the desire to augment the excellence of our nature and to render an intelligent being yet more intelligent this is the true ground to assign the genuine scientiﬁc passion however manifested and culture viewed simply fruit of this passion and it is worthy ground even tho we let the term curiosity stand to describe it but there is of culture another view in which not solely the scientiﬁc passion the sheer desire to see things they are natural and proper in an intelligent being appears the ground of it there is view in which all the love of our neighbor the impulses toward action help and beneﬁcence the desire removing human error clearing human confusion and diminishing human misery the noble aspiration to leave the world better and happier than we found eminently such are called in part of the grounds of culture and the main and preeminent part culture is then properly described not having its origin in curiosity but having its origin in the love of perfection it is study of perfection it moves by the force not merely or primarily of the scientiﬁc passion pure knowledge but also of the moral and social passion doing good in the ﬁrst view of it we took its worthy motto montesquieu words to render an intelligent being yet more intelligent so in the second view of it there is better motto which it can have than these words of bishop wilson to make reason and the will of god prevail the pursuit of perfection then is the pursuit of sweetness and light he who works sweetness and light works to make reason and the will of god prevail he who works machinery he who works hatred works only confusion culture looks beyond machinery culture hates hatred culture has one great passion the passion

judgments constituting the creed of their own profession or party our religions and political organizations give an example of this way of working on the masses i condemn neither way but culture works differently it does not try to teach down to the level of inferior classes it does not try to win them this or that sect of its own with judgments and watchwords it seeks to away with classes to make the best that has been thought and known in the world current everywhere to make all men live in an atmosphere of sweetne ss and light where they may use ideas it uses them itself and not bound by

that he had won the english crown by wrong and that what he had won by wrong he had right to give to another he had won his realm by warfare and bloodshed he had treated the sons of the english soil with needless harshness he had cruelly wronged nobles and commons he had spoiled many men wrongfully of their inheritance he had slain countless multitudes by hunger or by the sword the harrying of northumberland now rose up before his eyes in all its blackness the dying man now told how cruelly he had burned and plundered the land what thousands of every age and sex among the noble nation which he had conquered had been done to death at his bidding the scepter of the realm which he had won by so many crimes he dared not hand over to any but to god alone yet he would not hide his wish that his son william who had ever been dutiful to him might reign in england after him he would send him beyond the sea and he would pray lafranc to place the crown upon his head if the primate in his wisdom deemed that such an act could he rightly done of the two sons of whom he spoke robert was far away banished rebel william was by his bedside by his bedside also stood his youngest son the

and let thine elders go before thee it is perhaps by the light of the later events that our chronicler goes on to make william tell his youngest son that the day would come when he would succeed both his brothers in their dominions and would be richer and mightier than either of them the king then dictated letter to lafranc setting forth his wishes with regard to the kingdom he sealed it and gave it to his son william and bade him with his last blessing and his last kiss to cross at once into england william rufus straightway set forth witsand and there heard of his father death meanwhile henry too left his father bedside to take himself the money that was left to him to see that nothing was lacking in its weight to call together his comrades on whom he could trust and to take measures stowing the treasure in place of safety and now those who stood around the dying king began to implore his mercy the captives whom he held in prison he granted the prayer the last earthly acts of the conqueror were now done he had striven to make his peace with god and man and to make such provision he could the children and the subjects whom he had left behind him and now his last hour was come on thursday morning in september when the sun had already risen upon the earth the sound of the great bell of the metropolitan minster struck on the ears of the dying king he asked why it sounded he was told that it rang prime in the church of our lady william lifted his eyes to heaven he stretched forth his hands and spake his last words to my lady mary the holy mother of god i commend myself that by her holy prayers she may reconcile to her dear son our lord jesus christ he prayed and his soul passed away william king of the english and duke of the normans the man whose fame has ﬁlled the world in his own and in every follo wing age had gone the way of all ﬂesh kingdom was left him now but his seven feet of ground and even to that his claim was not to be undisputed the death of king in those days came near to of all civil society till new king was chosen and crowned there was longer power in the land to protect or to chastise all bonds were loosed all public authority was in abeyance each man had to look to his own he best might sooner was the breath out of william body than the great company which had patiently watched around him during the night was scattered hither and thither the great men mounted their horses and rode with all speed to their own homes to guard their houses and goods against the outburst of lawlessness which was sure to break forth now that the land had longer ruler their servants and followers seeing their lords gone and deeming that there was longer any fear of punishment began to make spoil of the royal chamber weapons clothes vessels the

great chapter of the history of the world is written in the chalk few passag es in the history of man can be supported by such an overwhelming mass of direct and indirect evidence that which testiﬁes to the truth of the fragment of the history of the globe which i hope to enable you to read with your own eyes let add that few chapters of human history have more profound signiﬁcance ourselves i weigh my words well when i assert that the man who should know the true history of the bit of chalk which every carpenter carries abou t in his breeches pocket tho ignorant of all other history is likely if he will think his knowledge out to its ultimate results to have truer and therefore better conception of this wonderful universe and of man relation to it than the most learned student who is in the records of humanity and ignorant of those of nature the language of the chalk is not hard to learn not nearly so hard latin if you only want to get at the broad features of the story it has to tell and i propose that we now set to work to spell that story out together we all know that if we burn chalk the result is quicklime chalk in fact is compound of gas and lime and when you make it very hot the carbonic acid ﬂies away and the lime is left by this method of procedure we see the lime but we not see the carbonic acid if on the other hand you were to powder little chalk and drop it into good deal of strong vinegar there would be great bubbling and ﬁzzing and ﬁnally clear liquid in which sign of chalk would appear here you see the carbonic acid in the bubbles the lime dissolved in the vinegar vanishes from sight there are great many other ways of showing that chalk is essentially nothing but carbonic acid and quicklime chemists enunciate the result of all the experiments which prove this by stating that chalk is almost wholly composed of carbonate of lime it is desirable us to start from the knowledge of this fact tho it may not seem to help us very far toward what we seek carbonate of lime is widely spread substance and is met with under very various conditions all sorts of limestones are composed of more or less pure carbonate of lime the crust which is often deposited by waters which have drained through limestone rocks in the form of what are called stalagmites and stalactites is carbonate of lime or to take more familiar example the fur on the inside of is carbonate of lime and anything chemistry tells us to the contrary the chalk might be kind of gigantic fur upon the bottom of the which is kept pretty hot below but the slice of chalk presents totally different appearance when placed under the microscope the general mass of it is made up of very minute granules but imbedded in this matrix are innumerable bodies some smaller and some larger but on rough average not more than hundredth of an inch in diameter having shape and structure cubic inch of some specimens of chalk may contain hundreds of thousands of these bodies compacted together with incalculable millions of granules the examination of transparent slice gives good notion of the manner in which the components of the chalk are arranged and of their relative proportion but by rubbing up some chalk with brush in water and then pouring off the milky ﬂuid so to obtain sediments of different degrees of ﬁneness the granules and the minute rounded bodies may be pretty well separated from one another and submitted to microscopic examination either opaque or transparent objects by combining the views obtained in these various methods each of the rounded bodies may be proved to be 220 221 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics restricted to prose vol vi of x great britain and ireland iv by various https constructed calcareous fabric made up of number of chambers communicating freely with one another the chambered bodies are of various forms one of the commonest is something like badly grown raspberry being formed of number of nearly globular chambers of different sizes congregated together it is called globigerina and some specimens of chalk consist of little else than globigerinæ and granules let us ﬁx our attention upon the globigerina it is the spore of the game we are tracking if we can learn what it is and what are the conditions of its existence we shall see our way to the origin and past history of the chalk the history of the discovery of these living globigerinæ and of the part which they play in is singular enough it is discovery which like others of less scientiﬁc importance has arisen incidentally out of work devoted to very different and exceedingly practical interests when men ﬁrst took to the sea they speedily learned to look out the shoals and rocks and the more the burden of their ships increased the more imperatively necessary it became sailors to ascertain with precision the depth of the waters they traversed out of this necessity grew the use of the lead and line and ultimately marine surveying which is the recording of the form of coasts and of the depth of the sea ascertained by the upon charts at the same time it became desirable to ascertain and to indicate the nature of the sea bottom since this circumstance greatly affects its goodness ound anchors some ingenious tar whose name deserves better fate than the oblivion into which it has fallen attained the object by arming the bottom of the lead with lump of grease to which more or less of the sand or mud or broken shells the case might be adhered and was brought to the surface but however well adapted such an apparatus might be rough nautical purposes scientiﬁc accuracy could not be expected from the armed lead and to remedy its defects especially when applied to sounding in great depths lieutenant brooke of the american navy some years ago invented most ingenious machine by which conside rable portion of the superﬁcial layer of the sea bottom can be scooped out and brought up from any depth to which the lead descends in 1853 lieutenant brooke obtained mud from the bottom of the north atlantic between newfoundland and the azores at depth of more than feet or two miles by the help of this sounding apparatus the specimens were sent examination to ehrenber g of berlin and to bailey of west point and those able microscopists found that this sea mud was almost entirely composed of the skeletons of living greater proportion of these being just like the globigerinæ already known to occur in the chalk thus far the work had been carried on simply in the interests of science but lieutenant brooke method of sounding acquired high commercial value when the enterprise of laying down the telegraph cable between this country and the united states was undertaken it became matter of immense importance to know not only the depth of the sea over the whole line along which the cable was to be laid but the exact nature of the bottom so to guard against chances of cutting or fraying the strands of that costly rope the admiralty consequently ordered captain dayman an old friend and shipmate of mine to ascertain the depth over the whole line of the cable and to bring back specimens of the bottom in former days such command this might have sounded very much like one of the impossible things which the young prince in the fairy tales is ordered to before he can obtain the hand of the princess however in the months of june and july 1857 my friend performed the task assigned to him with great expedition and precision without so far i know having met with any reward of that kind the specimens of atlantic mud which he procured were sent to to be examined and reported upon the results of all these operations is that we know the contours and the nature of the surface soil covered by the north atlantic distance of miles from east to west well we know that of any part of the dry land it is prodigious of the widest and most even plains in the world if the sea were drained off you might drive wagon all the way from valentia on the west coast of ireland to trinity bay in newfoundland and except upon one sharp incline about 200 miles from valentia i am 222 223 224 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics restricted to prose vol vi of x great britain and ireland iv by various https quite sure that it would even be necessary to put the skid on so gentle are the ascents and descents upon that long route from valentia the road would lie downhill about 200 miles to the point at which the bottom is now covered by fathoms of then would come the central plain more than thousand miles wide the inequalities of the surface of which would be hardly perceptible tho the depth of water upon it now varies from to feet and there are places in which mont blanc might be sunk without showing its peak above water beyond this the ascent on the ame rican side commences and gradually leads about 300 miles to the newfoundland shore almost the whole of the bottom of this central plain which extends many hundred miles in direction is covered by ﬁne mud which when brought to the surface dries into friable substance you can write with this on blackboard if you are so inclined and to the eye it is quite like very soft grayish chalk examined chemically it proves to be composed almost wholly of carbonate of lime and if you make section of it in the same way that of the piece of chalk was made and view it with the microscope it presents innumerable globigerinæ imbedded in granular matrix thus this mud is substantially chalk i say substantially because there are good many minor differences but these have bearing on the question immediately before is the nature of the globigerinæ of the is unnecessary to speak of them globigerinæ of every size from the smallest to the largest are associated together in the atlantic mud and the chambers of many are ﬁlled by soft animal matter this soft substance is in fact the remains of the creature to which the globigerina shell or rather skeleton owes its existence and which is an animal of the simplest imaginable description it is in fact mere particle of living jelly without deﬁned parts of any kind without mouth nerves muscles or distinct organs and only manifesting its vitality to ordinary observation by thrusting out and retracting from all parts of its surface long ﬁlamentous processes which serve arms and legs yet this amorphous particle devoid of everything which in the higher animals we call organs is capable of feeding growing and multiplying of separating from the ocean the small proportion of carbonate of lime which is dissolved in and of building up that substance into skeleton itself according to pattern which can be imitated by other known agency the notion that animals can live and ﬂourish in the sea at the vast depths from which apparently living globigerinæ have been brought up does not agree very well with our usual conceptions respecting the conditions of animal life and it is not so absolutely impossible it might at ﬁrst sight appear to be that the globigerinæ of the atlantic sea bottom not live and die where they are found i have mentioned the soundings from the great atlantic plain are almost entirely made up of globigerinæ with the granules which have been mentioned and some few other calcareous shells but small percentage of the chalky at most some ﬁve per cent of of different nature and consists of shells and skeletons composed of silex or pure ﬂint these siliceous bodies belong partly to the lowly vegetable organisms which are called diatomaceæ and partly to the minute and extremely simple animals termed radiolaria it is quite certain that these creatures not live at the bottom of the ocean but at its surface where they may be obtained in prodigious numbers by the use of properly constructed net hence it follows that these siliceous organisms tho they are not heavier than the lightest dust must have fallen in some cases through feet of water before they reached their ﬁnal on the ocean ﬂoor and considering how large surface these bodies expose in proportion to their weight it is probable that they occupy great length of time in making their burial journey from the surface of the atlantic to the bottom thus not only is it certain that the chalk is the mud of an ancient sea bottom but it is less certain that the chalk sea existed during an extremely long period tho we may not be prepared to give precise estimate of the length of that period in years the relative duration is clear tho the absolute duration may not be deﬁnable the attempt to afﬁx any 225 226 227 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics restricted to prose vol vi of x great britain and ireland iv by various https date to the period at which the chalk sea began or ended its existence is bafﬂed by difﬁculties of the same kind but the relative age of the cretaceous epoch may be determined with great ease and certainty the long duration of that epoch you will have heard of the interesting discoveries recently made in various parts of western europe of ﬂint implements obviously worked into shape by huma n hands under circumstances which show conclusively that man is very ancient denizen of these regions it has been proved that the whole population of europe whose existence has been revealed to us in this way consiste d of savages such the eskimo are now that in the country which is now france they hunted the reindeer and were familiar with the ways of the mammoth and the bison the physical geography of france was in those days different from what it is now river somme instance having cut its bed hundred feet deeper between that time and this and it is probable that the climate was more like that of canada or siberia than that of western europe the existence of these people is forgotten even in the traditions of the oldest historical nations the name and fame of them had utterly vanished until few years back and the amount of physical change which has been effected since their day renders it more than probable that venerable are some of the historical nations the workers of the chipped ﬂints of hoxne or of amiens are to them they are to us in point of antiquity but if we assign to these hoar relics of generations of men the greatest age that can possibly be claimed them they are not older than the drift of boulder clay which in comparison with the chalk is but very juvenile deposit you need go further than your own seaboard evidence of this fact at one of the most charming spots on the coast of norfolk cromer you will see the boulder clay forming vast mass which lies upon the chalk and must consequently have come into existence after it huge boulders of chalk are in fact included in the clay and have evidently been brought to the position they now occupy by the same agency that which has planted blocks of syenite from norway side by side with them thus there is writing upon the wall of cliffs at cromer and whoso runs may read it it tells us with an authority which can not be impeached that the ancient of the chalk sea was raised up and remained dry land until it was covered with forest stocked with the great game the spoils of which have rejoiced your geologists how long it remained in that condition can not be said but the whirligig of time brought its revenges in those days in these that dry land with the bones and teeth of generations of elephants hidden away among the gnarled roots and dry leaves of its ancient trees sank gradually to the bottom of the icy sea which covered it with huge masses of drift and boulder clay sea beasts such the walrus now restricted to the extreme north paddled about where birds had twittered among the topmost twigs of the how long

us at last to measureless and pathless chaos to know anything that turns up is in the inﬁnity of knowledge to know nothing to read the ﬁrst book we come across in the wilderness of books is to learn nothing to turn over the pages of ten thousand volumes is to be practically indif ferent to all that is good i am very far from meaning that our whole time spent with books is to be given to study far from it i put the poetic and emotional side of literature the most needed daily use i take the books that seek to rouse the imagination to stir up feeling touch the heart the books of art of fancy of ideals such reﬂect the delight and aroma of life and here how does the trivial provided it is the new that which stares at us in the advertising columns of the day crowd out the immortal poetry and pathos of the human race vitiating our taste those exquisite pieces which are household word and weakening our mental relish the eternal works of genius old homer is the very fountai of pure poetic enjoyment of all that is spontaneous simple native and digniﬁed in life he takes us into the ambrosial world of heroes of human vigor of purity of grace now homer is one of the few poets the life of whom can be fairly preserved in translation most men and women can say that they have read homer just most of us can say that we have studied johnson dictionary but how few of us take him up time after time with fresh delight how few have even read the entire iliad and odyssey through whether in the resounding lines of the old greek fresh and the waves that tumble on the seashore ﬁlling the soul with satisfying silent wonder at its restless unison whether in the quaint lines of chapman or the clarion couplets of pope or the closer versions of cowper lord derby of philip worsley or even in the new prose version of the odyssey homer is always fresh and rich and yet how seldom does one ﬁnd friend spellbound over the greek bible of antiquity whilst they wade through torrents of magazine quotations from petty versiﬁer of and in an idle vacation will graze contentedly cattle in fresh meadow through the chopped straw of circulating library generation which will listen to pinafore three

dead completely some spoiled beauty of the ballroom is dead to the bloom of the heather or the waving of the daf fodils in glade it is true psychological problem this nausea which idle culture seems to produce all that is manly and pure in heroic poetry one least every schoolboy has known passage of homer rolling along in the hexameter or trumped out by pope will give one hot glow of pleasure and

sucking magazines and new poems to read book of homer would be like asking butcher boy to whistle adelaida the noises and sights and talk the whirl and volatility of life around us are too strong us society which is forever gossiping in sort of perpetual drum loses the very faculty of caring anything but early copies and the last tale out thus like the tares in the noble parable of the sower perpetual chatter about books chokes the seed which is sown in the greatest books in the world i speak of homer but ﬁfty other great poets and creators of eternal beauty would serve my argument well take the latest perhaps in the series of the and immortal poets of the whole human alter scott we all read scott romances we have all read hume history of england but how often we read them how zealously with what sympathy and understanding i am told that the last discovery of modern culture is that scott prose is commonplace that the young men at our universities are far too critical to care his artless sentences and ﬂowing descriptions they prefer swinburne mallock and the euphuism of young oxfor d just some people prefer dresden sheph erdess to the caryatides of the erechtheum pronounce fielding to be low and mozart to be passé boys love lollipops so these juvenile fops love to roll phrases about under the tongue if phrases in themselves had value apart from thoughts feelings great conceptions or human sympathy scott is just one of the poets we may call poets all the great creators in prose or in verse of whom one never wearies just one can listen to beethoven or watch the sunrise or the sunset day by day with new delight i think i can read the antiquary or the bride of lammermoor ivanhoe quentin durward and old mortality at least once year afresh now scott is perfect library in himself constant reader of romances would ﬁnd that it needed months to go through even the best pieces of the inexhaustible painter of eight full centuries and every type of man and he might repeat the process of reading him ten times in lifetime without sense of fatigue or sameness the poetic beauty of scott creations is almost the least of his great qualities it is the universality of his sympathy that is so truly great the justice of his estimates the insight into the spirit of each age his intense absorption of self in the vast epic of human civilization what are the old almanacs that they so often give us histories beside these living pictures of the ordered succession of ages in homer himself we see in this prose iliad of modern history the battle of the old and the new the heroic defense of ancient strongholds the long impending and inevitable doom of medieval life strong men and proud women struggle agains t the destiny of modern society unconsciously working out its ways undauntedly defying its power how just is our island homer neither greek nor trojan sways him achilles is his hero hector is his favorite he loves the councils of chiefs and the palace of priam but the swineherd the charioteer the slave girl the hound the beggar and the herdsman all glow alike in the harmonious coloring of his peopled epic we see the dawn of our english nation the defense of christendom against the koran the grace and the terror of feudalism the rise of monarchy out of baronies the rise of parliaments out of monarchy the rise of industry out of serfage the pathetic ruin of chivalry the splendid death struggle of catholicism the sylvan tribes of the mountain remnants of our prehis toric forefathers beating themselves to pieces against the hard advance of modern industry we see the grim heroism of the bible martyrs the catastrophe of feudalism overwhelmed by practical age which knew little of its graces and almost nothing of its virtues such is scott who we may say has done the various phases of modern history what shakespeare has done the manifold types of human character and this glorious and most human and most historical of poets

of some osric of the day who assures us that scott is an absolute philistine in speaking with enthusiasm of scott of homer or of shakespeare or of milton or of any of the accepted masters of the world i have wish to insist dogmatically upon any single name or two or three in particular our enjoyment and reverence of the great poets of the world is seriously injured nowadays by the habit we get of singling out some particular quality some particular school of art intemperate praise or still worse intemperate abuse ruskin i suppose is answerable the taste this and spasmodic criticism and every young gentleman who has the trick of few adjectives will languidly vow that marlowe is supreme or murillo foul it is the mark of rational criticism well of healthy thought to maintain an evenness of mind in judging of great works to recognize great qualities in due proportion to feel that defects are made up by beauties and beauties are often balanced by weakness the true judgment implies weighing of each work and each workman whole in relation to the sum of human cultivation and the gradual adva nce of the movement of ages and in this matter we shall usually ﬁnd that the world is right the world of the modern centuries and the nations of europe together it is unlikely to say the least of it that young person who has hardly ceased making latin verse s will be able to reverse the decisions of the civilized world and it is even more unlikely that milton and molière fielding and scott will ever be displaced by poet who has unaccountably lain hid one or two centuries i know that in the style of i ought hardly to venture to address you about poetry unless i am prepared to unfold to you the mysterious beauties of some unknow n genius who has recently been unearthed by the children of light and sweetness i confess i have such discovery to announce i prefer to dwell in gath and to pitch my tents in ashdod and i doubt the use of the sling weapon in modern war i decline to go into hyperbolic eccentricities over unknown geniuses and single quality or power is not enough to arouse my enthusiasm it is possible that master ever painted buttercup like this one or the fringe of robe like that one that this poet has unique subtlety and that an undeﬁnable music i am still unconvinced tho the man who can not see it we are told should at once retire to the place where there is wailing and gnashing of teeth i am against all gnashing of teeth whet her or against particular idol i stand by the men and by all the men who have moved mankind to the depths of their souls who have taught generations and formed our life if i say of scott that to have drunk in the whole of his glorious spirit is liberal education in itself i am asking exclusive devotion to scott to any poet or any school of poets or any age or any country to any style or any order of poet one more than another they are various fortunately and sided human nature itself if i delight in scott i love fielding and richardson and sterne and goldsmith and defoe yes and i will add cooper and marryat miss edgeworth and miss conﬁne myself to those who are already classics to our own country and to one form of art alone and not to venture on the ground of contemporary romance in general what i have said of homer i would say in degree but somewhat lower of those great ancients who are the most accessible to us in aristophanes virgil and horace what i have said of shake speare i would say of calderon of molière of corneille of racine of voltaire of alﬁeri of goethe of those dramatists in many forms and with genius the most diverse who have so steadily set themselves to idealize the great types of public life and of the phases of human history let us all beware lest worship of the idiosyncrasy of our peerless shakespeare blind us to the value of the great masters who in different world and with different aims have presented the development of civilization in series of dramas where the unity of few great types of man and of society is made paramount to subtlety of character or brilliancy of language 236 237 238 the project gutenberg ebook of the best of the world classics

awakening thought and primitive societies the pictu res of other races and types of life removed from our own all those primeval legends ballads songs and tales those proverbs apologs and maxims which have come down to us from distant ages of man old idylls and myths of the hebrew race the tales of greece of the middle ages of the east the fables of the old and the new world the songs of the nibelungs the romances of early feudalism the morte the arabian nights the ballads of the early nations of europe i protest that i am devoted to school in particular i condemn school i reject none i am the school of all the great men and i am against the school of the smal ler men i care wordsworth well byron burns well shelley boccaccio well milton bunyan well rabelais cervantes much dante corneille well shakespeare goldsmith well goethe i stand by the sentence of the world and i hold that in matter so human and so broad the highest poetry the judgment of the nations of europe is pretty well settled at any rate after century or two of continuous reading and discussing let those who will assure us that one can pretend to culture unless he swear by fra angelico and sandro botticelli by arnolpho the son of lapo or the lombardic bricklayers by martini and galuppi all by the way admirable men of the second rank and so in literature and poetry there are some who will hear of nothing but webster or marlowe blake herrick or keats william langland or the earl of surrey heine or omar khayyám all of these are men of genius and each with special and inimitable gift of his own but the busy world which does not hunt poets collectors hunt curios may fairly reserve these lesser lights the time when they know the greatest well so i say think mainly of the greatest of the best known of those who cover the largest area of human history and man common nature now when we come to count up these names accepted by the unanimous voice of europe we have some thirty or forty names and amongst them are some of the most voluminous of writers i have been running over but one department of literature alone the poetic i have been naming those only whose names are household words with us and the poets the most part of modern europe yet even here we have list which is usually found in not less than hundred volumes at least now poetry and the highest kind of romance are exactly that order of literature which not only will bear to be read many times but that of which the true value can only be gained by frequent and indeed habitual reading man can hardly be said to know the twelfth mass or the ninth symphony by virtue of having once heard them played ten years ago he can hardly be said to take air and exercise because he took country walk once last autumn and so he can hardly be said to know scott or shakespeare molière or cervantes when he once read them since the close of his or amidst the daily grind of his professional life the immortal and universal poets of our race are to be

taire an author and man of action 63 the man of letters usually unable to conceive loftier services to mankind or more attractive aims to persons of capacity than the composition of books has treated these pretensions of voltaire with supercil ious kind of censure which teaches us nothing about voltaire while it implies particularly shallow idea alike of the position of the mere literary life in the scale of things and of the conditions under which the best literary work is done to have really contributed in the humblest degree instance to peace between prussia and her enemies in 1759 would have been an immeasurably greater performance mankind than any given book which voltaire could have written and what is still better worth observing voltaire books would not have been the powers they were but this constant desire of his to come into the closest contact with the practical affairs of the world he who has never left the life of recluse drawing an income from the funds and living in remote garden constructing past present and future out of his own consciousness is not qualiﬁed either to lead mankind safely or to think on the course of human affairs correctly every page of voltaire has the bracing air of the life of the world in it and the instinct which led him to seek the society of the conspicuous actors on the great scene was essentially right one the takes good advantage of his opportunity to assure men expressly or by implication that he is their true king and that the sacred bard is mightier man than his hero voltaire knew better tho himself perhaps the most puissant man of letters that ever lived he rated literature it ought to be rated below action not because written speech is less of force but because the speculation and criticism of the literature that substantially inﬂuences the world make far less demand than the actual conduct of great affairs on qualities which are not rare in detail but are amazingly rare in combination on

highest functions of the state he had at least to make himself worthy of them i admit he concludes that we must not expect such an advantage with us our own constitution happens to be against it but he was deeply sensible what an advantage it was that they thus lost in short on all sides whatever men and think was real and alive to voltaire whatever had the quality of interesting any imaginable temperament had the quality of interesting him there was subject which any set of men have ever cared about which if he once had mention of it voltaire did not care about likewise and it was just because he was so thoroughly alive himself that he ﬁlled the whole with life the more closely one studies the various movements of that time the more clear it becomes that if he was not the original center and ﬁrst fountain of them all at any rate he made many channels ready and gave the sign he was the initial principle of fermentation throughout that vast commotion we may deplore if we think ﬁt

wherever he went he left an indelible trail behind him on the glittering streets wherever he went he was still tethered to the house by the cemetery of john wherever he went he must weave with his own

three steps of it and jumped into the shelter of the porch it was pretty dark inside after the glimmer of the snowy streets and he was groping forward with outspread hands when he stumbled over some substance which offered an indescribable mixture of resistances hard and soft ﬁrm and loose his heart gave leap and he sprang two steps back and stared dreadfully at the obstacle then he gave little
