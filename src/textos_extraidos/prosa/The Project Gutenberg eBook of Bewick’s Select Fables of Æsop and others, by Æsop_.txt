works are comparatively unknown to the literary and reading world we all know that bewick designed and engraved the inimitable british quadrupeds birds fables and that goldsmith wrote the vicar of wakeﬁeld traveller deserted village but what we know of their early progressive steps by which they attained their wondrous and celebrity it has been the pleasing pursuit of the writer some years to search and rescue from destruction and oblivion all possible early works of bewick and goldsmith the result has exceeded his most sanguine expectations he has discovered at least twenty little works

engraved the sketches of landscape in the backgrounds are more natural and the engraving of the foliage of the trees and bushes is not unfrequently scarce inferior to that of his later jackson gives

myself thus forming most useful manual or pictorial aid to connoisseurs in selecting early works illustrated by bewick the more valuable scarcely any of the works mentioned published by saint are in the british museum now to the goldsmith interest connected with this work the 1776 newcastle edition was evidently copied from dodsley s and other editions of select fables of æsop published in london prior to this period in the meantime newbery and others whom goldsmith wrote prefaces and arranged and edited books had published new editions so that when saint went to press with new edition improved with new set of cuts by the bewicks evidently the book was remodelled and extended from one that goldsmith had just edited in dodsley s preface to his fables he says he has been assisted in it by gentlemen of the most distinguished abilities and that several both of the old and the new fables are not written by himself but by authors with whom it is an honour to be dodsley also refers to the life of æsop being written by learned and ingenious doubtless dr johnson and goldsmith were the authors and goldsmith the friend here referred to be that it may the present work bears sufﬁcient internal evidence in the essay on fable the poetical applications and the fables in verse that oliver goldsmith was the author it is identical in style with numerous preface s and essays written about this period by oliver goldsmith newbery dodsley grifﬁths and others much conclusive eviden ce on this interesting subject will be given in my new book on the early works of bewick and goldsmith prospectus of which will shortly be issued the application s to this edition are inﬁnitely superior to any edition which had appeared prior to its publication in sir roger l estrange and croxall s editions the applications were warped away from their original and intended effect by political distortions and obsolete terms which often strayed far from instead of assisting the subject it is somewhat refreshing then in the edition here reprinted to meet with some applications which are everything that could be desired in easy naturally ﬂowing and apt language just to the point and who was so much master of such language oliver goldsmith whom dr johnson said he left species of writing it may be interesting here to quote from bewick s memoir of himself not published till 1862 his opinion of this book which at once justiﬁes the parent preceptor or friend in selecting this most suitable present the young of both sexes he says pages i was extremely fond of that book æsop s fables and it had afforded much pleasure i thought with better executed designs it would impart the same kind of delight to others that i had experienced from attentively reading it i was also of opinion that it had while admiring the cuts led hundreds of young men into the paths of wisdom and rectitude and in that way had materially assisted the xxvii xxviii the project gutenberg ebook of bewick s select fables of æsop and others by æsop https lessons intended to be conveyed through the medium of fable are certainly plainer and easier to be understood in this edition than in the once popular croxall and the publishers believe therefore that the book in its present form will be found powerful auxiliary in the important practical feeling the education of the rising generation illustrated it is by the early but forcible and natural rendering of these fables by the inimitable bewick through the medium of which is imparted the profound good sense wisdom and experience of the ancient philosophers i have already exceeded the limits of an ordinary preface on future occasion i will endeavour to show how coincidently bewick and goldsmith worked together to produce importance of which can scarcely be fully estimated i will now conclude with one of those exquisite little pictures of nature that will never cease to exhibit the true art of pleasing long the language of england is spoken or her literature edwin pearson say should the philosophic mind disdain that good which makes each humble bosom vain let pride dissemble all it can these little things are great to little man the life of æsop æsop according to the best accounts was native of phrygia province of the lesser asia and born in the city cotiæum 2 he was person of remarkable genius and extraordinary character though he was born slave by the assistance of his genius and virtue only he procured his own emancipation by his sage counsels and judicious advice he directed his countrymen to measures that secured their liberty and by single fable bafﬂed the tyrannical projects of crœsus king of lydia the most part of writers agree that his person was but unseemly though there are some of contrary opinion 3 it is probable that he was of low and diminutive stature though agreeable in his complexion and polite in his manners it is however certain that he had great soul and was endowed with extraordinary mental qualiﬁcations his moral character approached to xxix xxx the project gutenberg ebook of bewick s select fables of æsop and others by æsop https degree of perfection to which very few have attained he appears to have had true sense of morality and just discernment of right and wrong his perceptions and feelings of truth were scrupulously nice and the smallest deviation from rectitude impressed his mind with the greatest antipathy considerations of private interest could warp his inclinations so to seduce him from the paths of virtue his principles were stedfast and determined and truly habitual he never employed his great wisdom to serve the purposes of cunning but with an uncommon exactness made his underst anding servant to truth historians have given many instances of his wit and shrewdness which were always employed in the service of virtue philanthr opy and benevolence it can not well be ascertained who were his parents though some have afﬁrmed that his father was shepherd 4 he himself was undoubtedly slave his ﬁrst master was an athenian whose name was caresias at athens he learned the greek language in perfection and acquired taste writing moral instructions in the way of fables which was then the prevailing mode of teaching morals in attica his fables are allegorical stories delivered with an air of ﬁction under various personiﬁc ations to convey truth to the mind in an agreeable manner by telling story of lion dog or wolf the fabulist describes the manners and characters of men and communicates instruction without seeming to assume the authority of master or pedagogue æsop s situation slave might suggest this method to him what would have been scornfully rejected if delivered in an authoritative style by slave was received with avidity in the form of fable æsop had several masters his second master was xanthus in whose service he discovered great wisdom and sagacity in answering questions and reconciling differences by the following stratagem he made his master s wife return back after she had run away and left him and effectu ally reconciled them our fabulist then slave went to the market and bought great quantity of the best provisions which he publicly declared were intended the marriage of his master with new spouse this report had its desired effect and the matter was amicably composed the story of his feast of neat tongrege and his answer to gardener are scarcely worthy of relating at feast made on purpose to celebrate the return of his master s wife he is said to have served the guests with several courses of tongues by which he intended to give moral lesson to his master and mistress who had by the too liberal use of their tongues occasioned the difference which was now agreed the third master of æsop was idmon who was surnamed the wise idmon was an inhabitant of the island of samos during æsop s servitude with this master he had called rhodopis who some afﬁrm was his wife 5 this does not at all appear credible there is mention made of this among the greek writers this rhodopis became afterwards very famous her riches and was celebrated all over greece idmon is said to have been so well pleased with æsop that after he had been some time in his service he emancipated him and made him free with the enjoyment of liberty he acquired new reputation and became celebrated his wisdom he is by some compared to the seven sages of greece and accounted their equal in wisdom he had the honour to be acquainted with solon and chilo and was equally admitted with them in the court of periander the king of the corinthians who was himself one of the sages of greece he was much esteemed by crœsus king of lydia and received into his court at sardis during his residence at sardis he gave proofs of his sagacity which astonished the courtiers of crœsus this ambitious prince having one day shewn his wise men his vast riches and magniﬁcence and the glory and splendour of his court asked them the question whom they thought the happie st man after several different answers given by all the wise men present it came at last to æsop to make his reply who said that crœsus was much happier than other men the fulness of the sea was superior to the rivers whether this was spoken ironically or in earnest does not appear so evident but according to the severe morality of æsop it would rather appear to be sarcasm though it was otherwise understood by the king and received the greatest compliment it wrought so much upon his vanity that he exclaimed the phrygian had hit the mark one thing which renders it probable that æsop ﬂattered crœsus on this occasion is his xxxi xxxii xxxiii xxxiv the project gutenberg ebook of bewick s select fables of æsop and others by æsop https with solon who at this time departed from the court of the king of lydia when they were upon the road æsop exclaims solon either we must not speak to kings or we must say what will please them solon replied we should either not speak to kings at all or we should give them good advice and speak truth this seems to be one instance in which æsop is charged with ﬂattery and dissimulation some writers praise him his complaisance to so great prince but it is rather proof of his policy than his ordinary strictness and integrity there is another instance recorded by some writers of the life of æsop of his complaisance to princes even contrary to the liberties of the people he is said to have written fable in favour of the tyrant pisistratu s which phædrus has translated and proves that he was reconciled to tyranny but this is way evident there are many fables which are mingled with those of æsop which are not his yet have been fathered upon him and it is not consistent with the other parts of his character and writings to suppose that he would either ﬂatter tyrants or defend them the authorities from whence these supposed facts are taken are not to be depended upon in all other particulars he appears to have proceeded upon the principles of wisdom far any of the sages of greece when he was asked by chilo one of the wise men what god was doing he replied with great adroitness that he was humbling the proud and exalting the humble he had just views of human nature and assigned true reasons all its phænomena in an account of the paintings in the time of the antonines philostratus informs us that there is one of æsop which makes principal ﬁgure the painter represents him before his own house with the geniuses approaching him with sort of adulating pleasure the inventor of fables they are painted adorning him with wreaths and chaplets of ﬂowers and crowning him with olive branches his countenance appears in smiling attitude while his eyes seem ﬁxed towards the ground if composing fable with the same gaiety and good humour with which he usually wrote there is group of men and beasts placed around him and amongst the rest the fox which makes capital ﬁgure he does in the fables this picture does not represent æsop in decrepit form but sets him forth with mixture of gravity and good humour the image of his mind is well drawn by plutarch in his feast of the sages at the court of periander who himself was one of the seven it was at this feast that æsop repeats his fable of the wolf and the shepher ds to shew that the company were guilty of the same fault from plutarch s account it is manifest that æsop s conversation was pleasant and witty but yet delicate he was satirical without disobliging and the poignancy of his wit was smoothed with good nature and good sense the writer of his life preﬁxed to dodsley s fables compares him to dean swift but with very little propriety he has delicacy in all his wit which the dean of st patrick s was total stranger to and what is more strange he had nearly much christianity it has been doubted if he was the inventor of fables but it is certain he was the ﬁrst that brought that species of writing into reputation archilochus is said to have written fables one hundred years before him 6 but it would appear that those stories were not written posterity like those of æsop the fables of æsop were written in prose though the images that are in them afford good scope poet of which phædrus has given an elegant specimen æsop writes with great simplicity elegance and neatness the schemes of his fables are natural the sentiments just and the conclusions moral quintilian recommends his fables ﬁrst book children 7 and when plato had sent all the poets into exile he allows æsop residence in his commonwealth 8 the athenians were good judges of literary merit and erected noble statue æsop to perpetuate his memory which was sculped by the famous l ysippus the great excellency of æsop s manner of writing is that he blends the pleasi ng and the instructive so well to instruct and please at once horace is much indebted to him plan of writing and has formed rule from this famous fabulist xxxv xxxvi the project gutenberg ebook of bewick s select fables of æsop and others by æsop https tulit punctum qui miscuit utile dulci lectorem delectando pariterque monendo arte poet ver i wish i could conceal the exit of this great fabulist and moral writer he was accused by the delphians of sacrilege and convicted by an act of the greatest villany that ever was invented they concealed among his baggage at his departure some golden vessels consecrated to apollo and then dispatched messengers to search his baggage upon this he was accused of theft and sacrilege condemned and precipitated over rock thus ended the famous æsop whose fables have immortalised his memory and will hand down his name to the latest posterity an y upon f able fable is the method of conveying truth under the form of an allegory the sense of fable is entirely different from the literal meaning of the words that are used to compose it and yet the real intention thereof is visible and manifest otherwise the fable is not well composed the sense of fable of the moral kind ought always to be obvious at ﬁrst view that the instruction intended to be given may have early an ef fect possible the chief thing to be considered in fable is the action which conveys the moral or truth designed instruction there ought only to be one action in fable which must appear through the whole otherwise it will be liable to admit of different interpretations and be the same riddle and have effect clearness unity and probability are incidents essentially necessary in moral fable if fable be not so plain to point out the sense of the writer clearly but admit of different interpretations it does not answer the true design thereof if the incidents tend to convey different ideas then the reader will be at loss to understand the chief intention of the author all the various incidents ought manifestly to unite in one design and point out one clear and perspicuous truth many of the modern fables labour under this defect the incidents not manifestly tend to point out the moral fontaine s fable of the two pigeons and croxall s story of the wheel are of this sort the incidents of fable ought also to have real foundation in natur this rule may be infringed by ascribing to creatures appetites and passions that are not consistent with their known characters fox should not be said to long 9 the rule of horace will hold sed non ut placidis cœant immitia non ut serpentes avibus geminentur tigribus agni delphinum sylvis appingit fluctibus aprum i to join the wild with creatures that are tame serpents with birds or tygers with the lamb paint whales in woods and wild boars in the sea ah what motley piece the whole would be creatures different in their nature must not be associated in just fable the lamb must not be made to travel with the fox nor the wolf and the sheep to feed or associate together all this is unnatural and can never be rendered probable object of belief the incidents in fable ought also to be few lest by crowding circumstances too close the whole appear confused and perplex the mind the next thing to be considered in fable is the imagery or characters these may either be men beasts or inanimate beings all these have been introduced by the ancient fabulists in all personiﬁcations the rules of analogy are to be observed in those things xxxvii xxxviii xxxix the project gutenberg ebook of bewick s select fables of æsop and others by æsop https man and other creatures have similitude true image can be formed in what respects human society the persons and characters assumed in fables ought therefore to have likeness to the things to which they are compared all nature may serve to furnish fabulist with machinery mountains rivers trees animals and even invisibl powers may answer his purpose but in the use of all sorts of machinery proper regard must always be held to analogy when language is attributed to animals they must not be made to speak in style which bears similitude to some property in their nature an owl must not be made to sing like nightingale nor should raven be made the symbol of an orator when beasts are made the representations of men there ought always to be something in their nature that bears similitude to their character the same may be said of things inanimate strong man may be compared to mountain but it would be preposterous to make the same comparison of dwarf vices and virtues ought in the same manner to be delineated in fable proud man may be compared to high hill humble person to low valley this is authorised by the writings of the old testament the high mountains shall be br ought low and every valley shall be exalted when human actions are attributed to invisible powers or especially to the deity they ought to be such are worthy of those ideas which are generally received concerning him in this homer is very faulty he exalts his men almost to gods and brings down his gods to the level of beasts the style of fable simplicity is the greatest excellence that familiar manner of speech in which we converse is best suited the purposes of fable this manner of writing is more difﬁcult to attain than is generally imagined it requires particular taste and is harder to imitate than the sublime itself the style of fable must always be adapted to the characters which are introduced it would be absurd to make the eagle speak in the same style with the bat or the king of the forest express himself in the language of the mouse but in all these particulars nature will be the best guide and where this is deﬁcient art can supply the want of it fables xl 1 the project gutenberg ebook of bewick s select fables of æsop and others by æsop https able the miller his son and their ass tis better to pursue the dictates
