offered their votes to the inspectors of election claiming the right to vote among the privileges and immunities secured to them citizens by the fourteenth amendment to the constitution of the united states the inspectors jones hall and marsh by majority decided in favor of receiving the offered votes against the dissent of hall and they were received and deposited in the ballot box this act the women fourteen in number were arrested and held to bail and indictments were found against them severally under the 19th section of the act of congress of may 30th 1870 16 at l 144 charging them with the offense of knowingly voting without having lawful right to vote the three inspectors were also arrested but only two of them were held to bail hall having been dischar ged by the commissioner on whose warrant they were arrested all three however were jointly indicted under the same having knowingly and wilfully received the votes of persons not entitled to vote of the women voters the case of miss anthony alone was brought to trial nolle prosequi having been entered upon the other indictments upon the trial of miss anthony before the circuit court the northern district of new york at canandaigua in june 1873 it was proved that before offering her vote she was advised by her counsel that she had right to vote and that she entertained doubt at the time of voting that she was entitled to vote it was claimed in her behalf that she was legally entitled to vote ii that if she was not so entitled but voted in good faith in the belief that it was her right she was guilty of crime iii that she did vote in such good faith and with such belief the court held that the defendant had right to good faith constituted there was nothing in the case the jury to decide and directed them to ﬁnd verdict of guilty refusing to submit at the request of the defendant counsel any question to the jury or to allow the clerk to ask the jurors severally whether they assented to the verdict which the court had directed to be entered the verdict of guilty was entered by the clerk directed by the court without any express assent or dissent on the part of the jury ﬁne of 100 and costs was imposed upon the defendant miss anthony insists that in these proceedings the fundamental principle of criminal law that person can be criminal unless the mind be an honest mistake is not crime has been disregarded that she has been denied her constitutional right of trial by jury the jury having had voice in her conviction that she has been denied her right to have the response of every juror to the question whether he did or did not assent to the verdict which the court directed the clerk to enter the trial of the three inspectors followed that of miss anthony and all were convicted the court holding in the case of miss anthony that good faith on their part in receiving the votes was not protection which they think somewhat severe rule of law inasmuch the statute provides the same penalty and in the same sentence knowingly and wilfully receiving the vote of any person not entitled to vote or refusing to receive the vote of any person entitled to vote the inspectors claim that according to this exposition of the law they were placed in position which required them without any opportunity to investigate or take advice in regard to the right of any voter whose right was questioned to decide the question correctly at the peril of term in the state prison if they made mistake and though this may be correct exposition of the law in their case they would be sorry to see it applied to the decisions of any court not excepting the tribunal by which they were the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https defendant hall is at loss to know how he could have avoided the penalty inasmuch he did all that he could in the way of rejecting the votes without throttling his and forcing them to desist from the wrong of receiving them he is of opinion that by the ruling of the court he would have been equally guilty if he had tried his strength in that direction and had failed of success to preserve full record of so important judicial determination and to

hunt and jury jury impanneled at c rowley opened the case follows may it please the court and gentlemen of the jury on the 5th of november 1872 there was held in this state well in other states of the union general election different ofﬁcers and among those candidates to represent several districts of this state in the congress of the united states the defendant miss susan anthony at that time

the 29th congressional district of this state and also representative at large the state of new york to represent the state in the congress of the united states at that time she was woman i suppose there will be question about that the question in this case if there be question of fact about it at all will in my judgment be rather question of law than one of fact i suppose that there will be question of the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https in the case when all of the evidence is out and it will be you to decide under the charge of his honor the judge whether or not the defendant committed the offence of voting representative in congress upon that occasion we think on the part of the government that there is question about it either one way or the other neither question of fact nor question of law and that whatever miss anthony intentions may have they were good or did not have right to vote upon that question and if she did vote without having lawful right to vote then there is question but what she is guilty of violating law of the united states in that behalf enacted by the congress of the united states we claim in this case gentlemen that miss anthony is of that class of people who go about repeating we claim that she went from place to place the purpose of offering her vote but we claim that upon the 5th of november 1872 she voted and whether she believed that she had right to vote or not it being question of law that she is within the statute congress in 1870 passed the following statute reads 19th section of the act of 1870 page

anthony if it is upon that poll list i have it what number is it number from that poll list what tickets does it purport to show that she voted upon that occasion electoral state congress and assembly united states r ests judge s elden opened the case in behalf of the defendant follows if the court please gentlemen of the the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https is case of ordinary magnitude although many might regard it one of very little importance the question whether my client here has done anything to justify her being consigned to felon prison or not is one that interests her very essentially and that interests the people also essentially i claim and shall endeavor to establish before you that when she offered to have her name registered voter and when she offered her vote member of congress she was much entitled to vote any man that voted at that election according to the constitution and laws of the government under which she lives if i maintain that proposition matter of course she has comm itted offence and is entitled to be dischar ged at your hands but beyond that whether she was legal voter or not whether she was entitled to vote or not if she sincerely believed that she had right to vote and offered her ballot in good faith under that belief whether right or wrong by the laws of this country she is guilty of crime i apprehend that that proposition when it is discussed will be maintained with clearness and force that shall leave doubt upon the mind of the court or upon your minds the gentlemen of the jury if i maintain that proposition here then the further question and the only question which in my judgment can come before you to be passed upon by you question of fact is whether or not she did vote in good faith believing that she had right to vote the public prosecutor assumes that however honestly she may have offered her vote however sincerely she may have believed that she had right to vote if she was mistaken in that judgment her offering her vote and its being received makes criminal proposition to most abhorrent i believe it will be equally abhorrent to your judgment before the registration and before this election miss anthony called upon advice upon the question whether under the 14th amendment of the constitution of the united states she had right to vote i had not examined the question i told her i would examine it and give her my opinion upon the question of her legal right she went away and came again after i had made the examination i advised her that she was lawful voter i am or any other man is and advised her to go and offer her vote i may have been mistaken in that and if i was mistaken i believe she acted in good faith i believe she acted according to her right the law and constitution gave it to her but whether she did or not she acted in the most perfect good faith and if she made mistake or if i made one that is not reason committing her to felon cell the second time in my life in my professional practice i am under the necessity of offering myself witness my client henr y s elden witness sworn in behalf of the defendant testiﬁed follows before the last election miss anthony called upon advice upon the question whether she was or was not legal voter i examined the question and gave her my opinion unhesitatingly that the laws and constitution of the united states authorized her to vote well they authorize any man to vote and i advised her to have her name placed upon the registry and to vote at the election if the inspectors should receive her vote i gave the advice in good faith believing it to be accurate and i believe it to be accurate still this witness was not judge s elden i propose to call miss anthony to the fact of her the question of the intention or belief under which she voted c rowley she is not competent witness in her own behalf the court so held defendant r ests john p ound witness sworn in behalf of the united states testiﬁed the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https by c rowley during the months of november and december 1872 and january 1873 were you assistant united states dist attorney the northern district of new york yes sir you know the defendant susan anthony yes sir did you attend an examination before wm storrs united states commissioner in the city of rochester when her case was examined i did was she called witness in her own behalf upon that examination she was was she sworn she was did she give evidence she did did you keep minutes of evidence on that occasion i did q handing the witness paper please look at the paper now shown you and see if it contains the minutes you kept upon that occasion it does turn to the evidence of susan anthony i have it did she upon that occasion state that she consulted or talked with judge henry selden of rochester in relation to her right to vote judge s elden i object to that upon the ground that it is incompetent that if they refuse to allow her to be sworn here they should be excluded from producing any evidence that she gave elsewhere especially when they want to give the version which the united states ofﬁcer took of her evidence the c our t go on by c rowley state whether she stated on that examination under oath that she had talked or consulted with judge henry selden in relation to her right to vote she did state whether she was asked upon that examination if the advice given her by judge henry selden would or did make any difference in her action in voting or in substance that she stated on the i should have made the same endeavor to vote that i did had i not consulted judge selden i did consult any one before i registered i was not inﬂuenced by his advice in the matter at all have been resolved to vote the ﬁrst time i was at home 30 days number of years the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https by v an v oorhees pound was she asked there if she had any doubt about her right to vote and did she answer not particle she stated had doubt to my right to vote on the direct examination there was stenographic reporter there was there not reporter was there taking notes was not this question put to her did you have any doubt yourself of your right to vote and did she not answer not particle the c our t well he says so that she had doubt of her right to vote judge s elden i beg leave to state in regard to my own testimony miss anthony informs that i was mistaken in the fact that my advice was before her registry it was my recollection that it was on her way to the registry but she states to now that she was registered and came immediately to my ofﬁce in that respect i was under mistake evidence closed argument of selden the defendant the defendant is indicted under the 19th section of the act of congress of may 31 1870 16 at 144 voting without having lawful right to vote the words of the statute so far they are material in this case are follows if at any election representative or delegate in the congress of the united states any person shall knowingly vote without having lawful right to vote every such person shall be deemed guilty of crime and on conviction thereof shall be punished by ﬁne not exceeding 500 or by imprisonment term not exceeding three years or by both in the discretion of the court and shall pay the costs of prosecution the only alleged ground of illegality of the defendant vote is that she is woman if the same act had been done by her brother under the same circumstances the act would have been not only innocent but honorable and laudable but having been done by woman it is said to be crime the crime therefore consists not in the act done but in the simple fact that the person doing it was woman and not man i believe this is the ﬁrst instance in which woman has been arraigned in criminal court merely on account of her sex if the advocates of female suffrage had been allowed to choose the point of attack to be made upon their position they could not have chosen it more favorably themselves and i am disposed to thank those who have been instrumental in this procee ding presenting it in the form of criminal prosecution women have the same interest that men have in the establishment and maintenance of good government they are to the same extent men bound to obey the laws they suffer to the same extent by bad laws and proﬁt to the same extent by good laws and upon principles of equal justice it would seem should be allowed equally with men to express their preference in the choice of and rulers but however that may be greater absur dity to use harsher term could be presented than that of rewarding men and punishing women the same act without giving to women any voice in the question which should be r ewar ded and which punished i am aware however that we are here to be governed by the constitution and laws they are and that if the defendant has been guilty of violating the law she must submit to the penalty however unjust or absurd the law may be but courts are not required to the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https laws or constitutions to produce either absurdity or injustice so long they are open to more reasonable interpretation this must be my excuse what i design to say in regard to the propriety of female suffrage because with that propriety established there is very little difﬁculty in ﬁnding sufﬁcient warrant in the constitution its exercise this case in its legal aspects presents three questions which i purpose to discuss was the defendant legally entitled to vote at the election in question if she was not entitled to vote but believed that she was and voted in good faith in that belief did such voting constitute crime under the statute before referred to did the defendant vote in good faith in that belief if the ﬁrst question be decided in accordance with my views the other questions become immaterial if the second be decided adversely to my views the ﬁrst and third become immaterial the two ﬁrst are questions of law to be decided by the court the other is question the jury the judge here suggested that the argument should be conﬁned to the legal questions and the argument on the other question suspended until his opinion on those questions should be made known this suggestion was assented to and the counsel proceeded my ﬁrst position is that the defendant had the same right to vote any other citizen who voted at that election before proceeding to the discussion of the purely legal question i desire already intimated to pay some attention to the propriety and justice of the rule which i claim to have been established by the constitution miss anthony and those united with her in demanding the right of suffrage claim and with strong appearance of justice that upon the principles upon which our government is founded and which lie at the basis of all just government every citizen has right to take part upon equal terms with every other citizen in the formation and administration of government this claim on the part of the female sex presents question the magnitude of which is not well appreciated by the writers and speakers who treat it with ridicule those engaged in the movement are able sincere and earnest women and they will not be silenced by such ridicule nor even by the villainous caricatures of nast on the contrary they justly place all those things to the account of the wrongs which they think their sex has suffered they believe with an intensity of feeling which men who have not associated with them have not yet learned that their sex has not had and has not now its just and true position in the organization of government and society they may be wrong in their position but they will not be content until their arguments are fairly truthfully and candidly answered in the most celebrated document which has been put forth on this side of the atlantic our ancestors declared that governments derive their just powers from the conse nt of the governed blackstone says the lawfulness of punishing such criminals persons offending merely against the laws of society is founded upon this principle that the law by which they suffer was made by their own consent it is part of the original contract into which they entered when ﬁrst they engaged in society it was calculated and has long contributed to their own security quotations to an unlimited extent containing similar doctrines from eminent writers both english and american on government from the time of john locke to the present day might be made without adopting this doctrine which bases the rightfulness of government upon the consent of the governed i claim that there is implied in it the narrower and unassailable principle that all citizens of state who are bound by its laws are entitled to an equal voice in the making and execution of such laws the doctrine the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https stated by godwin in his treatise on political justice he says the ﬁrst and most important principle that can be imagined relative to the form and structure of government seems to be this that government is transaction in the name and the beneﬁt of the whole every member of the community ought to have some share in its administration again government is contrivance instituted the security of individua ls and it seems both reasonable that each man should have share in providing his own security and probable that partiality and cabal should by this means be most effectually excluded and again to give each man voice in the public concerns comes neare st to that admirable idea of which we should never lose sight the uncontrolled exercise of private judgment each man would thus be inspired with consciousness of his own importance and the slavish feelings that shrink up the soul in the presence of an imagined superior would be unknown the mastery which this doctrine whether right or wrong has acquired over the public mind has produced its natural fruit the extension of the right of suffrage to all the adult male population in nearly all the states of the union result which was well epitomized by president lincoln in the expression government by the people the people this extension of the suffrage is regarded by many source of danger to the stability of free government i believe it furnishes the greatest security free government it deprives the mass of the people of all motive revolution and that government so based is most safe not because the whole people are less liable to make mistakes in government than select few but because they have interest which can lead them to such mistakes or to prevent their correction when made on the contrary the world has never seen an aristocracy whether comp osed of few or many powerful enough to control government who did not honestly believe that their interest was identical with the public interest and who did not act persistently in accordance with such belief and unfortunately an aristocracy of sex has not proved an exception to the rule the only method yet discovered of overcoming this tendency to the selﬁsh use of power whether consciously or unconsciously by those possessing it is the distribution of the power among all who are its subjects short of this the name free government is misnomer this principle after long strife not yet entirely ended has been practically at least very generally recognized on this side of the atlantic far relates to men but when the attempt is made to extend it to women political philosophers and practical politicians those inside of politics two classes not often found acting in concert join in denouncing it it remains to be determined whether the reasons which have produced the extension of the franchise to all adult men not equally demand its extens ion to all adult women if it be necessary men that each should have share in the administration of government his security and to exclude partiality alleged by godwin it would seem to be equally if not more necessary women on account of their inferior physical power and if is persistently alleged by those who sneer at their claims they are also inferior in mental power that fact only gives additional weight to the argument in their behalf one of the primary objects of government acknowledged on all hands is the protection of the weak against the power of the strong i can discover ground consistent with the principle on which the franchise has been given to all men upon which it can be denied to women the principal argument against such extension so far argument upon that side of the question has fallen under my observation is based upon the position that women are represented in the government by men and that their rights and interests are better protected through that indirect representation than they would be by giving them direct voice in the government the teachings of history in regard to the condition of women under the care of these constituted protectors to which i can only brieﬂy allude show the value of this the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https applied to past ages and in demonstration of its value applied to more recent times even at the risk of being tedious i will give some examples from my own professional experience i this because nothing adds more to the efﬁcacy of truth than the translation of the abstract into the concrete withholding names i will state the facts with fullness and accuracy an educated and reﬁned woman who had been many years before deserted by her drunken husband was living in small village of western new york securing by great economy and intense labor in ﬁne needle work the means of living and of supporting her two daughters at an academy the object of her life being to give them such an education would enable them to become teachers and thus secure to them some degree of independence when she could longer provide them the daughters were good scholars and favorites in the school so long the mother was able to maintain them there young man the nephew and clerk of wealthy but miserly merchant became acquainted with the daughters and was specially attentive to the older one the uncle disapproved of the conduct of his nephew and failing to control it by honorable means resorted to the circulation of the vilest slanders against mother and daughters he was man of wealth and inﬂuence they were almost unknown the mother had but recently come to the village her object having been to secure to her daug hters the educational advantages which the academy afforded poverty well perhaps an excusable if not laudable pride compel led her to live in obscurity and consequently the assault upon their characters fell upon her and her daughters with crushing force her employment mainly ceased her daughters were of necessity withdrawn from school and all were deprived of the means from their own exertions of sustaining life had they been in fact the harlots which the miser ly scoundrel represented them to be they would not have been so utterly powerless to resist his assault the mother in her despair naturally sought legal redress but how was it to be obtained by the law the wife rights were merged in those of the husband she had in law individual existence and consequently action could be broug ht by her to redress the grievous wrong indeed accor ding to the law she had suffer ed wrong but the husband had suffered all and was entitled to all the redress where he was the lady did not know she had not heard from him many years her counsel however ventured to bring an action in her behalf joining the husband name with hers the law required when the cause came to trial the defendant made attempt to sustain the charges which he had made well knowing that they were groundless they were cruel but he introduced and proved release of the cause of action signed by the husband reciting consideration of ﬁfty dollars paid to him the defendant counsel had some difﬁculty in proving the execution of the release and was compelled to introduce witness the constable who had been employed to ﬁnd the vagabond husband and obtain his signature his testimony disclosed the facts that he found the husband in the forest in one of our counties engaged in making shingles presumably stealing timber from the public lands and converting it into the means of indulging his habits of drunkenness and only ﬁve dollars of the ﬁfty mentioned in the release had in fact been paid the court held was compelled to hold that the party injured in view of the law had received full compensation the the mother and daughters with means of redress were left to starve this was the act of the representative of the wife and daughters to whom we are referred better protector of their rights than they themselves could be it may properly be added that if the action had proceeded to judgment without interference from the husband and such amount of damages had been recovered jury might have thought it proper to award the money would have belonged to the husband and the wife could not lawfully have touched cent of it her attorney might and doubtless would have paid it to her but he could only have done so at the peril of being compelled to pay it again to the drunken husband if he had demanded it in another case two ladies mother and daughter some time prior to 1860 came from an eastern county of new york to rochester where habeas corpus was obtained child of the daughter less than two years of age it appeared on the return of the writ that the mother of the child had been previously abandoned by her husband who had gone to the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https state to reside and his wife had returned with the child to her mother house and had resided there after her desertion the husband had recently returned from the west had succeeded in getting the child into his custody and was stopping over night with it in rochester on the way to his western home misconduct on the part of the wife was pretended and none on the part of the husband excepting that he had gone to the west leaving his wife and child behind cause appearing and had returned and somewhat clandestinely obtained possession of the child the judge following blackstone views of husband rights remanded the infant to the custody of the father he thought the law required it and perhaps it did but if mothers had had voice either in making or in administering the law i think the result would have been different the distress of the mother on being thus separated from her child can be better imag ined than described the separation proved ﬁnal one in less than year neither father nor mother had any child on earth to love or care whether the loss to the little one of mother love and watchfulness had any effect upon the result can not of course be known the state of the law short time since in other respects in regard to the rights of married women shows what kind of security had been provided them by their assumed representatives prior to 1848 all the personal property of every woman on marriage became the absolute property of the use of all her real estate became his during coverture and on the birth of living child it became his during his life he could squander it in dissipation or bestow it upon harlots and the wife could not touch or interfere with it prior to 1860 the husband could by will take the custody of his infant children away from the surviving mothe r and give it to whom he he could in like manner dispose of the control of the children property after his death during their minority without the mother consent in most of these respects the state of the law has under gone great changes within the last 25 years the property real and personal which woman possesses before marriage and such may be given to her during coverture remains her own and is free from the control of her husband if married woman is slandered she can prosecute in her own name the slanderer and recover to her own use damages the injury the mother now has an equal claim with the father to the custody of their minor children and in case of controversy on the subject courts may award the custody to either in their discretion the husband can not now by will effectually appoint guardian his infant children without the consent of the mother if living these are certainly great ameliorations of the law but how have they been produced mainly the result of the exertions of few heroic women one of the foremost of whom is her who stands arraigned criminal before this court thousand years the absurdities and cruelties to which i have alluded have been embedded in the common law and in the statute books and men have not touched them and would not until the end of time had they not been goaded to it by the persistent efforts of the noble women to whom i have alluded much has been done but much more remains to be done by women if they had possessed the elective franchise the reforms which have cost them quarter of century of labor would have been accomplished in year they are still subject to taxation upon their property without any voice to the levying or destination of the tax and are still subject to laws made by men which subject them to ﬁne and impriso nment the same acts which men with honor and when brought to trial woman is allowed place on the bench or in the jury box or voice in her behalf at the bar they are bound to suffer the penalty of such laws made and administered solely by men and to be silent under the inﬂiction give them the ballot and although i not suppose that any great revolution will be produced or that all political evils will be removed i am the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https believer in political panaceas but if i mistake not valuable reforms will be introduced which are not now thought of schools almshouses hospitals drinking saloons and those worse dens which are destroying the morals and the constitutions of so many of the young of both sexes will feel their inﬂuence to an extent now little dreamed of at all events women will not be taxed without an opportunity to be heard and will not be subject to ﬁne and imprisonment by laws made exclusively by men doing what it is lawful and honorable men to it may be said in answer to the argument in favor of female suffrage derived from the cases to which i have referred that men not individually but collectively are the natural and appropriate representatives of women and that notwithstanding cases of individual wrong the rights of women are on the whole best protected by being left to their care it must be observed however that the cases which i have stated and which are only types of thousands like them in their cruelty and injustice are the result of ages of legislation by these assumed protectors of women the wrongs were less in the men than in the laws which sustained them and which contained nothing the protection of the women but passing this view let us look at the matter historically and on broader ﬁeld if chinese women were allowed an equal share with men in shaping the laws of that great empire would they subject their female children to torture with bandaged feet through the whole period of childhood and growth in order that they might be cripples the residue of their lives if hindoo women could have shaped the laws of india would widows ages have been burned on the funeral pyres of their deceased husbands if jewish women had had voice in framing jewish laws would the husband at his own pleasure have been allowed to write his wife bill of divorcement and give it in her hand and send her out of his house would women in turkey or persia have made it heinous if not capital offence wife to be seen abroad with her face not covered by an impenetrable veil would women in england however learned have been ages subjected to execution offences which men who could read were only subjected to burning in the hand and few months imprisonment the principle which governs in these cases or which has done so hitherto has been at all times and everywhere the same those who succeed in obtaining power matter by what means will with rare exceptions use it their exclusive beneﬁt often perhaps generally this is done in the honest belie f that such use is the best good of all who are affected by it wrong however to those upon whom it is inﬂicted is none the less wrong by reason of the good motives of the party by whom it is inﬂicted the condition of subjection in which women have been held is the result of this principle the result of superior strength not of superior rights on the part of men superior strength combined with ignorance and selﬁshness but not with malice it is relic of the barbarism in the shadow of which nations have grown up precisely nations have receded from barbarism the severity of that subjection has been relaxed so long merely physical power governed in the affairs of the world the wrongs done to women were without the possibility of redres s or relief but since nations have come to be governed by laws there is room to hope though the process may still be slow one that injustice in all its forms or at least political injustice may be extinguished injustice can be greater than to deny to any class of citizens not guilty of crime all share in the political power of state that is all share in the choice of rulers and in the making and administration of the laws persons to which such share is denied are essentially slaves because they hold their rights if they can be said to have any subject to the will of those who hold the political power this reason it has been found necessary to give the ballot to the emancipated slaves until this was done their emancipation was far from complete without share in the political powers of the state class of citizens has the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https its rights and the history of nations to which i brieﬂy alluded shows that women constitute exception to the universality of this rule great errors i think exist in the minds of both the advocates and the opponents of this measure in their anticipation of the immediate effects to be produced by its adoption on the one hand it is supposed by some that the character of women would be radically they would be unsexed it were by clothing them with political rights and that instead of modest amiable and graceful beings we should have bold noisy and disgusting political demagogues or something worse if anything worse can be imagined i think those who entertain such opinions are in error the innate character of women is the result of god laws not of man nor can the laws of man affect that character beyond very slight degree whatever rights may be given to them and whatever duties may be charged upon them by human laws their general character will remain unchanged their modesty their delicacy and intuitive sense of propriety will never desert them into whatever new positions their added rights or duties may carry them so far women without change of character women are qualiﬁed to discharge the duties of citizenship they will dischar ge them if called upon to so and beyond that they will not go nature has put barriers in the way of any excessive devotion of women to public affairs and it is not necessa ry that nature work in that respect should be supplemented by additional barriers invented by men such ofﬁces women are qualiﬁed to ﬁll will be sought by those who not ﬁnd other employment and others they will not seek or if they will seek in vain to aid in removing far possible the disheartening difﬁculties which women dependent upon their own exertions encounter it is i think desirable that such ofﬁcial positions they can ﬁll should be thrown open to them and that they should be given the same power that men have to aid each other by their votes i would say remove all legal barriers that stand in the way of their ﬁnding employment ofﬁcial or unofﬁcial and leave them men are left to depend success upon their character and their abilities long men are allowed to act milliners with what propriety can they exclude women from the post of school commissioners when chosen to such positions by their neighbors to deny them such rights is to leave them in condition of political servitude absolute that of the african slaves before their emancipation this conclusion is readily to be deduced from the opinion of chief justice jay in the case of chisholm the state of geor gia 2 dallas although the learned chief justice had of course idea of any such application i make of his opinion the action was assumpsit by citizen of the state of south carolina and the question was whether the united states court had jurisdiction the state of geor gia declining to appear the chief justice in the course of his opinion after alluding to the feudal idea of the character of the sovereign in england and giving some of the reasons why he was not subject to suit before the courts of the kingdom says the same feudal ideas run through all their jurisprudence and constantly remind us of the distinction between the prince and the subject such ideas obtain here at the revolution the sovereignty devolved on the people and they are truly the sovereigns of the country but they are sover eigns without subjects unless the african slaves among us may be so called and have none to govern but themselves the citizens of america are equal and joint tenants in the sover eignty now i beg leave to ask in case this charge against miss anthony can be sustained what equality and what sovereignty is enjoyed by the half of the citizens of these united states to which she belongs they not in that event occupy politically exactly the position which the learned chief justice assigns to the african slaves are they not shown to be subjects of the other half who are the sovereigns and is not their political subjection absolute was that of the african slaves if that charge has any basis to rest upon the learned chief justice was wrong the sovereigns of this country according to the theory of this prosecution are not sovereigns without subjects though two or three millions the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https subjects have lately ceased to be such and have become freemen they still hold twenty millions of subjects in absolute political bondage if it be said that my language is stronger than the facts warrant i appeal to the record in this case its justiﬁcation deductions from what has been said i respectfully insist 1st that upon the principles upon which our government is based the privilege of the elective franchise can not justly be denied to women 2d that women need it their protection 3d that the welfare of both sexes will be promoted by granting it to them having occupied much more time than i intended in showing the justice and propriety of the claim made by my client to the privileges of voter i proceed to the consideration of the present state of the law on that subject it would not become however clear my own convictions may be on the subject to assert the right of women under our constitution and laws they now are to vote at presidential and congressional elections is free from doubt because very able men have expressed contrary opinions on that question and so far i am informed there has been authoritative adjudication upon it or at all events none upon which the public mind has been content to rest conclusive i proceed therefore to offer such suggestions occur to and to refer to such authorities bearing upon the question have fallen under my observation hoping to satisfy your honor not only that my client has committed criminal offense but that she has done nothing which she had not legal and constitutional right to it is not claimed that under our state constitution and the laws made in pursuance of it women are authorized to vote at elections other than those of private corporations and consequently the right of miss anthony to vote at the election in question can only be established by reference to an authority superior to and sufﬁcient to overcome the provisions of our state constitution such authority can only be found and i claim that it is found in the constitution of the united states convenience i beg leave to bring together the various provisions of that constitution which bear more or less directly upon the question article i section 2 the house of representatives shall be composed of members chosen every second year by the people of the several states and the electors in each state shall have the qualiﬁcations electors of the most numerous branch of the state legislature the same article section 3 the senate of the united states shall be composed of two senators from each state chosen by the legislature thereof six years and each senator shall have one vote article ii section 1 each state shall appoint in such manner the legislature thereof may direct number of electors equal to the whole number of senators and representatives to which the state may be entitled in the congress article iv section 2 the citizens of each state shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states same article section 4 the united states shall guarantee to every state in the union republican form of government thir teenth amendment december 18 1865 neither slavery nor involuntary servitude except punishment crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted shall exist within the united states or any place subject to their jurisdiction the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation four teenth amendment july 28 section 1 all persons born or naturalized in the united states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the united states and of the state wherein they reside state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the united states nor shall any state deprive any person of life liberty or property without due process of law nor deny to any person within its jurisd iction the equal protection of the laws section 2 representatives shall be apportioned among the several states according to their respective numbers counting the whole number of persons in each state excluding indians not taxed but when the right to vote at any election the choice of electors president and of the united states representatives in congress the executive and judicial ofﬁcers of state or the members of the legislature thereof is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such state being years of age and citizens of the united states or in any way abridged except participation in rebellion or other crime the basis of representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens years of age in such state section 5 the congress shall have power to enforce by appropriate legislation the provisions of this article fifteenth amendment section 1 the right of citizens of the united states to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the united states or by any state on account of race color or previous condition of servitude section 2 the congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation by reference to the provisions of the original constitution here recited it appears that prior to the thirteenth if not until the fourteenth amendment the whole power over the elective franchise even in the choice of federal ofﬁcers rested with the states the constitution contains deﬁnition of the term citizen either of the united states or of the several states but contents itself with the provision that the citizens of each state shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizens of the several states the states were thus left free to place such restrictions and limitations upon the privileges and immunities of citizens they saw ﬁt so far is consistent with republican form of government subject only to the condition that state could place restrictions upon the privileges or immunities of the citizens of any other state which would not be applicable to its own citizens under like circumstances it will be seen therefore that the whole subject to what should constitute the privileges and immunities of the citize n being left to the states question such we now present could have arisen under the original constitution of the united states but now by the fourteenth amendment the united states have not only declared what constitutes citizenship both in the united states and in the several states securing the rights of citizens to all persons born or naturalized in the united states but have absolutely prohibited the states from making or enforcing any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the united states by virtue of this provision i insist that the act of miss anthony in voting was the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https has never since the adoption of the fourteenth amendment been questioned and can not be questioned that women well men are included in the terms of its ﬁrst section nor that the same privileges and immunities of citizens are equally secured to both what then are the privileges and immunities of citizens of the united states which are secured against such abridgement by this section i claim that these terms not only include the right of voting public ofﬁcers but that they include that right eminently the most important of all the privileges and immunities to which the section refers among these privileges and immunities may doubtless be classed the right to life and liberty to the acquisition and enjoyment of property and to the free pursuit of one own welfare so far such pursuit does not interfere with the rights and welfare of others but what security has any one the enjoyment of these rights when denied any voice in the making of the laws or in the choice of those who make and those who administer them the possession of this voice in the making and administration of the political what gives security and value to the other rights which are merely personal not political person deprived of political rights is essentiall y slave because he holds his personal rights subject to the will of those who possess the political power this principle constitutes the very corner of our of all republican government upon that basis our separation from great britain was justiﬁed taxation without representation is tyranny this famous aphorism of james otis although sufﬁcient the occasion when it was put forth expresses but fragm ent of the principle because government can be oppressive through means of many appliances besides that of taxation the true principle is that all government over persons deprived of any voice in such government is tyranny that is the principle of the declaration of independence we were slow in allowi ng its application to the african race and have been still slower in allowing its application to women but it has been done by the fourteenth amendment rightly construed by deﬁnition of citizenship which includes women well men and in the declaration that the privileges and immunities of citizens shall not be abridged if there is any privilege of the citizen which is paramount to all others it is the right of suffrage and in constitutional provision designed to secure the most valuable rights of the citizen the declaration that the privileges and immunities of the citizen shall not be abridged must i conceive be held to secure that right before all others it is obvious when the entire language of the section is examined not only that this declaration was designed to secure to the citizen this political right but that such was its principal if not its sole object those provisions of the section which follow it being devoted to securing the personal rights of life liberty property and the equal protection of the laws the clause on which we rely to wit state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the united states might be stricken out of the section and the residue would secure to the citizen every right which is now secured excepting the political rights of voting and holding ofﬁce if the clause in question does not secur those political rights it is entirely nugatory and might well have been omitted if we go to the lexicographers and to the writers upon law to learn what are the privileges and immunities of the citizen in republican government we shall ﬁnd that the leading feature of citizenship is the enjoyment of the right of suf frage the deﬁnition of the term citizen by bouvier is one who under the constitution and laws of the united states has right to vote representatives in congress and other public ofﬁcers and who is qualiﬁed to ﬁll ofﬁces in the gift of the people by worcester an inhabitant of republic who enjoys the rights of freeman and has right to vote public ofﬁcers by webster in the united states person native or naturalized who has the privilege of exercising the elective franchise or the qualiﬁcations which enable him to vote rulers and to purchase and hold real estate the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https meaning of the word citizen is directly and plainly recognized by the latest amendment of the constitution the ﬁfteenth the right of the citizens of the united states to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the united states or by any state on account of race color or previous condition of servitude this clause assumes that the right of citizens such to vote is an existing right richard grant white in his late work on words and their uses says of the word citizen citizen is person who has certain political rights and the word is properly used only to imply or suggest the possession of these rights justice washington in the case of corﬁeld coryell 4 wash 380 speaking of the privileges and immunit ies of the citizen mentioned in sec 2 art 4 of the constitution after enumerating the personal rights mentioned above and some others embraced by those terms says to which may be added the elective franchise regulated and established by the laws or constitution of the state in which it is to be exercised at that time the states had entire control of the subject and could abridge this privilege of the citizen at its pleasure but the judge recognizes the elective franchise among the privileges and immunities secured to qualiﬁed extent to the citizens of every state by the provisions of the constitution last referred to when therefore the states were by the fourteenth amendment absolutely prohibited from abridging the privileges of the citizen either by enforcing existing laws or by the making of new laws the right of every citizen to the full exercise of this privilege against state action was absolutely secured chancellor kent and judge story both refer to the opinion of justice washington above quoted with approbation the supreme court of kentucky in the case of amy woman of color smith 1 littell 326 discussed with great ability the questions to what constituted citizenship and what were the privileges and immunities of citizens which were secured by sec 2 art 4 of the constitution and they showed by an unanswerable argument that the term citizens there used was conﬁned to those who were entitled to the enjoyment of the elective franchise and that that was among the highest of the privileges and immunities secured to the citizen by that section the court say that to be citizen it is necessary that he should be entitled to the enjoyment of these privileges and immunities upon the same terms upon which they are conferred upon other citizens and unless he is so entitled he can not in the pr oper sense of the term be citizen in the case of scott sanfor d 19 how 404 chief justice taney says the words of the united states and are synonymous terms and mean the same thing they describe the political body who accor ding to our republican institutions form the sover eignty and hold the power and conduct the government through their representatives they are what we familiarly call the sovereign people and every citizen is one of this people and constituent member of this sovereignty justice daniel in the same case 476 says upon the principles of etymology alone the term citizen derived from civitas conveys the idea of connection or identiﬁcation with the state or government and participation in its funct ions but beyond this there is not it is believed to be found in the theories of writers on government or in any actual experim ent heretofore tried an exposition of the term citizen which has not been understood conferring the actual possession and enjoyment or the perfect right of acquisition and enjoyment of an entire equality of privileges civil and political similar references might be made to an indeﬁnite extent but enough has been said to show that the term citizen in the langu age of justice daniel conveys the idea of identiﬁcation with the state or government and participation in its functions the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https question therefore the ﬁrst section of the fourteenth amendment by placing the citizenship of women upon par with that of men and declaring that the privileges and immunities of the citizen shall not be abridged has secured to women equally with men the right of suffrage unless that conclusion is overthrown by some other provision of the constitution it is not necessary the purposes of this argument to claim that this amendment prohibits state from making or enforcing any law whatever regulating the elective franchise or prescribing the conditions upon which it may be exercised but we claim that in every republic the right of suffrage in some form and to some extent is not only one of the privileges of its citizens but is the ﬁrst most obvious and most important of all the privileges they enjoy that in this respect all citizens are equal and that the effect of this amendment is to prohibit the states from enforcing any law which denies this right to any of its citizens or which imposes any restrictions upon it which are inconsistent with republican form of government within this limit it is unnecessary us to deny that the states may still regulate and control the exercise of the right the only provisions of the constitution which it can be contended conﬂict with the construction which has here been put upon the ﬁrst section of the fourteenth amendment are the ﬁfteenth amendment and the second section of the fourteenth in regard to the ﬁfteenth amendment i shall only say that if my interpretati on of the fourteenth amendment is correct there was still an object to be accomplished and which was accomplished by the ﬁfteenth the prohibition of any action abridging the privileges and immunities of citizens contained in the fourteenth amendment applies only to the states and leaves the united states government free to abridge the political privileges and immunities of citizens of the united states such at its pleasure by the ﬁfteenth amendment both the united states and the state governments are prohibi ted from exercising this power on account of race color or previous condition of servitude of the citizen the ﬁrst remark to be made upon the second section of the fourteenth amendment is that it does not give and was not designed to give to the states any power to deny or abridge the right of any citizen to exercise the elective franchise so far it touches that subject it was designed to be restrictive upon the states it gives to them power whatever it takes away power but it gives none and if the states possess the power to deny or abridge the right of citizens to vote it must be derived from some other provision of the constitution i believe none such can be found which was not necessarily abrogated by the ﬁrst section of this amendment it may be conceded that the persons who prepared this section supposed that by other parts of the constitution or in some other way the states would still be authorized notwithstanding the provisions of the ﬁrst section to deny to the citizens the privilege of voting mentioned in the second section but their mistake can not be held to add to or to take from the other provisions of the constitution it is very clear that they did not intend by this section to give to the states any such power but believing that the states possessed it they designed to hold the prospect of reduction of their representation in congress in terrorem over them to prevent them from exerc ising it they seem not to have been able to emancipate themselv es from the inﬂuence of the original constitution which conceded this power to the states or to have realized the fact that the ﬁrst section of the amendment when adopted would wholly deprive the states of that power but those who prepare constitutions are never those who adopt them and consequently the views of those who frame them have little or bearing upon their interpretation the question consideration here is what the people who through their represen tatives in the legislatures adopted the amendments understood or must be presumed to have understood from their language they must be presumed to have known that the privileges and immunities of citizens which were secured to them by the ﬁrst section beyond the power of abridgment by the states gave them the right to exercise the elective franchise and they certainly can not be presumed to have understood that the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https section which was also designed to be restrictive upon the states would be held to confer by implication power upon them which the ﬁrst section in the most express terms prohibited it has been and may be again asserted that the position which i have taken in regard to the second section is inadmissible because it renders the section nugatory that is i hold an entire mistake the leading object of the second section was the readjustment of the representation of the states in congress rendered necessary by the abolition of chattel slavery not of political slavery effected by the thirteenth amendme nt this object the section accomplishes and in this respect it remains wholly untouched by my construction of it neither i think the position tenable which has been taken by one tribunal to which the consideration of this subject was presented that the constitutional provision does not execute itself the provisions on which we rely were negative merely and were designed to nullify existing well any future state legis lation interfering with our rights this result was accomplished by the constitution itself undoubtedly before we could exercise our right it was necessary that there should be time and place appointed holding the election and proper ofﬁcers to hold it with suitable arrangements receiving and counting the votes all this was properly done by existing laws and our right being made complete by the constitution further legislation was requir ed in our behalf when the state ofﬁcers attempted to interpose between us and the the state const itution or state law whether ancient or recent abridging or denying our equal right to vote with other citizens we had but to refer to the united states constitution prohibiting the states from enforcing any such constitutional provision or law and our rights were complete we needed neither congressional nor state legislation in aid of them the opinion of justice bradley in case in the united states circuit court in new orleans 1 abb 402 would seem to be decisive of this question although the right involved in that case was not that of the elective franchise the learned justice says it was very ably contended on the part of the defendants that the fourteenth amendment was intended only to secure to all citizens equal capacities befor the law that was at ﬁrst our view of it but it does not so read the language is state shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the united states what are the privileges and immunities of citizens are they capacities merely are they not also rights senator carpenter who took part in the discussion of the fourteenth amendment in the senate and aided in its passage says the fourteenth amendment executes itself in every state of the union it is thus the will of the united states in every state and silences every state constitution usage or law which conﬂicts with it and if this provision does protect the colored citizen then it protects every citizen black or white male or female and all the privileges and immunities which i vindicate to colored citizen i vindicate to our mothers our sisters and our daughters chicago legal news vol iv it has been said with how much or how little truth i not know that the subject of securing to women the elective franchise was not considered in the preparation or in the adoption of these amendments it is wholly immaterial whether that was so or not it is never possible to arrive at the intention of the people in adopting constitutions except by referring to the language used is said by cooley the intent is to be found in the instrument itself 55 and to that i have conﬁned my remarks it is not new thing constitutional and legislative acts to have an effect beyond the anticipation of those who framed them it is undoubtedly true that in exacting magna charta from king john the barons of england provided better securities the rights of the common people than they were aware of at the time although the rights of the common people were neither forgotten nor neglected by them it has also been said perhaps with some truth that the framers of the original constitution of the united states builded better than they knew and it is quite possible that in framing the amendments under consideration the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https in doing it have accomplished much greater work than they were at the time aware of i am quite sure that it will be fortunate the country if this great question of female suffrage than which few greater were ever presented the consideration of any people shall be found almost unexpectedly to have been put at rest the opinion of justice bradley in regard to this amendment in the case before referred to if i understand it corresponds very nearly with what i have here said the learned judge in one part of his opinion says it is possible that those who framed the article were not themselves aware of the character of its terms they may have had in mind but one particular phase of social and political wrong which they desired to if the amendment framed and expressed does in fact have broader meaning and does extend its protecting shield over those who were never thought of when it was conceived and put in form and does reach such social evils which were never before prohibited by constitutional amendment it is to be presumed that the american people in giving it their imprimatur understood what they were doing and meant to decree what has in fact been done it embraces much more the and immunities secured by the original constitution were only such each state gave its own citizens each was prohibited from discriminating in favor of its own citizens and against the citizens of other states but the fourteenth amendment prohibits any state from abridging the privileges or immunities of the citizens of the united states whether its own citizens or any others it not merely requires equality of privileges but it demands that the privileges and immunities of all citizens shall be absolutely unabridged unimpair ed 1 abbott 397 it will doubtless be urged an objection to my position that citizenship carries with it the right to vote that it would in that case follow that infants and lunatics who well adults and persons of sound mind are citizens would also have that right this objection which appears to have great weight with certain classes of persons is entirely without force it takes note of the familiar fact that every legislative provision whether constitutional or statutory which confers any discr etionary power is always conﬁned in its operation to persons who are compos mentis it is wholly unnecessary to except idiots and lunatics out of any such statute they are excluded from the very nature of the case the contrary supposition would be simply absurd and in respect to every such law infants during their minority are in the same class but are women who are not infants ever included in this category does any such principle of exclusion apply to them not at all on the contrary they stand in this respect upon the same footing men with the sole exception of the right to vote and the right to hold ofﬁce in every other respect whatever rights and powers are conferred upon persons by law may be exercised by women well by men they may transact any kind of business themselves or agents or trustees others may be executors or administrators with the same powers and responsibilities men and it ought not to be matter of surprise or regret that they are now placed by the fourteenth amendment in other respects upon footing of perfect equality although not directly connected with the argument to the right secured to women by the constitution i deem it not improper to allude brieﬂy to some of the popular objections against the propriety of allowing females the privilege of voting i this because i know from past experience that these popular objections having logical bearing upon the subject are yet practically among the most potent argumen ts against the interpretation of the fourteenth amendment which i consider the only one that its language fairly admits of it is said that women not desire to vote certainly many women not but that furnishes reason denying the right to those who desire to vote many men decline to vote is that reason denying the right to those who would vote the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https believe however that the public mind is greatly in error in regard to the proportion of female citizens who would vote if their right to so were recognized in england there has been to some extent test of that question with the following result given in the newspapers the correctness of which in this respect i think there is reason to doubt woman suffrage is to certain extent established in england with the result detailed in the london examiner that in 66 municipal elections out of every women who enjoy equal rights with men on the register 516 went to the poll which is but 48 less than the proportionate number of men and out of women registered where contest occurred voted of men there were on the register and at the poll the examiner thereupon draws this conclusion allowance the reluctance of old spinsters to change their habits and the more frequent illness of the sex it is manifest that women if they had opportunity would exercise the franchise freely men there is an end therefore of the argument that women would not vote if they had the power our law books furnish perhaps more satisfactory evidence of the earnestness with which women in england are claiming the right to vote under the reform act of 1867 aided by lord brougham act of the case of chorlton appellant lings respondent came before the court of common pleas in england in it was an appeal from the decision of the revising barrister the borough of manchester to the effect that mary abbott being woman was not entitled to be placed on the register her right was perfect in all respects excepting that of sex the court after very full and able discussion of the subject sustained the decision of the revising barrister denying to women the right to be placed on the register and consequently denying their right to vote the decision rested upon the peculiar phraseology of several acts of parliament and the point decided has applicability here my object in referring to the case has been to call attention to the fact stated by the reporter that appeals of other women were consolidated and decided with this better evidence could be furnished of the extent and earnestness of the claim of women in england to exercise the elective law pleas i infer without being able to say how the fact is that the votes given by women mentioned in the newspapers were given at municipal elections merely and that the cases decided by the court of common pleas relate to elections members of parliament another objection is that the right to hold ofﬁce must attend the right to vote and that women are not qualiﬁed to dischar ge the duties of responsible ofﬁces i beg leave to answer this objection by asking one or more questions how many of the male bipeds who our voting are qualiﬁed to hold high ofﬁces how many of the large class to whom the right of voting is supposed to have been secured by the ﬁfteenth amendment are qualiﬁed to hold ofﬁce whenever the qualiﬁcations of persons to dischar ge the duties of responsible ofﬁces is made the test of their right to vote and we are to have competitive examination on that subject open to all claimants my client will be content to enter the lists and take her chances among the candidates such honors but the practice of the world and our own practice give the lie to this objection compare the administration of female sovereigns of great kingdoms from semiramis to victoria with the average administration of male sovereigns and which will suffer by the comparison how often have mothers governed large kingdoms regents during the minority of their sons and governed them well such ofﬁces the sovereigns who rule them in this country have allowed women to hold they having voice on the subject they have dischar ged the duties of with ever increasing satisfactio n to the public and congress has lately passed an act making the ofﬁcial bonds of married women valid so that they could be appointed to the ofﬁce of postmaster the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https case of olive ingraham 7 modern 263 was an action brought to try the title to an ofﬁce on the death of the sexton of the parish of butolph the place was to be ﬁlled by election the voters being the housekeepers who paid scot and lot in the parish the widow of the deceased sexton sarah bly entered the lists against olive the plaintif f in the suit and received 169 indisputable votes and 40 votes given by women who were housekeepers and paid to church and poor the plaintif f had 174 indisputable votes and 22 votes given by such women voted bly bly was declared elected the action was brought to test two questions whether women were legal voters and whether woman was capable of holding the ofﬁce the case was four times argued in the king bench and all the judges delivered opinions holding that the women were competent voters that the widow was properly elected and could hold the ofﬁce in the course of the discussion it was shown that women had held many ofﬁces those of constable church warden overseer of the poor keeper of the gate house public prison governess of house of correction keeper of castles sherif fs of counties and high constable of england if women are legally competent to hold minor ofﬁces i would be glad to have the rule of law or of propriety shown which should exclude them from higher ofﬁces and which marks the line between those which they may and those which they may not hold another objection is that women can not serve soldiers to this i answer that capacity military service has never been made test of the right to vote if it were young men from sixteen to would be entitled to vote and old men from sixty and wards would not if that were the test some women would present much strong er claims than many of the male sex another objection is that engaging in political controversies is not consistent with the feminine character upon that subject women themselves are the best judges and if political duties should be found inconsi stent with female delicacy we may rest assured that women will either effect change in the character of political contests or decline to engage in them this subject may be safely left to their sense of delicacy and propriety if any difﬁculty on this account should occur it may not be impossible to receive the votes of women at their places of residence this method of voting was practiced in ancient rome under the republic and it will be remembered that when the votes of the soldiers who were ﬁghting our battles in the southern states were needed to sustain their friends at home difﬁculty was found in the way of taking their votes at their respective camps i humbly submit to your honor therefore that on the constitutional grounds to which i have referred miss anthony had lawful right to vote that her vote was properly received and counted that the ﬁrst section of the fourteenth amendment secured to her that right and did not need the aid of any further legislation but conceding that i may be in error in supposing that miss anthony had right to vote she has been guilty of crime if she voted in good faith believing that she had such right this proposition appears to so obvious that were it not the severity to my client of the consequences which may follow conviction i should not deem it necessary to discuss it to make out the offence it is incumbent on the prosecution to show afﬁrmat ively not only that the defendant knowingly voted but that she so voted knowing that she had right to vote that is the term knowingly applies not to the fact of voting but to the fact of want of right any other interpretation of the language would be absurd we can not conceive of case where party could vote without knowledge of the fact of voting and to apply the term knowingly to the more act of voting would make nonsense of the statute this word was inserted deﬁning the essence of the offence and it limits the criminality to cases where the voting is not only without right but the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https is done wilfully with knowledge that it is without right short of that there is offence within the statute this would be so upon well established principles even if the word knowingly had been omitted but that word was inserted to prevent the possibility of doubt on the subject and to furnish security against the inability of stupid or prejudiced judges or jurors to distinguish between wilful wrong and innocent mistake if the statute had been merely that if at any election representative in congress any person shall vote without having lawful right to vote such person shall be deemed guilty of crime there could have been justly conviction under it without proof that the party voted knowing that he had not right to vote if he voted innocently supposing he had the right to vote but had not it would not be an offence within the statute an innocent mistake is not crime and amount of judicial decisions can make it such bishop says 1 cr law there can be crime unless culpable intent accompanies the criminal act the same author 1 cr prac repeated in other words the same idea in order to render party criminally responsible vicious will must concur with wrongful act i quote from more distinguished author felony is always accompanied with an evil intention and therefore shall not be imputed to mere mistake or misanimadversion where persons break open door in order to execute warrant which will not justify such proceeding affectio enim nomen imponit operi tuo item crimen non contrahitur nisi nocendi voluntas intercedat which i understand may read your volition puts the name upon your act and crime is not committed unless the will of the offender takes part in it 1 hawk p 99 ch 85 this quotation by hawkins is i believe from bracton which carries the principle back to very early period in the existence of the common law it is principle however which underlies all law and must have been recognized at all times wherever criminal law has been administered with even the slightest reference to the principles of common morality and justice i quote again on this subject from bishop the doctrine of the intent it prevails in the criminal law is necessarily one of the foundation principles of public justice there is only one criterion by which the guilt of man is to be tested it is whether the mind is criminal criminal law relates only to crime and neither in philosophical speculation nor in religious or moral sentiment would any people in any age allow that man should be deemed guilty unless his mind was so it is therefore principle of our legal system probably it is of every other that the essence of an offence is the wrongful intent without which it can not exist 1 bishop crim law again the same author writing on the subject of knowledge necessary to establish the intent says it is absolutely necessary to constitute guilt in indictments uttering forged tokens or other attempts to defraud or receiving stolen goods and offences of similar description 1 crim prac in regard to the offence of obtaining property by false pretenses the author says the indictment must allege that the defendant knew the pretenses to be false this is necessary upon the general principles of the law in order to show an offence even though the statute does not contain the word 2 id to presumed knowledge of the law where the fact involves question of law the same author says the general doctrine laid down in the foregoing sections that every man is presumed to know the law and that ignorance of the law does not excuse is plain in itself and plain in its application still there are cases the precise nature and extent of which are not so obvious wherein ignorance of the law constitutes in sort of indirect way not in itself defence but foundation on which another defence rests thus if the guilt or innocence of prisoner depends on the fact to be found by the jury of his having been or not when he did the act in some precise mental condition the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https condition is the gist of the offenc the jury in determining this question of mental condition may take into consideration his ignorance or misinformation in matter of law example to constitute larceny there must be an intent to steal which involves the knowledge that the property taken does not belong to the taker yet if all the facts concerning the title are known to the accused and so the question is one merely of law whether the property is his or not still he may show and the showing will be defence to him against the criminal proceeding that he honestly believed it his through misappr ehension of the law 1 cr law the conclusions of the writer here are correct but in part of the statement the learned author has thrown some obscurity over his own principles the doctrines elsewhere enunciated by him show with great clearness that in such cases the state of the mind constitutes the essence of the offence and if the state of the mind which the law condemns does not exist in connection with the act there is offence it is immaterial whether its be owing to ignorance of law or ignorance of fact in either case the fact which the law condemns the criminal intent is wanting it is not therefore in an indirect way that ignorance of the law in such cases constitutes defence but in the most direct way possible it is not fact which jurors may take into consideration or not at their pleasure but which they must take into consideration because in case the ignorance exists matter from what cause the offence which the statute describes is not committed in such case ignorance of the law is not interposed shield to one committing criminal act but merely to show it does show that criminal act has been committed i quote from sir mathew hale on the subject speaking of larceny the learn ed author says it is cepit and asportavit so it must be felonice or animo furandi otherwise it is not felony it is the mind that makes the taking of another good s to be felony or bare trespass only but because the intention and mind are secret the intention must be judged of by the circumstances of the fact and these circumstances are various and may sometimes deceive yet regularly and ordinarily these circumstances following direct in the case if thinking he hath title to the house of seizeth it his own this regularly makes felony but trespass only but yet this may be trick to colour felony and the ordinary discovery of felonious intent is if the party doth it secretly or being char ged with the goods denies it 1 hales p 509 i concede that if miss anthony voted knowing that woman she had right to vote she may properly be convicted and that if she had dressed herself in men apparel and assumed man name or resorted to any other artiﬁce to deceive the board of inspectors the jury might properly regard her claim of right to be merely colorable and might in their judgment pronounce her guilty of the offence charged in case the constitution has not secured to her the right she claimed all i claim is that if she voted in perfect good faith believing that it was her right she has committed crime an innocent mistake whether of law or fact though wrongful act may be done in pursuance of it can not constitute crime the following cases and authorities were referred to and commented upon by the counsel sustaining his positions conover 3 mclean 573 the state mcdonald 4 harrington 555 the state homes 17 mo 379 rex hall 3 409 14 eng the queen reed 1 306 41 eng lancaster case 3 leon 208 starkie on ev part iv vol 2 828 3d am ed the counsel then said there are some cases which i concede can not be reconc iled with the position which i have endeavoured to maintain and i am sorry to say that one of them is found in the reports of this state the other cases are referred to in that and the principle if they can be said to stand on any principle is in all of them the same it will only be incumbent on to notice that one that case is not only irreconcilable with the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https authorities and the fundamental principles of criminal law to whic h i have referred but the enormity of its injustice is sufﬁcient alone to condemn it i refer to the case of hamilton the people 57 barb 725 in that case hamilton had been convicted of misdemeanor in having voted at general election after having been previously convicted of felony and sentenced to two years imprisonment in the state prison and not having been pardoned the conviction having by law deprived him of citizenship and right to vote unless pardoned and restored to citizenship the case came up before the general term of the supre court on writ of error it appeared that on the trial evidence was offered that before the prisoner was dischar ged from the state prison he and his father applied to the governor pardon and that the governor replied in writing that on the ground of the prisoner being minor at the time of his dischar ge from prison pardon would not be necessary and that he would be entitled to all the rights of citizen on his coming of age they also applied to two respectable counsellors of the supreme court and they conﬁrmed the governor opinion all this evidence was rejected it appeared that the prisoner was seventeen years old when convicted of the felony and was nineteen when dischar ged from prison the rejection of the evidence was approved by the supreme court on the ground that the prisoner was bound to know the law and was presumed to so and his conviction was accordingly conﬁrmed here young man innocent so far his conduct in this case was invol ved was condemned acting in good faith upon the advice mistaken advice it may be conceded of one governor and two lawyers to whom he applied information to his rights and this condemnation has proceeded upon the assumed ground conceded to be false in fact that he knew the advice given to him was wrong on this judicial ﬁction the young man in the name of justice is sent to prison punished mere mistake and mistake made in pursuance of such advice it can not be consistently with the radical principles of criminal law to which i have referred and the numerous authorities which i have quoted that this man was guilty of crime that his mistake was crime and i think the judges who pronounced his condemnation upon their own principles better than their victim deserved the punishment which they inﬂicted the condemnation of miss anthony her good faith being conceded would less violence to any fair administration of justice one other matter will close what i have to say miss anthony believed and was advised that she had right to vote she may also have been advised was clearly the fact that the question to her right could not be brought before the courts trial without her voting or offering to vote and if either was criminal the one was much so the other therefore she stands now arraigned criminal taking the only steps by which it was possible to bring the great constitutional question to her right before the tribunals of the country adjudication if thus acting in the most perfect good faith with motives pure and impulses noble any which can ﬁnd place in your honor breast in the administration of justice she is by the laws of her country to be condem ned criminal she must abide the conseque nces her condemnation however under such circumstances would only add another most weighty reason to those which i have already advanced to show that women need the aid of the ballot their protection upon the remaining question of the good faith of the defendant it is not necessary to speak that she acted in the most perfect good faith stands conceded thanking your honor the great patience with which you have listened to my too extended remarks i submit the legal questions which the case involves your honor consideration the c our t addressed the jury follows gentlemen of the jury the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https have given this case such consideration i have been able to and that there might be misapprehension about my views i have made brief statement in writing the defendant is indicted under the act of congress of 1870 having voted representatives in congress in november among other things that act makes it an offence any person knowingly to vote such representatives without having right to vote it is charged that the defendant thus voted she not having right to vote because she is woman the defendant insists that she has right to vote that the provision of the constitution of this state limiting the right to vote to persons of the male sex is in violation of the 14th amendment of the constitution of the united states and is void the 13th 14th and 15th amendments were designed mainly the protection of the newly emancipated negroes but full effect must nevertheless be given to the language employed the 13th amendment provided that neither slavery nor involuntary servitude should longer exist in the united states if honestly received and fairly applied this provision would have been enough to guard the rights of the colored race in some states it was attempted to be evaded by enactm ents cruel and oppressive in their nature that colored persons were forbidden to appear in the towns except in menial capacity that they should reside on and cultivate the soil without being allowed to own it that they were not permitted to give testimony in cases where white man was party they were excluded from performing particular kinds of business proﬁtable and reputable and they were denied the right of suffrage to meet the difﬁculties arising from this state of things the 14th and 15th amendments were enacted the 14th amendment created and deﬁned citizenship of the united states it had long been contended and had been held by many learned authorities and had never been judicially decided to the contrary that there was such thing citizen of the united states except that condition arose from citizenship of some state mode existed it was said of obtaining citizenship of the united states except by ﬁrst becoming citizen of some state this question is now at rest the 14th amendment deﬁnes and declares who should be citizens of the united states to wit all persons born or naturalized in the united states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof the latter qualiﬁca tion was intended to exclude the children of foreign representatives and the like with this qualiﬁcation every person born in the united states or naturalized is declared to be citizen of the united states and of the state wherein he resides after creating and deﬁning citizenship of the united states the amendment provides that state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizen of the united states this clause is intended to be protection not to all our rights but to our rights citizens of the united states only that is the rights existing or belonging to that condition or capacity the words or citizen of state used in the previous paragraph are carefully omitted here in article 4 paragraph 2 of the constitution of the united states it had been already provided in this language viz the citizens of each state shall be entitled to all the privileg es and immunities of the citizens in the several states the rights of citizens of the states and of citizens of the united states are each guarded by these different provisions that these rights were separate and distinct was held in the slaughter house cases recently decided by the united states supreme court at washington the rights of citizens of the state such are not under consideration in the 14th amendment they stand they did before the adoption of the 14th amendment and are fully guaranteed by other provisions the rights of citizens of the states have been the subject of judicial decision on more than one occasion corﬁeld agt coryell 4 w ard agt maryland 12 w paul agt v irginia 8 w these are the fundamental privileges and immunities belonging of right to the citizens of all free governments such the right of life and liberty the right to acquire and possess property to transact business to pursue happiness in his own manner subject to such restraint the government may adjudge to be necessary the general good in cromwell agt nevada 6 wallace 36 is found statement of some of the rights of citizen of the united states viz to come to the seat of the government to assert any claim he may have upon the government to transact any business he may have with it to seek its protection to share its ofﬁces to engage in administering its functions he the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https right of free access to its seaports through which all operations of foreign commerce are conducted to the land ofﬁces and courts of justice in the several states another privilege of citizen of the united states says miller justice in the slaughter house cases is to demand the care and protection of the federal government over his life liberty and property when on the high seas or within the jurisdiction of foreign government the right to assemble and petition redress of grievances the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus he says are rights of the citizen guaranteed by the federal constitution the right of voting or the privilege of voting is right or privilege arising under the constitution of the state and not of the united states the qualiﬁcations are different in the different states citizenship age sex residence are variously required in the different states or may be so if the right belongs to any particular person it is because such person is entitled to it by the laws of the state where he offers to exercise it and not because of citizenship of the united states if the state of new york should provide that person should vote until he had reached the age of 31 years or after he had reached the age of 50 or that person having gray hair or who had not the use of all his limbs should be entitled to vote i not see how it could be held to be violation of any right derived or held under the constitution of the united states we might say that such regulations were unjust tyrannical unﬁt the regulation of an intelligent state but if rights of citizen are thereby violated they are of that fundamental class derived from his position citizen of the state and not those limited rights belonging to him citizen of the united states and such was the decision in corﬁeld agt coryell supra the united states rights appertaining to this subject are those ﬁrst under article i paragraph 2 of the united states constitution which provides that electors of representatives in congress shall have the qualiﬁcations requisite electors of the most numerous branch of the state legislature and second under the 15th amendme nt which provides that the right of citizen of the united states to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the united states or by any state on account of race color or previous condition of servitude if the legislature of the state of new york should require higher qualiﬁcation in voter representative in congress than is required voter member of assembly this would i conceive be violation of right belonging to one citizen of the united states that right is in relation to federal subject or interest and is guaranteed by the federal constitution the inability of state to abridge the right of voting on account of race color or previous condition of servitude arises from federal guaranty its violation would be the denial of federal is right belonging to the claimant citizen of the united states this right however exists by virtue of the 15th amendment if the 15th amendment had contained the word sex the argumen t of the defendant would have been potent she would have said an attempt by state to deny the right to vote because one is of particular sex is expressly prohibited by that amendment the amendment however does not contain that word it is limited to race color or previous condition of servitude the legislature of the state of new york has seen ﬁt to say that the franchise of voting shall be limited to the male sex in saying this there is in my judgment violation of the letter or of the spirit of the 14th or of the 15th amendment this view is assumed in the second section of the 14th amendment which enacts that if the right to vote federal ofﬁcers is denied by any state to any of the male inhabitants of such state except crime the basis of representation of such state shall be reduced in proportion speciﬁed not only does this section assume that the right of male inhabitants to vote was the especial object of its protection but it assumes and admits the right of state notwithstanding the existence of that clause under which the defendant claim s to the contrary to deny to classes or portions of the male inhabitants the right to vote which is allowed to other male inhabitants the regulation of the suffrage is thereby conceded to the states state right the case of myra bradwell decided at recent term of the supreme court of the united states sustains both the positions above put forth viz first that the rights referred to in the 14th amendment are those belonging to person citizen of the united states and not citizen of state and second that right of the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https here involved is not one connected with citizenship of the united states bradwell made application to be admitte d to practice an attorney and counsellor at law in the courts of illinois her application was denied and upon appeal to the supreme court of the united states it was there held that to give jurisdiction under the 14th amendment the claim must be of right pertaining to citizenship of the united states and that the claim made by her did not come within that class of cases justice bradley and justice field held that woman was not entitled to license to practice law it does not appear that the other judges passed upon that question the 14th amendment gives right to woman to vote and the voting by miss anthony was in violation of the law if she believed she had right to vote and voted in reliance upon that belief does that relieve her from the penalty it is argued that the knowledge referred to in the act relates to her knowledge of the illegality of the act and not to the act of voting it is said that she must know that she voted two principles apply here first ignorance of the law excuses one second every person is presumed to understand and to intend the necessary effects of his own acts miss anthony knew that she was woman and that the constitution of this state prohibits her from voting she intended to violate that provision to test it perhaps but certainly intended to violate it the necessary effect of her act was to violate it and this she is presumed to have intended there was ignorance of any fact but all the facts being known she undertook to settle principle in her own person she takes the risk and she can not escape the consequences it is said and authorities are cited to sustain the position that there can be crime unless there is culpable intent to render one criminally responsible vicious will must be present commits trespass on the land of b and b thinking and believing that he has right to shoot an intruder on his premises kills on the spot does b misapprehension of his rights justify his act would judge be justiﬁed in charging the jury that if satisﬁed that b supposed he had right to shoot he was justiﬁed and they should ﬁnd verdict of not guilty judge would make such charge to constitute crime it is true that there must be criminal intent but it is equally true that knowledge of the facts of the case is always held to supply this intent an intentional killing bears with it evidence of malice in law whoever without justiﬁable cause intentionally kills his neighbor is guilty of crime the principle is the same in the case before us and in all criminal cases the precise question now before has been several times decided viz that one illegally voting was bound and was assumed to know the law and that belief that he had right to vote gave defense if there was mistake of fact hamilton against the people 57th of barbour 625 state against boyet 10th of iredell 336 state against hart 6th jones 389 mcguire against state 7 humphrey 54 15th of iowa reports 404 system of criminal jurisprudence can be sustained upon any other principle assuming that miss anthony believed she had right to vote that fact constitutes defense if in truth she had not the right she voluntarily gave vote which was illegal and thus is subject to the penalty of the law upon this evidence i suppose there is question the jury and that the jury should be directed to ﬁnd verdict of guilty judge s elden i submit that on the view which your honor has taken that the right to vote and the regulation of it is solely state matter that this whole law is out of the jurisdiction of the united states courts and of congress the whole law upon that basis i understand it is not within the constitutional power of the general government but is one which applies to the states i suppose that it is the jury to determine whether the defendant is guilty of crime or not and i therefore ask your honor to submit to the jury these propositions the defendant at the time of voting believed that she had right to vote and voted in good faith in that belief she is not guilty of the of fense char ged determining the question whether she did or did not believe that she had right to vote the jury may take into consideration bearing upon that question the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https which she received from the counsel to whom she applied they may also take into consideration bearing upon the same question the fact that the inspectors considered the question and came to the conclusion that she had right to vote the jury have right to ﬁnd general verdict of guilty or not guilty they shall believe that she has or has not committed the of fense described in the statute professional friend sitting by has made this suggestion which i take leave to avail myself of bearing upon this question the court has listened many hours to an argument in order to decide whether the defendant has right to vote the arguments show the same question has engaged the best minds of the country an open question can it be possible that the defendant is to be convicted acting upon such advice she could obtain while the question is an open and undecided one the c our t you have made much better ar gument than that sir judge s elden long it is an open question i submit that she has not been guilty of an offense at all events it is the jury the c our t i can not charge these propositions of course the question gentlemen of the jury in the form it ﬁnally takes is wholly question or questions of law and i have decided question of law in the ﬁrst place that under the 14th amendme nt which miss anthony claims protects her she was not protected in right to vote and i have decided also that her belief and the advice which she took does not protect her in the act which she committed if i am right in this the result must be verdict on your part of guilty and i therefore direct that you ﬁnd verdict of guilty judge s elden that is direction court has power to make in criminal case the c our t take the verdict mr clerk the c lerk gentlemen of the jury hearken to your verdict the court has recorded it you say you ﬁnd the defendant guilty of the offense whereof she stands indicte d and so say you all judge s elden i know whether an exception is available but i certainly must except to the refusal of the court to submit those propositions and especially to the direction of the court that the jury should ﬁnd verdict of guilty i claim that it is power that is not given to any court in criminal case will the clerk poll the jury the c our t gentlemen of the jury you are dischar ged on the next day motion new trial was made by judge selden follows may it please the court the trial of this case commenced with question of very great by the constitution of the united states the right of suffrage was secured to female equally with male citizens it is likely to close with question of much greater whether the right of trial by jury is absolutely secured by the federal constitution to persons char ged with crime before the federal courts i assume without attempting to produce any authority on the subject that this court has power to grant to the defendant new trial in case it should appear that in the haste and in the lack of opportunity examination which necessarily attend jury trial any material error should have been committed prejudicial to the defendant otherwise means whatever are provided by the law the correction of such the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https defendant was indicted under the nineteenth section of the act of congress of may 31st 1870 entitled an act to enforce the right of citizens of the united states to vote in the several states of this union and other purposes and was charged with having knowingly voted without having lawful right to vote at the congressional election in the eighth ward of the city of rochester in november last the only ground of illegality being that the defendant was woman the provisions of the act of congress so far they bear upon the present case are follows section if at any election representative or delegate in the congress of the united states any person shall knowingly perso nate and vote or attempt to vote in the name of any other person whether living dead or ﬁctitious or vote more than once at the same election any candidate the same ofﬁce or vote at place where he may not be lawfully entitled to vote or vote without having lawful right to vote every such person shall be deemed guilty of crime and shall such crime be liable to prosecution in any court of the united states of competent jurisdiction and on conviction thereof shall be punished by ﬁne not exceeding 500 or by imprisonment term not exceeding three years or both in the discretion of the court and shall pay the costs of prosecution it appeared on the trial that before votin g the defendant called upon respectable lawyer and asked his opinion whether she had right to vote and he advised her that she had such right and the lawyer was examined witness in her behalf and testiﬁed that he gave her such advice and that he gave it in good faith believing that she had such right it also appeared that when she offered to vote the question whether woman she had right to vote was raised by the inspectors and considered by them in her presence and they decided that she had right to vote and received her vote accordingly it was also shown on the part of the government that on the examination of the defendant before the commissioner on whose warrant she was arrested she stated that she should have voted if allowed to vote without reference to the advice she had received from the attorney whose opinion she had asked that she was not inﬂuenced to vote by that opinion that she had before determine d to offer her vote and had doubt about her right to vote at the close of the testimony the defendant counsel proceeded to address the jury and stated that he desired to present consideration three propositions two of law and one of fact the defendant had lawful right to vote whether she had lawful right to vote or not it she honestly believed that she had that right and voted in good faith in that belief she was guilty of crime when she gave her vote she gave it in good faith believing that it was her right to so that the two ﬁrst propositions presented questions the court to decide and the last the jury when the counsel had proceeded thus far the court suggested that the counsel had better discuss in the ﬁrst place the questions of law which the counsel proceeded to and having discussed the two legal questions at length asked leave then to say few words to the jury on the question of fact the court then said to the counsel that he thought that had better be left until the views of the court upon the legal questions should be made known the district attorney thereupon addressed the court at length upon the legal questions and at the close of his argument the court delivered an opinion adverse to the positions of the defendant counsel upon both of the legal questions presented holding that the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https was not entitled to vote and that if she voted in good faith in the belief in fact that she had right to vote it would constitute grounds of the decision on the last point being that she was bound to know that by law she was not legal voter and that even if she voted in good faith in the contrary belief it constituted defense to the crime with which she was charged the decision of the court upon these questions was read from written document at the close of the reading the court said that the decision of these questions disposed of the case and left question of fact the jury and that he should therefore direct the jury to ﬁnd verdict of guilty and proceeded to say to the jury that the decision of the court had disposed of all there was in the case and that he directed them to ﬁnd verdict of guilty and he instructed the clerk to enter verdict of guilty at this point before any entry had been made by the clerk the defendant counsel asked the court to submit the case to the jury and to give to the jury the following several instructions if the defendant at the time of voting believed that she had right to vote and voted in good faith in that belief she is not guilty of the of fence char ged determining the question whether she did or did not believe that she had right to vote the jury may take into consideration bearing upon that question the advice which she received from the counsel to whom she applied they may also take into consideration bearing upon the same question the fact that the inspectors considered the question and came to the conclusion that she had right to vote the jury have right to ﬁnd general verdict of guilty or not guilty they shall believe that she has or has not been guilty of the of fense described in the statute the court declined to submit the case to the jury upon any question whatever and directed them to render verdict of guilty against the defendant the defendant counsel excepted to the decision of the court upon the legal questions to its refusal to submit the case to the jury to its refusal to give the instructions asked and to its direction to the jury to ﬁnd verdict of guilty against the counsel insisting that it was direction which court had right to give in criminal case the court then instructed the clerk to take the verdict and the clerk said gentlemen of the jury hearken to the verdict the court hath recorded it you say you ﬁnd the defendant guilty of the of fence char ged so say you all response whatever was made by the jury either by word or sign they had not consulted together in their seats or otherwise neither of them had spoken word nor had they been asked whether they had or had not agreed upon verdict the defendant counsel then asked that the clerk be requested to poll the jury the court said that can not be allowed gentlemen of the jury you are dischar ged and the jurors left the box juror spoke word during the trial from the time they were impanelled to the time of their dischar ge now i respectfully submit that in these proceedings the defendant has been substantially denied her constitutional right of trial by jury the jurors composing the panel have been merely silent spectators of the conviction of the defendant by the court they have had more share in her trial and convict ion than any other twelve members of the jury summoned to attend this court or any twelve spectators who have sat by during the trial if such course is allowable in this case it must be equally allowable in all criminal cases whether the charge be treason murder or any minor grade of offence which can come under the jurisdiction of united states court and i understand it if correct substantially abolishes the right of trial by jury the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https certainly does so in all those cases where the judge shall be of the opinion that the facts which he may regard clearly proved lead necessarily to the guilt of the defendant of course by refusing to submit any question to the jury the judge refuses to allow counsel to address the jury in the defendant behalf the constitutional provisions which i insist are violated by this proceeding are the following constitution of the united states articl 3 section 2 the trial of all crimes except in cases of impeachment shall be by jury amendments to constitution article 6 in all criminal prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right to speedy and public trial by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed which district shall have been previously ascertained by law and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation to be confronted with the witnesses against him to have compulsory process obtaining witnesses in his favor and to have the assistance of counsel his defense in accordance with these provisions i insist that in every criminal case where the party has pleaded not guilty whether upon the trial the guilt of such party appears to the judge to be clear or not the response to the question guilty or not guilty must come from the jury must be their voluntary act and can not be imposed upon them by the court opportunity has been given to consult precedents on this subject but friend has referred to an authority strongly supporting my position from which i will quote though i deem reference to precedents unnecessary to sustain the plain declarations of the constitution i refer to the case of the state shule 10 iredell 153 the substance of which is stated in 2 graham waterman on new trials page before stating that case i quote from the text of the verdict is to be the result of the deliberation of the jury upon all the evidence in the case the court has right to anticipate the verdict by an expression of opinion calculated so to inﬂuence the jury to take from them their independence of action in the state shule two defendants were indicted an affray the jury remaining out considerable time at the request of the prosecuting attorney they were sent by the court the court then charged them that although jones the other defendant had ﬁrst commenced battery upon shule yet if the jury believed the evidence the defendant shule was also guilty thereupon one of the jurors remarked that they had agreed to convict jones but were about to acquit shule the court then charged the jury again and told them that they could retire if they thought proper to so the jury consulted together few minutes in the court room the prosecuting attorney directed the clerk to enter verdict of guilty to both defendants when the clerk had entered the verdict the jury were asked to attend to it it was about to be read by the clerk the clerk then read the verdict in the hearing of the jury the jury upon being requested if any of them disagreed to the verdict to make it known by nod seemed to express their unanimous assent and juror expressed his dissent in reviewing the case the court say the error complained of is that before the jury had announced their verdict and in fact after they had intimated an intention to acquit the defendant shale the court allowed the clerk to be directed to enter verdict ﬁnding him guilty and after the verdict was so entered allowed the jury to be asked if any of them disagreed to the verdict which had been recorded by the clerk juror expressed his dissent but by nod which appeared to be made by each juror expressed their unanimous assent the innovation is that instead of permitting the jury to give their verdict the court allows verdict to be entered them such it is to be presumed the court thinks they ought to render and then they are asked if any of them disagree to it thus making verdict them unless they are bold enough to stand out against plain intimation of the opinion of the court venir novo was ordered the principal difference between this case and the one under consideration is that in the latter the court directed the clerk to enter the verdict and in the former he the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https to so and in the latter the court denied liberty to the jurors to dissent from the verdict and in the former the court allowed such dissent with what jealous care the right of trial by jury in criminal cases has been guarded by every english speaking people from the days of king john indeed from the days of king alfred is known to every lawyer and to every intelligent layman and it does not seem to that such limitation of that right is presented by the proceedings in this case can be reconciled either with constitutional provisions with the practice of courts with public sentiment on the subject or with safety in the administration of justice how the question would be regarded by the highest court of this state may fairly be gathered from its decision in the case of cancemi 18 128 where on trial murder one juror some time after the trial commenced being necessarily withdrawn stipulation was entered into signed by the and by the defendant and his counsel to the effect that the trial should proce ed before the remaining eleven jurors and that their verdict should have the same effect the verdict of full panel would have verdict of guilty having been rendered by the eleven jurors was set aside and new trial ordered by the court of appeals on the ground that the defendant could not even by his own consent be lawfully tried by less number of jurors than twelve it would seem to follow that he could not waive the entire panel and effectually consent to be tried by the court alone and still less could the court against his protest assume the duties of the jury and ef fectually pronounce the verdict of guilty or not guilty in their stead it will doubtless be insisted that there was disputed question of fact upon which the jury were required to pass in regard to that i insist that however clear and conclusive the proof of the facts might appear to be the response to the question guilty or not guilty must under the constitution come from the jury and could not be supplied by the judgment of the court unless indeed the jury should see ﬁt to render specia l verdict which they always may but can never be required to it was the province of the court to instruct the jury to the law and to point out to them how clearly the law on its view of the established facts made out the offence but it has authority to instruct them positively on any question of fact or to order them to ﬁnd any particular verdict that must be their spontaneous work but there was question of fact which constituted the very essence of the offence and one on which the jury were not only entitled to exercise but were in duty bound to exercise their independent judgment that question of fact was whether the defendant at the time when she voted knew that she had not right to vote the statute makes this knowledge the very gist of the offence without the existence of which in the mind of the voter at the time of voting there is crime there is none by the statute and none in morals the existence of this knowledge in the mind of the voter at the time of voting is under the statute necessarily fact and nothing but fact and one which the jury was bound to ﬁnd fact before they could without violating the statute ﬁnd the defendant guilty the ruling which took that question away from the jury on the ground that it was question of law and not of fact and which declared that question of law the knowledge existed was i respectfully submit most palpable error both in law and justice it was an error in law because its effect was to deny any force whatever to the most important word which the statute uses in deﬁning the he word knowingly it was also unjust because it makes the law declare known falsehood truth and then by force of that judicial falsehood condemns the defendant to such punishment she could only lawfully be subject to if the falsehood were truth i admit that it is an established legal maxim that every person judicial ofﬁcers excepted is bound and must be presumed to know the law the soundness of this maxim in all the cases to which it can properly be applied i have desire to question but it has applicability whatever to this case it applies in every case where party does an act which the law pronounces criminal whether the party knows or does not know that the law has made the act crime that maxim would have applied to this case if the defendant had voted knowing that she had legal right to vote without knowing the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https law had made the act of knowingly voting without right crime in that case she would have done the act which the law made crime and could not have shielded herself from the penalty by pleading ignorance of the law but in the present case the defendant has not done the act which the law pronounces crime the law has not made the act of voting without lawful right to vote crime where it is done by mistake and in the belief by the party voting that he has the lawful right to vote the crime consists in voting knowingly without lawful right unless the knowledge exists in fact is the very gist of the offence is wanting to hold that the law presumes conclusively that such knowledge exists in all cases where the legal right is wanting and to reject all evidence to the contrary or to deny to such evidence any effect has been done on this trial is to strike the word knowingly out of the to condemn the defendant on the legal ﬁction that she was acting in bad faith it being all the while conceded that she was in fact acting in good faith i admit that there are precedents to sustain such ruling but they can not be reconciled with the fundamental principles of criminal law nor with the most ordinary rules of justice such ruling can not but shock the moral sense of all minded unprejudiced men doubt the assumption by the defendant of belief of her right to vote might be made use of by her mere cover to secure the privilege of giving known illegal vote and of course that false assumption would constitute defence to the charge of illegal voting if the defendant had dressed herself in male attire and had voted john anthony instead of susan she would not be able to protect herself against charge of voting with knowledge that she had right to vote by asserting her belief that she had right to vote woman the artiﬁce would doubt effectually overt hrow the assertion of good faith such question however is made here the decision of which i complain concedes that the defendant voted in good faith in the most implicit belief that she had right to vote and condemns her on the strength of the legal ﬁction conceded to be in fact mere ﬁction that she knew the contrary but if the facts admitted of doubt of the defendant good faith that was question the jury and it was clear error the court to assume the decision of it again the denial of the right to poll the jury was most clearly an error under the provisions of the constitution which have been cited the defendant could only be convicted on the verdict of jury the case of cancemi shows that such jury must consist of twelve men and it will not be claimed that anything less than the unanimous voice of the jury can be received their verdict how then could the defendant be lawfully deprived of the right to ask every juror if the verdict had his assent i believe this is right which was never before denied to party against whom verdict was rendered in any case either civil or criminal the following cases show and many others might be cited to the same effect that the right to poll the jury is an absolute right in all cases civil and criminal the people perkins 1 wend jackson hawks 2 wend fox smith 3 cowen 23 the ground on which the right of the defendant to vote has been denied is i understand the decision of the court that the rights of the citizens of the state such were not under consideration in the fourteenth amendment that they stand they did before that amendment the right of voting or the privilege of voting is right or privilege arising under the constitution of the state and not of the united states if the right belongs to any particular person it is because such person is entitled to it citizen of the state where he offers to exercise it and not because of citizenship of the united states the regulation of the suf frage is conceded to the states state right if this position be correct which i am not now disposed to question i respectfu lly insist that the congress of the united states had power to pass the act in questio n that by doing so it has attempted to usurp the rights of the states and that all proceedings under the act are void i claim therefore that the defendant is entitled to new the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https she has been denied her right of trial by jury she has been denied the right to ask the jury severally whether they assented to the verdict which the court had recorded them the court erroneously held that the defendant had not lawful right to vote the court erroneously held that if the defendant when she voted did so in good faith believing that she had right to vote that fact constituted defence the court erroneously held that the question whether the defendant at the time of voting knew that she had not right to vote was question of law to be decided by the court and not question of fact to be decided by the jury the court erred in holding that it was presumption of law that the defendant knew that she was not legal voter although in fact she had not that knowledge congress had constitutional right to pass the act under which the defendant was indicted and the act and all proceedings under it are void sir so far my information in regard to legal proceedings extends this is the only court in any country where trial by jury exists in which the decisions that are made in the haste and sometimes confusion of such trials are not subject to review before any other tribunal i believe that to the decisions of this court in criminal cases review is allowed except in the same court in the informal way in which i now ask your honor to review the decisions made on this trial this is therefore the court of last resort and i hope your honor will give to these they appear to grave questions such careful and deliberate consideration is due to them from such ﬁnal tribunal if new trial shall be denied to the defendant it will be consolation to her to be dismissed with slight penalty leaving the stigma resting upon her name of conviction an offence of which she claims to be and i believe is innocent the purest of the millions of male voters who voted at the same election are innocent of crime in so voting if she is in fact guilty of the crime with which she stands charged and of which she has been convicted by the court she deserves the utmost penalty which the court under the law has power to impose if she is not guilty she should be acquitted and not declared upon the records of this high court guilty of crime she never committed the court after hearing the district attorney denied the motion judge h ordering the defendant to stand up has the prisoner anything to say why sentence shall not be pronounced miss nthony your honor i have many things to say in your ordered verdict of guilty you have trampled under foot every vital principle of our government my natural rights my civil rights my political rights my judicial rights are all alike ignored robbed of the fundamental privilege of citizenship i am degraded from the status of citizen to that of subject and not only myself individually but all of my sex are by your honor verdict doomed to political subjection under this form of government judge h court can not listen to rehearsal of arguments the prisoner counsel has already consumed three hours in presenting miss nthony it please your honor i am not arguing the question but simply stating the reasons why sentence can not in justice be pronounced against your denial of my citizen right to vote is the denial of my right of consent one of the governed the denial of my right of representation one of the taxed the denial of my right to trial by jury of my peers an offender against law therefore the denial of my sacred rights to life liberty property the project gutenberg

rights may it please the court to remember that since the day of my arrest last november this is the ﬁrst time that either myself or any person of my disfranchised class has been allowed word of defense before judge or judge h prisoner must sit court can not allow it miss nthony of my prosecutors from the 8th ward corner grocery politician who entered the complaint to the united states marshal commissioner district attorney district judge your honor on the bench not one is my peer but each and all are my political sovereigns and had your hono r submitted my case to the jury was clearly your duty even then i should have had just cause of protest not one of those men was my peer but native or foreign born white or black rich or poor educated or ignorant awake or asleep sober or drunk each and every man of them was my political superior hence in sense my peer even under such circumstances commoner of england tried before jury of lords would have far less cause to complain than should i woman tried before jury of men even my counsel the hon henry selden who has argued my cause so ably so earnestly so unanswerably before your honor is my political sovereign precisely disfranchised person is entitled to sit upon jury and woman is entitled to the franchise so none but regularly admitted lawyer is allowed to practice in the courts and woman can gain admission to the jury judge counsel must all be of the superior class judge h court must prisoner has been tried according to the established forms of law miss nthony your honor but by forms of law all made by men interpreted by men administered by men in favor of men and against women and hence your honor ordered verdict of guilty against united states citizen the exercise of that citizen right to vote simply because that citizen was woman and not man but yesterday the same man made forms of law declared it crime punishable with ﬁne and six months imprisonment you or or any of us to give cup of cold water crust of bread or night shelter to panting fugitive he was tracking his way to canada and every man or woman in whose veins coursed drop of human sympathy violated that wicked law reckless of consequences and was justiﬁed in so doing then the slaves who got their freedom must take it over or under or through the unjust forms of law precisely so now must women to get their right to voice in this government take it and i have taken mine and mean to take it at every possible opportunity judge h court orders the prisoner to sit down it will not allow another word miss nthony i was brought before your honor trial i hoped broad and liberal interpretation of the constitution and its recent amendments that shoul d declare all united states citizens under its protecting should declare

project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https registering voters persons who have right to be registered law of congress deﬁnes the qualiﬁcations of voters in the several states these are found only in the state constitutions and statutes the offenses charged in the indictment are that the defendants being state ofﬁcers have violated the laws of the state if it be so they may be tried and punished in accordance with the state laws proposition can be clearer if the united states can also punish them the same offense it follows that they may be twice indicted tried convicted and punished one offense plea in state court of conviction and sentence in united states court would constitute bar or defense 12 metcalf 387 commonwealth peters and the defendants might be punished twice the same offense this can not be and if the act in question be valid the state of new york is ousted of jurisdiction and where does congress derive the power to pass laws to punish offenders against the laws of state this case must be tried under the laws of the united states against those laws offense is charged to have been committed such power if it exist must be somewhere expressly granted or it must be necessary in order to execute some power that is expressly granted the act of congress in question became law on may 31st it is an act to enforce the right of citizens of the u nited s tates to vote in the several states and other purposes the indictment is found under the 19th section of the act it passed originally and the 20th section amended by the act of february 28th the 19th section so far it is necessary to quote it here is follows that if at any election representatives or delegates in the congr ess of the united states any person shall knowingly personate and vote or attempt to vote in the name of any other person whether living or dead or ﬁctitious or vote more than once at the same election any candidate the same ofﬁce or vote at place where he may not be entitled to vote or vote without having lawful right to vote or knowingly and wilfully receives the vote of any person not entitled to vote or refuses to receive the vote of any person entitled to vote every such person shall be deemed guilty of crime and shall such crime be liable to prosecution in any court of the united states of competent jurisdiction and on conviction thereof shall be punished by ﬁne not exceeding ﬁve hundred dollars or by imprisonment term not exceeding three years or both in the discretion of the court and shall pay the costs of prosecution section 20 amended so far pertinent reads follows that if at any registration of voters an election representatives or delegates in the congress of the united states any person shall knowingly hinder any person having lawful right to register from duly exercising that right or compel or induce by any of such means or other unlawful means any officer of registra tion to admit to registration any person not legally entitled thereto or if any such ofﬁcer shall knowingly and wilfully register voter any person not entitled to be register ed or refuse so to register any person entitled to be registered every such person shall be deemed guilty of crime and shall be liable to prosecution and punishment therefor provided in section 19 of said act of may 31 1870 persons guilty of the crimes ther ein speciﬁed law of congress describes the qualiﬁcations of voters in this state or in any state congress has provided registry law therefore what constitutes the offenses charged in this indictment must be looked in the laws of the state by act of congress can it be determined in what case person votes without having right to vote by act of congress can it be determined when an inspector of election has received the vote the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https any person not entitled to vote or has registered voter any person not entitled to be register ed these are the offenses alleged in this indictment they are penal offenses by the statutes of new york the jurisd iction of the state courts over them is complete and can not be questioned by the act of may 31 1870 above cited congress has ordained in legal effect that if any person violates the penal code of the state of new york or any state in respect of voting he may be punished by the united states and the offense is variable quantity what is crime in one state under this act is legal right and duty in another citizen of rhode island instance who votes when not possessed in his own right of an estate in fee fee tail life or in reversion or remainder of the value of 134 or may be convicted of crime under this act and imprisoned in state prison he voted in violation of the laws of his state citizen of new york votes under precisely similar circumstances and with the same qualiﬁcations and his act is legal one and he performs simple duty any state may by its constitution and laws permit women to vote had these defendants been acting inspectors of elections in such state their act would be crime and this indictment could not be sustained the only illegality alleged is that the citizens whose votes were received were women and therefore not entitled to vote the act of congress thus is simply an act to enforce the diverse penal statutes of the various states in relation to voting in order to make case the united states must combine the federal law with the statutes of the state where the venue of the prosecution is laid before the enactment of the 13th 14th and 15th amendments it is not and never was pretended that congress possessed any such power subdivision 1 of section 2 of article one of the constitution provides follows the house of representatives shall be composed of members chosen every second year by the people of the several states and the electors in each state shall have the qualiﬁcations requisite electors of the most numerous branch of the state legislature by this provision what shall qualify person to be an elector is left entirely to the states whoever in any state is permitted to vote members of the most numerous branch of its legislature is also competent to vote representatives in congress the state might require property qualiﬁcation or it might dispense with it it might permit negroes to vote or it might exclude them it might permit women to vote or even foreigners and the federal constitution would not be infringed if state had provided different qualiﬁcation an elector of representatives in congress from that required of an elector of the most numerous branch of its legislature the power of the federal constitution might be invoked and the law annuled but never was the idea entertained that this provision of the constitutio n authorizes congress to pass laws the punishment of individuals in the states illegal voting or state returning ofﬁcers receiving illegal votes this power if it exist must be found in the recent amendments to the constitution i assume that your honor will hold you did yesterday in miss anthony case that these amendments not confer the right to vote upon citizens of the united states and therefore not upon women that decisi on is the law of this case it follows necessarily from that decision that these amendme nts have nothing to with the right of voting except so far that right is denied or abridged by the united states or by any state on account of race color or pr evious condition of servitude the thirteenth article of the amendme nts to the constitution of the united states in section 1 ordains that neither slavery nor involuntary servitude except punishment crime wher eof the party shall have been duly convicted shall exist within the united states or any place subject to their jurisdiction the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https 2 ordains that congr ess shall have power to enfor ce this article by appropriate legislation the fourteenth article of the amendments to the constitution of the united states ordains in section 1 all persons born or naturalized in the united states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the united states and of the state wher they reside state shall make or enfor ce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the united states nor shall any state deprive any person of life liberty or property without due process of law nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal pr otection of the section ﬁve enacts the congr ess shall have power to enfor ce by appropriate legislation the pr ovisions of this the ﬁfteenth article of amendment to the constitution ordains in its ﬁrst section that that the right of citizens of the united states to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the united states or by any state on account of race color or previous condition of servitude section two enacts that the congr ess shall have power to enfor ce this article by appropriate these are the provisions of the constitution relied on to support the legislation of congress now before this court some features of that legislation may be constitutional and valid whether this be so or not it is not necessary now to determine the question here is has congress by either of these amendments been clothed with the power to pass laws to punish inspectors of elections in this state receiving the votes of women the thirteenth amendment simply abolishes slavery and authorizes such legislation shall be necessary to make that enactment ef fectual the power in question is not found there the fourteenth amendment deﬁnes who are citizens of the united states and prohibits the states from making or enforcing any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of such citizens either the right to vote is one of the privileges or immunities of the united states citizen which the states are forbidden to abridge or it is not if it is then the women whose votes these defendants received being citizens of the united states and in every other way qualiﬁed to vote possessed the right to vote and their votes were rightfully received if it is not then the fourteenth amendment confers power upon congress to legislate on the subject of voting in the states there is other clause or provision of that amendment which can by any possibility confer such power which can not be implied but which if it exist must be expressly given in some part of the constitution or clearly needed to carry into ef fect some power that is expressly given such power is conferred by the ﬁfteenth amendment that amendment operates upon the states and upon the united states and not upon the citizen the right of citizens of the united states to vote shall not be denied or abridged by u nited s tates or by any state the terms united states and state here used mean the government of the united states and of the states they not apply to individuals or to offenses committed by individuals but only to acts done by the state or the united states but at any rate the operation of this amendment and the power given to congress to enforce it is limited to offenses committed in respect of depriving persons of the right to vote because of their race color or pr evious condition of servitude this is not such case there is ground saying that these defenda nts have committed any offense against the spirit or the letter of the ﬁfteenth amendment or any legitimate legislation its the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https can not make laws to regulate the duties of inspectors and it can not inﬂict penalty second offense is stated in the indictment the ﬁrst count in the indictment is knowingly and wilfully registering voter susan anthony this count is under section 26 of the act of may 31 1870 amended by the act of february 28 the indictment contains averment that the defendants were ofﬁcers of registration and charged with the duty of making correct registry of voters it simply alleges that they were inspectors of elections what that means the indictment does not inform us it is not an ofﬁce deﬁned by the acts of congress upon which this indictment was found nor has the court any information of which it can take notice to what are the duties of such ofﬁcers in the absence of any claim in the indictment to that effect the court will not presume the existence of so important circumstance against the defendants and therefore this count of the indictment must fail the second count is the same offense and obnoxious to the same objec tion the only variation being that the ﬁrst count charges the illegal registry of one woma n and the second fourteen the third count charges that the defen dants being inspectors of elections received the votes of fourteen women who had right to vote wrongfully this count does not allege that it was the duty of the defendants to receive or count the votes it simply alleges that they were inspectors of election their duties such are not stated it is not alleged that such inspectors they were charged with the duty of receiving and counting votes it is not claimed by the indictment that these votes were counted or put into the ballot affected the result the defendants simply received the votes what they did with them does not appear any bystander who had received these votes could be convicted

just before the ﬁrst meeting of the the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https what is your age i am did you hear the statement of mr jones i did to save time i will ask you whether that was substantially correct you understand it yes sir now i will ask you the question if in registering and receiving these votes you believed that the law required you to it and you acted conscientiously and honestly objected to the c our t put the question you did to the other in receiving these votes he acted honestly and according to the best of his judgment by v an v oorhis answer that question please i most assuredly did this witness was not william s torrs witness sworn in behalf of the defendants testiﬁed follows examined by v an v oorhis where you reside city of rochester what ofﬁce you hold united states commissioner how long have you held that ofﬁce fifteen years you know these defendants jones and marsh i sir was any application made to you by any person at any time warrant against them this of fence objected to v an v oorhis if the counsel objects i will not insist upon the evidence this witness was not susan nthony called witness in behalf of the defendants miss nthony i would like to know if the testimony of person who has been convicted of crime can be taken the c our t they call you witness madam the witness having been duly afﬁrmed testiﬁed follows examined by v an v oorhis the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https miss anthony i want you to state what occurred at the board of registry when your name was registered that would be very tedious it was full an hour state generally what was done or what occupied that hour time objected to well was the question of your right to be registered subject of discussion there it was by and between whom between the supervisors the inspectors and myself state if you please what occurred when you presented yourself at the polls on election day mr hall decidedly c rowley i submit to the court that unless the counsel expects to change the version given by the other witnesses it is not necessary to take up time the c our t matter of discretion i see how it will be of any beneﬁt it was fully related by the others and doubtless correctly c rowley it is not disputed the w itness i would like to say if i might be allowed by the court that the general impression that i swore i was male citizen is an erroneous one by v an v oorhis you took the two oaths there did you yes sir by the c our t you presented yourself female claiming that you had right to vote i presented myself not female at all sir i presented myself citizen of the united states i was called to the united states ballot box by the 14th amendment not female but citizen and i went there v an v oorhis we have number of witnesses to prove what occurred at the time of registry and what advice was given by these federal supervisors but under your honor ruling it is not necessary us to call them inasmuch hall is absent i ask permission to put in his evidence he gave it before the commissioners c rowley i have not read it your honor but i am willing they should use so much of it is competent under your honor ruling the c our t will it change the case at all mr van voorhis v an v oorhis it only varies it little to hall he stated that he depended in consenting to the registry upon the advice of warner who was his friend and upon whom he looked political father the c our t i think you have all the question that any evidence could give you in the case these men have sworn that they acted honestly and in accordance with their best judgment now if that is defense you have it and it will not make it any stronger to multiply the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https v an v oorhis i suppose it will be conceded that hall stands in the same position to his motives c rowley yes we have evidence to of fer upon that question at all evidence closed van voorhis addressed the court at some length follows may it please the court i submit that there is ground whatever to charge these defendants with any criminal of fense because the women who voted were legal voters because they were challenged and took the oaths which the statute requires of electors and the inspectors had right after such oath to reject their votes 1 edmonds the duty of inspectors of election is deﬁned by the statute follows if any person offering to vote at any election shall be challenged in relation to his right to vote at that election by an inspector or by any other person entitled to vote at the same poll one of the inspectors shall tender to him the following preliminary oath swear or afﬁrm that you will truly and fully answer all such questions shall be put to you touching your place of residence and qualiﬁcations an elector the inspectors or one of them shall then proceed to question the person challenged in relation to his name his then place of residence how long he has resided in the town or ward where the vote is offered what was the last place of his residence before he came into that town or ward and also to his citizenship and whether native or naturalized citizen and if the latter when where and in what court or before what ofﬁcer he was naturalized whether he came into the town or ward the purpose of voting at that election how long he contemplates residing in the town or ward and all such other questions may tend to test his qualiﬁcations resident of the town or ward citizenship and right to vote at that poll if any person shall refuse to take the said preliminary oath when so tendered or to answer fully any questions which shall be so put to him his vote shall be rejected after receiving the answers of the person so challenged the board of inspectors shall point out to him the qualiﬁcations if any in respect to which he shall appear to them deﬁcient if the person so offering shall persist in his claim to vote and the challenge shall not be withdrawn one of the inspectors shall then administer the following oath swear or afﬁrm the case may be that you have been citizen of the united states ten days and are now of the age of twenty one years that you have been an inhabitant of this state one year next preceding this election and the last four months resident of this county that you have been thirty days next preceding this election resident of this assembly district or senate or congressional district or districts ward town village or city from which the ofﬁcer is to be chosen whom said person offers to vote that you are now resident of this town or ward the case may be and of the election district in which you now offer to vote and that you have not made any bet or wager the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https are not directly or indirectly interested in any bet or wager depending upon the result of this election and that you have not voted at this election prescribes the form of oath to be administered to colored men if any person shall refuse to take the oath so tendered his vote shall be rejected the defendants performed their duty strictly and fully according to the statute the persons offering to vote were challenged the defendants administered the preliminary oath to them all the questions required by the statute were answered fully and truly the challenge was still insisted on the general oath was administered by the defendants to them they took that oath and every word contained in it was true in their case the inspectors had alternative they could not reject the votes this statute has been construed by the court of appeals of this state in the case of the people pease 27 in that case it is held that inspectors of election have authority by statute to reject vote except in three cases 1 after refusal to take the preliminary oath or 2 fully to answer any questions put or 3 on refusal to take the general oath davies in his opinion after an examination of the provisions of the statute says it is seen therefore that the inspectors have authority by statute to reject vote except in the three cases after refusal to take the preliminary oath or fully to answer any questions put or on refusal to take the general oath and the only judicial discr etion vested in them is to determine whether any question put to the person offering to vote has or has not been fully answer ed if the questions put have been fully answer ed and such answers discover the fact that the person offering to vote is not qualiﬁed voter yet if he persists in his claim to vote it is imperative upon the inspectors to administer to him the general oath and if taken to receive the vote and deposit the same in the ballot selden who wrote in the same case examines this question with great care and reaches the same conclusion he says the course required by the statute to be pursued where the right of any person to vote is challenged can not be reconciled with any discretionary power of rejection vested in the inspectors citing the statute above quoted the inspectors are ﬁrst to administer what is called the preliminary oath requiring the person offering the vote to answer such questions shall be put to him touching his place of residence and qualiﬁcations an elector the statut then mentions several questions which are to be addressed to him by the inspectors and authorizes such other questions may tend to test his qualiﬁcations voter if he refuse to take the oath or to answer fully his vote is to be rejected but if he answers fully the inspectors are required to point out to him the qualiﬁcations if any in which he shall appear to them to be deﬁcient if he still persists in his right to vote and the challenge is not withdrawn the inspectors are required to administer to him the general oath in which he states in detail and swears that he possesses all the qualiﬁcations the constitution and laws require the voter to possess if he refuse to take the oath his vote shall be rejected is not the inference irresistible that if he take the oath it shall be received if his vote is to be rejected after he takes the oath why not reject it before i construe the statute the inspectors have discr etion left them in such case where the person offering to vote is not shown by record to have been convicted of crime or by the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https oath to be interested in bet upon the election but must deposit the ballot in the box whatever they may believe or know of the want of qualiﬁcations of the voter they are requir ed to act upon the evidence which the statute prescribes and have judicial power to pass upon the question of its truth or falsehood nor can they act upon their own opinion or these views were concurred in by all the judges denio who wrote dissenting opinion in the case concurred with the other judges to the powers and duties of inspectors the defendants then have not in the least violated any law of the state of new york they performed their duty according to the statute and in accordance with the decision of the highest court of the state and in accordance with the printed instructions furnished them by the secretary of state what further can be demanded of them united states statute prescribes or attempts to prescri be their duties they can not legally be convicted and should be dischar ged because malice is shown whether the women were entitled to have their names registered and to vote or not the defen dants believed they had such right and acted in good faith according to their best judgment in allowing the registry of their in receiving their whether they decided right or wrong in point of law they are not guilty of any criminal of fense the substance of the statute is to registration if any such ofﬁcer shall knowingly and wilfully register voter any person not entitled to be registered or refuse to so register any person entitled to be registered every such person shall be deemed guilty of crime act of may 31 1870 20 amended by act of 28 1871 and to voting if any person shall knowingly and wilfully receive the vote of any person not entitled to vote or refuse to receive the vote of any person entitled to vote every such person shall be deemed guilty of crime act of may 31 1870 to bring an inspector within either of these sections he must know matter of fact that the person of fering to vote or to be registered is not entitled to be registered or to vote the inspectors were compelled to decide the question and to decide it instantly with chance examination or even if they decided in good faith according to the best of their ability they are excused whether they decided correctly or not in point of law this is too well settled to admit of by authority well by the plainest principles of justice and common sense the law never yet placed public ofﬁcer in position where he would be compelled to decide doubtful legal question and to act upon his decision subject to the penalty of ﬁne or imprisonment if he chanced to err in his decision all that is ever required of an ofﬁcer so placed whether judicial or ministerial ofﬁcer so far is necessary to escape any imputations of crime is good faith ministerial ofﬁcers may be required in some cases to act at their peril to civil responsibilities but to criminal r esponsibilities never the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https of elections however acting in good faith incur neither civil nor criminal responsibilities in jenkins waldron 11 john 114 which was an action on the case against inspectors of election refusing to receive the vote of the plaintif f duly qualiﬁed voter it was held that the action would not lie without proving malice spencer delivering the opinion of the court closes follows it would in our opinion be opposed to all the principles of law justice and sound policy to hold that ofﬁcers called upon to exercise their deliberate judgments are answerable mistake in law either civilly or criminally where their motives are pure and untainted with fraud or malice the same point precisely was decided in like case in the supreme court of this state recently and jenkins w aldron appr oved goetchens mathewson 5 lansing in harman tappenden and ﬁfteen others 1 east 555 the plaintif f was freeman of the company of free ﬁshermen and dredger men of the manor and hundred of faversham in kent and the defendants ofﬁcers of the company caused him wrongfully unlawfully and unjustly to be disfranchised and removed from his said ofﬁce of freeman he was restored by mandamus and brought his action on the case against the defendants who removed him to recover his damages on the trial before lord kenyon verdict was taken the plaintif f nominal damages with leave to the defendant to move to enter on that motion lord kenyon said have you any precedent to show that an action of this sort will lie without proof of malice in the defendants or that the act of disfranchisement was done on purpose to deprive the plaintif f of the particular advantage which resulted to him from his corporate character i believe this is case of the ﬁrst impression where an action of this kind had been brought upon mer mistake or err or in judgment the plaintif f had broken which he had incurred certain penalties and happening to be personally present in the court he was called upon to show cause why he should not pay the forfeitures to which not making any answer but refusing to pay them the court proceeded taking the of fense pro confesso without any proof to call on him to show cause why he should not be disfranchised and they accordingly made the order this was undoubtedly irregular but it was nothing more than mistake and there was ground to impute any malicious motives to the persons making the order lawrence said there is instance of an action of this sort maintained an act merely from error of judgment perhaps the action might have been maintained if it had been proved that the defendants contriving and intending to injure and prejudice the plaintif f and to deprive him of the beneﬁt of his proﬁts from the ﬁshery which member of this body he was entitled to according to the custom had wilfully and maliciously procured him to be disfranchised in consequence of which he was deprived of such proﬁts but here there was evidence of any wilful and malicious intention to deprive the plaintif f of his proﬁts or that they had disfranchised him with that intent which is necessary to maintain this action they were indeed guilty of an error in their proceedings to disfranchise him in not going into any proof of the offence charged against him but taking his silence confession in the case of drewe coulton where the action was against the mayor of saltash who was returning ofﬁcer refusing the plaintif f vote at an election which was claimed in right of burgage tenement wilson nonsuited the plaintif f because malice was not proved and he observed the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https lord holt in the case of ashby white endeavored to show that the action lay the obstruction of the right yet the house of lords in the justiﬁcation of their conduct supposed to be written by the chief justice puts it upon different principle the wilfulness of the act the declaration in that case was copied from the prece dent in milwar d sargeant which came on in this court on writ of error hill 26 geo 3 refusing the plaintif f vote the borough of hastings there the charge was the defendant contriving and wrongfully intending to injure and prejudice the plaintif f and to hinder and deprive him of his privilege of voting did not take or allow his vote all which allegations justice wilson in the case above alluded to thought were essential to be proved in order to sustain the action per curiam rule dischar ged the reporter head note is an action does not lie against individuals acts erroneously done by them in corporate capacity from which detriment has happened to the plaintif at least not without proof of malice the case of drewe coulton is given at length in note to harman tappenden and others 1 east 563 and fully sustains what is said of it by mr justice lawrence the election was member to serve in parliament the borough of saltash the defendant was mayor and returning ofﬁcer the question presented to him was whether the owners of burgage tenements in the borough had right of voting or whether that right was conﬁned to the freemen of the corporation the defendant had rejected the vote of fered by the plaintif f he claiming the right bur gage tenant the action was that refusal charging the defendant with contriving and wrongfully intending to deprive the plaintif f obstructed and hindered him from giving his vote wilson among other things says this is in the nature of it an action misbehavior by public ofﬁcer in his duty now i think that it can not be called misbehavior unless maliciously and wilfully done and that the action will not lie mistake in law the case of the bridge master is in point bul it is there said that an action on the case lies against ministerial ofﬁcer wilful misbehavior denying poll one who is candidate an elective ofﬁce such bridge master in all the cases put the misbehavior must be wilful and by wilful i understand contrary to man own conviction therefore i think from the opening of counsel this is not wilful refusal of the vote in very few instances is an ofﬁcer answerable what he does to the best of his judgment in cases where he is compelled to act but the action lies where the ofﬁcer has an option whether he will act or not besides i think that if an action were to be brought upon every occasion of this kind by every person whose vote was refused it would be such an inconvenience the law would not endure returning ofﬁcer in such case would be in most perilous situation this gentleman was put in situation wher he was bound to act and if he acted to the best of his judgment it would be great hardship that he should be answerable the consequences even though he is mistak en in point of law it was very material observation of gibbs that the words of the resolution of the house of lords in ashby white followed the words of the statute of william iii if that statute were declaratory of the common law it purports to be it enacted and declared that all false returns wilfully made and an action would not lie at common law false return unless the return be proved to have been made maliciously well falsely it should seem by parity of reasoning that person whose vote is refused by returning ofﬁcer can not maintain an action against him the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https refusal be proved to have been wilful and malicious and if malice were necessary before the statute by the common law and since by the statute which is declaratory thereof to sustain an action false return which includes perhaps the votes of all it seems equally necessary in an action like the present where the injury complained of is to one only i not mean to say that in this kind of action it is necessary to prove express malice it is sufﬁcient if malice may be implied from the conduct of the ofﬁcer if he had decided contrary to last resolution of the house of commons there i should leave it to the jury to imply malice but taking all the circumstances of this case together malice can in shape be imputed to the defendant the plaintiff may have right to vote but that depends upon an intricate question of law with respect to burgage tenur es the right itself founded on ancient documents and usages and not acted upon many years from these grounds therefore it can not be inferr ed that the defendant has acted wilfully and maliciously in refusing the plaintiff vote and unless that be so he is not liable in this action but without determining whether the statute be declaratory of the common law or not if not the case rests on that of ashby white now all the debates and arguments in that case go upon the malice and all those who have acted on that determination since have considered that the refusal must be wilful and malicious in order to support the action and in my opinion it can not be said that because an ofﬁcer is mistaken in point of law this action will lie against him it has also been said that this is not like case where burdensome ofﬁce is thrown upon man without his consent wherein he is compellable to act that here the defendant has chosen to become member of corporation by which he had put himself in situation to become returning ofﬁcer and therefore that he is bound to understand the whole law far it relates to his public situation and is answerable any determination he may make contrary to that law but i much doubt whether that rule be generally true and in the present instance i am clearly of opinion that the want of malice is full defense lawrence sat with wilson the plaintif f was nonsuited and new trial was moved bernar diston some 2 lev 114 1 east 586 note b was an action against the sherif f of suffolk charging that the defendant intending to deprive him of the ofﬁce of knight of the shire made double return upon trial at bar twysden rainsford and wylie js held and so directed the jury that if the return was made maliciously they ought to ﬁnd the plaintif f which they did and gave him on motion in arrest of judgment hale being in court he twysden wylie js held that much the return was laid to be falso et malitiose et ea intentione to put the plaintif f to charge and expense and so found by the jury the action lay rainsford doubted but notwithstanding this charge of malice judgment was reversed in cam scacc vide 3 lev 30 and that judgment of reversal was afﬁrmed in parliament lord chief justice north ﬁrst reason against the action was because the sherif f to declaring the mayoralty is judge and action will lie against judge what he does judicially though it should be laid falso malitiose et scienter this reversal occasioned the passage of the statute 7 and 8 iii 7 which gives an action against the returning ofﬁcer all false returns wilfully made and double returns falsely wilfully and maliciously made groenvelt burwell al 1 salk 396 2 ld ray 230 comyns 76 in this case the censors of the college of physicians and surgeons in london were empo wered the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https govern and censure all practice s of physic in to punish by ﬁne and imprisonment they convicted the plaintif f of administering noxious medicines and ﬁned him and imprisonment 12 months being taken in execution he brought trespass against the censors it was held that the censors had judicial power that being judges of the matter what they had adjudged was not traversable that the plaintif f could not be permitted to gainsay what the censors had said by their judgment the medicines were noxious though the medicines were really good yet action lies against the censors because it is wrong judgment in matter within the limits of their jurisdiction and judge is not answerable either to the king or the party the mistakes or errors of his judgment in matter of which he has jurisdiction it would expose the justice of the nation and man would execute the ofﬁce upon peril of being arraigned by action or indictment every judgment he pr onounces all that i have quoted from the english cases and our own to show that malice must be proven to make out the offense is expressly contained in the statute under which this indictment is framed the words are sec 19 shall knowingly and wilfully receive the vote of any person not entitled to vote and section 20 amended if any such ofﬁcer shall knowingly and wilfully register voter any person not entitled to vote and wilfully means to use the language of justice wilson contrary to man own conviction if it be said that the defendants must be presumed to know the law that is answered above by the quotations from the opinion of mr justice wilson besides when the statute speaks of knowledge aside from the expression wilfully it means knowledge any forced presumption of knowledge against the clear facts of the case to this extent and to this extent only does the presumption that defendants were bound to know the law go viz they were boun d to know that if they fact knowingly and wilfully registered voter any person not entitled to be registered or knowingly and wilfully received the vote of any person not entitled to vote in either case they were liable to the penalty and they could not be allowed to urge in their defense any ignorance that the law made those facts criminal here is total absence of any pretenc of malice the defendants acted honestly and according to their best judgment this is conceded the most that can be said against them is that they have erred in judgment they are not lawyers nor skilled in the law they had presented to them legal question which to say the least has puzzled some of the ablest legal minds of the nation the penalty is the same on which ever side they err if they can be convicted of crime test must be imposed upon them which judge in the land could stand the defendants should be dischar ged by this court crowley then rose to make his ar gument when the court said the c our t i think it is necessary you to spend time in argument crowley i think upon the last authority cited by the counsel there is defense in this case it is entirely clear that where there is distinct judicial act the party performing the judicial act is not responsible civilly or criminally unless corruption is proven and in many cases not when corruption is proven but where the act is not judicial in its where there is there is legal protection that is the law laid down in the authority last quoted and the authority quoted by judge selden in his opinion it is undoubtedly good law they hold expressly in that case that the inspectors are administrative ofﬁcers and not judicial the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https this is the point in the case in my view of it if there was any case in which female was entitled to vote then it would be subject of examination if female over the age of 21 was entitled to vote then it would be within the judicial authority of the inspectors to examine and determine whether in the given case the female came within that provision if married woman was entitled to vote or if married woman was not entitled to vote and single woman was entitled to vote i think the inspecto rs would have right in case before them to judge upon the evidence whether the person before them was married or single if they decided erroneously their judicial character would protect them but under the law of this state it stands under circumstances is woman entitled to vote when miss anthony leyden and the other ladies came there and presented themselves registry and presented themselves to offer their votes when it appeared that they were they were of the female power and authority of the inspectors was at an end when they act upon subject upon which they have discretion i think there is judicial authority there is large range of discretion in regard to the votes offered by the male sex if man offers his vote there is question whether he is he is 21 years of age the subject is within their jurisdiction if they decide correctly it is well if they decide erroneously they act judicially and are not liable if the question is whether the person presenting his vote is foreigner or naturalized or whether he has been resident of the state or district sufﬁcient length of time the subject is all within their jurisdiction and they have right to decide and are protected if they decide wrong but upon the view which has been taken of this question of the right of females to vote by the united states court at washington and by the adjudication which was made this morning upon this subject there is discretion and therefore i must hold that it affords protection in that view of the case is there anything to go to the jury v an v oorhis yes your honor the c our t what v an v oorhis the jury must pass upon the whole case and particularly to whether any ballots were received representative in congress or candidates representative in congress and whether the defendants acted wilfully and maliciously the c our t it is too plain to ar gue that v an v oorhis there is nothing but circumstantial evidence the c our t your own witness testiﬁed to it v an v oorhis but knowingly your honor implies knowing that it is vote representative in congress the c our t that comes within the decision of the question of law i see that there is anything to go to the jury v an v oorhis i can not take your honor view of the case but of course must submit to it we ask to go to the jury upon this whole case and claim that in this case in all criminal cases the right of trial by jury is made inviolate by the the court has power to take it from the jury the c our t i am going to submit it to the jury gentlemen of the jury this case is now before you upon the evidence it stands and i shall leave the case with you to v an v oorhis i claim the right to address the jury the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https c our t i think there is anything upon which you can legitimately address the jury gentlemen the defendants are charged with knowingly willfully and wrongfully receiving the votes of the ladies whose names are mentioned in november last in the city of rochester they are charged in the same indictment with willfully and improperly registering those ladies i decided in the case this morning which many of you heard probably that under the law it stands the ladies who offered their votes had right to vote whatever i repeat that decision and i charge you that they had right to offer their votes they having right to offer their votes the inspectors of election ought not to receive them the additional question exists in this case whether the fact that they acted inspectors will relieve them from the charge in this case you have heard the views which i have given upon that i think they are administrative ofﬁcers i charge you that they are administrative and ministerial ofﬁcers in this respect that they are not judicial ofﬁcers whose action protects them and that therefore they are liable in this case but instead of doing i did in the case this submit the case to you with these instructions and you can decide it here or you may go out v an v oorhis i ask your honor to instruct the jury that if they ﬁnd these inspectors acted honestly in accordance with their best judgment they should be acquitted the c our t i have expressly ruled to the contrary of that gentlemen that that makes difference v an v oorhis and that in this the laws of this the c our t that is need not ar gue it mr van voorhis v an v oorhis then i ask your honor to charge the jury that they must ﬁnd the fact that these inspectors received the votes of these persons knowingly and that such votes were votes some person member of congress there being in the case evidence that any man was voted member of congress and there being evidence except that secret ballots were received that the jury have right to ﬁnd the defendants if they choose the c our t i charge the jury that there is sufﬁcient evidence to sustain the indictment upon this point v an v oorhis i ask your honor also to charge the jury that there is sufﬁcient evidence to sustain verdict of not guilty the c our t i can not char ge that v an v oorhis then why should it go to the jury the c our t matter of form v an v oorhis if the jury should ﬁnd verdict of not guilty could your honor set it aside the c our t i will debate that with you when the occasion arises gentlemen you may deliberate here or retire you choose the jury retired consultation and the court took recess until 7 p the court at 7 when the clerk called the jury and asked them if they had agreed upon their verdict the foreman replied in the negative whereupon the court said the c our t is there anything upon which i can give you any advice gentlemen or any information the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https j uror we stand 1 1 conviction and 1 opposed the c our t if that gentleman desires to ask any questions in respect to the questions of law or the facts in the case i will give him any information he desires response from the jury it is quite proper if any gentleman has any doubt about anything either to the law or the facts that he should state it to the court counsel are both present and i can give such information is correct j uror i wish to ask any questions the c our t then you may retire again gentlemen the court will adjourn until morrow morning the jury retired and after an absence of about ten minutes returned into court the clerk called the names of the jury and then said the c lerk gentlemen have you agreed upon your verdict the f oreman we have the c lerk how say you you ﬁnd the prisoners at the bar guilty of the offense whereof they stand indicted or not guilty the f oreman guilty the c lerk hearken to your verdict it stands recorded by the court you say you ﬁnd the prisoners at the bar guilty of the offense whereof they stand indicted and so say you all v an v oorhis i ask that the jury be polled the clerk polled the jury each juror answering in the afﬁrmative to the question is this your verdict on the next day june 19 1873 the counsel the defendants john van voorhis made motion to the court new trial in behalf of beverly jones edwin marsh and william hall the argument was oral and is not given but the following are the grounds of the motion the indictment contains sufﬁcient statement of any crime under the acts of congress upon which it is framed the court has jurisdiction of the subject matter of the of fense it was an error which new trial should be granted to refuse the defendants the fundamental right to address the jury through their counsel this is right guaranteed by the united states constitution see article vi of the amendments to the constitution 1 graham w aterman on new t rials pages 682 683 and 684 the defendants were substantially deprived of the right of jury trial the instructions of the court to the jury were imperative they were equivalent to direction to ﬁnd verdict of guilty it was said by the court in the hearing of the jury that the case was submitted to the jury matter of form the jury was not at liberty to exercise its own judgment upon the evidence and witho ut committing gross discourtesy to the court could render verdict except that of guilty admitting that the defendants acted without malice or any corrupt motive and in accordance with their best judgments and in perfect good faith it was error to charge that that was defense the defendants are admitted to have acted in accordance with their duty deﬁned by the laws of new york 1 edmond pp sections 13 14 15 16 17 18 and 19 construed by the court of appeals people pease 27 45 the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https are administrative ofﬁcers and bound to regard only the evidence which the statute prescribes they are not clothed with the power to reject the vote of person who has furnished the evidence which the law requires of right to vote on what they or either of them might know to the truth or falsity of such evidences they have discretion and must perform their duty it is deﬁned by the laws of new york and the decisions of her courts the defendant william hall has been tried and convicted in his absence from the court this is an error fatal to the conviction in his case the court denied the motion the court then asked the defendants if they had anything to say why sentence should not be pronounced in response to which beverly jones said your honor has pronounced guilty of crime the jury had but little to with it in the performance of my duties an inspector of election which position i have held the last four years i acted conscientiously faithfully and according to the best of my judgment and ability i did not believe that i had right to reject the ballot of citizen who offered to vote and who took the preliminary and general oaths and answered all questions prescribed by law the instructions furnished by the state authorities declared that i had such right far the registry of the names is concerned they would never have been placed upon the registry if it had not been daniel warner the democratic federal supervisor of elections appointed by this court who not only advised the registry but addressed us saying men you know the penalty of the law if you refuse to register these names and after dischar ging my duties faithfully and honestly and to the best of my ability if it is to vindicate the law that i am to be imprisoned i willingly submit to the penalty and edwin marsh said in october

board miss anthony and other women presented themselves and claimed the right to be registered so far i knew the question of woman suffrage had never come up in that shape before we were in position where we could take middle course decide which way we might we were liable to prosecution we devoted all the time to acquiring information on the subject that our duties registrars would allow we were expected it seems to make an infallible decision inside of two days of question in regard to which some of the best minds of the country are divided the inﬂuences by which we were surrounde d were nearly all in unison with the course we took i believed then and believe now that we acted lawfully i faithfully dischar ged the duties of my ofﬁce according to the best of my ability in strict

monroe and of ontario in her canvass of those counties prior to her trial in june friends and i stand before you under indictment the alleged crime of having voted at the last presidential election without having lawful right to vote it shall be my work this evening to prove to you that in thus voting i not only committed crime but instead simp ly exercised my citizen right guaranteed to and all united states citizens by the national constitution beyond the power of any state to deny our government is based on the idea of the natural right of every individual member thereof to voice and vote in making and executing the laws we assert the province of government to be to secure the people in the enjoymen t of their unalienable rights we throw to the winds the old dogma that governments can give rights before governments were organized one denies that each individual possessed the right to protect his own life liberty and property and when 100 or 0 people enter into free government they not barter away their natural rights they simply pledge themselves to protect each other in the enjoyment of them through prescribed judicial and legislative tribunals they agree to abandon the methods of brute force in the adjustment of their dif ferences and adopt those of civilization nor can you ﬁnd word in any of the grand documents left us by the fathers that assumes government the power to create or to confer rights the declaration of independence the united states constitution the const itutions of the several states and the organic laws of the territories all alike propose to protect the people in the exercise of their rights not one of them pretends to bestow rights all men are created equal and endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that to secure these governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed here is shadow of government authority over rights nor exclusion of any class from their full and equal enjoyment here is pronounced the right of all men and consequently the quaker preacher said of all women to voice in the government and here in this very ﬁrst paragraph of the declaration is the assertion of the natural right of all to the ballot how can the consent of the governed be given if the right to vote be denied again that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it and to institute new government laying its foundations on such principles and organizing its powers in such forms to them shall seem most likely to ef fect their safety and happiness surely the right of the whole people to vote is here clearly implied however destructive to their happiness this gover nment might become disfranchised class could neither alter nor abolish it nor institute new one except by the old brute force method of insurrection and rebellion of the people of this nation are the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https to blot from the statute books an unjust law or to write there new and just one the women dissatisﬁed they are with this form of government that enforces taxation without representation compels them to obey laws to which they have never given their consent imprisons and hangs them without trial by jury of their peers that robs them in marriage of the custody of their own persons wages and children this half of the people left wholly at the mercy of the other half in direct violation of the spirit and letter of the declarations of the framers of this government every one of which was based on the immutable principle of equal rights to all by those declarations kings priests popes aristocrats were all alike dethroned and placed on common level politically with the lowliest born subject or serf by them too men such were deprived of their divine right to rule and placed on political level with women by the practice of those declarations all class and caste distinction will be abolished and slave serf plebeian wife woman all alike bound from their subject position to the proud platform of equality the preamble of the federal constitution says we the people of the united states in order to form more perfect union establish justice insure domestic tranquility provide the common defence promote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity ordain and establish this constitution the united states of america it was we the people not we the white male citizens nor yet we the male citizens but we the whole people who formed this union and we formed it not to give the blessings of liberty but to secure them not to the half of ourselves and the half of our posterity but to the whole en well men and it is downright mockery to talk to women of their enjoyment of the blessings of liberty while they are denied the use of the only means of securing them provided by this ballot the early journals of congress show that when the committee reported to that body the original articles of confederation the very ﬁrst article which became the subject of discussion was that respecting equality of suf frage article 4th said the better to secure and perpetuate mutual friendship and intercourse between the people of the different states of this union the free inhabitants of each of the states paupers vagabonds and fugitives from justice excepted shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of the free citizens of the several states thus at the very beginning did the fathers see the necessity of the universal application of the great principle of equal rights to order to produce the desired harmonious union and homogeneous people luther martin of maryland in his report to the legislature of that state of the convention that framed the united states constitution said those who advocated the equality of suffrage took the matter up on the original principles of government that the reason why each individual man in forming state government should have an equal vote is because each individual before he enters into government is equally free and equally independent james madison said under every view of the subject it seems indispensable that the mass of the citizens should not be without voice in making the laws which they are to obey and in choosing the magistrates who are to administer them also let it be remembered ﬁnally that it has ever been the pride and the the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https america that the rights which she contended were the rights of human nature and these assertions of the framers of the united states constitution of the equal and natural rights of all the people to voice in the government have been afﬁrmed and reafﬁrmed by the leading statesmen of the nation throughout the entire history of our government thaddeus stevens of pennsylvania said in 1866 i have made up my mind that the elective franchise is one of the inalienable rights meant to be secured by the declaration of independence gratz brown of missouri in the three days discussion in the united states senate in 1866 on senator cowan motion to strike male from the district of columbia suffrage bill said president i say here on the ﬂoor of the american senate i stand universal suffrage and matter of fundamental principle not recognize the right of society to limit it on any ground of race or sex i will go farther and say that i recognize the right of franchise being intrinsically natural right i not believe that society is authorized to impose any limitations upon it that not spring out of the necessities of the social state itself sir i have been shocked in the course of this debate to hear senators declare this right only conventional and political arrangement privilege yielded to you and and others not right in any sense only concession president i not hold my liberties by any such tenure on the contrary i believe that whenever you establish that doctrine whenever you crystalize that idea in the public mind of this country you ring the of american liberties charles sumner in his brave protests against the fourteenth and ﬁfteenth amendments insisted that so soon by the thirteenth amendment the slaves became free men the original powers of the united states constitution guaranteed to them equal right to vote and to be voted in closing one of his great speeches he said i not hesitate to say that when the slaves of our country became they took their place in the body politic component part of the entitled to equal rights and under the protection of these two guardian principles all just governments stand on the consent of the governed and second that taxation without representation is tyranny and these rights it is the duty of congress to guarantee essential to the idea of republic the preamble of the constitution of the state of new york declares the same purpose it says we the people of the state of new york grateful to almighty god our freedom in order to secure its blessings establish this constitution here is not the slightest intimation either of receiving freedom from the united states constitution or of the state conferring the blessings of liberty upon the people and the same is true of every one of the state constitutions each and all alike declare rights and that to secure the people in the enjoyment of their inalienable rights is their one and only object in ordaining and establishing government and all of the state constitutions are equally emphatic in their recognition of the ballot the means of securing the people in the enjoyment of these rights article 1 of the new york state constitution says member of this state shall be disfra nchised or deprived of the rights or privileges secured to any citizen thereo f unless by the law of the land the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https judgment of his peers and so carefully guarded is the citizen right to vote that the constitution makes special mention of all who may be excluded it says laws may be passed excluding from the right of suffrage all persons who have been or may be convicted of bribery larceny or any infamous crime in naming the various employments that shall not affect the residence of 3d section of article 2d says that being kept at any alms house or other asylum at public expense nor being conﬁned at any public prison shall deprive person of his residence and hence his vote thus is the right of voting most sacredly hedged about the only seeming permission in the new york state constitution the disfranchisement of women is in section 1st of article 2d which says every male citizen of the age of years shall be entitled to vote but i submit that in view of the explicit assertions of the equal right of the whole people both in the preamble and previous article of the constitution this omissio n of the adjective female in the second shou ld not be construed into denial but instead counted of effect mark the direct prohibition member of this state shall be disfranchised unless by the of the land or the judgment of his peers the law of the land is the united states constitution and there is provision in that document that can be fairly construed into permission to the states to deprive any class of their citizens of their right to vote hence new york can get power from that source to disfranchise one entire half of her members nor has the judgment of their peers been pronounced against women exercising their right to vote disfranchised person is allowed to be judge or none but disfranchised persons can be women peers nor has the legislature passed laws excluding them on account of idiocy or lunacy nor yet the courts convicted them of bribery larceny or any infamous crime clearly then there is constitutional ground the exclusion of women from the in the state of new york barriers whatever stand between women and the exercise of their right to vote save those of precedent and prejudice the clauses of the united states constitution cited by our opponents giving power to the states to disfranchise any classes of citizens they shall please are contained in sections 2d and 4th of article 1st the second says the house of representatives shall be composed of members chosen every second year by the people of the several states and the electors in each state shall have the qualiﬁcations requisite electors of the most numerous branch of the state legislature this can not be construed into concession to the states of the power to destroy the right to become an elector but simply to prescribe what shall be the qualiﬁcations such competency of intellect maturity of age length of residence that shall be deemed necessary to enable them to make an intelligent choice of candidates if our opponents assert the last clause of this section makes it the duty of the united states to protect citizens in the several states against higher or different qualiﬁcations electors representatives in congress than members of assembly then must the ﬁrst clause make it equally imperative the national government to interfere with the states and forbid them from arbitrarily cutting off the right of of the people to become electors altogether section 4th says the times places and manner of holding elections senators and representatives shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof but congress may at any time by law make or alter such regulations except to the places of choosing senators the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https is conceded the power only to prescribe times places and manner of holding the elections and even with these congress may interfere with all excepting the mere place of choosing senators thus you see there is not the slightest permission in either section the states to discriminate against the right of any class of citizens to vote surely to regulate can not be to annihilate nor to qualify to wholly deprive and to this principle every true democrat and republican said amen when applied to black men by senator sumner in his great speeches equal rights to all from 1865 to 1869 and when in 1871 i asked that senator to declare the power of the united states constitution to protect women in their right to he had done black handed copy of all his speeches during that reconstruction period and said miss anthony put where i have or and you have here the best and strongest argument i can make woman there is not doubt but women have the constitutional right to vote and i will never vote sixteenth amendment to guarantee it to them i voted both the fourteenth and ﬁfteenth under protest would never have done it but the pressing emer gency of that hour would have insisted that the power of the original constitution to protect all citizens in the equal enjoyment of their rights should have been vindicated through the courts but the newly made freedmen had neither the intelligence wealth nor time to wait that slow process women possess all these in an eminent degree and i insist that they shall appeal to the courts and through them establish the powers of our american magna charta to protect every citizen of the repu blic but friends when in accordance with senator summer counsel i went to the last november and exercised my citizen right to vote the courts did not wait to appeal to appealed to and indicted on the char ge of having voted illegally senator sumner putting sex where he did color said qualiﬁcations can not be in their nature permanent or insurmountable sex can not be qualiﬁcation any more than size race color or previous condition of servitude permanent or insurmountable qualiﬁcation is equivalent to deprivation of the suffrage in other words it is the tyranny of taxation without representation against which our revolutionary mothers well fathers rebelled any state to make sex qualiﬁcatio n that must ever result in the disfranchis ement of one entire half of the people is to pass bill of attainder or an ex post facto law and is therefore violation of the supreme law of the land by it the blessings of liberty are forever withheld from women and their female posterity to them this government has just powers derived from the consent of the governed to them this governm ent is not democracy it is not republic it is an odious aristocracy hateful obligarchy of sex the most hateful aristocracy ever established on the face of the globe an obligarchy of wealth where the rich govern the poor an obligarchy of learning where the educated govern the ignorant or even an obligarchy of race where the saxon rules the african might be endured but this obligarchy of sex which makes father brothers husband sons the obligarchs over the mother and sisters the wife and daughters of every household which ordains all men sovereigns all women subjects carries dissension discord and rebellion into every home of the nation and this most odious aristocracy exists too in the face of section 4 of article 4 which says the united states shall guarantee to every state in the union republican form of government what i ask you is the distinctive difference between the inhabitants of monarchical and those of republican form of govern ment save that in the monarchical the people are subjects helpless powerless bound to obey laws made by in the republican the people are citizens individual sovereigns all clothed with equal power to make and unmake both their laws and law makers and the moment you deprive the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https his right to voice in the government you degrade him from the status of citizen of the republic to that of subject and it matters very little to him whether his monarch be an individual tyrant is the czar of russia or headed monster here in the united states he is powerless subject serf or slave not free and independent citizen in any sense but it is urged the use of the masculine pronouns he his and him in all the constitutions and laws is proof that only men were meant to be included in their provisions if you insist on this version of the letter of the law we shall insist that you be consistent and accept the other horn of the dilemma which would compel you to exempt women from taxation the support of the government and from penalties the violation of laws year and half ago i was at walla walla washington territory i saw there theatrical company called the pixley sisters playing before crowded houses every night of the whole week of the territorial fair the eldest of those three fatherless girls was scarce eighteen yet every night united states ofﬁcer stretched out his long ﬁngers and clutched six dollars of the proceeds of the exhibitions of those orphan girls who but few years before were half starvelings in the streets of olympia the capital of that territory so the poor wido w who keeps boarding house manufactures shirts or sells apples and peanuts on the street corners of our cities is compelled to pay taxes from her scanty pittance i would that the women of this republic at once resolve never again to submit to taxation until their right to vote be recognized miss sarah wall of worcester twenty years ago took this position several years the ofﬁcers of the law distrained her property and sold it to meet the necessary amount still she persisted and would not yield an iota though every foot of her lands should be struck off under the hammer and now several years the assesso r has left her name of f the tax list and the collector passed her by without call weeden of viroqua the past six years has refused to pay her taxes though the annual assessment is 75 ellen van valkenbur g of santa cruz who sued the county clerk refusing to register her name declares she will never pay another dollar of tax until allowed to vote and all over the country women property holders are waking up to the injustice of taxation without representation and ere long will refuse en masse to submit to the imposition there is she or her or hers in the tax laws the statute of new york reads every person shall be assessed in the town or ward where he resides when the assessment is made the lands owned by him every collector shall call at least once on the perso n taxed or at his usual place of residence and shall demand payment of the taxes charged on him if any one shall refuse to pay the tax imposed on him the collector shall levy the same by distress and sale of his property the same is true of all the criminal laws person shall be compelled to be witness against himself the same with the law of may 31st 1870 the 19th section of which i am charged with having violated not only are all the pronouns in it masculine but everybody knows that that particular section was intended expressly to hinder the rebels from voting it reads if any person shall knowingly vote without his having lawful right precisely so with all the papers served on marshal warrant the the petition habeas corpus the bill of ot one of them had feminine pronoun printed in it but to make them applicable to the clerk of the court made little carat at the left of he and placed an s over it thus making she out of he then the letters is the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https out the little carat under and er over to make her out of his and i insist if government ofﬁcials may thus manipulate the pronouns to tax ﬁne imprison and hang women women may take the same liberty with them to secure to themselves their right to voice in the government so long any classes of men were denied their right to vote the government made show of consistency by exempting them from taxation when property qualiﬁcation of 250 was required of black men in new york they were not compelled to pay taxes so long they were content to report them selves worth less than that sum but the moment the black man died and his property fell to his widow or daughter the black woman name would be put on the assessor list and she be compelled to pay taxes on the same property exempted to her husband the same is true of ministers in new york so long the minister lives he is exempted from taxation on of property but the moment the breath goes out of his body his widow name will go down on the assessor list and she will have to pay taxes on the so much the special legislation in favor of women in all the penalties and burdens of the government except the military women are reckoned citizens equally with men also in all the privileges and immunities save those of the jury box and ballot box the two fundamental privileges on which rest all the others the united states government not only taxes ﬁnes imprisons and hang s women but it allows them to lands register ships and take out passport and naturalization papers not only does the law permit single women and widows to the right of naturalization but section 2 says married woman may be naturalized without the concurrence of her husband i wonder the fathers were not afraid of creating discord in the families of foreigners and again when an alien having complied with the law and declared his intention to become citizen dies before he is actually natura lized his widow and children shall be considered citizens entitled to all rights and privileges such on taking the required oath if foreign born woman by becoming naturalized citizen is entitled to all the rights and privileges of citizenship is not native born woman by her national citizenship possessed of equal rights and privileges the question of the masculine pronou ns yes and nouns too has been settled by the united states supreme court in the case of silver versus ladd december 1868 in decision to whether woman was entitled to lands under the oregon donati on law of elizabeth cruthers widow settled upon claim and received patents she died and her son was heir he died then ladd nott took possession under the general law december the administrator silver applied writ of ejectment at the land ofﬁce in oregon city both the register and receiver decided that an unmarried woman could not hold land under that law the commissioner of the general land ofﬁce at washington and the secretary of the interior also gave adverse opinions here patents were issued to ladd nott and duly recorded then suit was brought to set aside ladd patent and it was carried through all the state courts and the supreme court of oregon each in turn giving adverse decisions at last in the united states supreme court associate justice miller reversed the decisions of all the lower tribunals and ordered the land back to the heirs of cruthers the court said in construing benevolent statute of the government made the beneﬁt of its own citizens inviting and encouraging them to settle on its distant public lands the words man and man may especially if aided by the context and other parts of the statute be taken in generic sense held accordingly that the fourth section of the act of congress of september 27th 1850 granting by way of donation lands in oregon territory to every white settler or occupant american indians included embraced within the term single man an unmarried woman and the attorney who carried this question to its ﬁnal success is now the united states senator elect from oregon hon mitchell in whom the cause of equal rights to women has an added power on the ﬂoor of the united states the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https the words persons people inhabitants electors citizens are all used indiscriminately in the national and state constitutions there was always conﬂict of opinion prior to the war to whether they were synonymous terms instance person shall be representative who shall not have been seven years citizen and who shall not when elected be an inhabitant of that state in which he is chosen person shall be senator who shall not have been citizen of the united states and an inhabitant of that state in which he is chosen but whatever room there was doubt under the old regime the adoption of the fourteenth amendment settled that question forever in its ﬁrst sentence all persons born or naturalized in the united states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the united states and of the state wherein they reside and the second settles the equal status of all citizens state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens nor shall any state deprive any person of life liberty or property without due proces s of law nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws the only question left to be settled now is are women persons and i hardl y believe any of our opponents will have the hardihood to say they are not being perso ns then women are citizens and state has right to make any new law or to enforce any old law that shall abridge their privileges or immunities hence every discrimination against women in the constitutions and laws of the several states is null and void precisely is every one against negroes is the right to vote one of the privileges or immunities of citizens i think the disfranchised and the prisoners will all agree with that it is not only one of them but the one without which all the others are nothing seek ﬁrst the kingdom of the ballot and all things else shall be given thee is the political injunction webster worcester and bouvier all deﬁne citizen to be person in the united states entitled to vote and hold ofﬁce prior to the adoption of the thirteenth amendment by which slavery was forever abolished and black men transformed from property to persons the judicial opinions of the country had always been in harmony with these deﬁnitions to be person was to be citizen and to be citizen was to be voter associate justice washington in deﬁning the privileges and immunities of the citizen more than ﬁfty years ago said they included all such privileges were fundamental in their nature and among them is the right to exercise the elective franchise and to hold ofﬁce even the dred scott decision pronounced by the abolitionists and republicans infamous because it virtually declared black men had rights white men were bound to respect gave this true and logical conclusion that to be one of the people was to be citizen and voter chief judge daniels said there is not it is believed to be found in the theories of writers on government or in any actual experiment heretofore tried an exposition of the term citizen which has not been considered conferring the actual possession and enjoyment of the perfec t right of acquisition and enjoyment of an entire equality of privileges civil and political associate justice taney the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https the words of the united states and are synonymous terms and mean the same thing they both describe the political body who according to our republican institutions form the sovereignty and who hold the power and conduct the government through their representatives they are what we familiarly call the sovereign people and every citizen is one of this people and constituent member of this sovereignty thus does judge taney decision which was such terrible ban to the black man while he was slave now that he is person longer property pronounce him citizen possessed of an entire equality of privileges civil and political and not only the black man but the black woman and all women well and it was not until after the abolition of slavery by which the negroes became free men hence citizens that the united states attorney general bates rendered contrary opinion he said the constitution uses the word only to express the political quality not equality mark of the individual in his relation to the nation to declare that he is member of the body politic and bound to it by the reciprocal obligations of allegiance on the one side and protection on the other the phrase citizen of the united states without addition or qualiﬁcation means neither more nor less than member of the nation then to be citizen of this republic is more than to be subject of an empire you and i and all true and patriotic citizens must repudiate this base conclusion we all know that american citizenship without addition or qualiﬁcation means the possession of equal rights civil and political we all know that the crowning glory of every citizen of the united states is that he can either give or withhold his vote from every law and every legislator under the government did i am roman citizen mean nothing more than that i am member of the body politic of the republic of rome bound to it by the reciprocal obligations of allegiance on the one side and protection on the other ridiculously absurd question you say when you young man shall travel abroad among the monarchies of the old world and there proudly boast yourself an american citizen will you thereby declare yourself neither more nor less than member of the american nation and this opinion of attorney general bates that black citizen was not voter made merely to suit the political exigency of the republican party in that transition hour between emancipation and enfranchisement was less infamous in spirit or purpose than was the decision of judge taney that black man was not one of the people rendered in the interest and at the behest of the old democratic party in its darke st hour of subjection to the slave power nevertheless all of the adverse arguments adverse congressional reports and judicial opinions thus far have been based on this purely partisan opinion of general bates that the normal condition of the citizen of the united states is that of disfranchis ement that only such classes of citizens have had special legislative guarantee have legal right to vote and if this decision of attorney general bates was infamous against black men but yesterday plantation slaves what shall we pronounce upon judge bingham in the house of representatives and carpenter in the senate of the united states citing it against the women of the entire nation vast numbers of whom are the peers of those honorable gentlemen themselves in morals intellect culture wealth taxes on large estates and contributing equally with them and their sex in every direction to the growth prosperity and of the republic and what shall be said of the judicial opinions of judges carter jameson mckay and sharswood all based upon this aristocratic monarchial idea of the right of one class to govern another i am proud to mention the names of the two united states judges who have given opinions honorable to our republican idea and honorable to howe the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https territory and judge underwood of virginia the former gave it his opinion year ago when the legislature seemed likely to revoke the law enfranchising the women of that territory that in case they succeeded the women would still possess the right to vote under the fourteenth amendment judge underwood of virginia in noticing the recent decision of judge carter of the supreme court of the district of columbia denying to women the right to vote under the fourteenth and ﬁfteenth amendment says if the people of the united states by amendment of their constitution could expunge without any explanatory or assisting legislation an adjective of ﬁve letters from all state and local constitutions and thereby raise millions of our most ignorant to all of the rights and privileges of electors why should not the same people by the same amendment expunge an adjective of four letters from the same state and local constitutions and thereby raise other millions of more educated and better informed citizens to equal rights and privileges without explanatory or assisting legislation if the fourteenth amendment does not secure to all citizens the right to rote what purpose was that grand old charter of the fathers lumbered with its unwieldy proportions the republican party and judges howard and bingham who drafted the document pretended it was to something black men and if that something was not to secure them in their right to vote and hold ofﬁce what could it have been by the thirteenth amendment black men had become people and hence were entitled to all the privileges and immunities of the government precisely were the women of the country and foreign men not naturalized according to associate justice washington they already had the protection of the government the enjoyment of life and liberty with the right to acquire and possess property of every kind and to pursue and obtain happiness and safety subject to such restraints the government may justly prescribe the general welfare of the whole the right of citizen of one state to pass through or to reside in any other state the purpose of trade agriculture professional pursuit or otherwise to claim the beneﬁt of the writ of habeas corpus to institute and maintain actions of any kind in the courts of the state to take hold and dispose of property either real or personal and an exemption from higher taxes or impositions than are paid by the other citizens of the state thus you see those newly freed men were in possession of every possible right privilege and immunity of the governme nt except that of suffrage and hence needed constitutional amendment any other purpose what right i ask you has the irishman the day after he receives his naturalization papers that he did not possess the day before save the right to vote and hold ofﬁce and the chinamen now crowding our paciﬁc coast are in precisely the same position what privilege or immunity has california or oregon the constitutional right to deny them save that of the ballot clearly then if the fourteenth amendment was not to secur to black men their right to vote it did nothing them since they possessed everyt hing else before but if it was meant to be prohibition of the states to deny or abridge their right to i fully then it did the same all persons white women included born or naturalized in the united states the amendment does not say all male persons of african descent but all persons are citizens the second section is simply threat to punish the states by reducing their representation on the ﬂoor of congress should they disfranchise any of their male citizens on account of color and does not allow of the inference that the states may disfranchise from any or all other causes nor in any wise weaken or invalidate the universal guarantee of the ﬁrst section what rule of law or logic woul d allow the conclusion that the prohibition of the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https to one person on severe pains and penalties was sanction of that crime to any and all other persons save that one but however much the doctors of the law may disagree to whether people and citizens in the original constitution were one and the same or whether the privileges and immunities in the fourteenth amendment include the right of suffrage the question of the citizen right to vote is settled forever by the ﬁfteenth amendment the citizen right to vote shall not be denied by the united states nor any state thereof on account of race color or previous condition of servitude how can the state deny or abridge the right of the citizen if the citizen does not possess it there is escape from the conclusion that to vote is the citizen right and the speciﬁcations of race color or previous condition of servitude can in way impair the force of the emphatic assertion that the citizen right to vote shall not be denied or abridged the political strategy of the second section of the fourteenth amendment failing to coerce the rebel states into enfranchising their negroes and the necessities of the republican party demanding their votes throughout the south to ensure the of grant in 1872 that party was compelled to place this positive prohibition of the ﬁfteenth amendment upon the united states and all the states thereof if we once establish the false principle that united states citizenship does not carry with it the right to vote in every state in this union there is end to the petty freaks and cunning devices that will be resorted to to exclude one and another class of citizens from the right of suf frage it will not always be men combining to disfranchise all women native born men combining to abridge the rights of all naturalized citizens in rhode island it will not always be the rich and educated who may combine to cut off the poor and ignorant but we may live to see the poor hardworki ng uncultivated day laborers foreign and native born learning the power of the ballot and their vast majority of numbers combine and amend state constitutions so to disfranchise the vanderbilts and stew arts the conklings and fentons it is poor rule that wo work more ways than one establish this precedent admit the right to deny suffrage to the states and there is power to foresee the confusion discord and disruption that may await us there is and can be but one safe principle of rights to all and any and every discrimination against any class whether on account of color race nativity sex property culture can but imbitter and disaf fect that class and thereby endanger the safety of the whole people clearly then the national government must not only deﬁne the rights of citizens but it must stretch out its powerful hand and protect them in every state in this union but if you will insist that the ﬁfteenth amendment emphatic interdiction agains t robbing united states citizens of their right to vote on account of race color or previous condition of servitude is recognition of the right either of the united states or any state to rob citizens of that right any or all other reasons i will prove to you that the class of citizens which i now plead and to which i belong may be and are by all the principles of our government and many of the laws of the states included under the term previous condition of servitude married women and their legal status what is servitude the condition of slave what is slave person who is robbed of the proceeds of his labor person who is subject to the will of another by the law of geor gia south carolina and all the states of the south the negro had right to the custody and control of his person he belonged to his master if he was disobedient the master had the right to use correction if the negro did like the correction and attempted to run away the master had right to use coercion to bring him back by the law of every state in this union north well south the married woman has right to the custody and control of her person the wife belongs to the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https and if she refuses obedience to his will he may use moderate correction and if she does like his moderate correction and attempts to leave his bed and board the husband may use moderate coercion to bring her back the little word moderate you see is the saving clause the wife and would doubtless be overstepped should her offended husband administer his correction with the or accomplish his coercion with again the slave had right to the earnings of his hands they belonged to his master right to the custody of his children they belonged to his master right to sue or be sued or testify in the courts if he committed crime it was the master who must sue or be sued in many of the states there has been special legislation giving to married women the right to property inherited or received by bequest or earned by the pursuit of any avocation outside of the home also giving her the right to sue and be sued in matters pertaining to such separate property but not single state of this union has ever secured the wife in the enjoyment of her right to the joint ownership of the joint earnings of the marriage copartnership and since in the nature of things the vast majority of married women never earn dollar by work outside of their families nor inherit dollar from their fathers it follows that from the day of their marriage to the day of the death of their husbands not one of them ever has dollar except it shall please her husband to let her have it in some of the states also there have been laws passed giving to the mother joint right with the father in the guardianship of the children but twenty years ago when our woman rights movement commenced by the laws of the state of new york and all the states the father had the sole custody and control of the children matter if he were brutal drunken libertine he had the legal right without the mother consent to apprentice her sons to rumsellers or her daughters to brothel keepers he could even will away an unborn child to some other person than the mother and in many of the states the law still prevails and the mothers are still utterly powerless under the common law i doubt if there is state in this union where married woman can sue or be sued slander of character and until quite recently there was not one in which she could sue or be sued injury of person however damaging to the wife reputation any slander may be she is wholly powerless to institute legal proceedings against her accuser unless her husband shall join with her and how often have we heard of the husband conspiring with some outside barbarian to blast the good name of his wife married woman can not testify in courts in cases of joint interest with her husband good farmer wife near earlville who had all the rights she wanted went to dentist of the village and had full set of false teeth both upper and under the dentist pronounced them an admirable ﬁt and the wife declared they gave her ﬁts to wear them that she could neither chew nor talk with them in her mouth the dentist sued the husband his counsel brought the wife witness the judge ruled her off the stand saying married woman can not be witness in matters of joint interest between herself and her husband think of it ye good wives the false teeth in your mouths are joint interest with your husbands about which you are legally incompetent to speak if in our frequent and shocking railroad accidents married woman is injured in her person in nearly all of the states it is her husband who must sue the company and it is to her husband that the damages if there are any will be awarded in ashﬁeld supposed to be the most advanced of any state in the union in all things humanitarian well intellectual married woman was severely injured by defective sidewalk her husband sued the corporation and recovered damages and those belong to him bona ﬁde and whenever that unfortunate wife wishes dollar of it to supply her needs she must ask her husband it and if the man be of narrow selﬁsh niggardly nature she will have to hear him say every time what have you done my dear with the cents i gave you yesterday is such position i ask you humiliating enough to be called servitude that husband would any other husband in nearly every state of this union sued and obtained damages the loss of the services of his wife precisely the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https under the old slave regime would have done had his slave been thus injured and precisely he himself would have done had it been his ox cow or horse instead of his wife there is an old saying that rose by any other name would smell sweet and i submit if the deprivation by law of the ownership of one own person wages property children the denial of the right an individual to sue and be sued and to testify in the courts is not condition of servitude most bitter and absolute though under the sacred name of marriage does any lawyer doubt my statement of the legal status of married women i will remind him of the fact that the old common law of england prevails in every state in this union except where the legislature has enact ed special laws annulling it and i am ashamed that not one state has yet blotted from its statute books the old common law of marriage by which blackstone summed up in the fewest words possible is made to say husband and wife are one and that one is the husband thus may all married women wives and widows by the laws of the several states be technically included in the ﬁfteenth amendment speciﬁcation of condition of servitude present or previous and not only married women but i will also prove to you that by all the great fundamental principles of our free government the entire womanhood of the nation is in condition of servitude surely were our revolutionary fathers when they rebelled against old king geor ge women are taxed without representation governed without their consent tried convicted and punished without jury of their peers and is all this tyranny any less humiliating and degrading to women under our government than it was to men under their aristocratic monarchical government one hundred years ago there is not an utterance of old john adams john hancock or patrick henry but ﬁnds living response in the soul of every intelligent patriotic woman of the nation bring to sense woman property holder and i will show you one whose soul is ﬁred with all the indignation of 1776 every time the presents himself at her door you will not ﬁnd one such but feels her condition of servitude galling did james otis when he said the very act of taxing exercised over those who are not represented appears to to be depriving them of one of their most essential rights and if continued seems to be in effect an entire disfranchisement of every civil right what one civil right is worth rush after man property is subject to be taken from him at pleasure without his consent if man is not his own assessor in person or by deputy his liberty is gone or he is wholly at the mercy of others what was the tax on tea or the paltry tax on paper and sugar to which our revolutionary fathers were subjected when compared with the taxation of the women of this republic the orphaned pixley sisters six dollars day and even the women who are proclaiming the tyranny of our taxation without representation from city to city throughout the country are often compelled to pay tax the poor privilege of defending our rights and again to show that disfranchisement was precisely the slavery of which the fathers complained allow to cite to you old ben franklin who in those olden times was admitted to be good authority not merely in domestic economy but in political well he said every man of the commonalty except infants insane persons and criminals is of common right and the law of god freeman and entitled to the free enjoyment of liberty that liberty or freedom consists in having an actual share in the appointment of those who are to frame the laws and who are to be the guardians of every man life property and peace the all of one man is dear to him the all of another and the poor man has an equal right but more need to have representatives in the legislature than the rich one that they who have voice or vote in the electing the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https not enjoy liberty but are absolutely enslaved to those who have votes and their representatives to be enslaved is to have governors whom other men have set over us and to be subject to laws made by the representatives of others without having had representatives of our own to give consent in our behalf suppose i read it with the feminine gender that women who have voice nor vote in the electing of representatives not enjoy liberty but are absolutely enslaved to men who have votes and their representatives to be enslave d is to have governors whom men have set over us and to be subject to the laws made by the representatives of men without having representatives of our own to give consent in our behalf and yet one more authority that of thomas paine than whom not one of the revolutionary patriots more ably vindicated the principles upon which our gove rnment is founded the right of voting representatives is the primary right by which other rights are protected to take away this right is to reduce man to state of slavery slavery consists in being subject to the will of another and he that has not vote in the election of representatives is in this case the proposal therefore to disfranchise any class of men is criminal the proposal to take away property is anything further needed to prove woman condition of servitude sufﬁciently orthodox to entitle her to the guaranties of the ﬁfteenth amendment is there man who will not agree with that to talk of freedom without the ballot is the women of this republic precisely new england orator wendell phillips at the close of the late war declared it to be to the newly emancipated black men i admit that prior to the rebellion by common consent the right to enslave well to disfranchise both native and foreign born citizens was conceded to the states but the one grand principle settled by the war and the reconstruction legislatio n is the supremacy of national power to protect the citizens of the united states in their right to freedom and the elective franchise against any and every interference on the part of the several states and again and again have the american people asserted the triumph of this principle by their overwhelming majorities lincoln and grant the one issue of the last two preside ntial elections was whether the fourteenth and ﬁfteenth amendments should be considered the irrevocable will of the people and the decision was they shall that it is not only the right but the duty of the national government to protect all united states citizens in the full enjoyment and free exercise of all their privileges and immunities against any attempt of any state to deny or abridge and in this conclusion republicans and democrats alike agree senator frelinghuysen said the heresy of state rights has been completely buried in these amendments that amended the constitution confers not only national but state citizenship upon all persons born or naturalized within our limits the call the national republican convention said equal suffrage has been engrafted on the national constitution the privileges and immunities of american citizenship have become part of the or ganic law the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https national republican platform said complete liberty and exact equality in the enjoyment of all civil political and public rights should be establish ed and maintained throughout the union by efﬁcient and appropriate state and federal legislation if that means anything it is that congress should pass law to require the states to protect women in their equal political rights and that the states should enact laws making it the duty of inspectors of elections to receive women votes on precisely the same conditions they those of men judge stanley substantial ohio his preliminary speech at the cincinnati convention said most emphatically the constitutional amendments have established the political equality of all citizens before the law president grant in his message to congress march 30th 1870 on the adoption of the ﬁfteenth amendment said measure which makes at once four millions of people voters is indeed measure of greater importance than any act of the kind from the foundation of the government to the present time how could four millions negroes be made voters if two millions were not included the california state republican convention said among the many practical and substantial triumphs of the principles achieved by the republican party during the past twelve years it enumerated with pride and pleasure the prohibiting of any state from abridging the privileges of any citizen of the republic the declaring the civil and political equality of every citizen and the establishing all these principles in the federal constitution by amendments thereto the permanent law benjamin f butler in recent letter to said i not believe anybody in congress doubts that the constitution authorizes the right of women to vote precisely it authorizes trial by jury and many other like rights guaranteed to citizens and again general butler said it is not laws we want there are plenty of enough too administrative ability to enforce law is the great want of the age in this country especially everybody talks of law law if everybody would insist on the enforcement of law the government would stand on ﬁrmer basis and questions would settle themselves and it is upon this just interpretation of the united states constitution that our national woman suffrage association which celebrates the anniversary of the woman rights movement in new york on the 6th of may next has based all its arguments and action the past ﬁve years we longer petition legislature or congress to give us the right to vote we appeal to the women everywhere to exercise their too long neglected citizen right to vote we appeal to the inspectors of election everywhere to receive the votes of all united states citizens it is their duty to we appeal to united states commissioners and marshals to arrest the inspectors who reject the names and votes of united states citizens it is their duty to and leave those alone who like our eighth ward inspectors perform their duties faithfully and the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https ask the juries to fail to return verdicts of guilty against honest paying united states citizens offering their votes at our elections or against intelligent worthy young men inspectors of elections receiving and counting such citizens votes we ask the judges to render true and unprejudiced opinions of the law and wherever there is room doubt to give its beneﬁt on the side of liberty and equal rights to women remembering that the true rule of interpretation under our national constitution especially since its amendments is that anything human rights is constitutional everything against human rights unconstitutional and it is on this line that we propose to ﬁght our battle the peaceably but nevertheless persistently through to complete triumph when all united state s citizens shall be recognized equals before the law speech of matilda joslyn gage in canandaigua and 16 other towns of ontario county previous to miss anthony trial june 17th the united st ates on trial not susan anthony governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed that is the axiom of our republic from this axiom we understand that powers used by the government without the consent of the governed are not just powers but that on the contrary they are unjust powers usurped powers illegal powers in what way does the consent of the governed come by and through the ballot alone the ballot answers questions it says yes or it declares what principles shall rule it says what laws shall be made it tells what taxes are to be raised it places men in ofﬁce or lays their heads low in the dust it is the will of man embodied in that little piece of paper it is the consent of the governed are women governed most certainly they pay taxes are held amenabl to laws they are tried crimes they are ﬁned imprisoned hung the government wields strong power over them have they consented to this power of the government have they recognized right to the ballot has their consent bean asked through their votes have they had voice in saying what taxes shall be levied on their property penalties they shall pay crimes they are ruled without their consent the ﬁrst principles of government are founded on the natural rights of individuals in order to secur the exercise of these natural individual rights our government professed to be founded governments never created single right rights did not come into the world with our revolutionary fathers they were men of middle age when they severed their connexion with great britain but that severance did not endow them with single the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https it was at that time they ﬁrst entered into the exercise of their natural individual rights neither our declaration nor our constitution created single right they merely recognized certain rights in existence they recognized those rights human rights inalienable rights rights existing by virtue of common humanity natu ral rights never change but the power to perceive these natural rights does change and various nations have had their own standard three names said to be the sweetest the world ever knew are mother home and heaven there is one still which men have given up mother and home and which they have almost sacriﬁced the hope of heaven that word is liber ty when the ﬁres of liberty began to creep through europe in the middle ages at time when hereditary monarchs and the catholic church ruled the world men placed its safeguards in municipal corporations the idea of municipal corporations descended from rome to the rest of europe and free cities became the germ of personal freedom but new world was needed the great experiment of individual freedom macauley calls government an experimental science and therefore progressive science history shows this to be true liberty did not spring full armed like minerva from the head of jove the liberty possessed by the world has been gradually secured and it was left our country ﬁrst to incorporate in its foundation recognition of individual rights hundred years before the revolutionary war massachusetts and virginia resisted english tyranny massachusetts in 1664 called herself perfect republic she preserved neutral harbor by force of arms against opposing english factions she enacted laws against the supremacy of the english parliament and she established her own mint this last is noticeable in the progress of liberty rights of property of which money is the exponent have always been one of the foremost bancroft says virginia was always land of liberty that virginia placed the defense of liberty not in municipal corporations but in persons and that the liberty of the individu al was ever highly prized the difference between monarchy and republic is the difference between force and consent it is the difference between being governed and governing yourself it is the difference between the men of russia and the men of the united states it is the difference between the political rights of one man the government and the political rights of the people the government but the world has never yet seen true republic though it has hundreds of years been taking steps towards one the original principles of just governments are ﬁve all of which were acknowledged by the united states at its foundation these principles are first the natural right of each individual to second the exact equality of these rights third that these rights when not delegated by the individual are retained by the individual fourth that person can exercise these rights of others without delegated authority fifth that the of these rights does not destroy them these ﬁve underlying principles are the admitted basis of all governmental rights and the old revolutionists acted upon them they were men of middle life they were under an old and established form of government to which they had not delegated authority and during all these years they had made use of their natural equal rights when they chose to assume the exercise of these rights they at once took them up the women of that day were less in earnest than were the men mercy otis warren sister of that james otis whose ﬁery words did so much towards rousing the colonies was herself less in earnest had less inﬂuence than her brother she was member of the famous committee of correspondence and was constantly consulted by adams jefferson franklin hancock washington and all the foremost men of that day through her lips was ﬁrst whispered the word separation less active were the wome n of the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https and in 1770 ﬁve years before the breaking out of the revolutionary war the women of boston held public meeting and formed themselves into league to resist taxation tea was the article upon which great britain was then making her stand in order to sustain the principle of taxation these women declared they would use more tea until the tax upon it was repealed this league was ﬁrst formed by the married women but the next day the young women met in innumerable numbers and took similar action they expressly stated they did not this so much themselves the beneﬁt of their posterity in the country the women of that hour went abroad over the ﬁelds and sowed their tea men sow wheat this action of the women of the revolution was taken three years before the famous tea party of boston harbor and was the real origin of that tea party the women of the present day the posterity of these women of the revolution are now following the example then set and are protesting against taxation without representation few weeks ago i attended meeting of the women of rochester who met in the mayor ofﬁce in that city and there like their revolutionary mothers formed league against taxation without representation meetings the discussion of measures are regularly held by them and they have issued an address which i will read you to the w omen of the city of rochester and the county of monr oe after years of discussion appeal and work the women of rochester assembled are prompted to advise and urge women of the city and county that the time has come to act our patriot mothers acted in 1770 in protest against unjust government and the action appropriate and suited to the time is strong and earnest protest against the violation of the republican principles which compels the payment of taxes by women while they are denied the ballot by order of the w omen t ax p ayers ssocia tion of the city of rochester and county of monroe they have also issued this memorial and protest addressed to the boar d of supervisors of the county of monr oe and to the hon the common council of the city of rochester the payment of taxes is exacted in direct violation of the principles that governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed and that there shall be taxation without representation therefore we earnestly protest against the payment of taxes either municipal county or state until the ballot secures us in the right of representation just and equal with other citizens by order of the w omen t ax p ayers ssocia tion of the city of rochester and county of monroe thus women are everywhere going back to fundamental principles and this action of the women of rochester is but the commencement of protest which will soon become resistance and which will extend from the lawrence to the gulf of mexico from the atlantic to the paciﬁc the women of the city of rochester pay taxes on seven millions of property and yet not one of these tax payers is consulted to how or when that tax shall be raised or what purpose used this seven millions is but small proportion of property on which the women of that city really pay taxes it does not include that much larger amount of property of which they have been robbed and over whic h they are assumed to have control the foundation of new city hall has recently been laid in that city women property without their consent has been used this purpose water is soon to be brought in from hemlock lake and dozen other projects are on foot all of which require money and towards all of which the money of women will be taken without their the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https illustrate the extreme injustice with which women are treated in this matter of taxation to show you how contrary it is to all natural right let us suppose that all the taxable property in the city of rochester belonged to women with the exception of single small house and lot which were owned by man the law is now interpreted the man who owned that house and lot could vote tax upon the property of all those women at his own will to build city h alls cour t h ouses jails could call an election and vote an extraordinary tax to bring in water from dozen different lakes erect fountains at every corner fence in twenty parks vote himself in mayor alderman assessor collector with fat salary from these women money attached to each one of these ofﬁces and in the end elect himself the sole policeman of the city to protect the women and this you call just government it is more unjust more unrepublican to take the property of ﬁfty or hundred or thousand women in this way than it would be to take the property of single one the principle is still the same the women of protest did their principle women come into the world endowed with the same natural rights men and this by virtue of their common humanity and when prevented or restrained from their exercise they are ensla ved old ben franklin once said those that have vote or voice in the laws or the election of those who administer them not enjoy liberty but are absolutely enslaved to those who have votes and their representatives that sentiment is true when uttered while the women of this nation are restrained from the exercise of their natural rights of they are held enslaved to those who administer the laws said an old minister of revolutionary fame one who is bound to obey the will of another is really slave though he may have good master if he had bad one those of you who remember adolph in uncle tom cabin will recall his apparent freedom dressed in style wearing his master garments before the ﬁrst gloss was off viewing uncle tom superciliously through his eye glass he was petted companion of his master and did not feel his bonds but one day the scene changed clair died and poor adolph stripped of all his favors was dragged off to the vile slave pen you see parallel between adolph and the women of america adolph was restrained by unjust power from exercise of his natural rights so are the women of this country is most fully shown by this prosecution and trial of susan anthony in this country two kinds of representation exist property and personal let us look moment at the constitution of the united states in three years we celebrate our centennial from what does it date not from the constitution our country existed eleven years without constitution fact thirteen years before it was ratiﬁed by the thirteen colonies the centennial dates from the declaration of independence which was based on underlying principles but our government has recognized its own needs it has thrown new safeguards around liberty within year after the declaratio n it was found necessary to enter into articles of confederation and those were soon followed by the constitution it was found property rights were not secure under the action of thirteen dif ferent deliberatives england has never possessed personal representation but only that of property and in the secret proceedings upon the framing of our constitution the question to property or personal representation was strongly agitated some of the delegates favored the fuller representation of property than of persons others who advocated the equality of suffrage took the matter up on the original principles of government recognizing the fact that it was not strength or wisdom or property that conferred rights but that in state of nature before any government is formed all persons are equally free and independent one having any right or authority to exercise power over another and this without any regard to difference in personal strength understanding or wealth it was also argued and upon this acknowledgment the constitution was based that when individ uals enter into government they have each right to an equal voice in its ﬁrst formation and afterwards have each right to an equal vote in every matter which relates to their government that if it could be done conveniently they have right to exercise it in person when it can not be done in person but convenience representatives are appointed to act them every person has right to an equal vote in choosing the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https who is intrusted to the whole that which the whole if they could assemble might in person and in the transaction of which they would have an equal voice this was the basis upon which the cons titution was established and these the principles which led to its adoption principles which include the full recognition of each person possessed of the inalienable right of the argument equality was continu ed in the following strain reported by one of the delegates to the legislature of maryland that if we were to admit becau man was more wise more strong more wealthy he should be entitled to more votes than another it would be inconsistent with the freedom of that other and would reduce him to slavery the following illustration was used suppose instance ten individuals in state of nature about to enter into government nine of whom were equally wise equally strong equally wealthy the tenth is ten times wise ten times strong or ten times rich if this reason he is to have ten votes each vote of the others the nine might well have vote at all and though the whole nine might assent to the measure yet the vote of the tenth would countervail and set aside all their votes if this tenth approved of what they wished to adopt it would be well but if he disapproved he could prevent it and in the same manner he could carry into execution any measure he wished contrary to the opinion of all the others he having ten votes and the others altogether but nine it is evident that on these principles the nine would have will or discretion of their own but must be totally dependent on the will and discretion of the tenth to him they would be absolutely slaves any negro is to his master if he did not attempt to carry into execution any measures injurious to the other nine it could only be said that they had good master they would not be the less slaves because they would be totally dependent upon the will of another and not on their own will they might not feel their chains but they would notwithstanding wear them and whenever their master pleased he might draw them so tight to gall them to the bone again it was urged that though every individual should have voice in the government yet even then superio r wealth strength or understanding would give great and undue advantage to those who possessed them but the point especially pressed in these debates was that each individual before entering into government was equally free and independent and therefore the conclusion was drawn that each person had equal right both at the time of framing government and also after government or constitution was framed to those who with old english ideas constantly pressed property representation it was replied that taxation and representation ought to go together in so far that person not represented ought not to be taxed this constitutional convention was in session number of months its deleg ates were partially elected by women votes at that date women were exercising their right of through voting certainly in the states of massachusetts and new jersey if not in geor gia and delaware these women sent their delegates or representatives to assist in framing constitution let us look at the preamble of that instrument it reads thus we the people of the united states in order to form more perfect union establish justice insure domestic tranquility provide the common welfare and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity ordain and establish this constitution the united states of america here we have statement to who established the constitution it was not the thirteen states states not the government in its sovereign capacity but the people not the white people alone not the native born alone not the male people alone but the people in collective sense justice was not established by this constitution if one half the people were left out from its provisions neither was the common welfare considered unless all people in common equally shared the beneﬁts of the constitution and moreover the posterity of the people of that time are female well male the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https only by our knowledge of the course of argument taken by the frame rs of the constitution not only by our knowledge that women well men helped elect delegates to that convention only from the original principles proclaimed in the declaration but also by and through this preamble to the constitution we ﬁnd woman equally with man recognized part of the governing power although women not rest their claim to upon any human instrument it is well to show that even in the declaration and the original constitu tion the constitution it was the rights of all people were most emphatically and truly recognized judge story in his commentaries upon the constitution says the impo rtance of examining the preamble the purpose of expounding the language of statute has always been felt and universally conceded in all judicial proceedings on 1 chief justice jay regarded the preambl of the constitution of the united states an authoritative guide to correct interpretation of that instrument 2 dallas coke says the preamble of statute is good means to ﬁnd out the meaning of the statute and it were key to the understanding thereof blackstone lays it down fundamental principle that we must argue from generals down to particulars here is good legal authority i have cited men whose opinions are accepted we have thus argued down from the generals of the declaration and constitution to the particulars which appertain to each individual alike and what is the result freedom all equal rights we have read the preamble of the constitution and quoted authorities to show in what light it must be read in reference to its following provisions by its preamble the constitution is shown to make distinction in favor of sex from secret debates of the convention which framed it we ﬁnd the motives and the arguments of its framers the great foundation and key stone alike of our republican ideas of our constitution is individual personal representation and it is the greatest blessing to the country at large that the question of representation has come up in the person of miss anthony men are compelled to think upon underlying principles they are compelled to ask themselves where they get either natural or constitutional right to govern women from the earliest ages men have queried among themselves to where lay the governing power in the time of abraham and even now in some parts of the world the patriarch of the tribe is looked upon its supreme ruler members of scottish clans look with more reverence upon their chief than upon the queen they obey his behests sooner than parliamentary laws other men have believed the governing power lay in the hands of select few an aristocracy and that these few men could by right make laws to govern the rest others again have believed this power vested in single man called king or czar or pope but it was left to our country and our age to promulgate the idea that the governing power lay in the people themselves it took men great many thousand years to discover this pregnant fact and although our government laid down at the very ﬁrst certain underlying truths it has taken very long time even this country to see and practice these principles but men have opened their eyes to liberty there have been constant advances towards securing its full blessings to each and every individual and in this progress we had ﬁrst the declaration second the articles of confederati on third the constitution then the ten conciliato ry amendments quickly followed by an eleventh and twelfth each one of these designed to more fully secure liberty to the people and making ﬁfteen successive steps in the short period of years at the time of framing this government women existed well men women are part of the people the people created the government now when speaking to you i the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https to the people of this part of ontario county i am not speaking to men alone i am not speaking to women alone but to you all people when people frame government the rights not delegated by them to the government are retained by them is declared by the tenth amendment now where men get their constitutional right to govern women women have either delegated their right of to certain delegates by them to be elected according to all the forms of this government or they have not so delegated their rights of but have retained them in either case according to the genius of our government what is there to prevent them from exercising these rights any moment they choose unless it is force what prevents them unless it is unjust illegal power the ninth amendment declares that the enumeration of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people remember what are the foundation principles of just government principles fully acted upon by the old revolutionists remember that government of whatever kind or character can possibly create the right of but only recognize rights existent remember the of right does not destroy that right i have natural right to much fresh air i can breathe if you shut in close room with door and windows barred that does not invalidate my right to breathe pure fresh air i have natural right to obey the dictates of my own conscience and to worship god i choose if you are physically stronger than i am or if you are legally stronger than i am and use your strength to prevent the exercise of these natural rights you by means destroy them though i not use these rights i still possess them the framers of this government the men and the women who voted at that early day had never until then exercised their natural rights of when they chose they took them up but people tell us it was not the intention to include women what then was the intention did the framers of the declaration intend to leave women under the government of great britain did they intend to set themselves and their male compeers free and leave women behind under monarchy were not women intended to be included in the beneﬁts of the constitution oh but says some one they were intend ed to be generally included but the amendments had nothing to with them let us look at this is it possible to amend constitution not in accordance with its underlying principles it can be repealed abolished destroyed but not amended except in accor dance with its original character the supreme court of the united states has declared that the powers of the constitution are granted by the people and are to be exercised strictly on them and their beneﬁt story asks who are the parties to this great contract and answers the question by saying the people of the united states are the parties to the constitution on con on con legal rules 283 says this ﬁrst paragraph of the constitution declaring its ends is the most vital part of the instrument revealing its spirit and intent and the understanding of its framers here we have the recognized legal rule that the understanding or intention of the framers of an instrument is to be found in its ﬁrst paragraph and the ﬁrst paragraph of the constitution declares it was framed by the people and the purpose of securing the blessings of liberty to themselves and their posterity the american women of are the posterity of the framers of the constitution which was thus designed their beneﬁt the intention to include women is here positive women are part of the people now and ever have been rules of legal interpretation are general in their character and so general has the interpretation of the constitution been that not only did the people who framed the constitution and their posterity come in its blessings but the people also of every nation and tongue from continent or isles of the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https who come to us are included in its beneﬁts who can say our forefathers intended to include chinamen or sandwich islanders or the norwegian russian or italian in its beneﬁts yet they all share in it soon they become citizens how absurd we should think the assertion that it was not the lord intention to hold the people of the united states under the law of the ten commandments they were given to the jews alone some four thousand years before the united states existed nation massachusetts never abolished slavery by legislative act never intentionally abolished it in 1780 that state adopted new const itution with bill of rights declaring all men born free and equal upon this some slaves demanded their freedom and their masters granted it the slavery of men and women both was thus destroyed in massachu setts without intention on the part of the framers of the constitution and this because it is legal rule to argue down from generals to particulars and that the words of statute ought not to be interpreted to destroy natural justice but coke says whe never the question of liberty runs doubtful the decision must be given in favor of liberty digest when charter declares all men born free and equal it means intends and includes all women too it means all mankind and this is the legal interpr etation of the language to go back to the constitution of the united states let us examine if women were not intended the ﬁrst amendment reads congress shall make law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the government redress of grievances mention is there made of women but who will deny it was not intended them to enjoy the right of worshipping they choose were they not to be protected in freedom of speech and in the right of assembl ing to petition the government redress of grievances not man before will deny that women were included equally with men in the intention of the framers the sixth amendment reads in all criminal prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right to speedy and public trial by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed which district shall have been previously ascertained by law and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation to be confronted with the witnesses against him to have compulsory processes obtaining witnesses in his favor and to have the existence of counsel in his defense the words him and his are three times mentioned in this amendment yet one can be found wild enough to say women were not intended to be included in its beneﬁts miss anthony herself has already come under its provisions and were she denied speedy and open trial she could appeal to the protection of this very amendment which not only does not say women or her but does alone say him and his and this notwithstanding the other legal adage that laws stand they are written this whole question of constitutional rights turns on whether the united states is nation if the united states is nation it has national powers what is the admitted basis of our nation we reply equality of political rights and what again is the basis of political rights citizenship nothing more nothing less national sovereignty is only founded upon the political sovereignty of the individual and national rights are merely individual rights in collective form the acknowledged basis of rights in each and every one of the seven states is citizenship state citizenship alone that alone can not exist but ﬁrst national citizenship national rights are the fundamental basis of state rights if this is not true we are then nation but merely confederacy held together by our own separate wills and the south was right in its war of secession every sovereig n right of the united states exists solely from its existence nation the nation has grown to know the needs of liberty it has from time to time thrown new safeguards around it i have show n in its ﬁfteen progressive steps since sixty years there was change slavery had cast its blight upon our country and the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https was state supremacy men forgot the rights and need of freedom but in 1861 the climax was reached and then came the bitter struggle between state and national power although our underlying principles were all right freedom required new guards and the right of all men to liberty was put in new form an especial statute or amendment was added to our national constitution declaring that involuntary servitude unless crime could not exist in this republic this statute created new rights it merely afﬁrmed and elucidated rights old creation and which in general way had been recognized at the very ﬁrst foundation of our far back the old articles of association before the declaration of independence this amend ment was the sixteenth step in securing the rights of the people but it was not enough our country differs from every other country in that we have two kinds of citizenship first we have national citizenship based upon equal political rights person born citizen of the united states is by the very circumstances of birth endowed with certain political rights in this respect the circumstances of birth are very different from those of person born in great britain person born in great britain is not endowed with political rights simply because born in that country political rights in great britain are not based upon personal rights they are based upon property rights in england persons are not represented only property is represented that is the very great political difference between england and the united states in the united states representation is based upon individual personal every person born in the united every person every white person nor every male person but every person is born with political rights the naturalization of foreigners also secures to them the exercise of political rights because it secures to them citizenship and they obtain naturalization through national law the war brought about distinct and new recognition of the rights of national citizenship states had assumed to be superior to the nation in this very underlying national basis of voting rights but when certain states boldly attempted to thwart national power and vote themsel ves out of the union by this attempt they virtually said there is nation new protection was thrown around individual personal political rights by seventeenth step known to the world by the fourteenth amendment which deﬁned not created citizenship all persons born or naturalized in the united states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the united states and of the state wherein they reside thus recognizing united states citizenship the ﬁrst and superior citizenship miss anthony was not only born in the united states but the united states also has jurisdiction over her is shown by this suit under which she was arrested in rochester and held there to examination in the same little room in which fugitive slaves were once examined from rochester she was taken to albany from albany back to rochester and now from rochester to canandaigua where she is soon to be tried she has thus been fully acknowledged by the united states one of its citizens and also citizen of the state in which she resides in order to become citizen of state and enjoy the privileges and immunities of states citizen of the united states must reside in state citizenship of the united states secures nothing over the citizenship of other countries unless it secures the right of government state laws may hereafter regulate suffrage but the difference between regulating and prohibiting is great the difference between state and national citizenship the question of the war was the question of state rights it was the negro state rights or the power of states over the ballot the question is woman united states rights or the power of the united over the ballot the moral battle now waging will settle the question of the power of the united states over the rights of citizens by the civil war the united states was proven to be stronger than the states it was proven we were nation in so far that states were but parts of the whole the woman question of which in this pending trial miss anthony stands the exponent is to settle the question of united states power over the individual political rights of the people it is question of monarchy or republic the united states may usurp power did the states but it has rights in sovereign capacity not given it by the constitution or in other words by the people by the preamble we have discovered who are its the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https what purpose its constitution was instituted each and every ﬁrst ten the eleventh twelfth thirteent h fourteenth and ﬁfteenth are only parts of the grand whole and must each and every one be examined in the light of the preamble each added amendment makes this change in the status of the people in that it gives new guaranties of freedom and removes all pretense of right from any existing usurped power people are slow to comprehend the change which has been effected by the decision to state rights one claims that only the negro or persons of african descent were affected by it others claim and among them some prominent republi cans that every civil right is by these amendments thrown under national control recent ly two or three suits have come before the united states on this apprehension one of these known the slaughter house case came up from new orleans in the suit of certain persons against the state of louisiana permit had been given certain parties to erect sole buildings slaughter and in other ways control that entire business in the city of new orleans certain number of years suit upon it was appealed to the supreme court of the united states on the ground of the change in the power of states by and through the last three amendments and on the supposition that all the civil power of the states had thus been destroyed the court decided it had jurisdiction though in its decision it proclaimed the reaching character of these amendments in reference to the thirteenth amend ment the court used this language we not say that one else but the negro can share in this protection both the language and spirit of these articles are to have their full and just weight in any question of construction undoubtedly while negro slavery alone was in the minds of the congress which proposed the thirteenth article it forbids any kind of slavery now or hereafter if mexican peonage or the chinese cooley labor system shall develop slavery of the mexican or chinese race within our territory this amendment may be safely trusted to make it void this is the language used by the supreme court of the united states in reference to this thirteenth amendment prohibiting any all and every kind of slavery not only now but in the hereafter and this although the decision also acknowledges the fact that only african slavery was intended to be covered by this amendment the court further said and so if other rights are assailed by the states which properly and necessarily fall within the protect ion of these articles that protection will apply though the party interested may not be of african descent what other rights fall within the protection of these articles what other rights these amendments cover the fourteenth article after declaring who are citizens of the united states and of states still further says state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the united states nor shall any state deprive any person of life liberty or property without due process of law nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws this comprises the ﬁrst section of that amendment the jurisdiction and protection of the general government applies to united states citizens by its prosecution of miss anthony the general government acknowledges her citizen of the united states and what is much more it acknowledges its own jurisdiction over the the did i say the only political right of its citizens this prosecution is an admission of united states jurisdiction instead of state jurisdiction this whole amendment with the exception of the ﬁrst clause of the ﬁrst section which simply declares who are citizens of the united states and states is directed against the interference of states in the rights of citizens but in miss anthony case the state of new york has not interfered with her right to vote she voted under local laws and the state said not word taken action in the case consequently the united states has had occasion to interfere on that ground the question of state rights was not great question this what are united states rights can the united states in its sovereign capacity overthrow the rights of the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https citizens it can not the fifteenth amendment to the constitution speciﬁcally declares the right of citizens of the united states to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the united states or by any state on account of race color or previous condition of servitude this ﬁfteenth amendment has been seriously misapprehended by many people who have understood it to mean that women could be excluded from voting simply because they are women i have shown you that statutes and constitutions are always general in their character that from generals we must argue down to particulars and that if there is any doubt to the interpretation of statute it must be deﬁned in the interests of liberty but to the interpretation of this statute there can be doubt had it read the right of citizens of the united states to take out passports shall not be denied or abridged by the united states on account of race color or previous condition of servitude person would interpret it to mean that such right to take out passport could be denied on account of female sex or on account of male sex we will read it now ﬁrst in the light of the declaration second in that of the preamble to the constitution and the constitution itself and its various amendments to which i have referred the ﬁrst sixth ninth and tenth which would have been interpret ed male had the constitution meant men alone but which have always been deﬁned to cover and include cover and include the rights of the whole people to freedom of conscience to freedom of speech to the right of speedy and public trial and this although in the sixth amendment the terms him and his are alone used the courts long ago decided that statutes were of general bearing is fully true of the declaration and constitution which are supreme statutes the fifteenth amendment does not speciﬁcally exclude right of male citizens to vote because they are male citizens therefore male citizens are of necessity included in the right of voting it does not speciﬁ cally exclude female citizens from the right of voting because they are female citize ns therefore female citizens are of necessity included in the right of right which the united states can not abridge male citizen can claim that he male citizen is included save by implication and save on the general grounds that he is not speciﬁcally excluded he is necessarily included can the united states at pleasure take from its own citizens the right of voting or abridge that right has it the right to take from citizens of states the right of voting are citizens of states simply protected against states and can the united states now at will step in and deny or abridge the right of voting to all its male citizens simply because they are male if it has that power over its female citizens it has the same power over its male citizens you can not fail to see that the question brought up by miss anthony prosecution and trial by the united states the act of voting has developed the most important question of united states rights larger most pregnant more momentous question by far than that of state rights the liberties of the people are much more closely involved when the united states is the aggressor than when the states are aggressors the act to enforce the right of citizens to vote declares that citizens shall be entitled and allowed to vote at all elections by the people in any state territory district county city parish township school district municipality or other territorial division this act was passed after the ratiﬁcation of the fifteenth amendment and is designed to be in accordance with the constitution it does not say black citizens shall be entitled and allowed to vote it does not say male citizens shall be entitled and allowed to merely says citizens it covers the right of women citizens to vote and yet united states ofﬁcials claim to ﬁnd in this very act their authority prosecuting miss anthony and those fourteen other women citizens of rochester the alleged crime of voting when miss anthony voted what did she she merely exercised her citizen right of right to which she and all women citizens are entitled by virtue of their citizenship in the right to which they are entitled because individual political rights are the basis of the government the united states has other foundation if that right is trampled upon we have nation we may hang together in sort of anarchical way time but our dissolution draws near can the united states destroy rights the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https of sex in the original constitution before even the ﬁrst ten amendments were added states were forbidden to pass bills of attainder by the fourteenth amendment the right of voting was forbidden to be abridged unless crime is it crime to be woman in the beginning god created man male and female created he them bill of attainder inﬂicts punishment creates liabilities or disabilities on account of parentage birth or descent united states ofﬁcials presume to create disability or inﬂict punishment on account of birth woman and this in direct deﬁance of the constitution when the constitution of the united states presents barrier lesser power has such authority the constitu tion of the united states and the laws made in pursuance ther eof shall be the supreme law of the land says article sixth any law of congress not made in pursuance of or in unison with the constitution is an illegal and void law coke declared an act of parliament against magna charta was null and void but united states ofﬁcials declare it crime united states citizen to vote if it is crime citizen it ought to be still greater crime citizen but the fact that citizenship carries with it the right of voting is shown in the act of naturalization foreigner after certain length of residence in this country proceeds to take out papers of citizenship to become citizen is all that he needs to make of him voter at one and the same time he picks up ballot and his naturalization papers nothing more than his becoming citizen is needed him to less will answer susan anthony is citizen she had to take out papers to make her was born in the united is educated intelligent and free born citizenship is generally conceded to be of more value than that which is bought you not remember that when paul was brought up preparatory to being scour ged he demanded by what right they scour ged him roman citizen the chief captain said i bought this freedom with great price paul replied i am free born then great fear fell upon the chief capta in and he ordered the bonds removed from paul roman citizenship was worth much that two thousand years ago day the american citizen who has bought his freedom with great price who has left his home and country and crossed the sea to strange land in order that he may ﬁnd freedom is held to be superior to free born american women citizens but miss anthony is not battling herself alone nor the woman alone she stands the embodiment of republican principles the question of is not has woman right to vote but has any american citizen white or black or naturalized right to vote the prosecution of miss anthony by the united states the alleged crime of having cast vote at the last election is positive declaration of the government of the united states that it is crime to vote let that decision be afﬁrmed and we have republic the ballot the governing power in the hands of every person is the only true republic each person to help make the laws which govern him or her is the only true democracy individual responsibility personal representation exact political equality are the only stable foundations of republic and when the united states makes voting crime on the part of any citizen it strikes blow at its own stability it is undermining the very foundations of the is attempting to overthrow its own constitution miss anthony is the representati ve of liberty she is battling the rights of every man woman and child in the country she is not only upholding the right of every citizen but of every naturalized citizen is at stake in her person the hopes of foreign lands the quickened instincts of liberty so well nigh universal all these are on trial with her the destinies of america the civilization of the world are in the balance with her she stands on her defence if the women of this country are restricted in their right of what better is it them to have been born in the united states than to have been born in russia or france or england or many another monarchical country better nor well in all these countries women vote upon certain questions in russia about of the property of the country is in the hands of women and they vote upon its disposition and control the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https and sweden women vote at municipal elections and in england every woman householder or votes city ofﬁcers poor wardens and school commissioners thus expressing her views to the education of her children which is power not possessed by single woman of this state of new york whose boast has been that it leads the legislation of the world in regard to women women in england vote equally with men every ofﬁce except parliamentary and even that is near at hand petition it of names going up last year england though monarchy is consis tent with herself the foundation of english representation is property not persons property is allowed its representation whether it is held by man or by woman are ye not of more value than many sparrows said one of old is it less pertinent us to ask if personal representation is not more sacred than property representation where governments lead there are revolutions said the eloquent castelar but revolution is imminent in government like ours instituted by the people the people in its charters recognizing the most sacred rights of the people but which in sovereign capacity through its ofﬁcials tramples upon the most sacredly secured and guaranteed rights of the people the question brought up by this trial is not woman rights question but citizen rights question it is not denied that women are citizens is not denied that susan anthony was born in the united states and is therefore citizen of the united states and of the state wherein she resides which is this state of new york it can not be denied that she is person of the people is not word in the constitution of the united states which militates against the recogn ition of woman person one of the people citizen the whole question then turns on the power of the united states over the political rights of whole question then turns on the supreme authority of the national constitution the constitution recognizes women citizens both of the united states and of the states in which they reside and the enforcement act of 1870 in unison with our national fundamental principles is entitled an act to enfor ce the right of citizens of the united states to vote in the several states of the union out of those three words other purposes or any provisions of this act included in them can not be found authority restraining any citizen not guilty of participating in the rebellion or other crime from voting and we brand this prosecution of miss anthony by united states ofﬁcials under claim of provisions in this act an illegal prosecution infamous prosecution in direct deﬁance of national in its principles tending to subvert republican form of governmen t and direct step whether so designed or not to the establishment of monarchy in this country where the right of one individual is attacked the rights of all are menaced blow against one citizen is blow against every citizen the government has shown itself very weak in prosecuting miss anthony astute lawyer could be found on side so pregnant of ﬂaws this one were not the plaintif f in the case the sovereign united states the very fact of the prosecution is at one and the same time weakness on the part of the government and an act of unauthorized authority it is weakness because by it the united states comes onto the ground of the defendant and at once admits voting is an unite d states right because united states rights are citizens rights by this prosecution the united states clearly admits that protection of the ballot is an united states duty instead of state duty it is an united states duty instead of state duty because voting is an united states right instead of state right this prosecution is an open admission by the united states that voting is constitutional right but the prosecution is also an admission of unauthorized authority in that by it the united states discriminates between citizens if there is one point of our government more strongly fortiﬁed than another it is that the government is of the people the preamble of the constitution heretofore quoted means all the people if language has the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https all the people are citizens if the fourteenth amendment has any signiﬁcation at all if any minds are so obtuse not to see that the ballot is an united states right any person before still claims suffrage state right alone such person certainly can not fail to see that under his views the united states has been guilty of outrage upon miss anthony and the fourteen other women whom this great government big united states has prosecuted under this view of the right of suffrage such person can not fail to see there has been unauthorized interference by the united states with the duties and rights of the state of new york and while uncle sam was thus busy last winter over the prosecution of women citizens of the state of new york the state itself submitted in its legislature resolution looking towards the recognition by the state of the right of women to the ballot thus at one and the same time was seen the anomaly of prosecution by the united states of women of the state of new york an act that new york herself was resolving it right to perform and which if the ballot is not constitutional right the united states has power over at all look at this prosecution you will it presents ﬁne dilemma to solve it presents to the country never before the most important and vital question of united states rights it presents the most important and vital question of unconstitutional power which has grown to such dimensions in the hands of united states ofﬁcials and it must bring to people cognizance the very slight thread by which hangs the security of any citizen right to the ballot governments try themselves government has been stable in the past all have fallen because all have been all have permitted the degradation of woman babylon fell her religion deﬁled woman the appeared upon the wall and in single night she was overthrown neither was rome immortal her laws were class laws the rights of humanity were not respected she underwent many changes and that vast empire which once ruled the world lives now only in name egypt held the wisdom of the world and to certain extent she recognized the equality of woman her empire endured ages at last she too fell her civilization was still an unequal one special laws or laws specially deﬁned one particular body of people on account of race color sex or occupation is class legislation and bears the seeds of death within itself it was the boast of our forefather s that the rights which they conten ded were the rights of human nature shall the women of this country forever have cause to say that the declaration and the constitution are specially deﬁned or gans of special law where the legislative and executive function of the law are in the hands of single class special law or special renderings of law are the unvarying results if the constitution of the united states is deﬁned and ruled by united states ofﬁcials to discriminate between classes of citizens then the constitution is by them made to be nothing less than an organ of special law and is held not to sustain the rights of the people while the class which has usurped the legislative the executive and the judicial functions of the government deﬁnes political rights to belong to male citizens alone the women of the united states are under special law and while thus debarred from exercising their natural right of government they are subjects not citizens it matters not if women never voted since the framing of the government until now this right has merely been retained by them it has been held in abeyance to be exercised by them whenever they chose the principles advocated by the women are the principles which brought on the revolutionary war and miss anthony and other women associated with her are exponents of the very principles which caused the colonies to rebel against the mother country the eyes of all nations are upon us their hopes of liberty are directed towards us the united states is now on trial by the light of its own underlying principle its assertion of human right to lies hundred years back of it the chartered conﬁrmation and renewal of this asserti on has come up to our very day and though all the world looked on and wondered to see us crush the rebellion of it is at this hour at this soon coming trial of miss anthony at canandaigua before the supreme court the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https northern district of new york is at this trial that republican institutions will have their grand test and the decision is rendered or against the political rights of citizenship so will the people of the united states ﬁnd themselves free or slaves and so will the united states have tried itself and paved its way speedy fall or long and glorious continuance miss anthony is the representative of liberty in all ages of the world and during all times there have been epochs in which some one person took upon their own shoulders the hopes and the sorrows of the world and in their own person through many struggles bore them onward suddenly or gradually the case might be men found the rugged path made smooth and the way opened the world rapid advance such an epoch exists now and such person is susan anthony to you men of ontario county has come an important hour the fates have brought about that you of all the men in this great land have the responsibility of this trial to you freedom has come looking fuller acknowledgement wider area in which to work and grow your decision will not be susan anthony alone it will be yourselves and your children children to the latest generations you are not asked to decide question under favor but according to the foundation principles of this republic you will be called upon to decide question according to our great charters of the declaration of independence and the constitution of the united states you are to decide not only on question of natural right but of absolute law of the supreme law of the land you are not to decide accordin g to prejudice but according to the constitution if your decision is favorable to the defendant you will sustain the constitution if adverse if you are blinded by prejudice you will not decide against women alone but against the united states well more momentous hour has arisen in the interest of freedom the underlying principles of the republic its warp and woof alike is the exact and permanent political equality of every citizen of the nation whether that citizen is native born or naturalized white or black man or woman and may god help you judge hunt and the right of trial by jury by john hooker hartford the following article was intended publication in magazine but the writer kindly contributed it publication in this pamphlet in the recent trial of susan anthony voting illegally was claime d on the ground that woman she had right to point which we not propose to consider the course of judge hunt in taking the case from the jury and ordering verdict of guilty to be entered up was so remarkable so contrary to all rules of law and so subversive of the system of jury trials in criminal cases that it should not be the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https pass without an emphatic protest on the part of every public journal that values our liberties let us ﬁrst of all see precisely what were the facts miss anthony was charged with having knowingly voted without lawful right to vote at the congressional election in the eighth ward of the city of rochester in the state of new york in november the act of congress under which the prosecution was brought provides that if at any election representative or delegate in the congress of the united states any person shall knowingly personate and vote or attempt to vote in the name of any other person whether living dead or ﬁctitious or vote more than once at the same election any candidate the same ofﬁce or vote at place where he may not be lawfully entitled to vote or vote without having lawful right to vote every such person shall be deemed guilty of crime the trial took place at canandaigua in the state of new york in the circuit court of the united states before judge hunt of the supreme court of the united states the defendant pleaded not putting the government upon the proof of their entire case admitting however that she was woman but admitting nothing more the only evidence that she voted at all and that if at all she voted represe ntative in congress offered on the part of the government was that she handed four bits of paper folded in the form of ballots to the inspectors to be placed in the voting boxes there was nothing on the outside of these papers to indicate what they were and the contents were not known to the witnesses nor to the inspectors there were six ballot boxes and each elector had the right to cast six ballots this evidence would undoubtedly warrant the conclusion that miss anthony voted congressional representative the fact probably appearing although the papers before the writer not show it that one of the supposed ballots was placed by her direction in the box votes members of congress the facts are thus minutely stated not at all the purpose of questioning their sufﬁcien cy but to show how entirely it was question of fact and therefore question the jury upon this evidence judge hunt directed the clerk to enter up verdict of guilty the counsel the defendant interposed but without effect the judge closing the discussion by saying take the verdict mr clerk the clerk then said gentlemen of the jury hearken to your verdict the court has recorded it you say you ﬁnd the defendant guilty of the offence whereof she stands indicted and so say you all to this the jury made response and were immediately after dismissed it is stated in one of the public papers by person present at the trial that immediately after the dismissal of the jury one of the jurors said to him that that was not his verdict nor that of the rest and that if he could have spoken he should have answered not guilty and that other jurors would have sustained him in it the writer has authority this statement beyond the letter mentioned the juror of course had right when the verdict was read by the clerk to declare that it was not his verdict but it is not strange perhaps that an ordinary juror with time to consider or to consult with his fellows and probably ignorant of his rights and in awe of the court should have failed to assert himself at such moment probably the assumption by the judge that miss anthony in fact voted did her real injustice it was notorious fact that she did vote and claimed the right to so but all this made it less an usurpation the judge to take the case from the jury and order verdict of guilty to be entered up without consulting them there was however real injustice done her by the course of the judge inasmuch the mere fact of her voting and voting unlawfully was not enough her conviction it is perfectly settled rule of law that there must exist an intention to an illegal act to make an act crime it is of course not necessary that person perpetrating crime should have an actual knowledge of certain law which forbids the act but he must have the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https intent thus if one is charged with theft and admits the taking of the property which is clearly proved to have belonged to another it is yet good defence that he really believed that he had right to take it or that he took it by mistake just so in case where sometimes occurs the laws regulating the right to vote in state are of doubtful meaning and voter is uncertain whether he has right to vote in one town or another and upon taking advice from good counsel honestly makes up his mind that he has right to vote in the town of in this belief he applies to the registrars of that town who upon the statement of the facts are of the opinion that he has right to vote there and place his name upon the list and on election day he votes there without objection now if he should be prosecuted illegal voting it would not be enough that he acknowledged the fact of voting and that the judge was of the opinion that his view of the law was wrong there would remain another and most vital question in the case and that is did he intend to vote unlawfully now precisely the wrong that would be done to the voter in the case we are supposing by the judge ordering verdict of guilty to be entered up was done by that course in miss anthony case she thoroughly believed that she had right to vote in addition to this she had consulted one of the ablest lawyers in western new york who gave it his opinion that she had right to vote and who testiﬁed on the trial that he had given her that advice the act of congress upon which the prosecution was founded uses the term knowingly shall knowingly vote or attempt to vote in the name of any other person or more than once at the same election any candidate the same ofﬁce or vote at place where he may not be lawfully entitled to vote or without having lawful right to vote here most manifestly the term knowingly does not apply to the mere act of voting it is hardly possible that man should vote and not know the fact that he is voting the statute will bear possible construction but that which makes the term knowingly apply to the illegality of the act thus shall knowingly vote without having lawful right to vote can only mean shall vote knowing that there is lawful right to vote this being so there was manifestly most vital question beyond that of the fact of voting and of the conclusion of the judge that the voting was illegal did miss anthony vote knowing that she had right to vote now many people will say that miss anthony ought to have known that she had right to vote and will perhaps regard it an audacious attempt mere effect to assert right that she might think she ought to have but could not really have believed that she had but whatever degree of credit her claim to have acted honestly in the matter is entitled to whether to much or little or none it was entirely question the jury and they alone could pass upon it the judge had right even to express an opinion on the subject to the jury much less to instruct them upon it and least of all to order verdict of guilty without consulting them there seems to have been an impression the writer infers from various notices of the matter in the public papers that the case had resolved itself into pure question of law thus legal correspondent of one of our leading religious papers in defending the course of judge hunt says there was nothing before the court but pure question of law miss anthony violated the law of the state intentionally and deliberately she openly avowed and when brought to trial her only defence was that the law was unconstitutional here was nothing whatever to go to the jury and again he says in jury trials all questions of law are decide d by the judge this writer is referred to only expressing what are supposed to be the views of many others to show however how entirely incorrect is this assumption of fact i insert here the written points submitted by miss anthony counsel to the court its instruction to the jury if the defendant at the time of voting believed that she had right to vote and voted in good faith in that belief she is not guilty of the of fence char ged determining the question whether she did or did not believe that she had right to vote the jury may take into consideration bearing upon that question the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https which she received from the counsel to whom she applied they may also take into consideration bearing upon the same question the fact that the inspectors considered the question and came to the conclusion that she had right to vote the jury have right to ﬁnd general verdict of guilty or not guilty they shall believe that she has or has not been guilty of the of fense prescribed in the statute this certainly makes it clear that the question was not pure question of law and that there was something to go to the jury and this would be so even if that writer erroneously supposes miss anthony had openly avowed before the court that she voted but even if this point be wholly laid out of the case and it had been conceded that miss anthony had knowingly violated the law if she should be proved to have voted at all so that the only questions before the court were she had voted charged and the law forbade her voting and if in this state of the case hundred witnesses had been brought by the government to testify that she had openly avowed in their presence that she had voted so that practically the question of her having voted was proved beyond all possible question still the judge would have right to order verdict of guilty the proof that she voted would still be evidence and mere evidence and judge has power whatever to deal with evidence he can deal only with the law of the case and the jury alone can deal with the facts but we will go further than this we will suppose that in new york in some of the states defendant in criminal case is allowed to testify and that miss anthony had gone upon the stand witness and had stated distinctly and unequivocally that she did in fact vote charged we must not forget that if this had actually occurred she would at the same time have stated that she voted in the full belief that she had right to vote and that she was advised by eminent counsel that she had such right state of the case which we have before referred to presenting vital question of fact the jury and which excludes the possibility of the case being legally dealt with by the judge alone but this point we are laying out of the case in the view we are now taking of it we will suppose that miss anthony not only testiﬁed that she voted in fact but also that she had belief that she had any right to vote making case where if the court should hold matter of law that she had right to vote there would seem to be possible verdict the jury to bring in but that of guilty even in this case which would seem to resolve itself much possible into mere question of law there is yet power whatever on the part of the judge to order verdict of guilty but it rests entirely in the judgment and conscience of the jury what verdict they will bring in they may act unwisely and unconscientiously perhaps by mere favoritism or weak sympathy or prejudice or on any other indefensible ground but yet they have entire power over the matter it is them ﬁnally to say what their verdict shall be and the judge has power beyond that of instruction upon the law involved in the case the proposition laid down by the writer before referred to that in jury trials all questions of law are decided by the judge is not unqualiﬁedly true it is so in civil causes but in criminal causes it has been holden by many of our best courts that the jury are judges of the law well of the facts pages could be ﬁlled with authorities in support of this proposition the courts hold however that the judges are to instruct the jury to the law and that it is their duty to take the law thus laid down but it has never been held that if the jury assume the responsibility of holding prisoner not guilty in the face of charge from the judge that required verdict of guilty where the question was wholly one of law they had not full power to it the question is one ordinarily of little practical importance but it here helps to make clear the very point we are discussing here the judge laid down the law correctly we will suppose certainly in terms that left the jury doubt to what he meant and here by all the authorities the jury ought matter of proper deference in one view or the project gutenberg ebook of trial of susan anthony https duty in the other to have adopted the view of the law given them by the judge but it was in either case the jury only who could apply the law to the case the judge could instruct but the jury only could apply the instruction that is the instruction of the judge matter how authoritative we may regard it could ﬁnd its way to the defendant only thr ough the ver dict of the jury it is only where the confession of facts is matter of record that is where the plea ﬁled or recorded in the case admits them that the judge can enter up judgment without the ﬁnding of jury thus if the defendant pleads guilty there is need of jury ﬁnding him so if however he pleads not guilty then matter how overwhelming is the testimony against him on the trial matter if hundred witnesses prove his admission of all the facts the whole is not legally decisive like plea of guilty but the question still remains question of fact and the jury alone can determine what the verdict shall be in other words it is less question of fact the reason that the evidence is all one way and overwhelming or that the defend ant has in his testimony admitted all the facts against himself the writer has intended this article general rather than professional readers and has therefore not encumbered it with authorities but he has stated only rules and principles that are well established and familiar to all persons practising in our courts of law this case illustrates an important defect in the law with regard to the revision of verdicts and judgments in the united states circuit court in almost all other courts an application new trial on the ground of erroneous rulings by the judge is made to higher and independent tribunal in this court however an application new trial is addressed to and decided by the same judge who tried the case and whose erroneous rulings are complained of such motion was made and argued by miss anthony counsel before judge hunt who refuse d to grant new trial thus it was judge hunt alone who was to decide whether judge hunt was wrong it is manifest that the opportunity securing justice even before the most honest of judges would be somewhat less than before an entirely distinct tribunal the judge would be prejudiced in favor of his own opinion and the best and most learned of judges are human and fallible while if judge is disposed to be unfair it is perfectly easy him to suppress all attempts of party injured by his decision to set it aside the only remedy party thus wronged is by an appeal to the public such an appeal friend of justice and of the law without regard to miss anthony case in any other aspect the writer makes in this article the public thus the only appellate tribunal should willingly listen to such case and pass its own supreme and decisive judgment upon it the writer can not but regard judge hunt course not only irregular matter of law but very dangerous encroachment on the right of every person accused to be tried by jury it is by yielding to such encroachments that liberties are lost end of the
