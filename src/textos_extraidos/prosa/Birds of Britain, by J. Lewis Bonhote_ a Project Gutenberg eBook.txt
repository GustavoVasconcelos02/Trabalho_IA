thrush turdus viscivorus adult right young left preface the study of nature has of late years enormously increased and there is probably branch of its varied and inexhaustible interests which appeals more strongly to young and old than the fascinating study of birds every one feels more or less interested in birds whether it be from pure affection the robins and tits which beg our hospitality during the winter months or joy at the coming of the swallow and cuckoo heralds of spring some the interest is perhaps merely passing regret at the shooting of one of our rare and beautiful migrants while with others the real love of bird life makes it moment of intensest pleasure when instance the melodious note of the nightingale makes us dimly realise something of the innate beauty of nature

pages will be found not only descriptions and plates of the birds themselves but wherever possible notes on their ways and habits have also been given these notes having been taken at ﬁrst hand straight from nature it is hoped that they may give small insight into some of those beautiful mysteries which it is our ambition to unravel and that at the same time they may awaken and stimulate further desire to know still more of the workings of the great laws of the universe and the part they play in the lives of even the least of the feathered creatures it has been thought best to include in this book every species which has been known to occur in great britain with description of their leading characteristics and true habitat so that any bird met with may be easily identiﬁed and the plates have been carefully selected so to give examples of the most typical species facts relative to geographical distribution and other technical details the author has freely consulted howard saunders manual of british birds in conclusion the author hopes most sincerely that this book may often prove to be of help and service to the genuine seeker after reliable information on british birds and also that it may encourage observation and further research in branch of natural history where discovery ever stimulates to fresh discovery and where interest never fails lewis bonhote gade

which rose at our feet from behind tussock and uttering curious wild churring note darted away against the strong wind well has he earned his name of storm cock from his wild note and rapid ﬂight watch him now sustained by quick continuous and now the wind slackens carried along with dipping motion and outstretched wings the whole bird suggestive of strength and activity and ﬁckle and changeable in his moods the elements among which he delights to live it was in june that i ﬁrst saw him when he and others of his kind who but few months before were callow and helpless nestlings were learning from the summer gale taste of what they would have to face when winter brought its storms and tempests the storm cock is migrant to warmer climes and softer breezes but leads regular roving gipsy s life over our islands wandering from the northernmost corners of scotland to the south of england obeying will but his own and guided by special impu lse beyond that of satisfying his own appetite means difﬁcult task little in the way of berries or insects comes amiss to him his common name of missel thrush mistletoe thrush is derived from his supposed fondness this berry but this is point on which doubt still exists on the day when we ﬁrst saw him however he was engaged in picking up the ﬂies ants beetles and other live prey which the scanty vegetation on the hill enabled him to see and capture easily in spots where the ground was loose he would dig in his bill and turn over small bit of earth then stand with head held expectantly on one side literally waiting something to turn up often he would repeat this several times with little or result then all of sudden down would go his head and we would make out something between his mandibles then would come quick movement of his head and his beak would be empty again suddenly one of his brothers near uttered an and in an instant he was up and across the valley where the moment we could not follow him thus then he spends his life from may till january on cliffs by the sea on bare moorlands in thick the berries in their season form favourite open cultivated ﬁelds where the furrow has unearthed abundant in the country hedgerow where hips and haws elderberries and sloe are not less appreciated here and gone restless wandering bird early january however he begins to think of nesting and having secured mate retires to what is him comparatively sheltered spot either to wood or preferably to row of trees along hedge and not unfrequently to some in an orchard or garden whether or not the missel thrush returns year after year to the same spot to nest we can not say but rule the same garden or row of trees will every spring shelter pair of these birds if once they have nested there although he may probably build his nest quite close to our house yet the miss el thrush is always wild and shy and is rarely seen except he ﬂies over the garden uttering his unmistakab le note or he sits on the topmost branch of some tall tree and sings his to his mate below the song is wild and consists of somewhat incoherent medley of notes which if not calculated to appeal especially to our musical ear strikes at any rate note of harmony with the winter s wind the nest is placed on horizontal branch some 10 or 12 feet from the ground and often at some distance from the trunk of the tree the missel thrush is very conservative in its choice of site and seldom if ever chooses any other position when built the nest is fairly conspicuous object with its foundation of twigs and mud and lined with grass and hay towards the end of february however we shall one day be surprised to see large nest in some conspicuous position and on exam ination will probably discover the hen sitting on four to six eggs of bluish colour with large reddish spots and blotches fairly evenly distributed over their surface but even now although we know exactly where the nest of these shy birds is it will not be easy to see much of them when the young are hatched both parents attend most assiduously to the wants of the brood feeding them on the favourite food of almost all the thrushes by the end of march the ﬁrst brood is on the wing and the parents busy themselves with new nest the reception of their second family these too are hatched and on the wing by the middle of may and then the whole family young and old leave their home to wander round the country until another january brings them back again to add their note of harmony to the winter s wind the upper parts are of uniform ash brown under parts bufﬁsh white thickly spotted with dark brown the sexes are alike in plumage the young has the upper parts spotted with buf f and the spots below are much smaller length 1 1 in wing 6 birds of britain by lewis bonhote project gutenberg ebook https song thrush turdus musicus linnæus one of the ﬁrst signs that winter is thinking of releasing its grasp and that spring if still some way off is nevertheless on the way is the clear melodious song of the song thrush soon after daybreak having breakfasted off the early worm this bird may be heard in almost every garden that can boast of shrub large enough to conceal him and his nest any sort of cultivated country forms his home either the broad ﬁelds scanty hedgerows the garden of the wealthy or even the small and dusty plot of the song thrush turdus musicus his food consists chieﬂy of insects though worms form considerable part of his diet and snails are delicacy of which he is extremely fond there must be few people who have not noticed our brown friend hopping down the garden path with his peculiar sidelong leaps now and then varied by two or three quick short steps he conveys snail to his favourite abattoir this usually consists of smooth stone on which the unfortunate snail is beaten till his house falls from him when this is accomplished there is quick gulp and he is gone thus refreshed our friend birds of britain

leg he will whistle his song which has been rendered by some writers in the following words deal wet deal wet deal wet i i i who d it pretty dick pretty dick pretty dick who d this will go on some time until perhaps he happens to glance down at the lawn which he considers his especial preserve here he sees something which causes his song to cease in an instant it is his rival openly ﬂaunting himself before him there is swirl of wings he rushes to the attack they meet their bills snap violently and there is every prospect of ﬁght then suddenly the rival retreats precipitately into the nearest bush hotly pursued by our friend and we have time to notice the peculiar way in which the tail and wings are spread they disappear then we see more such is the life of one of our commonest birds we may witness it any day in early spring by the end of march or even earlier its nest may be found in some sheltered nook it is not often more than 10 feet from the ground and is generally in the fork of some tree or bush or on the beam of some old barn or potting shed perhaps it may be found in the middle of hedgerow or occasionally even on the ground it is composed of rough grass and bents and lined with mud pressed round and smoothed so to form fairly deep cup the eggs are ﬁve in number and in colour are beautiful pale blue with few small black or spots towards the larger end these markings being in some cases entirely lacking after fortnight s incubation the young are hatched they are then almost naked and only slightly covered with down incubation is carried on by the hen alone but both birds assist in the feeding the diet consisting almost entirely of in about fortnight to three weeks after the young are hatched they leave the nest to ﬁnd and earn their own living whilst their parents busy themselves with the cares of another family pair of birds gener ally rears three broods in the season after the rearing of the last brood which is over by the end of june or early in july both old and young begin to moult consequently at this time of year they are very quiet and skulking in their habits but we may sometimes catch sight of them in the evenings and early mornings when they come out to feed on lawns and ﬁelds where the grass is short and where their favourite abound about the end of august close observer will often miss his little friend few days or even weeks then one morning he will again see the familiar ﬁgure on the lawn and think that perhaps his companion has returned but it is not so the spring visitor has gone to another part of the country probably not very far away this species is only partial migrant but nevertheless he has gone and the bird which has taken his place has come from some more northerly locality to spend the winter probably we not notice the change and put down the temporary disappearance of our particular song thrush to the fact that we chanced not to see him it is not so however our friend of spring and summer has departed the general colour above including mantle and wings is uniform olive brow n some of the major and median covers having bufﬁsh tips breast yellowish spotted with triangular spots the ﬂanks uniformly olive chin and throat white margined with row of dark streaks belly white bill brown base of lower mandible paler legs pale ﬂesh iris hazel length in wing in young birds are spotted on the upper parts this species is widely and generally distributed throughout the british isles the redwing turdus iliacus linnæus from the middle to the end of october when the leaves are falling thickly from the trees and the dull dark days of winter are beginning to make themselves felt we may be aware while walking along country lane or throug h park of new arrival among our birds there rises probably from the ground bird whose quick movement will at once catch our eye and being in company with others similar to himself we shall have difﬁculty in recognising the redwing tired possibly by his long journey he will settle on the hedge little in front of us and begin diligently feeding on any berries he can ﬁnd but little in that line comes amiss to our friend and soon he will again drop to the ground and we shall get glimpse of the deep red feathers under his wings from which he has derived his trivial name at this season of the year redwings are essentially wanderers moving about in ﬂocks of from dozen to thirty or more stopping here and there where food is plentiful few days or weeks and then moving on always southward lack of food or the severity of the weather dictates if the winter be mild they may be found roosting in large numbers in thick hawthorn hedges or small plantations although fond of cover and spending most of their time among under growth on the ground they are not very partial to large woods preferring thick hedgerows or small coppices cold north wind accompanied by snow and frost drives most of these birds away from our shores to sunnier climes their place however is soon taken if the hard weather be prolonged by large immigrations of poor birds from the north of the continent who reach us with barely sufﬁcient strength to seek their food and who receive too frequently an inhospitable reception such wanderers become exceedingly tame and may be found hopping disconsolately round our gardens within foot or two of us and the mortality in such seasons these must be very great happily this extreme severity does not often happen and one is glad to think that rule our visitors driven to us by hard weather abroad ﬁnd sustenance in our warmer if still somewhat boisterous climate in april that strange homing instinct which animates almost every known bird causes the redwings to leave our hedgerows at their most beautiful time and to seek northern home where they may settle down and rear their young there where are scarce his little warble which would be unnoticed here in our wealth of songs ters is eagerly awaited and eulogised though it were the rich outpourings of nightingale his nest is built on the ground or just above it at the foot of some bush or even in crevice short distance up the trunk of tree but if so far north to be beyond the limit of tree growth sloping bank or the shelter of some boulder will be selected the site the nest is substantially built of grass with foundation of twigs and is similar to that of our blackbird to which species also the eggs though slightly smaller bear close resemblance two broods are sometimes reared in the season especially in the more southerly parts of its breeding range and after the duties of family life are over the birds unite in small ﬂocks lingering in their northern home till autumnal storms drive them once more among us the male in winter is uniform olive brown above chest and chin pale buff thickly and irregularly streaked with dark brown sides of face dark brown light bufﬁsh or white superciliary streak running from the base of the upper mandible over the eye flanks deep rich chestnut remainder of lower parts white slightly streaked on the sides with olive brown bill dark horn colour legs pale ﬂesh length in wing in the sexes are similar in plumage but the female is paler and duller in colour than the male the young bird is spotted on the back and after the autumn moult may still be recognised by the pale tips to the wing coverts its breeding range extends north of from the yenesei westward to scandinavia and its breeding in our islands has not yet been authenticated in winter it is found throughout the south of europe extending eastwards through persia and turkestan the fieldfare turdus pilaris birds of britain by lewis bonhote project gutenberg ebook https 12 13 fieldf are turdus pilaris adult left and centr young right an unwonted note strikes our ears sort of chack or chick and looking round we see that it proceeds from ﬂock of ten or dozen birds ﬂying on straight course high in the air with quick and regular at ﬁrst sight they appear like missel thrushes but their ﬂight is less erratic and their unmistakable note tells us that the last of our migrant thrushes has arrived to spend the winter with us like the redwing the fieldfare is emphatically bird of the north although he always nests in trees he does not touch high latitudes like the redwing being restrained in that direction by the limit of tree growth in summer the woods of the far north form his home and if he himself felt the solitude and intense stillness that reigns there he breeds generally in small colonies of from ten to dozen pairs the nests are generally placed in the ﬁrst fork of birch tree from 4 to 8 feet above the ground the eggs closely resemble those of the missel thrush but are rather smaller the fieldfare s song is very feeble and consists of an incoherent warble varied with the chack chack of his however he is not the only denizen of the woods that feels the need of companionship it will generally be found that few pairs of redwings have also nested near the colony and their more melodious song is an added element of cheerfulness amid such surroundings the young fieldfare is hatched and is carefully tended by his parents who supply him with worms insects beetles and in fact any small living thing that they can capture they are most bold and noisy in defence of their young ﬂying close round an intruder s head and uttering their unceasingly the young bird being duly ﬂedged leaves his nest and in company with others of his own age wanders about the woods feeding on insects or any fruit he can ﬁnd while his parents to make the most of the short summer busy themselves with the cares of second brood it is not until the ﬁrst storms and snows of winter come that the fieldfare leaves his summer home though during the few weeks that have elapsed since he left the nest he may have wandered aimlessly far from his birthplace the chill mists of autumn however remind him that he must move south so reluctantly if clinging to the edge of winter he ﬁnally takes ﬂight and we in england hear his chack chack toward s the end of october his numbers being continually augmented each fresh northerly blast drives some of his kind farther and farther south while with us he is essentially sociable bird he attaches himself to wandering ﬂocks of missel thrushes and redwings and among the former he may always be distinguished by his rump which shows up conspicuously against the darker wings and mantle thus he wanders the whole winter through feeding chieﬂy on the hips and haws in the hedges and probably also on worms and grubs he may frequently be met with in ploughed ﬁelds at night with much chackin g he goes to roost in some thick hedge coppice or plantation where in company with the missel thrushes he will seek the highest branches while the redwing roosts in the thicker growth below in hard weather he does not seem to suffer like the redwing possibly from his marked preference berries which even the heaviest snow does not cover it would seem if the long journeys which he has to take were distasteful to him summer is nearly with us before the last fieldfares have left our shores not uncommonly they may be seen until the middle of may or perchance he knows that the inhospitable climate to which he resorts to breed driven by some irresistible and incomprehensible force will not till then afford him and his progeny the necessary sustenance be that it may we can still hear his cheery voice long after we have left winter behind us the sexes are alike in plumage but the female is rather paler in colouring the adult male in winter has the head and neck slate grey the feathers of the crown having dark centres which are hardly noticeable at this season mantle and scapulars deep rufous brown wing coverts less rufous and showing traces of paler tips rump grey quills and tail dark brown pale yellow streaked with dark brown on the sides chest rufous streaked with brown ﬂank feathers dark brown with broad white margins concealing the darker colour lower breast and chest white in summer the pale edgings to the under parts wear off causing him to become nearly black on the ﬂanks and lower breast while the dark streaks on the crown become much more conspicuous bill horn coloured in winter yellow in summer legs and feet dark brown total length 10 in wing in the plumage of the young bird resembles that of the adult on the back but the head and rump are much browner some of the feathers of the mantle have lightish centres though the amount and extent of these varies greatly below it is of uniform pale yellow deeper on the breast each feather having black terminal birds of britain by lewis bonhote project gutenberg ebook https 15

though there are said to be isolated colonies in the high mountain regions of central europe the alps and the pyrenees its winter migrations extend throughout the whole of southern europe and asia minor including both sides of the mediterranean basin the thrush turdus atrigularis temminck this is an eastern species breeding in siberia from the ural mountains eastwards and wintering in persia afghanistan and india stragglers have frequently been obtained in europe and two or three examples have been taken in these islands the adult is brown on the upper parts and whitish below except the chin which is spotted and the throat and breast which are black length in wing in white s thrush turdus varius pallas large thrush rather bigger than missel thrush and not unlike that species in its immature plumage it is of extremely rare occurrence on our islands and has only been obtained in about eight or nine counties of england and on three occasions in ireland young missel thrushes have been frequently recorded belonging to this species white s thrush may however always be distinguished by having fourteen tail feathers instead of twelve and the under side of the wing which in the missel thrush is pure white has in this species broad black bar across the centre its summer home lies across siberia east of the yenesei through northern china and japan whence it migrates in winter to south china and the philippines the blackbird turdus merula linnæus mingling with the song thrushes on the lawn but always recognisable by his much longer tail and darker colour we may at all times of the year see the blackbird he is hardly so familiar his neighbour the thrush and prefers to keep near the shrubbery where on the least sign of real or imaginary danger he may retire and by remaining motionless be secure from observation but if we follow him and approach too near he will ﬂy away uttering his loud of cluck cluck he will not be long away however and if we remain quiet he will soon be back again crossing the lawn with long measured hops stopping now and again to look round and to spread and ﬂirt his broad tail the missel thrush will be sitting on the eggs and the song thrush will have nearly completed her nest before our sable friend begins to think of matrimonial cares towards the end of february his clear notes will be heard from the shrubbery or song which if more mellow in tone is far shorter and more monotonous than that of the song thrush although the performance of some individual blackbirds is longer and more pleasing he will now sing almost continuously with the exception of few short intervals spent in chasing his mate who unlike him wears dull suit of russet brown and he will have to prove himself preux chevalier ere he can win his lady fair there will almost certainly be two or three other suitors to ﬁght and the victor alone can claim the lady while the ousted competitors retire from the ﬁeld this extreme combativeness makes the species appear scarcer than is really the case each pair will claim suzerain rights over comparatively large space the nest is built low down in some bush or hedgerow on the ground in bank in furze bush or on heath and is formed entirely of grass and bents with little mud the foundation but well lined with ﬁner bents it is rather larger in diameter and shallower than that of the thrush the eggs four to six in number have pale blue ground colour thickly mottl ed with reddish markings sometimes uniformly distributed over its surface at others conﬁned to broader blotches forming ring round its larger end or again in some cases the markings may be entirely absent the young like those of most thrushes are fed almost entirely on earthworms though insects are also swallowed two or three broods are reared in the season and summer advances and fruit ripens visits are paid to the neighbouring orchards and gardens the spoils from which form during the season very large proportion of their diet so there is doubt that the gardeners complaints of them are only too well justiﬁed with the advent of the migration season in september and october large numbers leave our shores only we fear to be caught and eaten by our neighbours across the channel where members of the thrush family are considered great delicacies many however remain spending the winter in thick hedgerows

their home unless driven away by stronger rivals and so it happens that year by year winter relaxes its grasp we can see our friend on his accustomed perch in hedge or bush singing away in full consciousness that his own power has earned him the right to so and quite prepared to defend it again and again till in course of time he is ousted by another minstrel who reigns in his stead by the law that might is the blackbirds found migrating along our shores are either the surplus population driven farther aﬁeld by competition or wanderers from the colder parts of the continent of europe from which it regularly migrates the male is of uniform deep glossy black with bright orange bill legs and feet black iris hazel young males in their ﬁrst winter have black bill total length in wing 5

mottled with lighter vent sooty grey the young of both sexes resemble the female in general appearance but the feathers of the head and back have light shafts young males are shade darker in colour generally distributed throughout the british isles except shetland and the outer hebrides where it only occurs on migration the dusky thrush turdus dubius bechstein this species breeds in eastern siberia from the valley of the yenesei to the paciﬁc several stragglers have been obtained at different times in europe but the only british example was shot in 1905 near gunthorpe notts the general

clucking note is often repeated he ﬂies round us several times continually settling few seconds to make sure whether our presence is good or ill before he betrays the whereabouts of his nest the interest of his life at the present time soon he takes another ﬂight and we lose sight of him he disappears in small gully following quickly we are just able to see his mate come from the steep side of the ravine and almost simultaneously he appears and joins her in ﬂuttering round us in terrible state of agitation and doubtless with feeling that had he been more patient we should have gone away without ﬁnding his home however his cries produce effect he ﬂies off and settles some distance away few feet down the bank and cunningly hidden near underneath an overhanging tuft is the nest built almost entirely of grass and bents is the case with most of the thrushes but with little or mud the young four in number being well grown scramble out of the nest calling out at the same time and bringing their parents round us again more vociferous than ever we have however evil intentions and having satisﬁed our curiosity we continue our walk suddenly bird rises from behind stone at our feet

dark just little lighter on the breast and we recognise if we did not already know it young bird strongly on the wing few yards farther on we see hen bird possibly his mother she leaves her nest with

the summer nesting either already described or in holes of old walls barns or in fact wherever spot can be found well concealed and sheltered from the wind towards the end of september he leaves his summer home and is then generally distributed throughout the country although often overlooked owing to his resemblance to blackbird when seen from short distance watch him however till he settles when alarmed he invariably perches on the top of the hedge before dropping down the other side while the blackbird with his characteristic motion of the tail enters the hedge at once low down on the

suddenly break off his song seize the tempting morsel and ﬂy up again with his sharp chack the nest is somewhat difﬁcult to ﬁnd and rule can only be discovered by watching the hen bird who may be recognised by her browner tints if however she suspects you of watching her she will refuse to return some considerable time if you allow your attention to be diverted she will seize the opportunity to dart home and your trouble will have been in vain with the wants however of six children to attend to she will betray less caution both parents then look after the young and they may be watched with comparative ease having secured luscious beakful of insects spiders especially being great delicacy they hop or dart with their peculiar sharp ﬂight from point to point till ﬁnally they are gone and on approaching the spot where they vanished you will suddenly see them reappear from some hole or cranny the young leave the nest soon they are able to hop and ﬂutter and are then jealously guarded by their parents who ﬂy round in great excitement if you approach too near they are soon well on the wing however and the old birds are free to burden themselves with another family during the early part of may large variety of the wheatear may sometimes be seen most frequently along the these are birds whose home is in the far north and which regularly pass through these islands at this

though possessed of the most reliable of calendars they leave their tropical winter home when spring in temperate regions has well advanced not to be tempted by the attractions our country can offer in its most delightful month they pursue their journey with restless energy to the apparently inhospitable shores of greenland these wanderers however not concern us much they are gone and our summer residents are busy with their second brood and when this is hatched young and old spend the rest of the warm weather in their home renewing their plumage and preparing themselves the shortening days

merry little fellow is he arriving in this country with our other summer migrants about the middle of april his haunts are open ﬁelds and pastures so that he does not often come across his near relation the stonechat whom in actions and to some extent in dress he clearly resembles you will generally ﬁrst have your attention drawn to him by hearing his note of you walk across the ﬁeld and looking round you will see small bird hanging on to some slender stem which happens to be taller than its fellows if you approach nearer he will ﬂy little farther on and settle again his ﬂight and the habit of settling on some outstanding stem or spray is very reminiscent of the stonechat but in spring his much paler breast and head and bufﬁsh face will prevent any confusion the hens and the young more closely approach in general appearance to the allied species but the lesser amount of white on the tail and on the head may generally be noted soon after they arrive the nest is begun this is built on the ground either under tussock of grass or more preferably if possible in sloping bank it is loosely constructed of grass and bents and lined with horse hair the eggs six or even seven in number are pale blue very like those of the stonechat but bluer and with less of greenish hue rule they are absolutely unspotted but occasionally few minute rusty specks are present at the larger end the hen alone sits but both parents attend to the young soon the ﬁrst brood is on the wing generally by the end of may the parent birds busy themselves with the cares of another family after which they wander about the open and unenclosed country till at the end of august and during the ﬁrst half of september they leave our shores the summer regions of the south the male has the upper parts dark brow n mottled with buff there is clear white superciliary streak tail feathers dark brown with white bases wings brown showing conspicuous white patch near the body under parts bright fawn

his deep chestnut breast and head and back the otherwise comparatively lifeless spot you can not miss him or rather he will not miss you you approach he will rise and settle on the topmost spray of some furze bush or possibly on the tall stem of grass or thistle jerking his tail with the quivering movement characteristic of his tribe though it were on spring or uttering his little call of tick tick he will move ahead with dipping ﬂight to some other point of vantage you approach and display he does so the white on his tail and wings bright and happy little chap he is living in the open the whole year through ﬁnding there plenty of food which consists chieﬂy of caterpillars and other insects even in our inhospitable winters early in april he chooses his mate and sets up housekeeping the nest which is loosely built of grass and moss and lined with hair is very well concealed being placed near the ground in the centre of clump of furze or bramble there protected by the natural chevaux frise the six pure blue eggs are laid and in due course the young are hatched the male does not sit but is always to be seen in the vicinity of the nest and continually brings to his mate both parents tend the young with great care and after they have left the nest the family may often be found wandering about together the male on the approach of danger sitting on the topmost sprays of some bush while his family remain concealed in the cover following him singly or two or three at time he moves on second brood is generally reared in the season and in autumn after the moult certain amount of wandering takes place generally in family parties and at such times we may frequently ﬁnd them in turnip ﬁelds or on the edge of thick hedgerows in cultivated coun try these wanderings however not generally extend to any great distance from their true home to which or to some neighbouring common they return to spend the winter the plumage of the young is brown the female resembles the male except that the colouring is less brilliant and the white markings are not so conspicuous the male has the head throat and back black patch on either side of the neck white tail and wings dark brown with conspicuous white patch on the wing coverts breast and under parts bright rufous lighter on the abdomen the female has the upper parts striped with brown and the throat spotted with black the

pollard willows that fringe the stream his tail vibrating with that curious sideway motion peculi ar to his kind it is in these early april days that he is seen to best advantage staying in favoured spots till the advent of others of his tribe few days later causes him to select both mate and after which he drives to fresh ﬁelds and pastures new those of his kind who seem incline d to throw too amorous glances on his chosen mate hole in tree on the outskirts of wood along river or in park is the selected spot their residence the nest is loosely constructed of moss lined with hair and in it are laid ﬁve to six eggs of delicate blue colour much resembling those of the hedge sparrow the hen is much duller coloured bird than the cock but with red tail which she moves with the same characteristic motion she undertakes alone the duties of incubation her lord and master keeping her well fed with insects ﬂies and any living creature of suitable size that he is able to capture in the intervals of catering her or while listlessly waiting bite he will trill out his little song which is however very feeble in quality in quantity it consists merely of disconnected ramble through few short strains that are repeated again and again the male has the crown nape and mantle dark slate grey rump and tail feathers except the two centre ones which are brown chestnut forehead white chin throat and cheeks black under parts including the axillaries and under wing coverts chestnut the female is brown on the whole of the upper parts except the rump and tail which are chestnut in the

becoming more numerous in the east in the southern limits of its range and in north africa it is resident though its numbers become augmented each season by individuals that have bred farther north the male is extremely dark in appearance and may be easily recognised from the common redstart by its uniformly black breast the white outer margins to the secondaries and black under wing coverts the

which the blue throat exhibits red spot and the other in which the blue throat exhibits white spot the former form is found breeding in northern europe and siberia wintering chieﬂy in south asia and africa while the latter breeds in central europe south of the baltic the females and young of the two forms are practically indistinguishable it seems probable that few examples of this species occur annually on migration along our eastern coasts but much more numerously in some years than in others these visitors are the most part immature and until recently all the adult males that had been taken belonged to the northern or form during the last ﬁve years however two examples of the form have been obtained on the sussex coast there is variety of the form in which the throat is unspotted but it has not yet been satisfactorily identiﬁed in this country when on migration they will generally be found skulking in hedges and under growth near the coast the male has the upper parts of warm brown there is white stripe passing through the eye the upper tail coverts and bases of the tail feathers bright bay rest of tail dark brown chin throat and gorget brilliant ultramarine blue succeeded by bands of black white and bay rest of under parts whitish in the female the whole of the under parts are whitish with brownish band across the chest the young in ﬁrst plumage is not unlike young

and in turn acknowledges the compliment by trusting us few of our native birds it is in winter perhaps that we know him best however cold and stormy the weather he always appears happy cheerful and sprightly he hops along the garden path or seeks his breakfast at the window returning thanks by brilliant but short outburst of song from some neighbouring bush or wall he has only one fault and that is extreme birds not excluding that great bully the sparrow live in awe of him and keep respectful distance but it is different matter with those of his own kind who are always spoiling soon one has found good point of vantage or if he be not too hungry some dainty morsel he will call out with peculiar shrill single syllabled tzsee much to say i have found something good and dare you to take this

in some other part of the country and his place has been taken by another from the south there was probably short interregnum but we did not notice it imagining probably that more abundant food had caused him to refuse the modest pittance of that we were accustomed to put out daily his especial beneﬁt the is certainly rather shyer bird at least we see less of him but he is too busy to hang round the house when he ﬁrst comes he has to make sure of his footing any rivals within call have to be disposed of not in the way that was good enough during the winter but effectually disposed of once and all his next care is the choosing of comfortable site his nest this is generally in some hole in bank or wall at great height from the ground and concealed with considerable care the nest itself is chieﬂy composed of moss with lining of horsehair carefully felted together the robin is an early breed er the nest being often completed by the end of february or early in march but the eggs usually six in number and of pale f colour sometimes nearly white with red spots are not rule laid till quite the end of march or beginning of april is customary in this family the incubat ion is carried on by the hen alone while he roams about the vicinity feeding her opportunity offers or sitting on some twig trilling forth his song after the young are hatched he has but little time singing and has to

poets have sung his praises centuries and not in vain there are few who not in consequence feel desir to hear this unsurpassed musician of the bird world like all good things however our songster does not overwhelm us with his melody on his arrival in this country about the third week in april he bursts forth pouring out his ecstasy in glorious and varied song what thrill it gives us we listen on warm spring evening to the liquid notes bubbling forth and resounding through the still air he pauses breath and we can then hear in the distance the voice of another and yet another answering the song the more distant warbling sounding echoes of our own musician till the whole is full of exquisite melody we retire feeling in ourselves the magic of that breath of spring which has brought the wanderer to our shores once more to attempt to describe that song in words would be impossible loud and clear with deep liquid notes now rising with impassioned fervour and then suddenly stopping he

of the trees or bushes preferring to remain hidden in their lower birds of britain by lewis bonhote project gutenberg ebook https soon the young are hatched the song ceases and harsh croak is the only sound emitted he watches us passing near his nest one brood only is reared and then they seem to disappear from our shy and silent birds always keeping to the thick cover they spend few weeks quietly feeding on the abundance of insects provided at this time of year and then when the moult is over and they are strengthened their journey they leave us their sunny winter home in africa while we remain behind to cherish amidst gales and rain the memories of those glad spring nights the plumage above is warm brown passing to reddish brown on the tail and tail coverts under parts greyish white

month populate our hedgerows in numbers when he ﬁrst comes he may be seen sitting on some outstanding twig or on the telegraph wires that border the road trilling forth his short but pleasing song which like that of most warblers is mere medley of notes put together without any apparent order or meaning though to our little brown friend himself it is doubtless pleasing and it is indicative of the vigour and energy he feels with the prospect of the return of summer anon he will drop from his perch into the hedge throwing up his tail he does so rather after the manner of blackbird and will

are of colour blotched and spotted especially near the larger end with purplish blue the hen alone sits while her mate warbles his song to relieve her tedium or searches insects and ﬂies which he continually brings her the young are hatched in about eleven days and in another fortnight are hopping about accompanied by their parents who still tend them short time till the cares of another family engross their attention the rest of the summer these birds may be found in small parties in woods ﬁelds furze comm ons or hedgerows wherever cover is to be obtained feeding on caterpillars ﬂies

to the blackcap having song little if at all inferior to that of the prince of songsters comparisons are at all times odious and in this case misleading to our mind comparison can possibly be made between the two the song is not only dif ferent but lacks also the passion and tone so characteristic of the nightingale although few blackcaps sometimes winter in devon they are really migrants and we gladly welcome this little bird when he makes his appearance in the spring he will not often be seen like all his tribe he delights in woods and coppices keeping low down in their leafy shade and hopping along quietly from branch to branch we approach his nest is very slight made of dry grass lightly woven together and lined with little horsehair the eggs are very variable being usually of dirty creamish colour blotched and spotted with darker brown or sometimes of reddish tint with dark red spots their food consists almost entirely of insects and it is on this diet that the young are reared but the berries and fruit ripen in the hedges or our gardens large toll is taken especially of currants and raspberries of which they are extremely fond like the nightinga le their song ceases with the hatching of the young and the rest of the year they are almost silent except harsh scolding note if the nest or young are approached towards the end of summer it leaves us but some time

smaller size and darker legs the second quill is equal to the seventh and the outer webs are emar ginated near their tips up to and including the sixth in the willow wren the emar gination only reaches the ﬁfth and the second is equal in length to the sixth it should be remembered that the ﬁrst quill is very short and inconspicuous so that the ﬁrst apparent quill is the second this species

portions of our southern and midland counties becoming rarer towards the north in scotland it has only been observed in few counties and has never been met with in ireland it is very shy bird but is most interesting to observe he runs up and down with extreme facility assuming he does so many graceful and curious positions unlike the woodpeckers which only run up the trees it seems quite immaterial to this species whether he be going up down or sideways forwards or backwards in all positions he seems equally at home he will be more often heard than seen the sharp shrill note will betray his whereabouts though by keepi ng on the far side of the tree he avoids being seen insects are largely eaten in summer but seeds berries nuts and beechmast form his chief food nuts and hard seeds are taken to some convenient crevice in the bark and hammered with the sharp hard bill until an entrance having been effected the kernel can be pulled out and eaten some hole in tree or wall or more rarely in bank is chosen the site the entrance is generally plastered up with mud till only small circular hole just large enough to admit the bird is left the inside of the cavity is lined with few leaves and scraps of bark on which ﬁve to seven eggs boldly marked with reddish brown are laid these eggs bear close resemblance to those of the great tit but are general rule rather larger in the

very difﬁcult to detect and the which is weak and sit would not attract attention unless specially listened the nest which is built fairly high up near the top of tall hedge or in tree tall hawthorn being an especial favourite is composed of ﬁne twigs lined with rootlets and much resembles that of bullﬁnch except that the cup is considerably deeper the eggs are extremely handsome being of bluish

he will leave his haunts to forage in the nearest garden where often not he pays his rashness with his life his food consists almost entirely of seeds and berries insects forming very small portion of

numbers in addition to which the higher and more scientiﬁc methods of farming have sadly restricted his legislation however has stepped in so that although still comparatively local bird he is steadily increasing in numbers and we have reason to hope that he may long remain welcome inhabitant of our ﬁelds the whole winter is spent roaming about on waste lands feeding on seeds or berries and destroying countless weeds which would otherwise overrun the land in spring the ﬂocks break up and our friend returns to the orchard or garden where he nested the previous year he constructs an open nest of moss bents and small twigs fairly high up in some tree often covering the outside with lichen to assimilate better with its surroundings the lining consists chieﬂy of hair and and the eggs are blue spotted and streaked especially at their larger ends with reddish brown the young are fed at ﬁrst by the regur gitation of food from the crops of their parents and at this time of year large number of insects are consumed two broods are often raised during the season and then the family party wanders out into the open ﬁelds to seek their food returning at night to the gardens till they

necessarily the case the siskin carduelis spinus linnæus though nearly allied to the goldﬁnch this bird is very different in appearance being much smaller and of yellowish green with black markings scotland is its chief home where it lives among the making excursions daily into the open country to seek its food in winter it wanders through our islands but is never very abundant and always irregular in its visits it has occasionally nested in ﬁr plantations in the south of england but it is only in the corner of scotland that it may be considered common breeding species the nest is placed near the top of or at the end of lateral branch at some distance from the ground the materials are similar to those used by the goldﬁnch and the eggs also bear close resemblance to those of that species but are slightly smaller it has pretty little song rather more melodious and varied than that of the goldﬁnch and when courting will frequently rise in the air and slowly descend with ﬂuttering wings and outspread tail aphides when in season form large portion of their diet and from this point of view they prove themselves of great service to man the rest any seed or berry is eaten

breast are yellow upper parts and ﬂanks olive streaked with brown belly white the female and young only differ from the male in being duller and in winter both sexes exhibit far less yellow length in wing in the passer domesticus linnæus noisy quarrelsome and vicious will perhaps sum up the character of this species cunning crafty hardy and omnivorous he is always literally in clover and under such circumstances is it to be wondered at that his numbers have increased so to be beyond all limits wherever man settles there sooner or later will he make his appearance sitting on the roof or in the shrubbery and uttering especially in the mornings his monotonous and impertinent chirp in spring he pulls up the crocuses later he turns his attention to young and succulent plants just forcing their way above the ground or if lawn be the object of one s solicitude he will make it his business to see that the remains barren tableland summer comes on the are blocked by his untidy mere heap of straw and hay warmly lined with feathers if tree or the ivy against the house be chosen site the nest is better made and is in fact substantial structure with the entrance at the side but its position is readily betrayed by long untidy bits of straw left trailing outside the eggs are ﬁve or six in number and bluish white spotted and blotched with ash brown by the end of summer he will have reared two broods of ﬁve or six youngsters each and time our gardens are allowed brief respite while old and young gather in immense ﬂocks in the and then following the grain they spend some weeks round the stacks in the winter comes on they return once more to towns and gardens where by assuming cold and starved appearance they beg and frequently receive our charity till the blooming of the spring ﬂowers once more enables them to start their round of theft and damage so much their relations towards man and it is to be feared that their relations towards other birds have also redeeming point they are so quarrelsome that none of the more delicate and beautiful of our birds will live near them and the clinging to his home with pathetic persistence is driven away again and again by this impudent marauder is there however not one good word to be said him he is at least by means chestnut of his back his head black and white cheeks and black throat all tend to add touch of life and beauty to our gardens which they would otherwise lack and then in summer he destroys countless noxious insects while feeding his brood and in towns how companionable he is hopping about our or on the roadway evading the passing trafﬁc with knowledge born of long these at least are compensations that entitle him to some regard these arguments however all fail remove the sparrow and his place will soon be taken by other birds more beautiful who will destroy insects not merely when they have their broods but throughout the year and they will soon populate our towns and gardens to great an extent the present pest remove him yes but how there s the rub man in the face of the sparrow is at present powerless true the bitter war he deserves is not waged on him in this country but abroa d in australia and america relentless persecution is carried on and though his numbers may be kept in check he is still able to yearly inﬂict loss and damage that can only be measured in millions of pounds at the same time man is largely to blame this increase by careful farming woods and thickets which should shelter many other species of birds are cut down or reduced and thereby similar reduction of their inhabitants is created grain the sparrow s favouri food is cultivated in enormous quantities and birds of prey who might tend to keep the sparrow within reasonable limits are ruthlessly destroyed under these circumstances then is it to be wondered at that the sparrow having large number of his competitors food reduced his enemies swept away and unlimited food supplied should increase beyond all reasonable bounds espec ially if added to this we remember that he is exceedingly crafty and cunning soon recognising and avoiding traps and becoming very difﬁcult to approach in places where he is frequently shot at he is at the same time adaptable and able to attach himself to the dwellings of man who supplies him albeit involuntarily with plethora of food under such conditions his increase is only the result of one of nature s ﬁrst laws the survival of the this species is too well known to need description the female lacks the black on the throat and the grey and chestnut on

and streaks towards the larger end it is very silent bird and has song worthy of name the is insects and caterpillars are lar gely consumed during the summer but seeds and berries form their chief food in winter when ﬁrst hatched the bill in young birds is straight but it assumes its characteristic shape very soon after they are ﬂedged the adult male is crimson all over excep t the wings and tail which are brown the female is dark greenish yellow with striations of darker tint the young resemble the female but are greyer and greener young cocks probably not assume their full plumage until

is still debatable point the crossbill loxia bifasciata brehm this species whose true home is in northern russia and siberia has visited this country in small ﬂocks on several occasions it may easily be distinguished from the common crossbill by the two white it is also rather smaller in size length in wing in the bunting emberiza melanocephala scopoli the bunting must not be confused with the reed bunting which is known in many parts of the country under the former name the true bunting is an inhabitant of europe but it occasionally wanders westwards and has been taken about four times in this country the male has the head black back brownish orange and under parts bright lemon yellow the female and young are yellowish brown and the male in autumn has the bright colours obscured by

without number the long that serves him song in appearance he much resembles the skylark but unlike that species which is always so alert and ever on the move the corn bunting spends most of his day sitting in an exposed situation on hedge or on some tall plant in the open ﬁeld the nest is fairly neat structure of grass roots and moss with lining of horsehair and is usually placed on the ground in the middle of ﬁeld and often at great distance from bush or some other post of vantage on which noted above he spends the greater part of the day the eggs are extremely handsome being of creamy white boldly blotched and scrolled with very dark brown insects and seeds are equally consumed and both being abundant on the cultivated land in which he delights he earns an easy living with the minimum of exertion during the winter months he loves company and consorts with the larks and finches generally roosting on the ground with the former the sexes are alike and have the upper parts pale brown streaked with darker shade of the same colour throat whitish margined with brown spots rest of the under parts bufﬁsh white spotted on the breast and ﬂanks with brown length 7 in wing in the young are rather darker and have the wing coverts broadly mar gined with fulvous it is by means so abundant the next species but is widely distributed in open wild or cultivated country the yellow bunting emberiza citrinella linnæus day after day throughout the spring and early summer months the yellow bunting may be found sitting on the topmost spray of hedge and repeating with monotonous frequency his little song which has often been rendered by the words little bit of bread and it is neither long nor pretty there is music in it and it is delivered without soul or fervour yet in open and cultivated country where the songs of the woodland birds are absent it forms on warm summer s day ﬁtting accompaniment to the more ambitious performance of the lark decked out in bright yellow livery toned down and shaded with other dark markings the yellow bunting receives too little recog nition at our hands and is not appreciated at his true worth harmless bright and sociab le in habits he may be found throughout the year in the open ﬁelds and hedgerows and except during the summer months when insects form large portion of his diet he is essentially destroying in countless numbers the seeds of the various weeds that have hard struggle life amongst the cultivated crops the nest is neat structure of grass roots and moss woven together and is lined with horsehair five eggs form the usual clutch they are whitish streaked and veined after the manner characteristic of this family with purplish red in autumn the young and old visit the standing crops in family parties and they pass the winter seeking their food on the ground in stubbles and fallows or visiting the the fallen grain the male has the head throat and under parts bright yellow spotted or streaked except on the throat with dark brown mantle yellowish brown with darker streaks rump reddish brown wings brown with broad deep rufous edgings to the secondaries and wing coverts tail feathers dark brown with white spots near the tip of the inner web of the two outer pairs the female resembles the male but it is very much duller and darker in colour the young are pale brown all over lighter on the under parts

male below young above this species is widely distributed throu ghout great britain and is often known the yellow hammer the latter word being corruption of ammer the german word bunting the cirl bunting emberiza cirlus linnæus this species is very similar to the yellow bunting in habits and plumage from which it may be most easily distinguished by the black throat and black line through the eye in our islands however it is very local and chieﬂy conﬁned to the southern counties but stragglers have been met with far north yorkshire although frequenting the hedgerows and open country it delights in trees uttering its song from the higher branches of some hedgerow elm the nest is placed near the ground and constructed of similar materials to that of the yellow bunting but the eggs differ in having the markings bolder and chieﬂy restricted to the larger end and the hair lines so numerous on those of the former species are much fewer in number two broods are reared in the season the young birds being fed on grasshoppers and insects and the rest of the year is spent in the ﬁelds in company with other ﬂocks of finches the male has the top of the head and nape and rump greyish green streaked with darker wing coverts and feathers of the mantle deep reddish brown with dark median spot or streak and broad light margins wing and tail dark brown cheeks yellow with black line through the eye chin and throat black succeeded by narrow yellow collar upper breast grey lower breast chestnut rest of under parts pale yellow becoming brownish streaked with darker on the ﬂanks the female is much duller in colour and has the throat yellow she closely resembles the hen yellow hammer but may be distinguished by the absence of yellow on the head and by the lesser wing coverts being reddish brown and not black the young roughly resemble the female length in wing in the ortolan bunting emberiza hortulana birds of britain by lewis bonhote project gutenberg ebook https to within the last few years this bird was so freely imported alive to supply the wants of epicures that large number of its supposed occurrences in these islands are open to suspicion there seems however little

yellow with narrow chestnut collar across the uppe r breast length 5 in wing in the female is much duller and in winter the colours in both sexes are obscured by long greyish mar gins reed bunting emberiza schœniclus linnæus the reed bunting is an inhabitant of marshy places where osiers alders and long rough sedgy grass and reeds abound and in such localities it is by means uncommon in summer the male may often be seen clinging to some reed stem he sings his very short and feeble song owing to his black head and white collar which enable him to be very easily distinguished he is known in some parts of the country the bunting the true bunting is however very different bird but it so rarely occurs in this country that the confusion likely to arise is not very serious the nest is placed on the ground in the rough grass at the base of some shrub or in the side of tussock and always near water it is fairly neat structure built like the nests of all buntings of grass bents and moss with lining of hair the eggs four to six in number are very characteristic of this species the ground colour is usually purplish grey boldly blotched marked and streaked with dark brown very handsome clutches are sometimes found in which the ground colour is pale green showing off the dark scrolls and blotches to great advantage if the nest be discovered and frequently visited after the young are hatched they will leave it at very early age long before they can ﬂy in such cases however the anxiety of the parent birds they ﬂy round and round the spot soon leads to the discovery of their children except under stress of weather it is very resident species seldom leaving its favourite haunts but sometimes in winter when these are frozen over it will be found in the ﬁelds consorting with large ﬂocks of buntings and finches rule however it is by means gregarious rarely more than ten or twelve being found together in summer the male has the whole of the head and chin deep black

to us by the appearance of few stragglers that have wandered here from time to time in autumn and winter though during the last few years its occurrences have been more numerous and regular especially along our eastern and shores in its winter dress it bears at distance superﬁcial resemblance to the lark and from being found in situations viz salt marshes near the coast where the latter is also abundant it has probably frequently been overlooked it is another of those species whose home is circumpolar and rears its young on the lonely tundras of lapland novaya zembla and franz josef land in winter it moves southward but becomes scarce south of the baltic and is unknown in italy the south of france and spain mentioned above the adult in winter is not unlike lark at distance but in summer the male is very handsome bird the crown cheeks throat and breast are black the hind neck is banded with deep chestnut which is separated from the black of the head by white stripe which starting

quietly just after dusk and then make noise will afford one sensation never to be forgotten they rise with sound like rolling thunder caused by the clattering of thousands of wings against the reeds while others farther off disturbed in turn will also rise until the whole ﬂock is on the wing circling round our head with subdued roar which increases and diminishes they approach or retreat in few minutes however if we remain quiet they will soon begin to return making sound except the rattling together of the reeds they settle and in few minutes all is quiet once more at daybreak the ﬂock divides into smaller parties which set out to forage in the neighbouring country in the afternoon their hunger is appeased the scattered ﬂocks begin to collect again and it is then that we may observe the evolutions referr ed to above till ﬁnally at dusk they are all roosting once more in the after staying in the locality some time their numbers being increased by fresh arrivals daily they will one night fail to return to their accustomed quarters but will instead start on long journey on which we are unable to follow them apart however from these large ﬂocks smaller bodies will be found throughout the winter wandering over the country and even penetrating the parks and gardens of our large cities in march and april migration of small ﬂocks returning to their accustomed breeding

to join with those from other nests and thus form the nucleus of the immense ﬂocks which are perhaps one of the main characteristics of this species it feeds chieﬂy on insects worms and slugs which are sought in damp meadows and it walks in curious deliberate way and on seeing likely worm casting it pushes in its closed beak and after drawing it back with open mandibles the hole thus enlar ged

wings then it glides onward with outstretched pinions the ends of the outer primaries being well separated from each other its wings close it drops towards the ground and then with few more beats it recovers its former level and continues its ﬂight this species which is only found on rocky coasts is yearly becoming scarcer but its chief enemy if we except the ubiquitous is one of its own family the jackdaw this latter species extends its breeding quarters so the chough has to give way before it being turned out of its nestin till weary of ineffectual attempts it leaves the locality in other places that king of falcons the peregrine will attack it resulting in its very rapid extermination this however is apparently an acquired taste on the part of certain peregrines only we have known

tops of the trees ﬂying off with many protestations to another part of the wood on the least sign of danger his great supposed sin is the destruction of the pheasants eggs though we doubt whether his depredations are sufﬁciently great to warrant his wholesale slaughter the fox has been saved from extermination in the interests of hunting and it is now conceded that after all his presence does not so greatly affect the interests of those whose sport lies with the gun rather than with the horse and if only keepers could be taught to leave the jay alone the loss of few head of game that would hardly be missed would surely be more than compensated by the sight of this beautiful species he dodges through the wood in front of the beaters better could be found and many trespasser will quit wood owing to the warning given by the jay noisy and active he is during the winter he becomes in spring exceptionally quiet and only when the nest is approached does he give any indication of his

the woods which formed his summer home but in the northern parts of his range on the continent he migrates sometimes in considerable ﬂocks some of which visit our shores in autumn and although these

young and sickly lambs it is unworthy of the persecution to which it is subjected scattered pairs are still to be met with round the rocky shores of england while in the wilder parts of scotland and ireland it is still comparatively common it chooses its home some wild precipitous crag exposed to the fury of the gales and there it may be found at all times of year ruling with uncontested sway

blotched with olive brown the female takes sole charge of the duties of incubation while her mate sitting near keeps close watch and attacks with great boldness and fury any other feathered marauder too often however their labours are in vain and man steps in and destroys the nest but ever faithful to the old home many pairs continue ineffectually to breed year after year near the same spot till at last in their old age they succumb to some winter s storm and the spot is the poorer by the loss of one of our noblest birds after the young are ﬂedged they remain with their parents some months

markings but except in size resemble those of the raven short time after the young are ﬂedged they wander about in family parties but they soon separate and after august more than pair are seldom seen together fact which will help to distinguish it at distance from the rook who is nearly always gregarious in general appearance this bird is very like the rook but it may be distinguished by the following charac ters the bill is much stouter and broader and not so long and slender its colour is black with greenish gloss and not of purplish blue and the feathers have white bases while those of the rook are grey the bristles and feathers at the base of the bill are never worn away is always the case with rooks after their second moult length in wing 13 in in this country it is generally distributed where not too strongly persecuted becoming commoner in scotland but in ireland it is very rare the hooded crow corvus cornix linnæus the question to whether this bird which interbreeds freely with the carrion crow where their ranges overlap is or is not good species need not trouble us here sufﬁce it to say that in england it occurs numerously regula r winter immigrant large numbers crossing the north sea and arriving on our eastern coasts over the rest of our islands its distribution is somewhat capricious in wales and the western counties it is rare whereas in ireland and scotland it is well distributed and resident in habits it resembles the carrion crow but is more found on the and estuaries than that species though it is also found in the wooded districts the back shoulder breast and under parts are ashy grey the rest of the body being black in the carrion crow of which in size and all other respects it is the exact counterpart the rook corvus frugilegus linnæus there is more delightful sound in early spring than the caw of the rooks at their rookeries their breeding places are called year after year they return regularly to the same clump of trees on the tops of which they build fairly substantial nest of sticks with an inner foundation of mud which is in turn warmly lined with roots straw and ﬁne grass the sites chosen their homes are more frequently than not near human habitations or on clumps of trees near highway and exceptionally they may choose pollards or low bushes but rule the nests are never less than twenty feet from the ground the eggs are bluish with olive brown spots and blotches resembling those of the carrion crow but smaller and more variable the young leave the nest just before they can ﬂy and may then be seen sitting on the topmost branches of the trees they sway in the wind this is the time when they are shot and also under the impression that if they are not thinned out the colony will be deserted this belief we are not aware that any proof exists but curiously enough colonies left to themselves tend to diminish these birds are rather capricious and will occasionally even in the nesting season desert the colony the presence in the neighbourhood of pair of carrion crows is sometimes the cause but more often than not the reason is not apparent soon the young can ﬂy towards the middle or end

grass lined with ﬁner materials and placed on the ground in the middle of an open ﬁeld the youthful lark has early to contend with enemies mice and other ground vermin or the heavy foot of some grazing cattle frequently destroy the nest and its contents and the fact that so many escape must be lar gely ascribed to good luck his food is of very varied nature and nothing comes amiss the young are fed exclusively on insects but after leaving the nest they spend their time eagerly feeding on seeds berries or anything that comes their way summer wanes giving place to autumn they collect in large ﬂocks and seek the stubble ﬁelds where the scattered grain gives them abundant nourishment and on which they become very fat it is at such times while they are asleep by night that they are netted by hundreds the market this form of catching can however only be successfully carried out shortly after dark on the blackest of nights like all wild animals they seem to rest with one eye open and should there be the faintest glimmer of light they will be up and away long before the is near them in october they become restless and many wander to the coast and thence to other countries their place being taken by the inhabitants of more northerly climates so the months pass until northerly gale and severe frost moves even these hardy northerners and at such times they may be seen migrating in millions they travel almost entirely by day relentlessly pursuing southerly course in front of the biting norther with change of wind and temperature large number will drift back again but the movement will not be so noticeable and thus they pass their lives wandering wherever the weather and food may dictate till in the very early days of spring or even on ﬁne days throughout the winter we may hear their voluble song breathing it does the joy of freedom in every note this is almost always uttered on the wing springing from the ground with rapid ﬂuttering wings he rises perpendicularly higher and higher till he is almost lost to sight in the clouds though his song still drifts down to us with unaffected clearness higher and higher he goes and then in spiral curve he slowly descends the song ceasing he reaches spot within few feet of where he rose is begun in april and several broods are reared in season the song being continued except when he is actually feeding young in the nest the adult has the general plumage of warm brownish tint mottled and streaked with darker shade there is superciliary streak the chin throat and upper breast and ﬂanks are brownish buff streaked with brown rest of under parts yellowish white the sexes are alike in plumage but the female is rather smaller measure them from tip to tip of the expanded wings rejecting those which are under one

bonhote project gutenberg ebook https 170 171 172adult left young right the wood lark alauda arborea linnæus the wood lark is much rarer bird than the skylark and very local in distribution rows of trees bordering open ﬁelds are the localities chieﬂy favoured by this species which except that it frequently perches and may often be heard singing from the topmost branch of tree much resembles its commoner congener in habits it feeds almost entirely on the ground living chieﬂy on insects the nest is placed few yards from the hedge and composed of bents and grass with lining of ﬁner materials the eggs usually four in number are of creamy ground colour very thickly freckled with reddish brown markings this species may be most easily distinguished by its song which is much sweeter and fuller in tone than that of the preceding bird but lacks the power and exuberance when rising from the ground to sing it always does so in wide spiral curve differing in that respect also from the skylark which rises straight the sexes are alike in plumage and resemble the skylark but it is smaller bird and has short hind toe and is more heavily streaked on the back length 6 in wing in the crested lark alauda cristata linnæus the crested lark is common species on the continent even close to our shores the north of france but very few examples have been known to stray to this country it is not gregarious like the common skylark and the song is not usually uttered on the wing but in food and other habits it does not dif fer much from our species in general colour this species is much duller and the beak is longer and stouter than the skylark but its chief characteristics are the long pointed crest the lar ge bastard primary and the absence of white on the tail length in wing in the lark alauda brachydactyla leisler this bird is resident or partial migrant throughout the whole of southern europe but it has been known to occur in northern germany belgium and the north of france in great britain about examples have been taken at various times in the south and east very similar in appearance to other larks but its name indicates the hind claw is short the under parts are white and unspotted except few streaks on the sides of the neck length in wing in the lark alauda sibirica gmelin this species breeds across central russ ia and through the kirghiz steppes far the altai migrating southwards in winter has only once occurred in england the bill is short and stout and this species may be at once recognised by the white inner primaries and secondaries which form conspicuous patch length in wing in the black lark melanocorypha yeltoniensis forster this species inhabits south russia transcaspia and western siberia in the winter of 1906 small ﬂock consisting of both males and females arrived in sussex being presumably driven westwards owing to the severity of the weather the male has the entire plumage jet black but in winter this colour is largely obscured by broad sandy margins to the feathers the female is pale sandy brown with darker markings under parts white spotted on the throat and breast length about in wing in shore lark otocorys alpestris linnæus very different bird is this from the other larks with which we have been dealing he is seldom seen in this country and then only in small numbers and at irregular periods the wide tundras of the north form his home and there he may be found plentifully but the long arctic day gives way to the cold black night he reluctantly retires and passes the winter in the temperate portions of the northern hemisphere in these islands we are just on the fringe of his wanderings and almost every year few stragglers put in an appearance on our eastern coast in autumn their visits are of but short duration and rule they quickly pass away southwards with very severe weather on the continent however they may appear in some numbers towards midwinter and at such times remain with us till at the ﬁrst sign of coming spring they are of f again to their dearly loved home in the birds of britain by lewis bonhote project gutenberg ebook https 174general colour above pale sandy brown tinged with rufous on the back of the head and nape forehead and superciliary stripe white band across the head lores cheeks and triangular band across the chest black rest of under parts white inclined to rufous on the breast and ﬂanks the female is smaller and duller length about 7 in wing in the swift cypselus apus linnæus the causes that govern the migratory movements of birds are still unknown some species are doubtless impelled by stress of weather or lack of food to seek other quarters but what power can it be that brings the swift thousands of miles from another continent to lay its eggs and rear its young and then precipitately to retire again when the ﬂies on which they feed are most abundant and the warmest month of the year has hardly begun it is one of the last of the summer birds to arrive may being generally well advanced before we hear its harsh yet pleasant scream of swee ree it swerves in rapid ﬂight round the cottage or belfry which is to form its summer home this species is the most aerial of all our native birds and is never seen to settle except when entering the hole under the eaves where it nests and in fact owing to the length of its wing and shortness of its legs it can not raise itself from level surface should it once settle gregarious in its habits it returns yearly to the same place and entering through hole or crevice under the eaves nests there in security swifts family differ from all other birds in using sticky mucous saliva with which to bind together rough bits of straw cobwebs feathers which form their nest the nests of certain foreign species are formed entirely of this saliva and such nests are eaten with great relish and in large quantities by the chinese with our species however the amount of saliva used is comparatively small it does not often collect material its nest but makes use of the accumulation of rubbish usually found under roofs and hollowing out shallow depression cements it into permanent cup two or three dull oblong white eggs form the clutch the young when ﬁrst hatched are naked they stay in the nest long time not leaving it until fully ﬂedged when however they leave their home and drop into the air the ﬁrst time they ﬂy off at once and appear much at home on the wing their parents few days they return to the nest to rest and then week or two after they are ﬂedged about the beginning of august they leave us their tropical winter home these birds occasionally perform curious aerial evolutions on warm summer nights darkness comes on they become very restless screaming round the tower or belfry they dash by in wide circles gradually they rise higher and higher in the air till they become mere specks and are ﬁnally lost in the darkness here again our ignorance comes in and our story must end observers have sat up in vain till two or three in the morning awaiting their return not one has reappeared and yet the next day they will all be seen back again apparently unwearied by their restless night but rather enjoying to the full the marvellous powers of ﬂight which they have inherited the sexes and young are alike in plumage and are of uniformly dark sooty brown the chin and throat being dull white the tail is short and slightly forked wings very long and narrow the feet are extremely feeble the four toes all directed forward and having sharp recurved nails which enable them to cling to perpendicular surfaces length in wing in it is generally abundantly distributed throughout our islands but becomes scarcer in the north it winters in birds of britain by lewis bonhote project gutenberg ebook https common swift cypselus apus the alpine swift cypselus melba linnæus this is much larger species than our common swift and has only visited these islands on very rare occasions almost all the examples obtained having been taken in the south of england it breeds in the high mountain ranges of central and southern europe and winters in africa from our common species it may be distinguished by its lar ger size browner colour and light under parts length 8 in wing in another species the swift acanthyllis caudacuta has occurred on two occasions in england it breeds in central

linnæus arriving the latest of all our migrants towards the middle of may and leaving again early in september this strange bird is but little known to the majority of people although by means uncommon in suitable localities its favourite haunts are gorse commons and moorlands on the edge of woods especially where bracken grows freely and in such situations it may be found throughout our islands the best time to see it is at dusk when it comes out to capture moths beetles and other crepuscular insects which form its chief sustenance its ﬂight is silent and very twisting and turning with great ease and agility now and again striking its wings together with loud clap and uttering at the same time sharp little whistle when resting on branch which it invariably does lengthways curious reeling note or vibrating churr is uttered nest is made but the two white eggs boldly blotched and mottled with brown and lilac are laid on the bare ground without any attempt at concealment the bird sits very closely and her dull greyish plumage so assimilates with her surroundings that it is almost impossible to see her until she rises and circles round uttering harsh chuck the young when ﬁrst hatched are covered with an ashy grey down and have even at this tender age the large mouth with enormous gape characteristic of this family they not remain in the nest till ﬂedged but crawl about on the ground they not however attempt to feed themselves and are carefully tended by their parents till they are well able to ﬂy when they at once quit this country to winter in tropical africa the plumage of both sexes is nearly alike and is ashy grey streaked and spotted irregularly with brown the male has white spot near the centre of each of the three outer primaries and the two outermost pairs of tail feathers are tipped with white these white markings are absent in the female the young practically resemble the female length in wing one example each of two other species of this family the nightjar caprimulgus ruﬁcollis and the egyptian nightjar caprimulgus ægyptius have been taken in england the ﬁrst named is native of southern spain and north africa far east tunisia the of the other are in europe egypt nubia and tunisia in general appearance they both closely resemble our common species the throated may however be recognised by the tawny collar encircling the head and the egyptian by the inner webs of the primaries being pure white the wryneck iynx torquilla linnæus under the name of the cuckoo s mate this species is well known in our southe rn and counties elsewhere in england it is rare or local and in scotland and ireland it is of very irregular occurrence the name cuckoo s mate is derived from the fact that its arrival usually coincides pretty closely with that of the cuckoo namely during the ﬁrst week in april but in other respects it has connection in habits or distribution with the better species owing to its dull and unobtrusive plumage and more especially from its custom of inhabiting gardens and woods it is not easy to see though to those who know its note which is sharp qui qui qui its presence will be frequently made known it feeds chieﬂy on ants which it searches on the ground or on these are rapidly conveyed to its mouth by quick motion of its long extensile tongue which is coated with sticky mucus and the rate at which this organ is shot forwards and backwards is almost incredible and reminds one rather of the tongue in the chameleons and some other lizards it breeds in the hole of tree and the six round white eggs are laid on the wood itself without any attempt at nest if the hole be visited during incubation the sitting bird will utter peculiar hissing noise and at the same time twist her neck in most surprising manner this habit which is well calculated to make the observer believe the hole to be tenanted by snake has given rise to the name of well the better one of wryneck the sexes are alike in plumage the general colour being greyish with dark streaks of brownish black on the nape and scapulars throat upper breast and ﬂanks yellowish becoming paler on the belly with narrow black bars and arrow markings the young are greyer and have yellow or markings on the under parts length 7 in wing in towards the end of september it takes its departure but some individuals frequently remain much later and probably occasionally spend the winter with birds of britain by lewis bonhote project gutenberg ebook https wryneck iynx torquilla the green woodpecker gecinus viridis linnæus the cheery pleu pleu pleu of the yafﬂe it ﬂies from one tree to another may be heard in most parts of england and wales though in scotland and ireland it is almost unknown it is and somewhat ungainly bird in its actions spending its life among trees though it by means restricts itself to woods especially in autumn when it may frequently be seen ascending some hedgerow tree with its characteristic jerking motion the stiff and pointed tail feathers aiding it to cling to the trunk its food consists of insects more especially beetles and ants which it ﬁnds in crevices of the bark but it often descends to the ground in search of food its ﬂight is direct and undulating and it proceeds by series of rapid followed by short falling period when the wings are half closed on the ground it progresses by short hops and when searching tree food it ascends spirally from the base in short jerks ﬂying off when near the top to recommence its search at the base of another early in april it begins to excavate choosing preference tree destitute of lower branches neat circular hole is chiselled out which is carried in horizontally some distance and then turns downwards special nest is made

stripe of the same colour edged with black the female has less crimson on the head and the malar stripes are black the young are mottled on the back and spotted on the under parts with blackish length in wing in the greater spotted woodpecker dendrocopus major linnæus although it can nowhere be called abundant this species is widely distributed in districts far north durham but in scotland it is scarce bird only nesting very sparingly in the south and in ireland it is almost unknown quiet and shy bird it is rarely seen keeping it does to the higher branches of tall trees and when possible keeping the trunk between it and any observer in its food and habits it resembles the green woodpecker though it is comparatively seldom seen on the ground the is sharp short chik but it makes also peculiar rattling sound by rapping its beak against bough this sound which is more often heard in early spring has been supposed to be made only at that season but it may also be heard though less frequently at other times of the year grea ter spotted woodpecker dendrocopus major male right female centr young left in winter this species is much given to wandering and every autumn our local birds receive further additions from scandinavia it can hardly however be considered regular winter visitor such immigrations are largely dependent on the season and it is only at irregular periods that really lar ge numbers arrive the upper parts of the male are chieﬂy black the forehead cheeks ear coverts and scapulars are white nape crimson wing feathers black barred with white on the outer

spotted woodpecker dendrocopus minor linnæus in many localities in the south the lesser spotted woodpecker may be almost considered common though from its small size and partiality to the topmost branches of tall trees it is but seldom seen in wales and north of the midlands it becomes extremely local and in scotland and ireland it has only been obtained rare straggler on few isolated occasions in food and habits it hardly differs from its larger congener but the nest is generally hewn out in some dead tree it has not occurred on migration the male has the upper parts chieﬂy black barred with white the forehead buff crown of the head crimson nape and malar stripe black cheeks white the under parts are bufﬁsh white with black streaks on the ﬂanks the female has only got little red on the fore part of the head length 6 in wing in the kingfisher alcedo ispida linnæus in spite of the ease with which he may be caught and the demand his skin brought about by his fatal beauty we are still able to reckon the kingﬁsher generally distributed species representative of family which is essentially associated with tropical climes he still wears his brilliant dress in these northern latitudes and resembles he darts with rapid ﬂight down our rivers and streams some huge turquoise having ﬁxed on favourite piece of water he seldom wanders far aﬁeld but may be seen at all times of the year sitting on an overhanging bough ever and anon dropping into the water to seize some passing ﬁsh his prey being captured he returns to his perch and kills the struggling ﬁsh by knocking it against his stand it is then swallowed head ﬁrst and he resumes his motionless watch if sport be slow and he be hungry he will wend his way with rapid ﬂight down the river to try his luck in another place and it is at such times that we shall probably get momentary glimpse of his brilliancy till curve in the stream hides him from birds of britain by lewis bonhote project gutenberg ebook https 184 kingfisher alcedo ispida mere cold does not seem to affect him in the least but when the streams are frozen he suffers greatly from hunger and after day or two of frosty weather he reluctantly leaves his accustomed home the milder reaches of the where the restless tide brings him in continual supply of food the however is not to his taste and at the ﬁrst of the frost he returns again to his inhospitable home early in april he turns his attention to housekeeping like most birds he has song with which to woo his mate but at such times they may often be seen chasing each other about up and down the stream uttering their shrill and sharp perpendicular wall in the bank of the river is chosen and near the top of this they excavate long low tunnel with the end slightly widened out to form chamber the nest is peculiar being formed of mass of small regur gitated bones and on this the six pure white and highly glossed eggs are laid soon the young are ﬂedged and thoroughly able to earn their own living they are driven away from their home and forced to seek winter elsewhere many especially in the northern portions of its range go to the and migrate while others seek out some quiet stream where they may ﬁsh in undisputed possession till the return of spring impels them to seek mate and form home themselves the sexes are practically alike in plumage the top of the head wings and

linnæus although stragglers of this beautiful and brilliant species have frequently visited this country in both the spring and autumn migrations it can by means be considered regular visitor to our shores it is very numerous in southern europe and breeds far north petersbur g and certain parts of sweden in the countries bordering the north sea however it is decidedly rare in winter it inhabits the southern portion of africa being numerous in cape colony and natal the sexes are alike the head neck and under parts are of brilliant greenish blue the mantle is brown and there is patch of gorgeous ultramarine blue on the lesser wing coverts length 12 in wing in the merops apiaster linnæus good many stragglers of this southern species have occurred from time to time chieﬂy in the

black band across the lower neck under parts greenish blue length in wing 6 in hoopoe upupa epops linnæus in the spring of every year with unfailing regularity few misguided individuals of this interesting bird seek the hospitality of our shores and were they unmolested would eventually settle one of our permanent summer visitors in the southern counties unfortunately apart from its striking plumage which can not fail to arrest attention it is of very conﬁding nature stalking about lawns and grass ﬁelds with its peculiar walk while it prods the ground with its long bill in search of grubs and insects such sight is too much the collector or ignorant loafer whose only idea on seeing strange bird is to kill it and thus it happens that our guest either reposes fearful caricature in glass case till moth and rust have done their work or is frighte ned off to some other country where his appearance excites less curiosity and murder from time to time however protected by some enlightened farmer or landowner this species has been spared to pass the summer unmolested and choosing hollow tree preferably in an orchard or near some open grass ﬁelds has reared young brood to maturity and ﬁnally departed in peace to spend the winter in southern europe or africa the nest is placed in hole in some tree and the eggs seven in number are of uniform pale greenish blue general colour of the

bill in wing 6 in the cuckoo cuculus canorus linnæus the arrival of the cuckoo heralded by his note is eagerly awaited by every one who lives in the country ornithologist or otherwise and so anxious are some to record his arrival that they persuade themselves that they have heard him before the march winds have abated there is little doubt however that this species rarely if ever arrives in march and not before can his pleasing note be generally heard throughout the whole of our islands this bird is common and well known inhabiting equally the wild open country the enclosed arable land or estates it feeds entirely on insects especially caterpillars those of the common being an especially favourite delicacy its ﬂight is direct and fairly rapid the short wings and long tail giving it very much the appear ance of which it is frequently mistaken by the smaller birds and mobbed accordingly birds of britain by lewis bonhote project gutenberg ebook https 188 cuckoo cuculus canorus adult below young above this bird solves housekeeping difﬁculties in the simplest way by leaving its eggs to the tender mercies of other species it apparently usually watches other birds when building and soon the chosen nest contains few eggs it lays its own egg on the ground and picking it up in its beak deposits it in the nest throwing out at the same time few of the rightful eggs the eggs are rule deposited one by one in different nest of the same species and when two cuckoo s eggs are found in the same nest they are almost assuredly the produce of two different birds having deposited its eggs the mother cuckoo takes further interest in her progeny but continues to lead life of leisure till early in august both sexes leave us their southern winter the eggs of this species are extremely variable but rule are of pale bluish or greenish ground colour with reddish spots and mottlings someti mes they agree so closely with the eggs of their foster to be almost indistinguishable but such cases are exceptional when the young cuckoo has been hatched about hours he sets to work to eject the other nestlings by getting them on his back in which there is hollow and pushing them over the side of the nest he is most importunate in his demands food and continues to be burden on the foster long after he is able to feed himself once however he is ﬂedged he wings his way southwards and we see him more till he returns the following spring to gladden us with his cheering various species of insectivorous birds are made use of foster parents and there is doubt that much discrimination is exercised by the moth er cuckoo to where and when to deposit her egg the nests most favoured in this country are those of the meadow pipit pied wagtail hedge sparrow sedge and reed warblers but over sixty different species of british birds have been made use of at various times practically nothing is known to whether cuckoos pair or if the female receives the attentions of several males and the number of eggs laid by single bird in the season is also doubtful though about eight is said to be the number many interesting problems are thus still unsolved about one of our commones t birds and if his character be not very estimable one we can birds of britain by lewis bonhote project gutenberg ebook https 190marvel at the workings of evolution which has enabled so curious and complicated method of parasitism to be sufﬁciently successful to ensure the perpetuation of the race it must be reme mbered that the successful rearing of each young cuckoo the mother has to ﬁnd and recognise the nest of an insectivorous bird and to lay her egg during the ﬁve days in which the elect is laying her clutch regards the various stages of evolution that have caused the young cuckoo to evolve murderer at his birth and that have provided him with the means in the shape of special hollow in his back we know nothing and can in the present state of our knowledge merely leave the problem in

on rats mice and such small deer and rarely takes any small birds they are always securely roosting by the time the barn owl comes out from its habits of choosing barns and old buildings this species more than any other is deserving of man s protection since its favourite are round the where it destroys those vermin that are of most immediate nuisance to the farmer the note is harsh scream which

without any attempt at nest they are generally laid in clutches of two at intervals of some days so that four or six young of varying ages are generally found in the nest together unlike most of the other owls the ﬁrst plumage of the young is composed of true feathers whereas in most of the other species the young are at ﬁrst clothed with the exception of the wings and tail in plumage of downy feathers which after being worn short time is exchanged the full plumage the general colour above is bufﬁsh orange minutely speckled and vermiculated with grey the under parts are white sometimes

very partial to ﬁr woods or evergreen plantations and early in the year takes possession of an old nest or squirrel s drey in which to deposit its six white eggs the young are chieﬂy fed on rats and mice but moths and beetles are also eaten with relish while small birds are not despised the daytime is spent among the branches of the trees and when alarmed by any noise the bird draws itself up and leans against the trunk of the tree in which position it may easily be overlooked it ﬂies out at dusk and ranges the ﬁelds near woods its prey in the northern parts of scotland it is regular migrant but elsewhere within these islands it is resident though immigrations from the continent occur every year it is very silent bird but occasionally gives rise to short mellow bark the sexes resemble each other and are bufﬁsh heavily speckled and vermiculated with dark brown ashy and white the markings of the young are yellowish and warmer in tint the name is derived from two longish tufts of feathers above the facial disc which can be erected at will length 14 in wing 1 in the owl asio accipitrinus pallas unlike the preceding species this bird inhabits fens marshes and open moorlands in scotland it nests fairly commonly but in england it is decidedly rare and local breeding species while it has never been known to breed in ireland the nest is placed on the ground at the foot of small bush in long sedge or among heather real nest is made but few bits of grass or heather are arranged round the eggs these are usually ﬁve in number and like all owls eggs pure white in some seasons these owls become much more abundant in certain places due generally to great increase in their food whic h consists almost entirely of in the years when these voles increase to an enormous extent this species will also appear nesting in considerable numbers where it was almost unknown before and in such seasons many twelve eggs have been found in clutch it is by means nocturnal bird but takes

much rounder in shape than those of the barn owl it is extremely nocturnal never appearing till quite dark and seldom pursuing its prey in the open but keepi ng to glades and rides in the woods its hoot is loud hoo hoo and is repeated with great frequency this species is never met with on migration but is one of the most resident of birds rarely wandering far from its birthplace the sexes are alike except that the female is slightly larger the general colou r is usually of warm tawny brown mottled and streaked with darker shades of the same colour the under parts are pale bufﬁsh white

of northern europe siberia and north america it has occurred here straggler on several occasions the majority of examples having been shot in the western counties of england and scotland and belonging curiously enough to the american race which has the bars of the under parts more ruddy than the european form this latter form has however also been obtained on at least one occasion the upper parts are brown spotted with white under parts white barred with greyish or reddish brown its most characteristic feature is the tail which is long and graduated barred and tipped with white length about 15

regularly in many places in england where large stretches of suitable to its habits were to be found pair or two may occasionally still try to rear brood in east anglia but owing to the drainage of the fens it is longer known in any of its former haunts in ireland where it was formerly fairly common its breeding area is restricted to one locality to scotland it has always been an extremely rare visitor on migration small numbers of this species visit england and wales yearly the nest is fairly substantial structure built of reeds and grass and placed on the ground the eggs which generally number ﬁve are pale bluish white without any other markings in plumage this species varies greatly according to age the adult male is dark brown on the back head creamy white with dark streaks wing

scarce and very few pairs if any are allowed to nest in scotland and ireland where it was formerly fairly plentiful it is fast decreasing in numbers on migra tion it is still not uncommon in the north and the passage of stragglers through england is of yearly occurrence but very few remain to spend the winter in any part of this country it frequents large open moorlands which like all harriers it regularly quarters in its search food this consists of young birds rats mice and frogs or lizards the nest is made of roots heather and plant stems and the eggs are bluish white often faintly spotted with reddish brown the adult male is slate grey with white rump and white under parts the throat and breast being bluish grey the female and young are brown above with the exception of the rump which

localities in the south and of england few pairs yearly attempt to breed the sight of this grand bird it quarters the ground backwards and forwards in search of food is an exquisite pleasure to the true naturalist but in spite of the protection afforded by law it is ruthlessly destroyed either by the gamekeeper or the collector of british killed specimens whenever seen in habits it closely resembles the hen harrier it nests on the ground and its bluish white eggs are in the case of that species often speckled with rusty red the upper parts throat and breast of the male are slaty grey

species is summer migrant to central and southern europe from whence it migrates on the approach of winter to africa large numbers passing down the nile valley the adult is of warm brown all over but the young bird has the feathers of the upper parts tipped with buff and the lower parts striped with ochreous length of male 19 in the female is slightly lar ger the golden eagle aquila chrysaetus linnæus this magniﬁcent bird has only been preserved to us breeding species owing to the strict protection afforded to the deer in the highlands and some of the outlying islands off the west coast of scotland thanks to this it is slightly on the increase in some places though it meets with speedy death should it trespass over grouse moor it can never become generally common it is truly grand bird to watch it soars and circles over the few miles of country to which it claims suzerain rights and eminently worthy of protection an object of natural beauty the eyrie which is resorted to year after year is placed on the ledge of crag or more rarely in tree it is vast accumulation of sticks to which additions are made every year and is lined with tufts of grass the eggs usuall y two in number are bluish white marked to greater or lesser extent with reddish brown its food consists chieﬂy of mountain hares though it also takes birds lambs and occasionally the fawns of the deer but although it

their southward migration the nest is placed usually on an inacces sible crag by the and is vast accumulation of sticks and rubbish which is yearly augmented the eggs are two in number and dull white without any markings the habits and food are similar to the golden eagle but it occasionally takes ﬁsh and feeds more readily on carrion old birds are dark brown with nearly white head and neck and white tail immature birds are brown mottled with fulvous on the upper parts and with brown tail this species takes about ﬁve years to become adult and all varieties between these two plumages may be met with length about 34 in wing 25 in the goshawk astur palumbarius linnæus this species is common throughout the wooded districts of northern and central europe and has only occurred in these islands at long intervals almost always on the east coast of scotland or england in ireland it is practically unknown in olden times falconers this species was in great demand hawking used to liberate adults in the spring in order to procure the young when they nested and in this manner there is doubt that it became established several centuries but it is now over hundred years since the last nestling was obtained it inhabits wooded districts and seizes its prey which consists of both mammals and birds on the ground the adult is brown on the back the under parts are white barred with dull black the young is brown above and buf f striped with dark brown below length 20 in wing 12 in the female is slightly lar ger the accipiter nisus linnæus numerous and abundant throughout our woodland districts it must be confessed that this species especially when rearing its young does undoubtedly considerable damage among the pheasant coops and there is less to be said in favour of this bird than is the case with most of the other birds destroyed by the inhabiting woods it is not so often seen the kestrel nor is its ﬂight powerful when hunting it ﬂies low along hedgerow or the outskirts of wood pouncing suddenly upon any hapless bird that may dart out in front of it birds form its principal prey but it will also take mice moles or any other living thing which comes under its notice substantial nest of sticks is built high up in some ﬁr or evergreen former nest is often used sometimes after lapse of several years the eggs are extremely handsome being pale blue with very bold mottlings and markings of deep reddish brown the same coppice is resorted to yearly although one of the parents may be shot on the nest and the young destroyed the adult male which is much smaller than the female is slate blue on the uppe r parts with rufous on the cheeks and ear coverts the under parts are pale buff barred with reddish brown some individuals being much redder than others the female is brown on the back and the under parts are whitish barred with brown the young except in size resemble the female but the under parts are striped instead of barred this species is however extremely variable in colour and markings length of male 13 in wing in female in wing 9 in the kite milvus ictinus savigny although once so abundant that it used some two or three centuries ago to feed on offal in the london streets the remnant of our indigenous kites are now reduced to some dozen individuals in the more remote parts of wales the gamekeeper the and even the have all combined to destroy this noble species and even now when it is far too scarc to any harm vandal has recently shot one of the remnant and owing to fault in the administration of the law has got off scot free it will not be until we have public opinion aroused sufﬁciently to protect our natural beauties that this ruthless extermination of any rare bird will be stopped certain species robin thrush nightingale house martin are so well protected by that opinion to become almost too numerous in certain places the shooting of many of our rarer wanderers can great harm if the lust killing rare birds must be indulged in but our rare resident or breeding migrants should never be destroyed we can not replace what is thus killed and these living bits of nature form heritage left us by former generations which it becomes our duty to hand on to the future even in the immediate present the delight of seeing the living bird in its native haunts is not conﬁned to ornithologists but thousands rich and poor appreciate intensely the sight of one of our larger and rarer specie s amidst its natural surroundings and censure can be too strong the man who wilfully destroys that creature his own selﬁsh ends whether the sake of having its stuffed efﬁgy in glass case or that he may bag larger number of pheasants in due season it is crime great or greater than the stealing of art treasures from our national gallery the wide circling ﬂight of the kite is magniﬁcent sight it daily covers large tracts of country in search of its food offal and carrion are or should be the chief diet of this species but in this country it chieﬂy subsists on small mammals and birds becoming at the nesting time very bold and taking toll from the and game coverts the kite was formerly common through out england and by means rare in scotland but many years past it has been restricted to certain places in almost all of which it is now extinct it is only very occasional wanderer to ireland the nest is placed in tall

species the king of falcons is still we are glad to say by means uncommon round our coasts though breeding bird it has been banished from most of its inland eyries to those who still keep up the ancient sport of hawking an amusement which to our minds comes nearer true sport than any of its latter substitutes the peregrine is the favourite bird and grand sight it is to see this beautiful

colour and are blotched with deep red in about three weeks the young are hatched and in the case of all birds of prey are thickly covered with pale greyish down at ﬁrst their parents on bringing the food tear it up them and allow the young to peck it from their beaks but they grow and their appetite increases their voracity at this age is enormous the food is merely brought to the nest and the young tear it to pieces and eat it without further aid like several other birds the kestrel at such time does not hunt in the immediate vicinity of his nest and except that he may occasionally be seen ﬂying over he is seldom at home to reveal the presence of his young at the age of ﬁve or six weeks the young leave the nest at ﬁrst they not ﬂy much but remain perched near the nest and are still

streaked with brown the young resemble the female length 13 in wing 6 in the common bittern botaurus stellaris linnæus owing to drainage and cultivation the bittern which used formerly to breed in various swamps and especially in our eastern counties is now only known migrant it still occurs yearly on our shores and if unmolested it is probable that it would once more nest with us the nest is heap of reeds placed on the marsh in the thickest part of the eggs are usually four in number and of uniform brownish olive colour in the breeding season it utters loud booming noise but at other times it is very silent bird the adult is buff irregularly barred and streaked all over with black except on the head which is pure black sexes and young are alike in plumage length 28 in wing 13 in

platalea leucorodia linnæus this species used formerly to breed in several localities in england but these have long been deserted it however still occurs on migration and few annually visit the norfolk broads in spring where they are now strictly protected it is to be hoped that they may once again be induced to nest it still nests in holland but in other districts where it used to occur it seems to have died out breeding species and is now restricted to more southern localities such the south of spain the danube and the black sea the whole of the plumage is white gular pouch orange bill

ago this bird used to nest in the fens of cambridge and lincolnshire it has long since ceased to so and the only places where it may still be found breeding in these islands are in the north of scotland and in the outer hebrides in winter it occurs on our coasts in company with other species of geese but it is by means common and the majority pass on to the south reappearing on their way north in spring the food consists chieﬂy of grass and other green food which it seeks on salt marshes near the sea by day retiring to the shore to rest at night it is the only goose that breeds in our islands the nest is begun in the middle of april and consists merely of scrape amongst the grass or heather which is lined incubation proceeds with down pluck ed from the body of the female the eggs are usually six in number and dull yellowish white in colour soon the female begins to sit the males gather together in small ﬂocks and take further interest in their mates geese are strong ﬂiers and being very wary birds extremely difﬁcult to approach in ﬂight they usually assume formation known the note is harsh gaggle gaggle like that of our domestic goose which is supposed to have originated from this species there is some doubt to the origin of the name grey lag but it is now generally conceded to have been applied to this species because it lagged behind after the other geese had gone to their breeding quarters in the north the adult is greyish brown on the upper parts and breast the rest of the under parts being whitish grey with few black feathers the young are rather darker and lack the black feathers underneath length 34 in wing 17 in the goose anser albifrons scopoli this goose whose chief breeding grounds are in siberia though it also nests across the whole of northern

cases during the life of single individual legs orange yello there is bluish grey on the shoulder of the wing in the grey lag and length 34 in wing 19 in the goose anser brachyrhynchus baillon on the east of england and scotland this species is very plentiful during the winter but in the south of england and on our west coasts it is comparatively rare and its occurrence in ireland is not yet authenticated it breeds in northern europe and is apparently the only grey goose breeding on spitzber the bill is black with pink across the centre and black nail legs pink this pink colour has sometimes yellowish tinge and so can not be accepted deﬁnite character on which to diagnose this species the wing however in the goose is blue grey approaching that of the grey lag and this together with its smaller size will distinguish it from the preceding species length 28 in wing in the snow goose chen hyperboreus pallas this is north american species breeding in arctic regions and wandering

somewhat local in its breeding haunts this species is fairly abundant round all our coasts in winter it is being seldom found far inland and its food consists of small mollusca and marine insects which it seeks on our ﬂat estuaries and along the shore in near the sea is chosen and lined with little grass to which is subsequently added an abundance of grey down from the body of the female occasionally it makes its own burrow or other sites such crevices between boulders or under furze bushes are selected the eggs generally ten in number are creamy white soon they are hatched the mother leads her brood to the shore where they feed making the sea on the ﬁrst sign of danger during the pairing season this bird is very noisy the male uttering short whistle while both sexes run round each other with neck making curious guttural chuckle in winter large ﬂocks of these birds visit us from the continent these ﬂocks may be seen resting out at sea by day and come in to feed on the soft ooze

with weeds or shallow ponds to open stretches of deep water early in march it chooses nesting site usually on the ground and at great distance from water but exceptionally it has been known to nest in trees faggots stacks and other elevated places nest is formed but hollow is scraped out which is warmly lined with down after incubation comme nces the eggs usually ten to twelve in number are pale greenish yellow and are always carefully covered up by the duck on leaving the nest they hatch after days incubation and the young are then taken to the nearest water on or near which they remain about two months till they can ﬂy if however they are much disturbed they will be led away by their mother to neighbouring piece of water often at some considerable distance in wild state the mallard the male of this species is called is strictly monogamous and during the whole of incubation he will remain in the vicinity of the nest warning his mate of the approach of danger and accompan ying her when she comes off to feed once the young are hatched he retires to some secluded and sheltered piece of water where he assumes dull plumage somewhat resembling that of the female during this period he becomes very skulking rarely show ing himself on the open water when his dull or eclipse plumage has been assumed he casts all his ﬂight feathers at once and short time becomes incapable of ﬂight these grow again in about fortnight and then in september he begins to assume his brilliant colours once more and comes from his secluded retreat to join his comrades in the winter they gather in

meres and ponds feeding lar gely on aquatic vegetation the nest is placed near the water on the ground and warmly lined with down the eggs are of bluish green colour in its plumage this species is somewhat peculiar it assumes in october plumage in which the head and neck are white except brownish grey patch on the cheeks and an oval patch of dark brown on each side of the neck the upper parts breast wing coverts and central tail feathers which latter are much elongat ed are black the scapulars secondari es outer tail feathers and under parts white bill black with pinkish band legs lead grey in april just previous to the breeding season the white portions of the upper parts are changed and become of various shades of brown or tawny the female lacks the elongated tail feathers is duller and has the white portions brownish otherwise she resembles the drake and under goes similar changes of plumage length inclusive of tail 25 in wing in the harlequin duck cosmonetta histrionica linnæus iceland is the nearest breeding resort of this species which nests also in eastern siberia and only three or four examples have occurred on our coasts it is very peculiarly marked duck the general colour above is bluish black with white spot at the base of the bill and behind each ear white line runs backwards over the crown and another down the sides of the neck white ring bordered with black encircles the lower neck and there is another similar one across the breast the under parts are dark greyish brown length 17 in wing 8 in the eider duck somateria mollissima linnæus this exclusively is not uncommon from northumberland northwards where it is resident and breeds in all suitable localities but over the rest of our coasts it is rare and only met with occasionally in food and habits it calls special comment the nest is placed usually on low rocky islets among the herbage or in crevices of the rocks but it is sometimes found at considerable distances from the water and often at some height above the sea five is the usual number in clutch the eggs being large somewhat pointed and greenish grey in colour this bird is famous the down with which its nest is lined and on this account is stringently protected in many places abroad the ﬁrst two nests are generally taken the duck being allowed to hatch her third clutch unmolested the drakes are extremely handsome birds the head and neck are black with the exception of white line running backwards from the crown to the nape which is green the cheeks back wing coverts and long secondaries characteristic of the eider ducks white wings rump and tail black breast warm buff rest of under parts black bill and legs greenish in the eclipse plumage the whole of the head and white portions of the body except the wing coverts become dull brownish black the female is rufous buff with darker bars length 23 in wing 11 in the king eider somateria spectabilis linnæus essentially an arctic species and rarely wandering south even in winter this species is somewhat scarce visitor to our shores though good many examples have been taken especially in the north the large raised orange tubercle at the base of the bill and the dark clear v mark underneath the chin form fairly distinctive characters by which this species may be recognised though an imperfect v mark is sometimes found on the common eider the secondaries are black and not white in the common eider the female is smaller but otherwise resembles the common eider though on close examination she may be distinguished by the shape and extent of the backward prolongation of the beak sheath length 21 in wing in steller s eider somateria stelleri pallas this is an arctic species nesting sparingly in europe and more commonly on the tundras of eastern siberia it is not very rare on the coast of norway in winter where many migrate westwards two examples only have been obtained in great britain it is the smallest of our eiders the male has the head white with bluish black patch across the occiput and on the chin the rest of the upper parts are bluish black except the falcate secondaries which are striped with white under parts rufous chestnut the female except in size is very like the common eider but darker length 18 in wing in the common scoter œdemia nigra linnæus this species except during the breedi ng season is almost

winter months the main breeding grounds are the wide tundras of northern europe and siberia but few pairs nest in the north of scotland the nest is usually placed on an islet in small lake or mere and composed of few tufts of moss and heather lined with down the eggs eight or nine in number are yellowish white in colour rule it is silent species but during the breeding season the male utters tui

species of sawbills that are found in this country unlike other ducks the bill is moderately long and narrow and both mandibles have very rough toothed surface enabling them easily to secure and hold their prey which consists entirely of ﬁsh they are all expert divers on the east coast of england this species is not uncommon during the winter months frequenting estuaries and freshwater lakes but in the south and west it is of irregular occurrence in scotland it is known to nest in few localities but on the west coast and in ireland it is decidedly rare the nest is placed down hole among rocks or in tree and in sweden and lapland it makes extensive use of the put up it and other species by the lapps the eggs which may be many thirteen in number are creamy white the note is very harsh kaar and when swimming this bird is not unlike cormorant in general outline when wounded it will always attempt to escape by diving the male has the head and neck dark glossy green back and scapulars brown passing to grey on the rump wing coverts white lower neck and under parts creamy white tinged with pink in the living bird bill and legs red the female is rufous brown on the head greyish on the upper parts and ﬂanks and bufﬁsh white below she is rather smaller than the male the young resemble the female length 25 in wing 1 1 in the merganser mergus serrator linnæus nearly allied to the preceding species the merganser is fairly common round our shores in winter and nests in considerable numbers in scotland both on lakes and tarns well on the coasts in the north and west in ireland it is very common resident breeding especially abundantly on the west coast in habits and food it resembles the goosander but is less frequently found inland and far more partial to the sea than that species the nest is not placed in hole but in thick cover at great distance from water the eggs generally about ten in number are of pale greenish drab and are never of that creamy tint which distinguishes those of the former species in these ducks the male apparently helps the female in attending on the young and in catching the small fry on which they live although smaller this species is not unlike the goosander the male may always be recognised by his reddish breast streaked with black the wing patch is white barred with black and on the breast at the point of the wing there is conspicuous tuft of white feathers with black margins the long falcated inner scapulars are black the female has distinct black bar across the wing patch but in other respects except size closely resembles the duck goosander length 24 in wing in the smew mergus albellus linnæus this species the smallest and scarcest of the sawbills only comes to us in the winter its breeding haunts being near the limit of tree growth throughout northern europe it may be found on inland rivers and lakes well in sheltered bays and estuaries on the coast immature examples with red head known smews far the adults and old males in full plumage are rarely seen this is one of the species that occupies the boxes in sweden and lapland and the discovery of its eggs ﬁfty years ago was due to the energy and perseverance of an

there is black patch between the bill and the eye on each side and another high up on the occiput joining its fellow on the opposite side this black crescent being broken by the overlapping of the slightly elongated feathers of the head the eclipse plumage somewhat resembles that of the immature male from which it may always be distinguished by the mantle remaining black the female is smaller

increasing scarcity and approaching extermination far these islands are concerned with the wood pigeon the case is very different nesting in the woods throughout the country where owing to strict preservation trespassers are forbidden and raptorial birds shot this species has of late years increased with amazing rapidity and may be found in winter in ﬂocks of thousands which often considerable damage to the crops although rule very shy and wary it becomes in towns where it is unmolested absurdly tame and it may now be found in the london parks and squares disputing with the omnipresent sparrow the crumbs of bread thrown out by it is curious and interesting to note that it is very conservative in its habits rarely settling on any of the buildings like the wild domestic pigeons which are descended from the rock dove but always keeping to the trees and gardens leaving its tame relative in undisputed possession of the streets and buildings on one occasion at least it deigned to avail itself of civilisation nest was recently found in one of the parks composed almost entirely of ladies hairpins the nest is usually placed on tree but sometimes in bushes or hedgerows it is made of twigs laid loosely on each other and is such ﬂimsy structure that one would never imagine it capable of forming an efﬁcient nursery so large bird two eggs only are laid which with all pigeons are pure white two or three broods are often reared in the season both sexes taking their turn at incubation and rearing the young pigeons when ﬁrst hatched are covered with coarse yellowish down and are very helpless they are fed the ﬁrst ten days on sort of soft curd known pigeon s milk which is secreted in the crop or is has been stated the secretion of two glands placed on each side near the crop but this latter point requires conﬁrmation they are fed by regur gitation the young bird inserting its beak into that of the parent the note of the wood pigeon is soft melodious cooroo coo when courting he expands his tail blows out his crop and holding his head high in the air utters his coo he then bows and raises his expanded tail his hen who usually shows but little enthusiasm over the display has probably moved little farther of f and the display ends with an awkward hop towards her the ﬂight is rapid and sustained but in the nesting season and occasionally at other times an upward soaring ﬂight is indulged in over their nesting home its food consists chieﬂy of grain seeds beechmast and acorns but at certain seasons especially when the snow is on the ground large quantities of green food are eaten tender turnip tops being much sought after the adult is delicate bluish grey all over having violet green metallic patch on the sides of the neck bounded on each side by patch of

nevertheless by means uncommon in england and has greatly increased of late years especially in scotland in ireland it is still rare and local species the name stock dove is not due many erroneously suppose to its being the race from which our domestic pigeons spring but to its habit of nesting in the stocks and boles of old timber such places are however by means exclusively used it also nests in caves ledges of cliffs and otherwise its habits are not materially different from those of the wood pigeon rule it goes about in pairs and large ﬂocks are never met with even when migrating from

the continent it also frequents inland and mountainous regions the nest built of is placed on small ledge near the roof of cave those into which the sea comes up with each tide being chosen by preference they breed very early and at least two broods are reared in season and in small caves which are only tenanted by one pair two nests may often be found and are used alternately the second clutch being usually laid before the young of the ﬁrst brood are ready to ﬂy it is worthy of note that in this and many other species where the young to move from the nest before they are ﬂedged would mean instant death they remain actually in the nest itself till fully ﬂedged and not take their ﬁrst ﬂight till they are almost strong on the wing the old birds this habit is in marked contradistinctio n to rooks and many other small birds that leave the nest and perch on the branches round long before they can ﬂy the gulls form also another example by nature they would and run from the nest if the nest is on the ground but if placed on narrow ledge they hardly move from it until fully ﬂedged in habits this bird resembles the other pigeons though its method of courting which must be well known to most people is slightly different the male has curious habit shared also by the stock dove of driving the hen few days before she lays on these occasions his whole time is spent in keeping her on the move and he never lets her settle or rest minute except on the nest the sexes are alike and pale grey all over except the rump which is white across the wing are two distinct and

our islands arrived during the latter half of 1859 and four years later larger invasion took place the birds spreading throughout the country the largest immigration however took place in 1888 in which year several pairs nested with us in yorkshire and other places in 1889 special act of parliament was passed their protection but it came too late by that date they had all been slaughtered or had left more peaceful localities the eggs are two in number and of warm stone buff colour with purplish blotches they are laid in depression in the ground with attempt at nest their food consists almost entirely of seeds and grain the general colour is yellowish buff greyer on the head and barred on the back with black under parts greyish buff mottled on the gorget and banded on the belly with

great britain this species became extinct over hundred years ago from causes which are by means clear in 1837 it was introduced into perthshire and few other districts in scotland where it has increased largely and is at the present time gradually spreading southwards through the pine oak and birch forests it is essentially speci es rarely if ever wandering far from the woods where its call of peller peller peller may be continually heard during the spring months and sometimes again in autumn like most game birds it is polygamous and an old cock is very jealous of his hens savagely attacking other males that come near him when courting he performs various evolutions drooping his wings and erecting his tail and calling out vigorously at the same time their food consists chieﬂy of various seeds and berries and in their season the tender shoots of the scotch ﬁr the nest is merely scrape in the ground generally at the foot of tree and the eggs some twelve in number are reddish

during the last hundred years another species the chinese pheasant has been imported and has so interbred with the original birds that the pure colchian pheasant is hardly ever shot at the present day the pheasant is woodland bird roosting on trees and roaming in the ﬁelds during the day in search of its food which consists chieﬂy of grain and seed but during the summer months many insects are eaten it is polygamous and the nest is placed in thick cover on the ground ten to twelve pale brown eggs form the usual clutch the hen is said to be bad mother and to desert her eggs if disturbed but this has probably been largely brought about by the artiﬁcial conditions under which they are now kept in spite of their size and proportionately short wings they are strong ﬂiers and when well on the wing progress at considerable pace if possible however they generally try to escape by running and squatting low on the ground until closely approached when they rise with their known whirr the male

these structures the eggs will be laid and soon the site has been deﬁnitely chosen considerable amount of material is added and the higher leaves of the sedge are often bent over so to conceal it from above the young when ﬁrst hatched are black with the base of the beak bright red like that of their parents but after about fortnight this colour is lost the beak and frontal plate becoming brownish green the ﬁrst few weeks are spent entirely on the water or in the thick cover fringing the banks of pond or stream and at such times the nests are utilised nurseries on which to brood the young both parents feed and tend the young and on the approach of danger safety is sought by diving when swimming the moor proceeds slowly with curious bobbing motion of the head and neck and on land when undisturbed it walks slowly raising its tail at every step and thus displaying the white under tail coverts if alarmed however it lowers its head and runs with consider able rapidity and shows white

most of the open sheets of water throughout the count ry it differs from its other congeners in being far less skulking and spending most of its time out on the open water and procures much of its food by diving its feet are lobed that is to say have ﬂat extensions of the skin which is constricted at the joints down all the toes the nest is huge structure of reeds and rushes placed well away from the shore in small clump of reeds and the eggs which number seven to ten are very pale stone colour minutely speckled and dotted with dark brown the young bird when ﬁrst hatched is black except his head which is sparsely covered with coarse hairs of red and orange tint its food consists of aquatic insects and vegetation is the case with the moor in winter although resident it collects in large ﬂocks and many visit the bays and estuaries round the coast receiving considerable additions to their numbers from the continent the coot is extremely wary and difﬁcult to approach taking wing on the least sign of danger it ﬂies well and fast carrying its legs stretched out behind but has to run along the surface of the water some distance before it can rise the sexes are alike and have the

chilterns and in one or two other counties to the north but in the west of england scotland and ireland it is entirely absent and has only occurred on very few occasions sandy brown in colour it assimilates so well with its surroundings that it is very difﬁcult to see and when approached will often squat stretching its neck out to its fullest extent and so escape observation it runs with great rapidity and ﬂies strongly its ﬂight rather resembling that of pigeon while the white bars on the wing coverts show up conspicuously its food which is chieﬂy taken at dusk and dawn consists of insects of all kinds especially beetles living it frequently does in districts away from water it journeys nightly to favourite the note is loud whistling cry which is uttered at night and during the early spring these birds are very noisy the two eggs are deposited towards the end of april or beginning of may on the bare ground spot where there are many loose stones among which they are very difﬁcult to see being usually chosen in colour the eggs are pale clay spotted and streaked with dark brown those in the same clutch being often very dissimilar in markings both sexes assist in the duties of incubation and rearing of the young who when ﬁrst hatched are pale buff with longitudinal dark line down each side of the back their legs are much thickened feature common to many limicoline

we can not ﬁnd this bird on our shores whatever be the howling winter s gale and driving sleet or under the blazing summer s sun when we can see the heated air vibrating over the burning stones he is still there apparently absolutely unmoved by the powerful forces of nature but the time to see him at his best is in may we are walking along when suddenly his note strikes our ears and we see him running along in front of us we sit down to watch him and he in his turn will suddenly stop and then running to some stone slightly higher than its neighbours stand up and watch us his mate soon joins him and together they stand now running few yards and then turning round give us another look while they bob their heads up and down at the same time with motion so characteristic of the plovers

ringed plover they are all ﬂecked with white to form conspicuous bar when the wing is opened length in wing in the kentish plover ægialitis cantiana latham the ringed plover is one of our commonest

golden plover is on the lower slopes of those hills the tops of which the dotterel takes his own the golden plover prefers the cover af forded by the tall heather and the more abundant and varied insect diet of the lower lands we walk up the hill we ﬁrst hear his shrill whistle and soon see him coming to meet us settling some yards ahead he pipes his whistle incessantly and then we approach he ﬂies on to some other upstanding boulder and so on perhaps till having escorted us to the limits of the ground over which he claims suzerain rights he hands us over to the ruling chief of the next territory thus in walk over the hillside we ﬁnd ourselves incessantly accompanied by one of these birds whose cry is never out of our ears we have however only noticed half the game the birds that have been accompanying us are almost always male birds his duty it is to stand on some exposed mound while his hen crouches amid the heather on her precious eggs four beauties the black spots and markings showing up against their greenish ground colour on the ﬁrst appearance of any intruder he will sound his pipe and ﬂy off towards us while his mate quietly leaves her eggs and ﬂying low circles round till we see her apparently coming up from direction diametrically opposed to that in which her treasures lie it will be unavailing us to lie in wait hoping to watch her return to the nest unless we are completely concealed he will keep close eye upon us and until his warning whistle is quiet she will not return when the young are hatched both birds meet and follow us while in response to the warning the young squat close to the ground under some sheltering piece of heather and so defy detection in autumn these birds collect in large ﬂocks and though many remain on the moors all the year round the majority come to the marshes near the sea and gradually pass southwards the sexes are alike in plumage the whole of the upper parts are dark brown with two or more yellow

the time this bird spends with us he passes the winter in the warm tropics of africa wandering southwards far the cape and then obeying some mysterious impulse of which we can form conception he journeys in may northwards and passing over many spots which would to our ignorant eyes afford him food and shelter sufﬁcient the rearing of his young he seeks out the wild and lonely tundras of europe and siberia there during the eternal day of an arctic summer he rears his family and soon they can ﬂy old and young are back again on our shores some weeks they remain slowly passin g to the

aerial chases with much calling out but very little serious ﬁghting once however these early difﬁculties have been overcome the colony settles down in peace few ousted pairs being left to seek some fresh ground the nest is merely shallow platform of roots and bents placed on small scrape on the ground over the actual choice of site there seems to be some difﬁculty many scrapes are generally to be found within few yards of the spot eventually chosen towards the latter end of march the four eggs so well known in poulterers shops are laid and the hen commences her incubation duties which last about nineteen days during this period her mate wanders about in the vicinity of the nest keeping an eye any intruder soon we are seen approaching he is up in the air ﬂying round with great noise and performing at the same time curious tumble but recovering himself before touching the ground after two or three minutes of these antics however he goes away having apparently further interest in us or the place we may then walk about the ﬁeld in vain so far that pair is concerned they will not return to settle while we are there and the eggs are so protectively coloured that the chances of our seeing them even if we walk right by them are exceedingly remote while we were watching the male bird perform his curious antics the hen warned by his cries quietly slipped off the nest and ﬂying low skimmed the next hedge and so away and he having watched her safely into neighbouring ﬁeld goes off to join her and leaves us to ﬁnd the eggs if we can if we retire however they will not be long gone he will soon ﬂy back and having ascertained that the danger is over and uttered warning cry she will immediately follow and settling near the nest run to it and once more cover her eggs when the young are hatched however matters are very different both birds will then rise and ﬂying round our heads beseech us with piteous cries to leave their young alone these cries serve the purpose of making the young squat and hide and their greyish green down with black mottlings so exactly assimilates in colour with the ground that they are almost impossible to see the young leave the nest soon they are hatched and utter feeble cry not unlike that of the adults at ﬁrst their parents feed them most carefully picking up grubs ﬂies spiders or any other insect that comes their way while the young run up

may be easily recognised from other limicoline or wading birds by their very close feathering especially on the breast and their lobed feet while in the grey phalarope especially the bill is somewhat ﬂattened so that in these birds we ﬁnd tendency towards the ﬂattened bill in ducks lobed feet in the grebes and the peculiar thick feathers on the breast characteristic of petrels and gulls the phalaropes have also another peculiarity unique among british birds although shared by several other groups in different parts of the world namely that the duties of incubation and rearing of the

this bird is found wherever swamps marshes and damp meadows suitable to its habits are still left and is common resident throughout great britain receiving lar ge additions to its numbers from the continent every autumn very early in april it begins to nest making fairly deep scrape in damp spot generally in some rough grass or other cover and lining it with few bents and leaves the eggs four in number is the case with all wading birds are greenish olive spotted and blotched often spirally with various shades of brown and there are also few black markings near the larger end the young when ﬁrst hatched are reddish chestnut mottled with black and white during the breeding season this specie s may often be seen drumming or this is sound much like the bleating of goat and considerable doubt to how it was produced has long existed although swedish naturalist stated many years ago that it was brought about by the rapidly vibrating tail feathers the bird descended at certain angle through the air this has recently been clearly proved correct by an english observer bahr who points out that the sound is produced by the two outer tail feathers which during the ﬂight are held out widely separated from the rest of the tail the sound can be produced artiﬁcially by placing these feathers on cork and rapidly whirling them round with piece of string during the breeding season it utters also loud vocal chip chip when on the ground while when suddenly ﬂushed the of scape scape is well known its ﬂight is very rapid and direct when once on the wing but on ﬁrst rising it ﬂies in short offering very difﬁcult shot sometimes however it will squat on the approach of danger and even on bare patch of mud becomes almost invisible so well its colours harmonise its method of squatting

only an autumn visitor that it will be generally found even on passage it can hardly be called common but on our east and south coasts good many pass through halting merely few days on the west and in ireland it is decidedly rare and irregular in its appearances this species differs in its nesting habits from all other waders the males who don special showy ruff in spring meet at their on some raised mound and display their ﬁnery to the hens apparently they are very pugnacious they will often jump up and peck at another male using their feet also after the manner of gallinaceous bird but on close observ ation it will be seen to be all show and we have never seen proper ﬁght between two males on the arrival of female the males spread out their ruff and remain motionless in front of her and she moves away they will jump up and quivering with suppressed excitement again display their charms to which she is apparently quite indifferent although said to be polygamous the question is still open to doubt from among her many admirers the female chooses one and observations so far they go seem birds of britain by lewis bonhote project gutenberg ebook https 335 336 337show that she

of this has not been forthcoming in the north and west of scotland it is scarce but otherwise it is widely distributed throughout the country on the continent it nests in marshy woods from the arctic circle southwards to central russia poland and east germany its migrations extending to africa in the winter in its nesting habits it differs from all others sandpipers it lays its eggs in the deserted nest of some other bird generally that of thrush blackbird or jay the eggs are greenish grey with small brownish spots its food consists of worms and insects in plumage it very closely

other less wary fowl with its shrill tui too the nest is usually situated on some inland marsh or grass ﬁeld intersected with ditches it is very slight structure of grass and bents well concealed in tussock of grass or tuft of rushes the four eggs are of pale stone colour mottled and blotched with rich reddish brown during the nesting season this bird becomes very noisy and if the nesting site be approache d especially after the young are hatched they ﬂy round the intruder or sit on some bank calling out vigorously all the time it is most interesting sight to take sporting dog to where they have young and watch the way in which time after time these birds will decoy the dog away by ﬂuttering under his very nose until they have led him to what they consider safe distance when they will spring in the air and with cheery note return to their brood this habit is common to many species and orders of nesting birds but unless we take keen hunting dog with us we shall fail to realise what

black the rest of the plumage slate grey except the vent and under tail coverts which are white bill black in winter the forehead nape chin throat and under parts are white the young resemble the adults in winter but the upper tail coverts are lighter and the back and wing coverts are greyish mottled with brown length 10 in wing in the black tern hydrochelidon leucoptera schinz this species which is nearly allied to the preceding breeds in the marshes of central and europe it is very scarce and irregular visitor to our eastern and shores especially in spring in habits it resembles the black tern from which it may be distinguished in summer by its red bill white tail and tail coverts and whitish wing coverts the young may be distinguished from those of nigra by their longer toes and much paler rump and tail length in wing in the whiskered tern hydrochelidon hybrida pallas this is more southern species than its congeners breeding in spain on the delta of the rhone and eastwards in turkey greece and south russia to our shores it is very rare visitor some specimens only having been obtained in summer it is not unlike the black tern but it may be recognised by the bill which is stouter and red the black of the head and nape is sharply contrasted with the grey of the back broad white stripe runs backwards from the base of the bill chin and throat grey shading to black on the belly in winter the forehead and under parts are white length 1 in wing in the tern sterna anglica montagu with this species we come to the true terns or the preceding species being known marsh terns

the east and west coasts in scotlan d the colonies are rather more numerous while ireland can only boast of one in the north it nests on the bare shingle the nests being usually placed quite close to each other two or three eggs of pale stone colour spotted and blotched with reddish brown and black form the clutch like all terns this bird is powerful ﬂier and seizes the ﬁsh on which it feeds by plunging into the water with considerable force its note is loud and harsh kirhitt which may be heard some way off and often enables this species to be detected when among other terns it leaves our shores soon the young are well on the wing and though few stragglers may occur on the coast during the autumn it is by means common species and needs all the protection it can get if it is to remain an annual summer visitor to our shores the adult male in summer has the crown of the head black the rest of the upper parts pearl grey rump tail and under parts white the breast being suffused with delicate rose tint which soon fades after death bill black with yellow tip legs black the female is similar but slightly smaller in autumn the back of the head and nape are white the latter being

this tern still nests in small numbers round our shores but it is extremely scarce and somewhat erratic in its choice of which often vary from year to year it arrives very late in may and leaves our shores soon the young can ﬂy so that it is not often met with on migration it breeds sparingly on the coast of france but its chief are along the atlantic coast of the united states in general habits it resembles its congeners but it is an exclusively sea tern obtaining most of its food some distance out at sea in plumage it is almost indistinguishab le from the two following species but it may be recognised at all ages by the white inner margins to the primaries reaching the tip and even some little way up the outer web the bill in the breeding season is black legs and feet red length in wing

few bents together the eggs are usually three in number often only two and are very variable in colour being rule greenish or stone buf f with brown and grey spots and markings the note is sharp but during the nesting season they utter loud which is rather characteristic of this species the young are covered with pale brown down mottled with black and leave the nest soon they are hatched but they remain near the spot until they are fully ﬂedged and well able to ﬂy they are during that period entirely dependent on their parents food soon after the young can ﬂy old and young gradually disperse

in the north but in scotland it is the commonest tern breeding in increasing numbers northwards in ireland it breeds commonly especially on the islets of the north and west elsewhere it breeds in circumpolar regions and has been met with in winter in antarctic seas so that it has latitudinal range of from to probably the lar gest range recorded any one species its nesting habits are similar to those of the common tern and rule it collects absolutely materials lining but lays its eggs in shallow scrape or even on the bare rock the eggs are indistinguishable in colour from those of the common tern but are on the average slightly smaller to the experienced ear the note is also rather dif ferent but that dif ference is too slight to be expressed on paper this species may be distinguished from the preceding species by its bill which is not darker at the tip and the shorter tarsi the under parts especially in summer are much darker and the stripe on the inner web of the ﬂight feathers

the coast well on the lochs and tarns inland it is abundant in summer well in winter it usually nests in small colonies of six or eight pairs on some islet near the coast or on lake but it avoids during the breeding season precipitous coasts and exposed situations the nest is placed on the ground and composed of few bits of grass seaweed and heather without any attempt at concealment the eggs usually three in number are olive brown streaked and spotted with blackish like most gull s eggs however they vary considerably in colour in food and habits it closely resembles the gull its ordinary note is harsh cry but during the nesting season it tries somewhat feebly to imitate the call of the lar ger gulls in summer the plumage with the exception of the wings and mantle is pure white the mantle and most of the wing feathers are delicate bluish grey but the three outer pairs of ﬂight feathers are black with white mirror towards the tip bill greenish with yellowish tip legs greenish

near the shore they leave it much sooner the herring gull is practically omnivorous ﬁsh rats crustacea and garbage thrown up by the tide are all equally appreciated and when nesting near colonies of guillemots and cormorants it systematically hunts the ledges and devours any uncovered eggs it can ﬁnd during the nesting season it is very noisy and utters variety of cries at times the head is bent right down and suddenly thrown up in the air with loud ollick ollick which cry is taken and repeated all over the colony young gulls ﬁrst commence to utter this note which is not peculiar to the

sea where food is plentiful length 24 in wing 17 in the lesser gull larus fuscus linnæus very closely allied to the herring gull this species is tolerably common everywhere but is rather more local in the breeding season in england it nests but sparingly and only in the west but in scotland it becomes much more abundant and in some districts commits considerable havoc among the on the moors it chooses its some grassy slope on the top of the cliffs or on an islet in one of the numerous ﬁrths in the west of scotland in ireland it is generally distributed and nests sparingly round the coast in all its habits this species so closely resembles the herring gull that further description is unnecessary the adult only differs from the preceding species in being black on the mantle and wing coverts and in the colour of the legs which are yellow length 22 in wing 16 in it is almost impossible to distinguish the young of this species in their ﬁrst autumn the greater gull larus marinus linnæus this species may be found during the winter on almost any part of our shores but it is by means so abundant the herring gull breeding species in england it is rather scarce chieﬂy owing to lack of suitable places but in scotland it is abundant it is bold and majestic species with ﬁne soaring ﬂight but we must acknowledge that it is terribly destructive to weakly lambs and young water practically omnivorous nothing comes amiss to this rapacious bird and its food consists largely of carrion and other refuse of the shore although it has often been denied this and other species of gulls can completely immerse themselve s and pick up food from the bottom in at least three feet of water and we have repeatedly observed them so in captivity having marked some food at the bottom of the water they rise to height of about four feet and forcibly precipitate themselves into the water with wings they are nevertheless extremely buoyant and occasionally bob up on to the surface again before they have attained their object an isolated stack or islet in loch is commandeered by pair of these birds their summer home the nest composed of grass and rubbish is usually placed on the

in the leg which gives it somewhat squat appearance and it does not run about on land with the same facility in correlation with this we ﬁnd it to be much more pelagic species and though found commonly round our shores it gets most of its food on the water and is rarely to be found among the large ﬂocks of other gulls that spend much of their time on the shore itself its food consists almost entirely of ﬁsh in pursuit of which it dives and swims under water with ease it nests on the ledges of precipitous cliffs in immense colonies and in some cases the population of these colonies must amount to very many thousands the nest is built of seaweed and other ﬂotsam and is often larger than the narrow ledge on which it is placed the eggs two or three in number are usually pale greyish white blotched and zoned with ash grey and brown the shell is rougher in texture than in the other species they are laid very late in the season so that it is generally july before the young are hatched both sexes take part in the incubation and the young are entirely nidicolous not leaving the nest till they are well able to ﬂy in summer the adults very closely resemble the common gull

six months in every year we know nothing or comparatively nothing of its habits or whereabouts towards the middle of april it suddenly appears at certain haunts and proceeds forthwith to set up housekeeping hole or cranny in rock or where possible is ﬁxed upon its home and the same entrance is often shared by several pairs well the rabbit weird little creature is our friend he sits bolt upright on his doorstep turning round every now and again to bill and coo with his mate their large beaks and feet showing up brightly against their plumage the wings are so short that this bird ﬁnds some difﬁculty in rising from ﬂat surface and when on the wing will often ﬂy round in spiral curves in order to reach the summit of the cliff in ﬂight the legs are held spread out behind on either

and invariably sit with their head facing the entrance and woe betide any one who by mistake enters the wrong hole their beaks are exceeding sharp and powerful and they cling on with all the tenacity of dog they feed chieﬂy by night and spend the day resting on the water or at the mouth of their burrows the food consists of small fry and when feeding their young many three or four ﬁsh are caught and carried up in their bill at the same time if approached by boat they remain till one is just on them and then suddenly dive under the water their progress is extremely rapid and both wings and feet are brought into play but especially the former the young are clad in very thick long down of dark colour they grow they will often move about the passage running to the entrance and meeting their parents but never venturing outside while if they meet another young one bound on similar errand stern ﬁght ensues not however till they are fully ﬂedged they leave the burrow and then immediately take to the water on which they are quite at home swimming and diving with ease from the very ﬁrst the parents whose plumage has lately been showing signs of wear now commence to moult and

and the whole of the upper parts and broad collar round the throat are black scales of the head and under parts white legs deep orange bill chieﬂy red and orange the young resemble the parents except that the beak is much smaller and the legs are pale coloured the mode of growth of their wings is quite distinct from that of the guillemot the primaries being grown simultaneously with the rest of the plumage length 13 in wing 6 in the great northern diver colymbus glacialis linnæus during autumn and winter this species is by means rare along our coasts it does not remain to breed on any part of great britain but breeds to the in iceland greenland and north america it feeds entirely on ﬁsh and the adults generally keep well out at sea unless the weather be stormy so that the individuals that frequent our shores are mostly immature in autumn the young bird has the feathers of the back greyish brown with paler mar gins under parts whitish bill brownish horn colour the adult in its breeding dress has the back black each feather having two square white spots the head and neck are black with purplish gloss except two crescentic bands on the fore neck which are longitudinally striped with white and black after the autumn moult the whole of the upper parts are pale slaty blue the head and nape dusky grey chin and throat white this plumage is however worn an exceedingly short time and is rarely complete signs of the new breeding dress appearing before all old feathers have been cast the winter feathers of the head and neck are downy length in wing in the northern diver colymbus adamsi grey this species breeds in the far north wandering south in winter two or three examples have been taken on our shores and it is probable that owing to its resemblance to the preceding species it has been often overlooked the chief characteristic is the bill which is yellowish white at all seasons and the lower mandible is also markedly upturned the white streaks on the transverse throat bands are much fewer in number than in the preceding species length about 33 in wing in the diver colymbus arcticus linnæus the diver is very rare in england and the few examples that are obtained are usually immature in ireland it has only been taken at long intervals but in scotland it breeds locally throughout the north and west the site chosen the nest is usually an islet in some large loch and the eggs two in number are olive brown sparsely spotted with black and brown the young when ﬁrst hatched are of uniform smoky in its habits it closely resembles the next species in summer the back is black spotted with white but the spots are not so uniformly distributed in the former species crown and hind neck ash grey chin and throat black margined with short black and white stripes and small band of similar stripes towards the upper end of the patch under parts white the sexes are alike but the females are slightly smaller after the autumn moult the chin and throat

septentrionalis birds of britain by lewis bonhote project gutenberg ebook https 387this species is the commonest of the divers and may be found along all our coasts during the winter months in the breeding season except few pairs that may still be found on some of the irish loughs it is restricted to scotland so far our islands are concerned the eggs are laid close to the margin of some small tarn or on an islet in large loch but the former situation is the one preferred they are elongate and olive brown spotted with umber the young leave the nest soon they are hatched but they are not very strong divers at ﬁrst and receive all their food from their parents in fact this species often nests on ponds destitute of ﬁsh and journeys several miles to the sea or large loch daily its food if the nest be approached the sitting bird glides off and dives without ripple reappearing again some way off the note is loud and mournful kark kark in winter the adult is brown on the back spotted with small white spots the under parts are pure white and head and neck on which the feathers are very downy are greyish brown on the crown and nape and white on the chin and throat in summer the white spots on the back disappear the crown and nape are slate grey streaked with black the sides of the head and neck are pale grey and there is longitudinal patch of chestnut down the neck the sexes are alike in plumage the young bird in winter may be distingu ished by the spots on the back being longer and tending to form shaped markings and the feathers of the vent have narrow brown mar gins

linnæus in the course of these pages we have often had to lament the extermination or decrease of many species so that it is real pleasure to have to record that ﬁne species like the present has increased abundantly of late years this has been largely brought about by very strict protection and although still local there are many places where it is now common and in scotland it breeds on several lochs far north aberdeenshire in ireland also it nests in several localities it is practically resident and may be found with us at all times of the year but after the breeding season the majority leave their summer haunts and may be found in the estuaries and bays along the coast the nest is large ﬂoating mass of decaying vegetation generally well hidden among thick reeds though occasionally it is placed in the open the eggs usually four in number are yellowish white when ﬁrst laid but soon become stained to dirty brown from contact with the decaying vegetable matter with which they are always covered when the sitting bird leaves the nest the young when ﬁrst hatched are dark brown longitudinally striped with white they are carefully tended by both their parents who often carry them on their backs the food consists of ﬁsh crustaceans and any other living food which may be found this bird may usually be seen swimming about in the centre of the open water its long neck and low ﬂat back enabling it to be easily recognised it ﬂies well and strongly appearing when on the wing rather like duck in winter it is dark brown above and white below but in spring it assumes chestnut tippet which surrounds the face the crown of the head is dark brown the cheeks and stripe over the eye white the female is rather duller but otherwise resembles the male the young in their ﬁrst plumage are much like the adults in winter length 21 in wing in the grebe podicipes griseigena boddaert on the east coast of england this specie s is not uncommon during the winter months and in some seasons becomes quite abundant elsewhere in our area it is decidedly rare and not more than ﬁve or six examples are recorded from ireland it is plentiful in the south of scandinavia the baltic and north russia whence it migrates south wards throughout europe in the winter in habits and food it does not appreciably differ from the preceding species the crown and nape are blackish

ear coverts upper parts dark brown under parts white ﬂanks chestnut all the secondaries white and good deal of white on the four innermost primaries bill black curved in front of the angle in winter the ear tufts and black on the throat are lost and at this season it closely resembles the preceding species but the white on the primaries will always serve to distinguish it length 12 in wing 5 in

the eggs usually ﬁve in number are of uniform yellowish white but soon become discoloured by the weeds with which they are always covered when the bird is not sitting the nestling is striped and fed by its parents on insects and small ﬁsh these birds are seldom seen on the wing and hardly ever on land but nevertheless they are well able to stand up and even walk when on shore in summer the plumage except the cheeks throat and sides of the neck which are chestnut is dark brown all over rather lighter on the under parts in winter the chin neck and under parts are nearly white the plumage of the young resembles the winter dress of their parents but is little duller and there is more white about the cheeks length in wing 4 in the storm petrel procellaria pelagica linnæus this is the commonest of the petrels which come to our shores to breed rule these birds live far out at sea and only visit the shore to breed or when driven inland by stress of weather or on migration about their migrations little or nothing is known but in october and november this species regularly strikes many of our lighthouses and lightships being attracted by the light it is found along the whole of the countries fringing the atlantic and nests from the faroes southwards and also along the shores of the western end of the mediterranean the single white egg is deposited during the latter half of june down holes in heaps of stones in or in any other spot affording suitable concealment incubation which is probably undertaken by both sexes lasts about days the nestling when hatched being covered with long black down their food consists of crustaceans small ﬁsh and fatty matter of any kind they are nocturnal during the breeding season at all events only leaving their retreat after dark and returning before dawn so that it is very difﬁcult to detect their presence the sitting bird however utters curious note while sitting and strong musky odour pervades the burrow so that by this means the nest may frequently be found if handled the bird emits greenish oil in england it only nests sparingly on the coast of wales and in the scilly islands but in scotland and ireland its breeding places are numerous the adult is sooty black all over but the bases of the tail coverts are white and the edges of the wing coverts are slightly edged with white length in wing in leach s petrel

egg in or other crevices it is not known to breed on the east coast but down the west from wales northwards well in ireland it breeds commonly though from its nocturnal habits the nest is not always easy to ﬁnd it may be distinguished when ﬂying by its rounded wings and its habit of progressing with wings held motionless close over the surface of the water the crown nape and upper parts are sooty
