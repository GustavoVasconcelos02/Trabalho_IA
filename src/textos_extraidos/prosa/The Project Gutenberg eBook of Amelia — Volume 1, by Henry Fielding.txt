she then gave loose to her passion they opened the hamper he seized him by the collar introduction fielding third great novel has been the subject of much more discordant judgments than either of its forerunners if we take the period since its appearance covering four generations we ﬁnd the greatest authority in the earliest johnson speaking of it with something more nearly approaching to enthusiasm than he allowed himself in reference to any other work of an author to whom he was on the whole so unjust the greatest man of letters of the next generation scott whose attitude to fielding was rather undecided and seems to speak mixture of intellectual admiration and moral dislike or at least failure in sympathy pronounces it on the whole unpleasin g and regards it chieﬂy sequel to tom jones showing what is to be expected of libertine and thoughtless husband but he too is enthusiastic over the heroine thackeray whom in this special connection at any rate it is scarcely too much to call the greatest man of the third generation overﬂows with predilection it but chieﬂy it would seem because of his affection amelia herself in which he practically agrees with scott and johnson it would be invidious and is noways needful the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https out any critic of our own time to place beside these great men but it can not be denied that the book now always has incurr ed considerable amount of hinted fault and hesitated dislike even dobson notes some things in it unsatisfactory gosse with evident consciousness of temerity ventures to ask whether it is not little dull the very absence of episodes on the ground that miss matthews story is too closely connected with the main action to be fairly called an episode and of introductory dissertations has been brought against it the presence of these things was brought against its forerunners i have sometimes wondered whether amelia pays the penalty of an audacity which priori its most unfavourable critics would indignantly deny to be fault it begins instead of ending with the and though critic after critic of novels has exhausted his indignation and his satire over the folly of insisting on these ﬁnale i doubt whether the demand is not too deeply rooted in the english nay in the human mind to be safely neglected the essence of all romance is quest the quest most perennially and universally interesting to man is the quest of wife or mistress and the chapters dealing with what comes later have an inevitable ﬂavour of tameness and of the day after the feast it is not common to meet anybody who thinks tommy moore great poet one has to encounter either suspicion of philistinism or suspicion of paradox if one tries to vindicate him even his due place in the poetical hierarchy yet i suspect that poet ever put into words more universal criticism of life than he did when he wrote i saw from the beach with its moral give back give back the wild freshness of smiles and her tears are worth evening best light if we discard this fallacy boldly and ask ourselves whether amelia is or is not good joseph andr ews or tom jones we shall i think be inclined to answer rather in the afﬁrmative than in the negative it is perhaps little more easy to ﬁnd fault with its characters than with theirs or rather though one of these characters has the defects of bliﬁl or of allworthy it is easy to say that one of them has the charm of the best personages of the earlier books the idolaters of amelia would of course exclaim at this sentence it regards that amiable lady and i am myself by means disposed to rank amiability low in the scale of things excellent in woman but though she is by means what her namesake and spiritual miss sedley must i fear be pronounced to be an amiable fool there is really too much of the milk of human kindness unrefreshed and unrelieved of its mawkishness by the rum or whisky of human frailty in her one could have better pardoned her forgiveness of her husband if she had in the ﬁrst place been little more conscious of what there was to forgive and in the second little more romantic in her attachment to him it is he was son homme he was handsome he had broad shoulders he had sweet temper he was the father of her children and that was enough at least we are allowed to see in booth qualities other than these and in her imagination even of any other qualities to put what i mean out of reach of cavil compare imogen and amelia and the dif ference will be felt but fielding was prose writer writing in london in the eighteenth century while shakespeare was poet writing in all time and all space so that the comparison is luminous in more ways than one i not think that in the special scheme which the nove list set himself here he can be accused of any failure the life is vivid ever the minor sketches may be even called little more vivid dr harrison is not perfect i not mean that he has the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https that is merit not defect but he is not quite perfect in art his alternate persecution and patronage of booth though useful to the story repeat the earlier fault of allworthy and are something of blot but he is individually much more natural than allworthy and indeed is something like what dr johnson would have been if he had been rather better bred less crotchety and blessed with more health miss matthews in her earlier scenes has touches of greatness which thousand french novelists lavishing candour and reckless of exaggeration have not equalled and i believe that fielding kept her at distance during the later scenes of the story because he could not trust himself not to make her more interesting than amelia of the peers more wicked and less wicked there is indeed not much good to be said the peer of the writers even when in fielding case there was reason why they should mention him with kor policeman has it is almost always faint type of goodness or wickedness dressed out with stars and ribbons and only swift by combination of experience and genius has given us live lords in lord sparkish and lord smart but ellison and atkinson are very women and the serjeant though the touch of sensibility is on him is excellent and dr harrison country friend and his prig of son are capital and bondum and the author and robinson and all the minor characters are good they can be it is however usual to detect lack of vivacity in the book an evidence of declining health and years it may be so it is at least certain that fielding during the composition of amelia had much less time to bestow upon elaborating his work than he had previously had and that his health was breaking but are we perfectly sure that if the chronological order had been different we should have pronounced the same verdict had amelia come between joseph and tom how many of us might have committed ourselves to some such sentence this in amelia we see the youthful exuberances of joseph andr ews corrected by higher art the adjustment of plot and character arranged with fuller craftsmanship the genius which was to ﬁnd its fullest exempliﬁcation in tom jones already displaying maturity and we not too often forget that very short fact barely three between the appearance of tom jones and the appearance of amelia that although we not know how long the earlier work had been in preparation it is extremely improbable that man of fielding temperament of his wants of his known habits and history would have kept it when once ﬁnished long in his desk and that conse quently between some scenes of tom jones and some scenes of amelia it is not improbable that there was more than few months interval i not urge these things in mitigation of any unfavourable judgment against the later novel i only much of that unfavourable judgment ought in justice to be set down to the fallacies connected with an imperfect appreciation of facts to it is not so much question of deciding whether i like amelia less and if so how much less than the others question what part of the general conception of this great writer it supplies i not think that we could fully understand fielding without it i not think that we could derive the full quantity of pleasure from him without it the exuberant romantic faculty of joseph andrews and its pleasant satire the mighty craftsmanship and the vast science of life of tom jones the ineffable irony and logical grasp of jonathan wild might have left us with slight sense of hardness vague desire unction if it had not been this completion of the picture we should not have known in the other books with the possible exception of fitzpatrick the characters are little too determinately goats and sheep how fielding could draw nuances how he could project mixed personage on the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https if we had not had miss matthews and last especially ﬁgure full of the ﬁnest strokes and rule insufﬁciently done justice to by critics and i have purposely left to the last group of personages about whom indeed there has been little question but who are among the triumphs of fielding two colonels and their the wife of the one and the sister of the other colonel bath has necessarily united all suffrages he is of course very little stagey he reminds us that his author had had long theatrical apprenticeship he is something too much piece but study of the brave man who is almost more braggart than brave of the generous man who will sacriﬁce not only generosity but bare justice to hogo of honour he is admirable and up to his time almost unique ordinary writers and ordinary readers have never been quite content to admit that bravery and braggadocio can go together that the man of honour may be selﬁsh pedant people have been unwilling to tell and to hear the whole truth even about wolfe and nelson who were both favourable specimens of the type but fielding the infallible saw that type in its quiddity and knew it and registered it ever less amusing but more delicately faithful and true are colonel james and his wife they are both very good sort of people in way who live in lax and frivolous age who have plenty of money particular principle strong affection each other and little individual character they might have james to some extent estimable and harmless but even it is they are not to be wholly ill spoken of being what they are fielding has taken them and with relentlessness which swift could hardly have exceeded and which swift rarely or never attained has held them up to us dissected preparations of meanness scoundrelism and vanity such are hardly anywhere else to be found i have used the word preparations and it in part indicates fielding virtue virtue shown i think in this book much anywhere but it does not fully indicate it the preparation wet or dry is dead thing and museum is but mortuary fielding men and women

accidents which befel very worthy couple after their uniting in the state of matrimony will be the subject of the following history the distresses which they waded through were some of them so exquisite and the incidents which produced these so extraordinary that they seemed to requir not only the utmost malice but the utmost invention which superstition hath ever attributed to fortune though whether any such being interfered in the case or indeed whether there be any such being in the universe is matter which i by means presume to determine in the afﬁrmative to speak bold truth i am after much mature deliberation inclined to suspect that the public voice hath in all ages done much injustice to fortune and hath convicted her of many facts in which she had not the least concern i question much whether we may not by natural means account the success of knaves the calamities of fools with all the miseries in which men of sense sometimes involve themselves by quitting the directions of prudence and following the blind guidance of predominant passion in short all the ordinary phenomena which are imputed to fortune whom perhaps men accuse with less absurdity in life than bad player complains of ill luck at the game of chess but if men are sometimes guilty of layin g improper blame on this imaginary being they are altogether apt to make her amends by ascribing to her honours which she little deserves to retrieve the ill consequences of foolish conduct and by struggling manfully with distress to subdue it is one of the noblest efforts of wisdom and virtue whoever therefo re calls such man fortunate is guilty of less impropriety in speech than he would be who should call the statuary or the poet fortunate who carved venus or who writ an iliad life may properly be called an art any other and the great incidents in it are more to be considered mere accidents than the several members of ﬁne statue or noble poem the critics in all these are not content with seeing anything to be great without knowing why and how it came to be so by examining carefully the several gradations which conduce to bring every model to perfection we learn truly to know that science in which the model is formed histories of this kind therefore may properly be called models of human life so by observing minutely the several incidents which tend to the catastrophe or completion of the whole and the minute causes whence those incidents are produced we shall best be instructed in this most useful of all arts which i call the art of life chapter ii the history sets out observations on the excellency of the english constitutio n and curious examinations befor justice of peace on the ﬁrst of april in the year the watchmen of certain parish i know not particularly which within the liberty of westminster brought several persons whom they had apprehended the preceding night before jonathan thrasher one of the justices of the peace that liberty the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https here reader before we proceed to the trials of these offenders we shall after our usual manner premise some things which it may be necessary thee to know it hath been observed i think by many well the celebrated writer of three letters that human institution is capable of consummate perfection an observation whic h perhaps that writer at least gathered from discovering some defects in the polity even of this nation and indeed if there should be any such defect in constitution which my lord coke long ago told us the wisdom of all the wise men in the world if they had all met together at one time could not have equalled which some of our wisest men who were met together long before said was too good to be altered in any particular and which nevertheless hath been mending ever since by very great number of the said wise men if i say this constitution should be imperfect we may be allowed i think to doubt whether any such faultless model can be found among the institutions of men it will probably be objected that the small imperfections which i am about to produce not lie in the laws themselves but in the ill execution of them but with submission this appears to to be less an absurdity than to say of any machine that it is excellently made though incapable of performing its functions good laws should execute themselves in regulated state at least if the same legislature which provides the laws doth not provide the execution of them they act graham would if he should form all the parts of clock in the most exquisite manner yet put them so together that the clock could not go in this case surely we might say that there was small defect in the constitution of the clock to say the truth graham would soon see the fault and would easily remedy it the fault indeed could be other than that the parts were improperly disposed perhaps reader i have another illustration which will set my intention in still clearer light before you figure to yourself then family the master of which should dispose of the several economical ofﬁces in the following manner viz should put his butler in the his steward behind his coach his coachman in the butlery and his footman in the stewardship and in the same ridiculous manner should misemploy the talents of every other servant it is easy to see what ﬁgure such family must make in the world ridiculous this may seem i have often considered some of the lower ofﬁcers in our civil government to be disposed in this very manner to begin i think low i well can with the watchmen in our metropolis who being to guard our streets by night from thieves and robbers an ofﬁce which at least requires strength of body are chosen out of those poor old decrepit people who are from their want of bodily strength rendered incapable of getting livelihood by work these men armed only with pole which some of them are scarce able to lift are to secure the persons and houses of his majesty subjects from the attacks of gangs of young bold stout desperate and villains quae non viribus istis munera conveniunt if the poor old fellows should run away from such enemies one i think can wonder unless it be that they were able to make their the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https higher we proceed among our public ofﬁcers and magistrates the less defects of this kind will perhaps be observable thrasher however the justice before whom the prisoners above mentioned were now brought had some few imperfections in his magistratical capacity i own i have been sometimes inclined to think that this ofﬁce of justice of peace requires some knowledge of the law this simple reason because in every case which comes before him he is to judge and act according to law again these laws are contained in great variety of books the statutes which relate to the ofﬁce of justice of peace making of themselves at least two large volumes in folio and that part of his jurisdiction which is founded on the common law being dispersed in above hundred volumes i can not conceive how this knowledge should by acquire d without reading and yet certain it is thrasher never read one syllable of the matter this perhaps was defect but this was not all where mere ignorance is to decide point between two litigants it will always be an even chance whether it decides right or wrong but sorry am i to say right was often in much worse situation than this and wrong hath often had ﬁve hundred to one on his side before that magistrate who if he was ignorant of the law of england was yet well versed in the laws of nature he perfectly well understood that fundamental principle so strongly laid down in the institutes of the learned rochefoucault by which the duty of is so strongly enforced and every man is taught to consider himself the centre of gravity and to attract all things thither to speak the truth plainly the justice was never indif ferent in cause but when he could get nothing on either side such was the justice to whose tremendous bar gotobed the constable on the day above mentioned brought several delinquents who we have said had been apprehended by the watch diverse outrages the ﬁrst who came upon his trial was bloody spectre ever the imagination of murderer or tragic poet conceived this poor wretch was charged with battery by much stouter man than himself indeed the accused person bore about him some evidence that he had been in an affray his cloaths being very bloody but certain open sluices on his own head sufﬁciently shewed whence all the scarl et stream had issued whereas the accuser had not the least mark or appearance of any wound the justice asked the defendant what he meant by breaking the king peace which he upon my shoul i love the king very well and i have not been after breaking anything of his that i know but upon my shoul this man hath brake my head and my head did brake his stick that is all gra he then offered to produce several witnesses against this improbable accusation but the justice presently interrupted him saying sirrah your tongue betrays your guilt you are an irishman and that is always sufﬁcient evidence with the second criminal was poor woman who was taken up by the watch it was alleged against her that she was found walking the streets after twelve and the watchman declared he believed her to be common strumpet she pleaded in her defence was really the truth that she was servant and was sent by her mistress who was little shopkeeper and upon the point of delivery to fetch midwife which she offered to prove by several of the neighbours if she was allowed to send them the justice asked her why she had not done it before to which she answered she had money and could get messenger the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https justice then called her several scurrilous names and declaring she was guilty within the statute of ordered her to bridewell month genteel young man and woman were then set forward and very looking person swore he caught them in situation which we can not particularly describe here he did before the magistrate who having received wink from his clerk declared with much warmth that the fact was incredible and impossible he presently dischar ged the accus ed parties and was going without any evidence to commit the accuser perjury but this the clerk dissuaded him from saying he doubted whether justice of peace had any such power the justice at ﬁrst differed in opinion and said he had seen man stand in the pillory about perjury nay he had known man in gaol it too and how came he there if he was not committed thither why that is true sir answered the clerk and yet i have been told by very great lawyer that man can not be committed perjury before he is indicted and the reason is i believe because it is not against the peace before the indictment makes it so why that may be cries the justice and indeed perjury is but scandalous words and i know man can not have warrant those unless you put rioting footnote opus est interpr ete by the laws of england abusive words are not punishable by the magistrate some commissioners of the peace therefore when one scold hath applied to them warrant against another from too eager desire of doing justice have construed little harmless scolding into riot which is in law an outrageous breach of the peace committed by several persons by three at the least nor can less number be convicted of it under this word rioting or riotting i have seen it spelt both ways many thousands of old women have been arrested and put to expense sometimes in prison little intemperate use of their tongues this practice began to decrease in the year 1749 them into the warrant the witness was now about to be dischar ged when the lady whom he had accused declared she would swear the peace against him that he had called her whore sever al times oho you will swear the peace madam will you cries the justice give her the peace presently and pray constable secure the prisoner now we have him while warrant is made to take him up all which was immediately performed and the poor witness want of securities was sent to prison young fellow whose name was booth was now charged with beating the watchman in the execution of his ofﬁce and breaking his lanthorn this was deposed by two witnesses and the shattered remains of broken lanthorn which had been long preserved the sake of its testimony were produced to corroborate the evidence the justice perceiving the criminal to be but shabbily drest was going to commit him without asking any further questions at length however at the earnest request of the accused the worthy magistrate submitted to hear his defence the young man then alledged was in reality the case that he was walking home to his lodging he saw two men in the street cruelly beating third upon which he had stopt and endeavoured to assist the person who was so unequally attacked that the watch came up during the affray and took them all four into custody that they were immediately carried to the where the two original assailants who appeared to be men of fortune found means to make up the matter and were dischar ged by the constable favour which he himself having money in his pocket was unable to obtain he utterly denied having assaulted any of the watchmen and solemnly declared that he was offered his liberty at the price of half crown the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https the bare word of an offender can never be taken against the oath of his accuser yet the matter of this defence was so pertinent and delivered with such an air of truth and sincerity that had the magistrate been endued with much sagacity or had he been very moderately gifted with another quality very necessary to all who are to administer justice he would have employed some labour in examining the watchmen at least he would have given the defendant the time he desired to send the other persons who were present at the affray neither of which he did in short the magistrate had too great an hono ur truth to suspect that she ever appeared in sordid apparel nor did he ever sully his sublime notions of that virtue by uniting them with the mean ideas of poverty and distress there remained now only one prisoner and that was the poor man himself in whose defence the culprit was engaged his trial took but very short time cause of battery and broken lanthorn was instituted again st him and proved in the same manner nor would the justice hear one word in defence but though his patience was exhausted his breath was not against this last wretch he poured forth great many volleys of menaces and abuse the delinquents were then all dispatch ed to prison under guard of watchmen and the justice and the constable adjourned to neighbouring alehouse to take their morning repast chapter iii containing the inside of prison booth we shall not trouble you with the rest was sooner arrived in the prison than number of persons gathered round him all demanding garnish to which booth not making ready answer indeed he did not understand the word some were going to lay hold of him when person of apparent dignity came up and insisted that one should affront the gentleman this person then who was less than the master or keeper of the prison turning towards booth acquainted him that it was the custom of the place every prisoner upon his ﬁrst arrival there to give something to the former prisoners to make them drink this he said was what they call garnish and concluded with advising his new customer to draw his purse upon the present occasion booth answered that he would very readily comply with this laudable custom was it in his powe r but that in reality he had not shilling in his pocket and what was worse he had not shilling in the oho if that be the case cries the keeper it is another matter and i have nothing to say upon which he immed iately departed and left poor booth to the mercy of his companions who without loss of time applied themselves to uncasing they termed it and with such dexterity that his coat was not only stript of f but out of sight in minute booth was too weak to resist and too wise to complain of this usage soon therefore he was at liberty and declared free of the place he summoned his philosophy of which the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https inconsiderable share to his assistance and resolved to make himself easy possible under his present circumstances could his own thoughts indeed have suffered him moment to forget where he was the dispositions of the other prisoners might have induced him to believe that he had been in happier place much the greater part of his ferers instead of wailing and repining at their condition were laughing singing and diverting themselves with various kinds of sports and gambols the ﬁrst person accosted him was called blear moll woman of very comely appearance her eye she had but one whence she derived her nickname was such that nickname bespoke besides which it had two remarkable qualities ﬁrst if nature had been careful to provide her own defect it constantly looked towards her blind side and secondly the ball consisted almost entirely of white or rather yellow with little grey spot in the corner so small that it was scarce discernible nose she had none venus envious perhaps at her former charms had carried off the gristly part and some earthly damsel perhaps from the same envy had levelled the bone with the rest of her face indeed it was far beneath the bones of her cheeks which rose proportionally higher than is usual about half dozen ebony teeth fortiﬁed that large and long canal which nature had cut from ear to ear at the bottom of which was chin preposterously short nature having turned up the bottom instead of suf fering it to grow to its due length her body was well adapted to her face she measured full much round the middle from head to foot besides the extreme breadth of her back her vast breasts had long since forsaken their native home and had settled themselves little below the girdle i wish certain actresses on the stage when they are to perform characters of amiable cast would study to dress themselves with the propriety with which blear moll was now arrayed the sake of our squeamish reader we shall not descend to particulars let it sufﬁce to say nothing more ragged or more dirty was ever emptied out of the at st giles we have taken the more pains to describe this person two remarkable reasons the one is that this unlovely creature was taken in the fact with very pretty young fellow the other which is more productive of moral lesson is that however wretched her fortune may appear to the reader she was one of the merriest persons in the whole prison blear moll then came up to booth with smile or rather grin on her countenance and asked him dram of gin and when booth assured her that he had not penny of money she your eyes i thought by your look you had been clever fellow and upon the snafﬂing lay footnote cant term robbery on the highway at least but n your body and eyes i ﬁnd you are some sneaking budge footnote another cant term pilfering rascal she then launched forth volley of dreadful oaths interlarded with some language not proper to be repeated here and was going to lay hold on poor booth when tall prisoner who had been very earnestly eying booth some time came up and taking her by the shoulder ﬂung her off at some distance cursing her and bidding her let the gentleman the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https person was not himself of the most inviting aspect he was visaged and pale with red beard of above fortnight growth he was attired in coat which would have shewed more holes than it did had not the linen which appeared through it been entirely of the same colour with the cloth this gentleman whose name was robinson addressed himself very civilly to booth and told him he was sorry to see one of his appearance in that place to your being without your coat sir says he i can easily account that and indeed dress is the least part which distinguishes gentleman at which words he cast signiﬁcant look on his own coat if he desired they should be applied to himself he then proceeded in the following manner i perceive sir you are but just arrived in this dismal place which is indeed rendered more detestable by the wretches who inhabit it than by any other circumstance but even these wise man will soon bring himself to bear with indifference what is is and what must be must be the knowledge of this which simple it appears is in truth the heighth of all philosophy renders wise man superior to every evil which can befall him i hope sir very dreadful accident is the cause of your coming hither but whatever it was you may be assured it could not be otherwise all things happen by an inevitable fatality and man can more resist the impulse of fate than wheelbarrow can the force of its driver besides the obligation which robinson had conferred on booth in delivering him from the insults of blear moll there was something in the manner of robinson which notwithstanding the meanness of his dress seemed to distinguish him from the crowd of wretches who swarmed in those regio ns and above all the sentiments which he had just declared very nearly coincided with those of booth this gentleman was what they call freethinker that is to say deist or perhaps an atheist though he did not absolutely deny the existence of god yet he entirely denied his providence doctrine which if it is not downright atheism hath direct tendenc y towards it and dr clarke observes may soon be driven into it and to booth though he was in his heart an extreme to religion he was an honest man yet his notions of it were very slight and uncertain to say truth he was in the wavering condition so ﬁnely described by claudian labefacta cadelat religio non sponte sequebar alterius vacua quae currere semina motu afﬁrmat magnumque novas fer inane ﬁgures fortuna non arte regi quae numina sensu ambiguo vel nulla futat vel nescia nostri this way of thinking or rather of doubting he had contracted from the same reasons which claudian assigns and which had induced brutus in his latter days to doubt the existence of that virtue which he had all his life cultivated in short poor booth imagined that larger share of misfortunes had fallen to his lot than he had merited and this led him who though good classical scholar was not deeply learne d in religious matters into disadvantageous opinion of providence dangerous way of reasoning in which our conclusions are not only too hasty from an imperfect view of things but we are likewise liable to much error from partiality the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https viewing our virtues and vices through perspective in which we turn the glass always to our own advantage so to diminish the one and greatly to magnify the other from the above reasons it can be wonder that booth did not decline the acquaintance of this person in place which could not promise to afford him any better he answered him therefore with great courtesy indee d he was of very good and gentle disposition and after expressing civil surprize at meeting him there declared himself to be of the same opinion with regard to the necessity of human actions adding however that he did not believe men were under any blind impulse or direction of fate but that every man acted merely from the force of that passion which was uppermost in his mind and could otherwise discourse now ensued between the two gentlemen on the necessity arising from the impulse of fate and the necessity arising from the impulse of passion which it will make pretty pamphlet of itself we shall reserve some future opportunity when this was ended they set forward to survey the gaol and the prisoners with the several cases of whom robinson who had been some time under conﬁnement undertook to make booth acquainted chapter iv disclosing further secr ets of the the ﬁrst persons whom they passed by were three men in fetters who were enjoying themselves very merrily over bottle of wine and pipe of tobacco these robinson informed his friend were three bbers and were all certain of being hanged the ensuing sessions so inconsiderable an object said he is misery to light minds when it is at any distance little farther they beheld man prostrate on the ground whose heavy groans and frantic actions plainly indicated the highest disorder of mind this person was it seems committed small felony and his wife who then upon hearing the news had thrown herself from window two pair of stairs high by which means he had in all probability lost both her and his child very pretty girl then advanced towards them whose beauty booth could not help admiring the moment he saw her declaring at the same time he thought she had great innocence in her countenance robinson said she was committed thither an idle and disorderly person and common she past by booth she damned his eyes and dischar ged volley of words every one of which was too indecent to be repeated they now beheld little creature sitting by herself in corner and crying bitterly this girl robinson said was committed because her father who was in the grenadier guards had sworn that he was afraid of his life or of some bodily harm which she would him the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https could get sureties keeping the peace which reason justice thrasher had committed her to prison great noise now arose occasioned by the prisoners all ﬂocking to see fellow whipt petty larceny to which he was condemned by the court of quarter but this soon ended in the disappointment of the spectators the fellow after being stript having advanced another sixpence was dischar ged untouched this was immediately followed by another bustle blear moll and several of her companions having got possession of man who was committed certain odious unmanlike practices not ﬁt to be named were giving him various kinds of discipline and would probably have put an end to him had he not been rescued out of their hands by authority when this bustle was little allayed booth took notice of young woman in rags sitting on the ground and supporting the head of an old man in her lap who appeared to be giving up the ghost these robinson inform ed him were father and daughter that the latter was committed stealing loaf in order to support the former and the former receiving it knowing it to be stolen man then walked surlily by them whom robinson reported to have been committed on an indictment found against him most horrid perjury but says he we expect him to be bailed today good heaven cries booth can such villains ﬁnd bail and is person charitable enough to bail that poor father and daughter oh sir answered robinson the offence of the daughter being felony is held not to be bailable in law whereas perjury is misdemeanor only and therefore persons who are even indicted it are nevertheless capable of being bailed nay of all perjuries that of which this man is indicted is the worst it was with an intention of taking away the life of an innocent person by form of law to perjuries in civil matters they are not so very criminal they are not said booth and yet even these are most ﬂagitious offence and worthy the highest punishment surely they ought to be distinguished answered robinson from the others what is taking away little property from man compared to taking away his life and his reputation and ruining his family into the bargain hope there can be comparison in the crimes and i think there ought to be none in the punishment however at present the punishment of all perjury is only pillory and transportation seven years and it is traversable and bailable offence methods are found to escape any punishment at all footnote by removing the indictment by certiorari into the king bench the trial is so long postponed and the costs are so highly encreased that prosecutors are often tired out and some incapacitated from pursuing verbum sapienti booth exprest great astonishment at this when his attention was suddenly diverted by the most miserable object that he had yet seen this was wretch almost naked and who bore in his countenance joined to an appearance of honesty the marks of poverty hunger and disease he had moreover wooden leg and two or three scars on his forehead the case of this poor man is indeed unhappy enough said robinson he hath served his country lost his limb and received several wounds at the siege of gibraltar when he was dischar ged from the hospital abroad he came over to get into that of chelsea but could not immedia tely none of his ofﬁcers were then in england in the mean time he was one day apprehended and committed hither on suspicion of stealing three herrings from ﬁshmonger he was the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https months ago this offence and acquitted indeed his innocence manifestly appeared at the trial but he was brought back again his fees and here he hath lain ever since booth exprest great horror at this account and declared if he had only so much money in his pocket he would pay his fees him but added that he was not posses sed of single farthing in the world robinson hesitated moment and then said with smile i am going to make you sir very odd proposal after your last declaration but what say you to game at cards it will serve to pass tedious hour and may divert your thoughts from more unpleasant speculations i not imagine booth would have agreed to this though some love of gaming had been formerly amongst his faults yet he was not so egregiously addicted to that vice to be tempted by the shabby plight of robinson who had if i may so express myself charms gamester if he had however any such inclinations he had opportunity to follow them before he could make any answer to robinson proposal strapping wench came up to booth and taking hold of his arm asked him to walk aside with her saying what pox are you such fresh cull that you not know this fellow why he is gambler and committed cheating at play there is not such pickpocket in the whole quad footnote cant word prison scene of altercation now ensued between robinson and the lady which ended in bout at ﬁsticuf fs in which the lady was greatly superior to the philosopher while the two combatants were engage d man rather better drest than the majority of the company came up to booth and taking him aside said i am sorry sir to see gentleman you appear to be in such intimacy with that rascal who makes scruple of disowning all revealed religion crimes they are human errors and signify but little nay perhaps the worse man is by nature the more room there is grace the spirit is active and loves best to inhabit those minds where it may meet with the most work whatever your crime be therefore i would not have you despair but rather rejoice at it perhaps it may be the means of your being called he ran on considerable time with this cant without waiting an answer and ended in declaring himself methodist just the methodist had ﬁnished his discourse beautiful young woman was ushered into the gaol she was genteel and well drest and did not in the least resemble those females whom booth had hitherto seen the constable had sooner delivered her at the gate than she asked with commanding voice the keeper and when he arrived she said to him well sir whither am i to be conducted i hope i am not to take up my lodging with these creatures the keeper answered with kind of surly respect madam we have rooms those who can afford to pay them at these words she pulled handsome purse from her pocket in which many guineas chinked saying with an air of indignation that she was not come thither on account of poverty the keeper sooner viewed the purse than his features became all softened in an instant and with all the courtesy of which he was master he desired the lady to walk with him assuring her that she should have the best apartment in his house booth was now left alone the methodist had forsaken him having the phrase of the sect is searched him to the bottom in fact he had thoroughly examined every one of the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https pockets from which he had conveyed away penknife and an iron these being all the moveables which were to be found booth was standing near the gate of the prison when the young lady above mentioned was introduced into the yard he viewed her features very attentively and was persuaded that he knew her she was indeed so remarkably handsome that it was hardly possible any who had ever seen her to forget her he enquired of one of the underkeepers if the name of the prisoner lately arrived was not matthews to which he was answered that her name was not matthews but vincent and that she was committed murder the latter part of this information made booth suspect his memory more than the former it was very possible that she might have changed her name but he hardly thought she could so far have changed her nature to be guilty of crime so very incongruous with her former gentle manners miss matthews had both the birth and education of gentlewoman he concluded therefore that he was certainly mistaken and rested satisﬁed without any further enquiry chapter containing certain adventur es which befel mr booth in the prison the remainder of the day booth spent in melancholy contemplation on his present condition he was destitute of the common necessaries of life and conseque ntly unable to subsist where he was nor was there single person in town to whom he could with any reasonable hope apply his delivery grief some time banished the thoughts of food from his mind but in the morning nature began to grow uneasy want of her usual nourishment he had not eat morse l during the last forty hours penny loaf which is it seems the ordinary allowance to the prisoners in bridewell was now delivered him and while he was eating this man brought him little packet sealed up informing him that it came by messenger who said it required answer booth now opened his packet and after unfolding several pieces of blank paper successively at last discovered guinea wrapt with great care in the inmost paper he was vastly surprized at this sight he had few if any friends from whom he could expect such favour slight it was and not one of his friends he was apprized knew of his conﬁnement there was direction to the packet nor word of writing contained in it he began to suspect that it was delivered to the wrong person and being one of the most untainted honesty he found out the man who gave it him and again examined him concerning the person who brought it and the message delivered with it the man assured booth that he had made mistake saying if your name is booth sir i am positive you are the gentleman to whom the parcel i gave you belongs the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https most scrupulous honesty would perhaps in such situation have been well enough satisﬁed in ﬁnding owner the guinea especially when proclamation had been made in the prison that booth had received packet without any direction to which if any person had any claim and would discover the contents he was ready to deliver it to such claimant such claimant being found i mean none who knew the contents many swore that they expected just such packet and believed it to be their property booth very calmly resolved to apply the money to his own use the ﬁrst thing after redemption of the coat which booth hungry he was thought of was to supply himself with snuff which he had long to his great sorrow been without on this occasion he presently missed that iron box which the methodist had so dexterously conveyed out of his pocket we mentioned in the last chapter he sooner missed this box than he immediately suspected that the gambler was the person who had stolen it nay so well was he assured of this man guilt that it may perhaps be improper to say he barely suspected it though booth was we have hinted man of very sweet disposition yet was he rather overwarm having therefore doubt concerning the person of the thief he eagerly sought him out and very bluntly char ged him with the fact the gambler whom i think we should now call the philosopher received this charge without the least visible emotion either of mind or muscle after short pause of few moments he answered with great solemnity follows young man i am entirely unconcerned at your groundless suspicion he that censures stranger i am to you without any cause makes worse compliment to himself than to the stranger you know yourself friend you know not it is true indeed you heard accused of being cheat and gamester but who is my accuser look at my apparel friend thieves and gamesters wear such cloaths these play is my folly not my vice it is my impu lse and i have been martyr to it would gamester have asked another to play when he could have lost and won nothing however if you are not satisﬁed you may search my pockets the outside of all but one will serve your turn and in that one there is the i told you of he then turned up his cloaths and his pockets entirely resembled the pitchers of the belides booth was little staggered at this defence he said the real value of the iron box was too inconsiderable to mention but that he had capricious value it the sake of the person who gave it him though it is not said he worth sixpence i would willingly give crown to any one who would bring it again robinson answered if that be the case you have nothing more to but to signify your intention in the prison and i am well convinced you will not be long without regaining the possession of your snuf box this advice was immediately followed and with success the methodist presently producing the box which he said he had found and should have returned it before had he known the person to whom it belonged adding with uplifted eyes that the spirit would not suffer him knowingly to detain the goods of another however inconsiderable the value was why so friend said robinson have i not heard you often say the wickeder any man was the better provided he was what you call believer you mistake cries cooper that was the name of the methodist man can be wicked after he is possessed by the spirit there is the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https difference between the days of sin and the days of grace i have been sinner myself i believe thee cries robinson with sneer i care not answered the other what an atheist believes i suppose you would insinuate that i stole the but i value not your malice the lord knows my innocence he then walked off with the reward and booth turning to robinson very earnestly asked pardon his groundless suspicion which the other without any hesitation accorded him saying you never accused sir you suspected some gambler with whose character i have concern i should be angry with friend or acquaintance who should give hasty credit to any allegation against but i have reason to be offended with you believing what the woman and the rascal who is just gone and who is committed here pickpocket which you did not perhaps know told you to my disadvantage and if you thought to be gambler you had just reason to suspect any ill of i myself am conﬁned here by the perjury of one of those villains who having cheated of my money at play and hearing that i intended to apply to magistrate against him himself began the attack and obtained warrant against of justice thrasher who without hearing one speech in my defence committed to this place booth testiﬁed great compassion at this account and he having invited robins on to dinner they spent that day together in the afternoon booth indulged his friend with game at cards at ﬁrst halfpence and afterwards shillings when fortune so favoured robin son that he did not leave the other single shilling in his pocket surprizing run of luck in gamester is often mistaken somewhat else by persons who are not believers in the divinity of fortune i have known stranger at bath who hath happened fortunately i might almost say unfortunately to have four by honours in his hand almost every time he dealt whole evening shunned universally by the whole company the next day and certain it is that booth though of temper very little inclined to suspicion began to waver in his opinion whether the character given by robinson of himself or that which the others gave of him was the truer in the morning hunger paid him second visit and found him again in the same situation before after some deliberation therefore he resolved to ask robinson to lend him shilling or two of that money which was lately his own and this experiments he thought would conﬁrm him either in good or evil opinion of that gentleman to this demand robinson answered with great alacrity that he should very gladly have complied had not fortune played one of her jade tricks with him since my winning of you said he i have been stript not only of your money but my own he was going to harangue farther but booth with great indignation turned from him this poor gentleman had very little time to reﬂect on his own misery or the rascality it appeared to him of the other when the same person who had the day before delivered him the guinea from the unknown hand again accosted him and told him lady in the house so he expressed himself desired the favour of his company booth immediately obeyed the message and was conducted into room in the

booth that having heard there was person in the prison who knew her by the name of matthews she had great curiosity to inquire who he was whereupon he had been shewn to her from the window of the house that she immediately recollected him and being informed of his distressful situation which she expressed great concern she had sent him that guinea which he had received the day before and then proceeded to excuse herself not having desired to see him at that time when she was under the greatest disorder and hurry of spirits booth made many handsome acknowledgments of her favour and added that he very little wondered at the disorder of her spirits concluding that he was heartily concerned at seeing her there but i hope madam said here he hesitated upon which bursting into an agony of tears she cried out captain captain many extraordinary things have passed since last i saw you gracious heaven did i ever expect that this would be the next place of our meeting she then ﬂung herself into her chair where she gave loose to her passion whilst he in the most affectionate and tender manner endeavoured to soothe and comfort her but passion itself did probably more its own relief than all his friendly consolations having vented this in large ﬂood of tears she became pretty well composed but booth unhappily mentioning her father she again relapsed into an agony and cried out why why will you repeat the name of that dear man i have disgraced him booth i am unworthy the name of his daughter here passion again stopped her words and dischar ged itself in tears after this second vent of sorrow or shame or if the reader pleases of rage she once more recovered from her agonies to say the truth these are i believe critical dischar ges of nature any of those which are so called by the physicians and more effectually relieve the mind than any remedies with which the whole materia medica of philosophy can supply it when vincent had recovered her faculties she perceived booth standing silent with mixture of concern and astonishment in his countenance then addressing herself to him with an air of most bewitching softness of which she was perfect mistress she said i not wonder at your amazement captain booth nor indeed at the concern which you so plainly discover i well know the goodness of your nature but booth believe when you know what hath happened since our last meeting your concern will be raised however your astonishment may cease sir you are stranger to the cause of my sorrows the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https i hope i am madam

that neither could shakspear describe nor hogarth paint nor clive act fury in higher perfection illustration she then gave loose to her passions what you hear reiterated she you hear the resentment of the most injured of women you have heard you say of the murder but you know the cause booth have you since your return to england visited that country where we formerly knew one another tell you know my wretched story tell that my friend booth hesitated an answer indeed he had heard some imperfect stories not much to her advantage she waited not till he had formed speech but cried whatever you may have heard you can not be acquainted with all the strange accidents which have occasioned your seeing in place which at our last parting was so unlikely that i should ever have been found in nor can you know the cause of all that i have uttered and which i am convinced you never expected to have heard from my mouth if these circumstances raise your curiosity i will satisfy it he answered that curiosity was too mean word to express his ardent desire of knowing her story upon which with very little previous ceremony she began to relate what is written in the following chapter but before we put an end to this it may be necessary to whisper word or two to the critics who have perhaps begun to express less astonishment than booth that lady in whom we had remarked most extraordinary power

formal or indeed sober appearance one of the ladies i remember said to the other did you ever see anything look so modest and so innocent that girl over the way what pity it is such creature should be in the way of ruin i am afraid she is by her being alone with that young fellow now this lady was bad physiognomist it was impossible to conceive greater appearance of modesty innocence and simplicity than what nature had displayed in the countenance of that girl and yet all appearances notwithstanding i myself remember critic it was in my youth had few mornings before seen that very identical

may imagine i am going to begin my history at the time when you left the country but i can not help reminding you of something which happened before you will soon recollect the incident but i believe you little know the consequence either at that time or since alas i could keep secret then now i have secrets the world knows all and it is not worth my while to conceal anything well will not wonder i protest i can hardly tell it you even but i am convinced you have too good an opinion of yourself to the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https at any conquest you may

happened at an assembly betwixt myself and miss johnson about standing uppermost you was then my partner and young williams danced with the other lady the particulars are not now worth mentioning though i suppose you have long since forgot them let it sufﬁce that you supported my claim and williams very sneakingly gave up that of his partner who was with much difﬁculty afterwards prevailed to dance with him you am sure i repeat the words you would not the world affront any lady there but that you thought you might without any such danger declare that there was assembly in which that lady meaning your humble servant was not worthy of the uppermost place will i said you the ﬁrst duke in england when she is at the uppermost end of the room and hath called her dance to lead his partner

heavens cries booth is it possible you should so much unmerited honour and i should be dunce enough not to perceive the least symptom i assure you answered she i did all i could to prevent you and yet i almost hated you not seeing through what i strove to hide why booth was you not more will answer affections were more happily disposed of to much better woman than myself whom you married soon afterwards i should ask you her booth i should have asked you her before but i am unworthy of asking her or of calling her my acquaintance booth stopt her short she was running into another ﬁt of passion and begged her to omit all former matters and acquaint him with that part of her history to which he was an entire stranger she then renewed her discourse follows you know booth i soon afterwards left that town upon the death of my grandmother and returned home to my father house where i had not been long arrived before some troops of dragoons came to quarter in our neighbourhood among the ofﬁcers there was cornet whose detested name was hebbers name i could scarce repeat had i not at the same time the pleasure to reﬂect that he is now more my father you know who is hearty to the present government the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https to invite the ofﬁcers to his house so did he these nor was it long before this cornet in so particular manner recommended himself to the poor old gentleman i can not think of him without tears that our house became his principal habitation and he was rarely at his quarters unless when his superior ofﬁcers obliged him to be there i shall say nothing of his person nor could that be any recommendation to man it was such however woman could have made an objection to nature had certainly wrapt up her odious work in most beautiful covering to say the truth he was the handsomest man except one only that i ever assure you i have seen had besides all the qualiﬁcations of gentleman was genteel and extremely polite spoke french well and danced to miracle but what chieﬂy recommended him to my father was his skill in music of which you know that dear man was the most violent lover i wish he was not too susceptible of ﬂattery on that head i have heard hebbers often greatly commend my father performance and have observed that the good man was wonderfully pleased with such commendations to say the truth it is the only way i can account the extraordinary friendship which my father conceived this person such friendship that he at last became part of our family this very circumstance which i am convinced strongly recommended him to my father had the very contrary effect with i had never any delight in music and it was not without much difﬁculty i was prevailed on to learn to play on the harpsichord in which i had made very slender progress this man therefore was frequently the occasion of my being importuned to play against my will i began to entertain some dislike him on that account and to his person i assure you i long continued to look on it with great indif ference how strange will the art of this man appear to you presently who had sufﬁcient address to convert that very circumstance which had at ﬁrst occasioned my dislike into the ﬁrst seeds of affection him you have often i believe heard my sister betty play on the harpsichord she was indeed reputed the best performer in the whole country i was the farthest in the world from regarding this perfection of hers with envy in reality perhaps i despised all perfection of this kind at least i had neither skill nor ambition to excel this way i looked upon it matter of mere indif ference hebbers ﬁrst put this emulation in my head he took great pains to persuade that i had much greater abilities of the musical kind than my sister and that i might with the greatest ease if i pleased excel her offering at the same time his assistance if i would resolve to undertake it when he had sufﬁciently inﬂamed my ambition in which perhaps he found too little difﬁculty the continual praises of my sister which before i had disregarded became more and more nauseous in my ears and the rather music being the favourite passion of my father i became apprehensive not without frequent hints from hebbers of that nature that she might gain too great preference in his favour to my harpsichord then i applied myself night and day with such industry and attention that i soon began to perform in tolerable manner i not absolutely say i excelled my sister many were of dif ferent opinion but indeed there might be some partiality in all the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https hebbers at least declared himself on my side and nobody could doubt his judgment he asserted openly that i played in the better manner of the two and one day when i was playing to him alone he affected to burst into rapture of admiration and squeezing gently by the hand said there madam i now declare you excel your sister much in music added he in whispering sigh you her and all the world in every other charm woman can bear any superiority in whatever thing she desires to excel in i now began to hate all the admirers of my sister to be uneasy at every commendation bestow ed on her skill in music and consequently to love hebbers the preference which he gave to mine it was now that i began to survey the handsome person of hebbers with pleasure and here booth i will betray to you the grand secret of our women i believe with great innocence and even with great indifference converse with men of the ﬁnest persons but this i am conﬁdent may be afﬁrmed with truth that when once woman comes to ask this question of herself is the man whom i like some other reason handsome her fate and his too very strongly depend on her answering in the afﬁrmative hebbers sooner perceived that he had made an impression on my heart of which i am satisﬁed i gave him too undeniable tokens than he affected on sudden to shun in the most apparent manner he wore the most melancholy air in my presence and by his dejected looks and sighs ﬁrmly persuaded that there was some secret sorrow labouring in his bosom nor will it be difﬁcult you to imagine to what cause i imputed it whilst i was wishing his declaration of passion in which i thought i could not be mistaken and at the same time trembling whenever we met with the apprehension of this very declaration the widow carey came from london to make us visit intending to stay the whole summer at our house those who know carey will scarce think i her an injury in saying she is far from being handsome and yet she is ﬁnished coquette if she had the highest beauty to support that character but perhaps you have seen her and if you have i am convinced you will readily subscribe to my opinion booth answered he had not and then she proceeded in the following chapter chapter viii the history of miss matthews continued this young lady had not been three days with us before hebbers grew so particular with her that it was generally observed and my poor father who i believe loved the cornet if he had been his son began to jest on the occasion one who would not be displeased at throwing good jointure into the arms of his the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https you will easily guess sir the disposition of my mind on this occasion but i was not permitted to suffer long under it one day when hebbers was alone with he took an opportunity of expressing his abhorrence at the thoughts of marrying interest contrary to his inclinations i was warm on the subject and i believe went so far to say that none but fools and villains did so he replied with sigh yes madam but what would you think of man whose heart is all the while bleed ing another woman to whom he would willingly sacriﬁce the world but because he must sacriﬁce her interest well his own never durst even give her hint of that passion which was preying on his very vitals you believe miss fanny there is such wretch on earth i answered with an assumed coldness i did not believe there was he then took gently by the hand and with look so tender that i can not describe it vowed he was himself that wretch then starting if conscious of an error committed he cried with faltering voice am i saying pardon miss fanny since i beg only your pity i never will ask at these words hearing my father coming up i betrayed myself entirely if indeed i had not done it before i hastily withdrew my hand crying hush heaven sake my father is just coming in my blushes my look and my accent telling him i suppose all which he wished to know few days now brought matters to an eclaircissement between us the being undeceived in what had given so much uneasiness gave pleasure too sweet to be resisted to triumph over the widow whom i had in very short time contracted most inveterate hatred was pride not to be described hebbers appeared to to be the cause of all this happiness i doubted not but that he had the most disinterested passion and thought him every way worthy of its return i did return it and accepted him my lover he declared the greatest apprehensions of my father suspicion though i am convinced these were causeless had his designs been honourable to blind these i consented that he should carry on sham addresses to the widow who was now constant jest between us and he pretended from time to time to acquaint faithfully with everything that past at his interviews with her nor was this faithless woman wanting in her part of the deceit she carried herself to all the while with shew of affection and pretended to have the utmost friendship but such are the friendships of women at this remark booth though enough affected at some parts of the story had great difﬁculty to refrain from laughter but by good luck he escaped being perceived and the lady went on without interruption i am come now to part of my narrati ve in which it is impossible to be particular without being tedious to the commerce between lovers it is i believe much the same in all cases and there is perhaps scarce single phrase that hath not been repeated ten millions of times one thing however i strongly remarked it then so i will repeat it to you now in all our conversations in moments when he fell into the warmest raptures and exprest the greatest uneasiness at the delay of his joys he seldom mentioned the word marriage and never once solicited day that purpose indeed women can not be cautioned too much against such lovers though i have heard and perhaps truly of some of our sex of virtue so exalted that it is proof against every temptation yet the generality i am afraid are too much in the power of man to whom they have owned an affection what is called being upon the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https is perhaps being upon very dangerous one and woman who hath given her consent to marry can hardly be said to be safe till she is married and now sir i hasten to the period of my ruin we had wedding in our family my musical sister was married to young fellow musical herself such match you may be sure amongst other festivities must have ball oh booth shall modesty forbid to remark to you what past on that occasion but why i mention modesty who have pretensions to it everything was said and practised on that occasion if the purpose had been to inﬂame the mind of every woma n present that effect i freely own to you it had with music dancing wine and the most luscious conversation in which my poor dear father innocently joined raised ideas in of which i shall ever repent and i wished why should i deny it that it had been my wedding instead of my sister the villain hebbers danced with that night and he lost opportunity of improving the occasion in short the dreadful evening came my father though it was very unusual thing with him grew intoxicated with liquor most of the men were in the same condition nay i myself drank more than i was accustomed to enough to inﬂame though not to disorder i lost my former my sister you may i think guess the villain found means to steal to my chamber and i was undone two months i passed in this detested commerce buying even then my guilty pleasures at too dear rate with continual horror and apprehension but what have i paid since i pay now booth may my fate be warning to every woman to keep her innocence to resist every temptation since she is certain to repent of the foolish bargain may it be warning to her to deal with mankind with care and caution to shun the least approaches of dishonour and never to conﬁde too much in the honesty of man nor in her own strength where she has so much at stake let her remember she walks on precipice and the bottomless pit is to receive her if she slips nay if she makes but one false step i ask your pardon booth i migh t have spared these exhortations since woman hears but you will not wonder at seeing af fected on this occasion booth declared he was much more surprised at her being able so well to preserve her temper in recounting her story sir answered she i am at length reconciled to my fate and i can now die with pleasure since i die revenged i am not one of those mean wretches who can sit down and lament their misfortunes if i ever shed tears they are the tears of indignatio i will proceed it was my fate now to solicit marriage and i failed not to it in the most earnest manner he answered at ﬁrst with procrastinations declaring from time to time he would mention it to my father and still excusing himself not doing it at last he thought on an expedient to obtain longer reprieve this was by pretending that he should in very few weeks be preferred to the command of troop and then he said he could with some conﬁdence propose the match in this delay i was persuaded to acquiesce and was indeed pretty easy i had not yet the least mistrust of his honour but what words can paint my sensations when one morning the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https into my room with all the marks of dejection in his countenance and throwing an open letter on the table said is news madam in that letter which i am unable to tell you nor can it give you more concern than it hath given this letter was from his captain to acquaint him that the rout they call it was arrived and that they were to march within two days and this i am since convinced was what he expected instead of the preferment which had been made the pretence of delaying our marriage the shock which i felt at reading this was inexpressible occasioned indeed principally by the departure of villain whom i loved however i soon acquired sufﬁcient presence of mind to remember the main point and i now insisted peremptorily on his making immediately his wife whatever might be the consequence he seemed thunderstruck at this propo sal being i suppose destitute of any excuse but i was too impatient to wait an answer and cried out with much eagerness sure you can not hesitate moment upon this madam replied you ask is impossible is this time to mention thing of this kind to your father eyes were now opened all at fell into rage little short of madness tell not i cried of impossibilities nor times nor of my honour my reputation my all are at i will have excuse your wife this instant or i will proclaim you over the face of the whole earth the greatest of villains he answered with kind of sneer will you proclaim madam honour will you injure my tongue faltered when i offered to reply and i fell into violent agony which ended in ﬁt nor i remember anything more that past till i found myself in the arms of my poor af frighted father booth what was then my situat ion i tremble even now from the reﬂect must stop moment i can go farther booth attempted all in his power to soothe her and she soon recovered her powers and proceeded in her story chapter ix in which miss matthews concludes her r elation before i had recovered my senses i had sufﬁciently betrayed myself to the best of men who instead of upbraiding or exerting any anger endeavoured to comfort all he could with assurances that all should yet be well this goodness of his affected with inexpressible sensations i prostrated myself before him embraced and kissed his knees and almost dissolved in tears and degree of tende rness hardly to be i am running into too minute descriptions hebbers seeing in ﬁt had left and sent one of the servants to take care of he then ran away like thief from the house without taking his leave of my father or the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https him all his civilities he did not stop at his quarters but made directly to london apprehensive i believe either of my father or brother resentment i am convinced he is coward indeed his fear of my brother was utterly groundless i believe he would rather have thanked any man who had destroyed and i am sure i am not in the least behindhand with him in good wishes all his inveteracy to had however effect on my father at least at that time though the good man took sufﬁcient occasions to reprimand my past offence he could not be brought to abandon treaty of marriage was now set on foot in which my father himself offered to hebbers with fortune superior to that which had been given with my sister nor could all my brother remonstrances against it an act of the highest injustice avail hebbers entered into the treaty though not with much warmth he had even the assurance to make additional demands on my father which being complied with everything was concluded and the villain once more received into the house he soon found means to obtain my forgiveness of his former behaviour indeed he convinced so foolishly blind is female love that he had never been to blame when everything was ready our nuptials and the day of the ceremony was to be appointed in the midst of my happiness i received letter from an unknown hand acquainting guess booth how i was shocked at receiving it that hebbers was already married to woman in distant part of the kingdom i will not tire you with all that past at our next interview i communicated the letter to hebbers who after some little hesitation owned the fact and not only owned it but had the address to improve it to his own advantage to make it the means of satisfying concerning all his former delays which to say the truth i was not so much displeased at imputing to any degree of villany i should have been to impute it to the want of sufﬁcient warmth of affection and though the disappointment of all my hopes at the very instant of their expected fruition threw into the most violent disorders yet when i came little to myself he had great difﬁculty to persuade that in every instance with regard to hebbers had acted from other motive than from the most ardent and ungovernable love and there is i believe crime which woman will not forgive when she can derive it from that fountain in short i forgave him all and am willing to persuade myself i am not weaker than the rest of my sex indeed booth he hath bewitching tongue and is master of an address that woman could resist i assure you the charms of his person are his least perfection at least in my eye here booth smiled but happily without her perceiving it fresh difﬁculty continued she now arose this was to excuse the delay of the ceremony to my father who every day very earnestly urged it this made so very unea sy that i at last listened to proposal which if any one in the days of my innocence or even few days before had assured i could have submitted to have thought of i should have treated the supposition with the highest contempt and indignation nay i scarce reﬂect on it now with more horror than astonishment in short i agreed to run away with leave my father the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https reputation everything which was or ought to have been dear to and to live with this villain mistress since i could not be his wife was not this an obligation of the highest and tenderest kind and had i not reason to expect every return in the man power on whom i had conferred it i will make short of the remainder of my story what is there of woman worth relating after what i have told you above year i lived with this man in an obscure court in london during which time i had child by him whom heaven i thank it hath been pleased to take to itself during many months he behaved to with all the apparent tenderness and even fondness imaginable but alas how poor was my enjoyment of this compared to what it would have been in another situation when he was present life was barely tolerable but when he was absent nothing could equal the misery i endured i past my hours almost entirely alone company but what i despised would consort with abroad i scarce ever went lest i should meet any of my former acquaintance their sight would have plunged thousand daggers in my soul my only diversion was going very seldom to play where i hid mysel f in the gallery with daughter of the woman of the house girl indeed of good sense and many good qualities but how much beneath was it to be the companion of creature so low heavens when i have seen my equals glittering in how have the thoughts of my lost honour torn my soul pardon dear madam cries booth interrupting you but i am under the utmost anxiety to know what became of your poor father whom i have so great respect and who i am convinced must so bitterly feel your loss booth answered she he was scarce ever out of my thoughts his dear image still obtruded itself in my mind and i believe would have broken my heart had i not taken very preposterous way to ease myself i am indeed almost ashamed to tell you but necessity put it in my will think the matter too triﬂing to have been remembered and so it surely was nor should i have remembered it on any other occasion you must know then sir that my brother was always my inveterate enemy and altogether fond of my sister once prevailed with my father to let him take my sister with him in the chariot and by that means i was disappointed of going to ball which i had set my heart on the disappoin tment i assure you was great at the time but i had long since forgotten it i must have been very bad woman if i had not it was the only thing in which i can remember that my father ever disobliged however i now revived this in my mind which i artiﬁcially worked up into so high an injury that i assure you it afforded little comfort when any tender idea intruded into my bosom i immediately raised this fantom of an injury in my imag ination and it considerably lessened the fury of that sorrow which i should have otherwise felt the loss of so good father who died within few months of my departure from him and now sir to draw to conclusion one night i was in the gallery at playhouse i saw below in x she was once below in every place that widow whom i mentioned to you before i had scarce cast my eyes on this woman before i was so shocked with the sight that it almost deprived of my senses the villain hebbers came presently in and seated himself behind her the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https he had been almost month from and i believed him to be at his quarters in yorkshire guess what were my sensations when i beheld him sitting by that base woman and talking to her with the utmost familiarity i could not long endure this sight and having acquainted my companion that i was taken suddenly ill i forced her to go home with at the end of the second act after restless and sleepless night when i rose the next morning i had the comfort to receive visit from the woman of the house who after very short introduction asked when i had heard from the captain and when i expected to see him i had not strength or spirits to make her any answer and she proceeded thus i did not think the captain would have used so my husband was an ofﬁcer of the army well himself and if body is little low in the world i am sure that is reason folks to trample on body i defy the world to say i ever was guilty of an ill thing heaven sake madam says i what you mean cries she i am sure if i had not thought you had been captain hebbers lady his lawful lady too you should never have set footing in my house i would have captain hebbers know that though i am reduced to let lodgings i never have entertained any but persons of character this manner sir she ran on saying many shocking things not worth repeating till my anger at last got the better of my patience well my sorrow and i pushed her out of the room she had not been long gone before her daughter came to and after many expressions of tenderness and pity acquainted that her mother had just found out by means of the captain servant that the captain was married to another lady if you did not know before madam said she i am sorry to be the messenger of such ill news think booth what i must have endured to see myself humbled before such creature this the daughter of woman who lets lodgings however having recollected myself little i thought it would be in vain to deny anything so knowing this to be one of the natured and most sensible girls in the world i resolved to tell her my whole story and the future to make her my conﬁdante i answered her therefore with good deal of assurance that she need not regret telling this piece of ill news i had known it before i came to her house madam replied the girl can not possibly have known it so long he hath not been married above week last night was the ﬁrst time of his appearing in public with his wife at the play indeed i knew very well the cause of your uneasi ness there but would not his wife at the play answered i eagerly what wife whom you mean i mean the widow carey madam replied she whom the captain was married few days since his servant was here last night to pay your lodging and he told it my mother i know not what answer i made or whether i made any i presently fell dead on the ﬂoor and it was with great difﬁculty i was brought back to life by the poor girl neither the mother nor the maid of the house would lend any assistance both seeming to regard rather monster than the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https scarce had i recovered the use of my senses when i received letter from the villain declaring he had not assurance to see my face and very kindly advising to endeavour to reconcile myself to my family concluding with an offer in case i did not succeed to allow twenty pounds to support in some remote part of the kingdom i need not mention my indignation at these proposals in the highest agony of rage i went in chair to the detested house wher i easily got access to the wretch i had devoted to destruction whom i sooner found within my reach than i plunged drawn penknife which i had prepared in my pocket the purpose into his accursed heart this fact i was immediately seized and soon after committed hither and this fact i am ready to die and shall with pleasure receive the sentence of the law thus sir said she i have related to you my unhappy story and if i have tired your patience by dwelling too long on those parts which af fected the most i ask your pardon booth made proper speech on this occasion and having exprest much concern at her present situation concluded that he hoped her sentence would be milder than she seemed to expect her reply to this was full of so much bitterness and indignation that we not think proper to record the speech at length in which having vented her passion she all at once put on serene countenance and with an air of great complacency said well booth i think i have now right to satisfy my curiosity at the expense of your breath i may say it is not altogether vain curiosity perhaps i have had inclination enough to interest myself in whatever concerns you but matter that those days added she with sigh are now over booth who was extremely and told her that she should not command him twice whatever was in his power and then after the usual apology was going to begin his history when the keeper arrived and acquainted the lady that dinner was ready at the same time saying i suppose madam the gentleman is an acquaintance of yours he must dine with us too miss matthews told the keeper that she had only one word to mention in private to the gentleman and that then they would both attend him she then pulled her purse from her pocket in which were upwards of twenty guineas being the remainder of the money which she had sold gold repeating watch her father present with some other trinkets and desired booth to take what he should have occasion saying you know i belie ve dear will i never valued money and now i am sure i shall have very little use it booth with much difﬁculty accepted of two guineas and then they both together attended the keeper chapter the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https consisting of facetious discourse that passed in the prison there were assembled at the table the governor of these not improperly called infernal regions the vulgarly named the ﬁrst turnkey miss matthe ws booth robinson the gambler several other prisoners of both sexes and one murphy an attorney the governor took the ﬁrst opportunity to bring the affair of miss matthews upon the carpet and then turning to murphy he said it is very lucky this gentleman happens to be present i assure you madam your cause can not be in abler hands he is i believe the best man in england at defence i have known him often succeed against the most positive evidence fy sir answered murphy you know i hate all this but if the lady will trust with her cause i will the best in my power come madam not be discouraged bit of manslaughter and cold iron i hope will be the worst or perhaps we may come off better with slice of or defendendo i am very ignorant of the law sir cries the lady yes madam answered murphy it ca be expected you should understand it there are very few of us who profess it that understand the whole nor is it necessary we should there is great deal of rubbish of little use about indictments and abatements and bars and ejectments and trovers and such stuff with which people cram their heads to little purpose the chapter of evidence is the main business that is the that is the rudder which brings the vessel safe in portum evidence is indeed the whole the summa totidis non appar entibus et non insistentibus eandem est ratio if you address yourself to sir said the lady you are much too learned i assure you my understanding tace madam answered murphy is latin candle i commend your prudence i shall know the particulars of your case when we are alone i hope the lady said robinson hath suspicion of any person here i hope we are all persons of honour at this table my eyes answered sed woman i can answer myself and the other ladies though i never saw the lady in my life she need not be shy of us my eyes i scorn to rap footnote cant word meaning to swear or rather to perjure yourself against any lady madam cried another female i honour what you have done i once put knife into cull my service to you madam and i wish you may come off with difﬁdendo with all my heart i beg good woman said miss matthews you would talk on some other subject and give yourself concern about my af fairs you see ladies cried murphy the doth not care to talk on this matter before company so pray not press her the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https nay i value the lady acquaintance more than she values mine cries the ﬁrst woman who spoke i have kept good company the lady i believe every day in the week good woman i use to be so treated if the lady says such another word to i will darken her daylights marry come up good woman lady whore well myself and though i am sent hither to mill doll my eyes i have money enough to buy it off well the lady herself action might perhaps soon have ensued this speech had not the keeper interposed his authority and put an end to any further dispute soon after which the company broke up and none but himself mr murphy captain booth and miss matthews remained together miss matthews then at the entreaty of the keeper began to open her case to murphy whom she admitted to be her solicitor though she still declared she was indifferent to the event of the trial murphy having heard all the particulars with which the reader is already acquainted far related to the murder shook his head and said there is but one circumstance madam which i wish was out of the case and that we must put out of it i mean the carrying the penknife drawn into the room with you that seems to imply malice prepensive we call it in the law this circumstance therefore must not appear against you and if the servant who was in the room observed this he must be bought off at all hazards all here you say are friends therefore i tell you openly you must furnish with money sufﬁcient this purpose malice is all we have to guard against i would not presume sir cries booth to inform you in the law but i have heard in case of stabbing man may be indicted upon the statute and it is capital though malice appears you say true sir answered murphy man may be indicted contra formam statutis and that method i allow you requires malice i presume you are lawyer sir indeed sir answered booth i know nothing of the law then sir i will tell man be indicted contra formam tatutis we say malice is necessary because the form of the statute makes malice and then what we have to guard against is having struck the ﬁrst blow pox it is unlucky this was done in room if it had been in the street we could have had ﬁve or six witnesses to have proved the ﬁrst blow cheaper than i am afraid we shall get this one when man knows from the unhappy circumstances of the case that you can procure other witness but himself he is always dear it is so in all other ways of business i am very implicit you see but we are all among friends the safest way is to furnish with money enough to offer him good round sum at once and i think it is your good i speak ﬁfty pounds is the least than can be offered him i assure you i would of fer him less was it my own case and you think sir said she that i would save my life at the expense of hiring another to perjure himself ay surely i cries murphy where is the fault admitting there is some fault in perjury you call it and to be sure it is such matter every man would rather wish the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https than not and yet it may be managed there is not so much some people are apt to imagine in it he need not kiss the book and then pray where the perjury but if the crier is sharper than ordinary what is it he kisses is it anything but bit of i am sure man must be very bad christian himself who would not so much that to save the life of any christian whatever much more of so pretty lady indeed madam if we can make out but tolerable case so much beauty will go great way with the judge and the jury too the latter part of this speech notwithstanding the mouth it came from caused miss matthews to suppress much of the indignation which began to arise at the former and she answered with smile sir you are great casuist in these matters but we need argue longer concerning them if ﬁfty pounds would save my life i assure you i could not command that sum the little money i have in my pocket is all i can call my own and i apprehend in the situation i am in i shall have very little of that to spare come come madam cries murphy life is sweet let tell you and never sweeter than when we are near losing it i have known many man very brave and undaunted at his ﬁrst commitment who when business began to thicken little upon him hath changed his note it is time to be saving in your condition the keeper who after the liberality of miss matthews and on seeing purse of guineas in her hand had conceived great opinion of her wealth sooner heard that the sum which he had in intention intirely conﬁscated his own use was attempted to be broke in upon thought it high time to be upon his guard to be sure cries he murphy life is sweet you say that must be acknowledged to be sure life is sweet but sweet it is persons can advance more than they are worth to save it and indeed if the lady can command more money than that little she mentions she is to be commended her unwillingness to part with any of it to be sure she says she will want every farthing of that to live like gentlewoman till she comes to her trial and to be sure sweet life is people ought to take care to be able to live sweetly while they live besides i can not help saying the lady shews herself to be what she is by her abhorrence of perjury which is certainly very dreadful crime and though the not kissing the book doth you say make great deal of difference and if man had great while to live and repent perhaps he might swallow it well enough yet when people comes to be near their end who can venture to foretel what will be the lady case they ought to take care not to overburthen their conscience i hope the lady case will not be found murder i am sure i always wish well to all my prisoners who shew themselves to be gentlemen or gentlewomen yet one should always fear the worst indeed sir you speak like an oracle answered the lady and one subornation of perjury would sit heavier on my conscience than twenty such murders i am guilty of nay to be sure madam answered the keeper nobody can pretend to tell what provocation you must have had and certainly it can never be imagined that lady who behaves herself so handsomely you have done ever since you have been under my keys should be guilty of killing man without being very highly provoked to it murphy was i believe going to answer when he was called out of the room after which nothing passed between the remaining persons worth relating till booth and the lady retired back again into the lady the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https they fell immediately to commenting on the foregoing discourse but their comments were i believe the same with what most readers have made on the same occasion we shall omit them at last miss matthews reminding her companion of his promise of relating to her what had befallen him since the interruption of their former acquaintance he began is written in the next book of this history book ii chapter in which captain booth begins to r elate his history the being removed and booth and the lady left alone he proceeded follows since you desire madam to know the particulars of my courtship to that best and dearest of women whom i afterwards married i will endeavour to recollect them well i can at least all those incidents which are most worth relating to you if the vulgar opinion of the fatality in marriage had ever any foundation it surely appeared in my marriage with my amelia i knew her in the ﬁrst dawn of her beauty and i believe madam she had much ever fell to the share of woman but though i always admired her it was long without any spark of love perhaps the general admiration which at that time pursued her the respect paid her by persons of the highest rank and the numbe rless addresses which were made her by men of great fortune prevented my aspiring at the possession of those charms which seemed so absolutely out of my reach however it was i assure you the accident which deprived her of the admiration of others made the ﬁrst great impression on my heart in her favour the injury done to her beauty by the overturning of chaise by which you may well remember her lovely nose was beat all to pieces gave an assurance that the woman who had been so much adored the charms of her person deserved much higher adoration to be paid to her mind that she was in the latter respect inﬁnitely more superior to the rest of her sex than she had ever been in the former i admire your taste extremely cried the lady i remember perfectly well the great heroism with which your amelia bore that misfortune good heavens madam answered he what magnanimity of mind did her behaviour demonstrate if the world have extolled the ﬁrmness of soul in man who can support the loss of fortune of general who can be composed after the loss of victory or of king who can be contented with the loss of crown with what astonishment ought we to behold with what praises to honour young lady who can with patience and resignation submit to the loss of exquisite beauty in other words to the loss of fortune power glory everything which human nature is apt to court and rejoice in what must be the mind which can bear to be deprived the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https these in moment and by an unfortunate triﬂing accident which could support all this together with the most exquisite tormen ts of body and with dignity with resignation without complaining almost without tear under go the most painful and dreadful operations of surgery in such situation here he stopt and torrent of tears gushed from his eyes such tears are apt to ﬂow from truly noble heart at the hearing of anything surprisingly great and glorious soon he was able he again proceeded thus would you think miss matthews that the misfortune of my amelia was capable of any aggravation i assure you she hath often told it was aggravated with circumstance which outweighed all the other ingredients this was the cruel insults she received from some of her most intimate acquaintance several of whom after many distortions and grimaces have turned their heads aside unable to support their secret triumph and burst into loud laugh in her hearing good heavens cried miss matthews what detestable actions will this contemptible passion of envy prevail on our sex to commit an occasion of this kind she hath since told made the ﬁrst impression on her gentle heart in my favour i was one day in company with several young ladies or rather young devils where poor amelia accident was the subject of much mirth and pleasantry one of these said she hoped miss would not hold her head so high the future another answered i not know madam what she may with her head but i am convinced she will never more turn up her nose at her betters another cried very proper match migh t now be made between amelia and certain captain who had unfortunately received an injury in the same part though from shameful cause many other sarcasms were thrown out very unworthy to be repeated i was hurt with perceiving so much malice in human shape and cried out very bluntly indeed ladies you need not express such satisfaction at poor miss emily accident she will still be the handsomest woman in england this speech of mine was afterwards variously repeated by some to my honour and by others represented in contrary light indeed it was often reported to be much ruder than it was however it at length reached amelia ears she said she was very much obliged to since i could have so much compassion her to be rude to lady on her account about month after the accident when amelia began to see company in mask i had the honour to drink tea with her we were alone together and i begged her to indulg my curiosity by showing her face she answered in most obliging manner booth you will little know when my mask is off when it is on and at the same instant unmasked surgeon skill was the least i considered thousand tender ideas rushed all at once on my mind i was unable to contain myself and eagerly kissing her hand i upon my soul madam you never appeared to so lovely at this instant nothing more remarkable passed at this visit but i sincerely believe we were neither of us hereafter indifferent to each other many months however passed after this before i ever thought seriously of making her my wife not that i wanted sufﬁcient love amelia indeed it arose from the vast affection i bore her i considered my own desperate fortune hers entirely dependent on her mother who was woman you know of violent passions and very unlikely to consent to match so highly contrary to the interest of her daughter the more i loved amelia the more ﬁrmly i the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https myself never to propose love to her seriously such dupe was my understanding to my heart and so foolishly did i imagine i could be master of ﬂame to which i was every day adding fuel miss matthews we have heard of men entirely masters of their passions and of hearts which can carry this ﬁre in them and conceal it at their pleasure perhaps there may be such but if there are those hearts may be compared i believe to damps in which it is more difﬁcult to keep ﬁre alive than to prevent its blazing in mine it was placed in the midst of combustible matter after several visits in which looks and sighs had been interchanged on both sides but without the least mention of passion in private one day the discourse between us when alone happened to turn on love i say happen ed i protest it was not designed on my side and i am ﬁrmly convinced not on hers i was now longer master of myself i declared myself the most wretched of all martyrs to this tender passion that i had long conce aled it from its object at length after mentioning many particulars suppressing however those which must have necessarily brought it home to amelia i concluded with begging her to be the conﬁdante of my amour and to give her advice on that occasion amelia i shall never forget the dear perturbation appeared all confusion at this instant she trembled turned pale and discove red how well she understood by thousand more symptoms than i could take notice of in state of mind so very little different from her own at last with faltering accents she said i had made very ill choice of counsellor in matter in which she was so adding at last i believe booth you gentlemen want very little advice in these af fairs which you all understand better than we i will relate more of our conversati on at present indeed i am afraid i tire you with too many particulars answered she i should be glad to hear every step of an amour which had so tender beginning tell everything you said or did if you can remember it he then proceeded and so will we in the next chapter chapter ii booth continues his story in this chapter there are some passages that may serve kind of touchstone by which young lady may examine the heart of her lover i would advise therefore that every lover be obliged to read it over in the presence of his mistress and that she car efully watch his emotions while he is r eading i was under the utmost concern cries booth when i retired from my visit and had reﬂected coolly on what i had said i now saw plainly that i had made downright love the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https and i feared such was my vanity that i had already gone too far and been too successful feared i say could i fear what i hoped how shall i describe the anxiety of my mind you need give yourself great pain cried miss matthews to describe what i can so easily guess to be honest with you booth i not agree with your lady opinion that the men have superior understanding in the matters of love men are often blind to the passions of women but every woman is hawk on these occasions nor is there one article in the whole science which is not understood by all our sex however madam said booth i now undertook to deceive amelia i abstained three days from seeing her to say the truth i endeavoured to work myself up to resolution of leaving her ever but when i could not so far subdue my why i talk nonsense of subduing passion should say when other passion could surmount my love i returned to visit her and now i attempted the strangest project which ever entered into the silly head of lover this was to persuade amelia that i was really in love in another place and had literally expressed my meaning when i asked her advice and desired her to be my conﬁdante i therefore forged meeting to have been between and my imaginary mistress since i had last seen amelia and related the particulars well i could invent them which had passed at our conversation poor amelia presently swallowed this bait and she hath told since absolutely believed to be in earnest poor dear love how should the sincerest of hearts have any idea of deceit with all her simplicity i assure you she is the most sensible woman in the world it is highly generous and good in you said miss matthews with sly sneer to impute to honesty what others would perhaps call credulity i protest madam answered he i her more than justice good heart will at all times betray the best head in the well madam my angel was now if possible more confused than before she looked so silly you can hardly believe it yes yes i can answered the lady with laugh i can believe ell well go on after some hesitation cried he my amelia said faintly to booth you use very ill you desire to be your conﬁdante and conceal from the name of your mistress is it possible then madam answered i that you can not guess her when i tell you she is one of your acquaintance and lives in this town acquaintance said she this town thought i could have guessed once but i have an ill talent that will never attempt to guess anything again indeed i her an injury when i pretend to represent her manner her manner look voice everything was inimitable such sweetness softness innocence modesty my soul if ever man could boast of his resolution i think i might now that i abstained from falling prostrate at her feet and adoring her however i triumphed pride i believe triumphed the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https love got the better of love we once more parted and i promised the next time i saw her to reveal the name of my mistress i now had i thought gained complete victory over myself and small compliments did i pay to my own resolution in short i triumphed cowards and niggards when they ﬂatter themselves with having given some supposed instance of courage or generosity and my triumph lasted long that is to say till my ascendant passion had proper opportunity of displaying itself in its true and natural colours having hitherto succeeded so well in my own opinion and obtained this mighty conquest i now entertained design of exerting the most romantic generosity and of curing that unhappy passion which i perceived i had raised in amelia among the ladies who had expressed the greatest satisfaction at my amelia misfortune miss osborne had distinguished herself in very eminent degree she was indeed the next in beauty to my angel nay she had disputed the preference and had some amon g her admirers who were blind enough to give it in her favour well cries the lady i will allow you to call them blind but miss osborne was charming girl she certainly was handsome answered he and very considerable fortune so i thought my amelia would have little difﬁculty in believing when i ﬁxed on her my mistress and i concluded that my thus placing my affections on her known enemy would be the surest method of eradicating every tender idea with which i had been ever honoured by amelia well then to amelia i went she received with more than usual coldness and reserve in which to confess the truth there appeared to more of anger than indifference and more of dejection than of either after some short introduction i revived the discourse of my amour and presently mentioned miss osborne the lady whose name i had concealed adding that the true reason why i did not mention her before was that i apprehended there was some little distance between them which i hoped to have the happiness of accommodating amelia answered with much gravity you know sir that there is any distance between us i suppose you know the reason of that distance and then i think i could not have expected to be affronted by her name i would not have you think booth that i hate miss osborne heaven is my witness i despise her too when i reﬂect how much i loved the woman who hath treated so cruelly i own it gives i lay i then imagined and all about believed on my deathbed in all the agonies of pain and misery to become the object of laughter to my dearest booth it is cruel reﬂection and could i after this have expected from why not from you to whom i am person entirely indif ferent if such friend could treat so barbarously during the greatest part of this speech the tears streamed from her bright eyes i could endure it longer i caught up the word indifferent and repeated it saying you think then madam that miss emily is indif ferent to surely i answered she i know i am indeed why should i not be indifferent to you the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https have my eyes said i then declared nothing there is need of your eyes answered she tongue hath declared that you have singled out of all womankind my greatest i will say my basest enemy i own i once thought that character would have been recommendation to you why did i think so i was born to deceive myself i then fell on my knees before her and forcing her hand cried out my amelia i can bear longer you are the only mistress of my affections you are the deity i adore in this stile i ran on above two or three minutes what it is impossible to repeat till torrent of contending passions together with the surprize overpowered her gentle spirits and she fainted away in my arms to describe my sensation till she returned to herself is not in my power y need not cried miss oh happy amelia why had i not been blest with such passion i am convinced madam continued he you can not expect all the particulars of the tender scene which ensued i was not enough in my senses to remember it all let it sufﬁce to say that that behaviour with which amelia while ignorant of its motive had been so much displeased when she became sensible of that motive proved the strongest recommendation to her favour and she was pleased to call it generous generous repeated the lady and so it was almost beyond the reach of humanity i question whether you ever had an equal perhaps the critical reader may have the same doubt with miss matthews and lest he should we will here make gap in our history to give him an opportunity of accurately considering whether this conduct of booth was natural or and consequently whether we have in this place maintained or deviated from that strict adherence to universal truth which we profess above all other historians chapter iii the narrative continued mor of the touchstone booth made proper acknowledgment of miss matthew civility and then renewed his story we were upon the footing of lovers and amelia threw off her reserve more and more till at length i found all that return of my af fection which the tenderest lover can require my situation would now have been paradise had not my happiness been interrupted with the same reﬂections i have already mentioned had i not in short concluded that i must derive all my joys from the almost certain ruin of that dear creature to whom i should owe the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https this thought haunted night and day till i at last grew unable to support it i therefore resolved in the strongest manner to lay it before amelia one evening then after the highest professions of the most disinterested love in which heaven knows my sincerity i took an occasion to speak to amelia in the following manner too true it is i am afraid my dearest creature that the highest human happiness is imperfect how rich would be my cup was it not one poisonous drop which embitters the whole amelia what must be the consequence of my ever having the honour to call you mine know my situation in life and you know your own i have nothing more than the poor provision of an ensign commission to depend on your sole dependen ce is on your mother should any act of disobedience defeat your expectations how wretched must your lot be with amelia how ghastly an object to my mind is the apprehension of your distress can i bear to reﬂect moment on the certainty of your foregoing all the conveniences of life on the possibility of your suffering all its most dreadful inconveniencies what must be my misery then to see you in such situation and to upbraid myself with being the accursed cause of bringing you to it suppose too in such season i should be summoned from you could i submit to see you encounter all the hazards the fatigues of war with you could not yourself however willing support them single campaign what then must i leave you to starve alone deprived of the tenderness of husband deprived too of the tenderness of the best of mothers through my means woman most dear to being the parent the nurse and the friend of my oh my sweet creature carry your thoughts little further think of the tenderest consequences the dearest pledges of our love can i bear to think of entailing beggary on the posterity of my amelia on heavens our children on the other side is it possible even to mention the word will not must not can not can not part with must we amelia it is now i sincerely ask your advice advice can i give you said she such an alternative would to heaven we had never met these words were accompanied with sigh and look inexpressibly tender the tears at the same time overﬂowing all her lovely cheeks i was endeavouring to reply when i was interrupted by what soon put an end to the scene our amour had already been buzzed all over the town and it came at last to the ears of harris i had indeed observed of late great alteration in that lady behaviour towards whenever i visited at the house nor could i long time before this evening ever obtain private interview with amelia and now it seems i owed it to her mother intention of overhearing all that passed between us at the period then above mentioned harris burst from the closet where she had hid herself and surprised her daughter reclining on my bosom in all that tender sorrow i have just described i will not attempt to paint the rage of the mother or the daughter confusion or my own are very ﬁne doings indeed cries harris have made noble use amelia of my indulgence and the trust i reposed in you booth i will not accuse you you have used my child i ought to have expected i may thank myself what hath happened with much more of the same kind before she would suffer to speak but at last i obtained hearing and offered to excuse my poor amelia who was ready to sink into the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https under the oppression of grief by taking much blame i could on myself harris answered sir i must say you are innocent in comparison of her nay i can say i have heard you use dissuasive arguments and i promise you they are of weight i have i thank heaven one dutiful child and i shall henceforth think her my only one then forced the poor trembling fainting amelia out of the room which when she had done she began very coolly to reason with on the folly well iniquity which i had been guilty of and repeated to almost every word i had before urged to her daughter in ﬁne she at last obtained of promise that i would soon go to my regiment and submit to any misery rather than that of being the ruin of amelia i now many days endured the greatest torments which the human mind is i believe capable of feeling and i can honestly say i tried all the means and applied every argument which i could raise to cure of my love and to make these the more effectual i spent every night in walking backwards and forwar ds in the sight of harris house where i never failed to ﬁnd some object or other which raised some tender idea of my lovely amelia and almost drove to distraction and you think sir said miss matthews you took most preposterous method to cure yourself alas madam answered he you can not see it in more absurd light than i but those know little of real love or grief who not know how much we deceive ourselves when we pretend to aim at the cure of either it is with these it is with some distempers of the body nothing is in the least agreeable to us but what serves to heighten the disease at the end of fortnight when i was driven almost to the highest degree of despair and could contrive method of conveying letter to amelia how was i surprised when harris servant brought card with an invitation from the mother herself to drink tea that evening at her house you will easily believe madam that i did not fail so agreeable an appointment on my arrival i was introduced into large company of men and women harris and my amelia being part of the company amelia seemed in my eyes to look more beautiful than ever and behaved with all the gaiety imaginable the old lady treated with much civility but the young lady took little notice of and addressed most of her discourse to another gentleman present indeed she now and then gave look of discouraging kind and i observed her colour change more than once when her eyes met mine circumstances which perhaps ought to have afforded sufﬁcient comfort but they could not allay the thousand doubts and fears with which i was alarmed my anxious thoughts suggested less to than that amelia had made her peace with her mother at the price of abandoning forever and of giving her ear to some other lover all my prudence now vanished at once and i would that instant have gladly run away with amelia and have married her without the least consideration of any consequences with such thoughts i had tormented myself near two hours till most of the company had taken their leave this i was myself incapable of doing nor i know when i should have put an end to my visit had not dr harrison taken away almost by force telling in the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https that he had something to say to of great know the doctor very well sir answered miss matthews and one of the best men in the world he is and an honour to the sacred order to which he belongs you will judge replied booth by the sequel whether i have reason to think him so he then proceeded in the next chapter chapter iv the story of booth continued in this chapter the reader will perceive glimpse of the character of very good divine with some matters of very tender kind the doctor conducted into his study and i then desiring to sit down began near i can remember in these words or at least to this purpose can not imagine young gentleman that your love miss emily is any secret in this place i have known it some time and have been i assure you very much your enemy in this affair i answered that i was very much obliged to him so you are replied he so perhaps you will think yourself when you know all went about fortnight ago to harris to acquaint her with my apprehensions on her daughter account though the matter was much talked of i thought it might possibly not have reached her ears i will be very plain with you i advised her to take all possible care of the young lady and even to send her to some place where she might be effectually kept out of your reach while you remained in the town and you think sir said i that this was acting kind part by or you expect that i should thank you on this occasion man answered he i did not intend you any kindness nor i desire any of your thanks my intention was to preserve worthy lady from young fellow of whom i had heard good character and whom i imagined to have design of stealing human creature the sake of her fortune it was very kind of you indeed answered i to entertain such an opinion of sir replied the doctor is the opinion which i believe most of you young gentlemen of the order of the rag deserve i have known some instances and have heard of more where such young fellows have committed robbery under the name of marriage the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https i was going to interrupt him with some anger when he desired to have little patience and then informed that he had visited harris with the design the evening after the discovery i have related that harris without waiting his information had recounted to him all which had happened the evening before and indeed she must have an excellent memory i think she repeated every word i said and added that she had conﬁned her daughter to her chamber where she kept her close prisoner and had not seen her since i can not express nor would modesty suffer if i could all that now past the doctor took by the hand and burst forth into the warmest commendations of the sense and generosity which he was pleased to say discovered themselves in my speech you know madam his strong and singular way of expressing himself on all occasions especially when he is affected with anything said he i knew half dozen such instances in the army the painter should put red liveries upon all the saints in my closet from this instant the doctor told he had become my friend and zealous advocate with harris on whom he had at last prevailed though not without the greate st difﬁculty to consent to my marrying amelia upon condition that i settled every penny which the mother should lay down and that she would retain certain sum in her hands which she would at any time deposit my advancement in the army you will i hope madam conceive that i made hesitation at these conditions nor need i mention the joy which i felt on this occasion or the acknowledgment i paid the doctor who is indeed you say one of the best of men the next morning i had permission to visit amelia who received in such manner that i now concluded my happiness to be complete everything was now agreed on all sides and lawyers employed to prepare the writings when an unexpected cloud arose suddenly in our serene sky and all our joys were obscured in moment when matters were i apprehended drawing near conclusion i received an express that sister whom i tenderly loved was seized with violent fever and earnestl y desired to come to her i immediately obeyed the summons and it was then about two in the morning without staying even to take leave of amelia whom i left short billet acquainting her with the reason of my absence the gentleman house where my sister then was stood at ﬁfty miles distance and though i used the utmost expedition the unmerci ful distemper had before my arrival entirely deprived the poor girl of her senses it soon after did of her life not all the love i bore amelia nor the tumultuous delight with which the approaching hour of possessing her ﬁlled my heart could while allay my grief at the loss of my beloved nancy upon my soul i can not yet mention her name without tears never brother and sister had i believe higher friendship each other poor dear girl whilst i sat by her in her head ﬁts she repeated scarce any other name but mine and it plainly appeared that when her dear reason was ravished away from her it had left my image on her fancy and that the last use she made of it was to think on my dear billy immediately she cried i know the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https come to in moment will nobody fetch him to pray kill before i see him once more you durst not use so if he was here accent still rings in my ears oh heavens to hear this and at the same time to see the poor delirious creature deriving the greatest horrors from my sight and mistaking highwayman who had little before robbed her but i ask your pardon the sensations i felt are to be known only from experience and to you must appear dull and insipid at last she seemed moment to know and cried heavens my dearest brother upon which she fell into immediate convulsions and died away in my arms here mr booth stopped moment and wiped his eyes and miss matthews perhaps out of complaisance wiped hers chapter containing strange r evolutions of fortune booth proceeded thus this loss perhaps madam you will think had made miserable enough but fortune did not think so on the day when my nancy was to be buried courier arrived from dr harrison with letter in which the doctor acquainted that he was just come from harris when he despatched the express and earnestly desired to return the very instant i received his letter i valued my amelia if the daughter added he take after her mother most of them it will be perhaps wiser in you to stay away i presently sent the messenger into my room and with much difﬁculty extorted from him that great squire in his coach and six was come to harris and that the whole town said he was shortly to be married to amelia i now soon perceived how much superior my love amelia was to every other passion poor nancy idea disappeared in moment i quitted the dear lifeless corpse over which i had shed thousand tears left the care of her funeral to others and posted i may almost say ﬂew back to amelia and alighted at the doctor house he had desired in his letter the good man presently acquainted with what had happened in my absence winckworth had it seems arrived the very day of my departure with grand equipage and without delay had made formal proposals to harris offering to settle any part of his vast estate in whatever manner she pleased on amelia these proposals the old lady had without any deliberation accepted and had insisted in the most violent manner on her daughter compliance which amelia had perem ptorily refused to give insisting on her part on the consent which her mother had before given to our marriage in which she was heartily seconded by the doctor who declared to her he now did to we ought much to be esteemed man and wife if the ceremony had already past between us the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https these remonstrances the doctor told had worked effect on harris who still persisted in her avowed resolution of marrying her daughter to winckworth whom the doctor had likewise attacked telling him that he was paying his addresses to another man wife but all to purpose the young gentleman was too much in love to hearken to any dissuasives we now entered into consultation what means to employ the doctor earnestly protested against any violence to be offered to the person of winckworth which i believe i had rashly threatened declaring that if i made any attempt of that kind he would ever abandon my cause i made him solemn promise of forbearance at last he determined to pay another visit to harris and if he found her obdurate he said he thought himself at liberty to join us together without any further consent of the mother which every parent he said had right to refuse but not retract when given unless the party himself by some conduct of his gave reason the doctor having made his visit with better success than before the matter now debated was how to get possession of amelia by stratagem she was now closer prisoner than ever was her mother bedfellow by night and never out of her sight by day while we were deliberating on this point of the town came to visit the doctor to inform him that he had just bottled off hogshead of excellent old port of which he offered to spare him hamper saying that he was that day to send in twelve dozen to harris the doctor now smiled at conceit which came into his head and taking aside asked if i had love enough the young lady to venture into the house in hamper i joyfully leapt at the proposal to which the merchant at the doctor intercession consented i believe madam you know the great authority which that worthy mart had over the whole town the doctor moreover promised to procure license and to perform the ofﬁce us at his house if i could ﬁnd any means of conveying amelia thither in this hamper then i was carried to the house and deposited in the entry where i had not lain long before i was again removed and packed up in cart in order to be sent ﬁve miles into the country i heard the orders given i lay in the entry and there i likew ise heard that amelia and her mother were to follow the next morning i was unloaded from my cart and set down with the rest of the lumber in great hall here i remained above three hours impatient ly waiting the evening when i determined to quit posture which was become very uneasy and break my prison but fortune contrived to release sooner by the following means the house where i now was had been left in the care of one this faithful creature came into the hall with the footman who had driven the cart scene of the highest fondness having past between them the fellow proposed and the maid consented to open the hamper and drink bottle together which they agreed their mistress would hardly miss in such quantity they presently began to execute their purpose they opened the hamper and to their great surprise discovered the contents i took an immediate advantage of the consternation which appeared in the countenances of both the servants and had sufﬁcient presence of mind to improve the knowledge of those secrets to which i was privy i told them that it entirely depended on their behaviour to the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https their mistress should ever be acquainted either with what they had done or with what they had intended to that if they would keep my secret i would reciprocally keep theirs i then acquainted them with my purpose of lying concealed in the house in order to watch an opportunity of obtaining private interview with amelia illustration they opened the hamper in the situation in which these two delinquents stood you may be assured it was not difﬁcult to seal up their lips in short they agreed to whatever i proposed i lay that evening in my dear amelia bedchamber and was in the morning conveyed into an old lumber where i was to wait till amelia whom the maid promised on her arrival to inform of my place of concealment could ﬁnd some opportunity of seeing i ask pardon interrupting you cries miss matthews but you bring to my remembrance foolish story which i heard at that time though at great distance from you that an ofﬁcer had in confederacy with miss harris broke open her mother cellar and stole away great quantity of her wine i mention it only to shew you what sort of foundations most stories have booth told her he had heard some such thing himself and then continued his story in the next chapter chapter vi containing many surprising adventur es there continued he i remained the whole day in hopes of happiness the expected approach of which gave such delight that i would not have exchanged my poor lodgings the ﬁnest palace in the universe little after it was dark harris arrived together with amelia and her sister i can not express how much my heart now began to ﬂutter my hopes every mom ent encreased strange fears which i had not felt before began now to intermingle with them when i had continued full two hours in these circumstances i heard woman step tripping upstairs which i fondly hoped was my amelia but all on sudden the door ﬂew open and harris herself appeared at it with countenance pale death her whole body trembling i suppose with anger she fell upon in the most bitter language it is not necessary to repeat what she said nor indeed can i i was so shocked and confounded on this occasion in word the scene ended with my departure without seeing amelia and pray cries miss matthews how happened this unfortunate discovery the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https answered that the lady at supper ordered bottle of wine which neither myself says he nor the servants had presence of mind to provide being told there was none in the house though she had been before informed that the things came all safe she had sent the maid who being unable to devise any excuse had fallen on her knees and after confessing her design of opening bottle which she imputed to the fellow betrayed poor to her mistress well madam after lecture of about quarter of an hour duration from harris i suffered her to conduct to the outward gate of her whence i set forward in disconsolate condition of mind towards my lodgings i had ﬁve miles to walkin dark and rainy night but how can i mention these triﬂing circumstances any aggravation of my disappointment how was it possible cried miss matthews that you could be got out of the house without seeing miss harris i assure you madam answered booth i have often wondered at it myself but my spirits were so much sunk at the sight of her mother that man was ever greater coward than i was at that instant indeed i believe my tender concern the terrors of amelia were the principal cause of my submission however it was i left the house and walked about hundred yards when at the corner of the wall female voice in whisper cried out booth the person was extremely near but it was so dark i could scarce see her nor did i in the confusion i was in immediately recognize the voice i answered in line of congreve which burst from my lips spontaneously i am sure i had intention to quote plays at that time calls the wretched thing that was alphonso upon which woman leapt into my arms crying it is indeed my alphonso my only alphonso miss matthews guess what i felt when i found i had my amelia in my arms i embraced her with an ecstasy not to be described at the same instant pouring thousand tendernesses into her ears at least if i could express so many to her in minute in that time the alarm began at the house harris had mist her daughter and the court was presently full of lights and noises of all kinds i now lifted amelia over gate and jumping after we crept along together by the side of hedge different way from what led to the town i imagined that would be the road through which they would pursue us in this opinion i was right we heard them pass along that road and the voice of harris herself who ran with the rest notwithstandin g the darkness and the rain by these means we luckily made our escape and clambring over hedge and ditch my amelia performing the part of heroine all the way we at length arrived at little green lane where stood vast spreading oak under which we sheltered ourselves from violent storm when this was over and the moon began to appear amelia declared she knew very well where she was and little farther striking into another lane to the right she said that would lead us to house where we should be both safe and unsuspected i followed her directions and we at length came to little cottage about three miles distant from harris the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https it now rained very violently we entered this cottage in which we espied light without any ceremony here we found an elderly woman sitting by herself at little ﬁre who had sooner viewed us than she instantly sprung from her seat and starting back gave the strongest tokens of amazement upon which amelia said not surprised nurse though you see in strange pickle i own the old woman after having several times blessed herself and expressed the most tender concern the lady who stood dripping before her began to bestir herself in making up the ﬁre at the same time entreating amelia that she might be permitted to furnish her with some cloaths which she said though not ﬁne were clean and wholesome and much dryer than her own i seconded this motion so vehemently that amelia though she declared herself under apprehension of catching cold she hath indeed the best constitution in the world at last consented and i retired without doors under shed to give my angel an opportunity of dressing herself in the only room which the cottage af forded belowstairs at my return into the room amelia insisted on my exchanging my coat one which belonged to the old woman son i am very glad cried miss matthews to ﬁnd she did not forget you i own i thought it somewhat cruel to turn you out into the rain miss matthews continued he taking notice of her observation i had now an opportunity of contemplating the vast power of exquisite beauty which nothing almost can add to or diminish amelia in the poor rags of her old nurse looked scarce less beautiful than i have seen her appear at ball or an assembly well well cries miss matthews to be sure she did but pray go on with your story the old woman continued he after having equipped us well she could and placed our wet cloaths before the ﬁre began to grow inquisitive and after some ejaculations she my dear young madam my mind misgives hugeously and pray who is this ﬁne young gentleman oh miss emmy miss emmy i am afraid madam knows nothing of all this matter he should be my husband nurse answered amelia good and if he be replies the nurse i hope he is some great gentleman or other with vast estate and coach and six to be sure if an he was the greatest lord in the land you would deserve it all but why i attempt to mimic the honest creature in short she discovered the greatest affection my amelia with which i was much more delighted than i was offended at the suspicions she shewed of or the many bitter curses which she denounced against if i ever proved bad husband to so sweet young lady i so well improved the hint given by amelia that the old woman had doubt of our being really married and comforting herself that if it was not well it might have been yet madam had enough us both and that happiness did not always depend on great riches she began to rail at the old lady having turned us out of doors which i scarce told an untruth in asserting and when amelia said hoped her nurse would not betray her the good woman answered with much you my dear young madam that i would not if the king would give all that he is worth not if madam herself would give the great house and the whole farm belonging to it the good woman then went out and fetched chicken from the roost which she killed and began to pick without asking any questions then summoning her son who was in bed to her assistance she began to prepare this chicken our supper this she afterwards set before us in so neat i may almost say elegant manner that whoever would have disdained it the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https not know the sensation of hunger or doth not deserve to have it gratiﬁed our food was attended with some ale which our kind hostess said she intended not to have tapped till christmas added she i little thought ever to have the honour of seeing my dear honoured lady in this poor place my own part human being was then an object of envy to and even amelia seemed to be in pretty good spirits she softly whispered to that she perceived there might be happiness in cottage cottage cries miss matthews sighing cottage with the man one loves is palace when supper was ended continued booth the good woman began to think of our further wants and very earnestly recommended her bed to us saying it was very neat though homely one and that she could furnish us with pair of clean sheets she added some persuasives which painted my angel all over with vermilion myself i behaved so awkwardly and foolishly and so readily agreed to amelia resolution of sittin g up all night that if it did not give the nurse any suspicion of our marriage it ought to have inspired her with the utmost contempt we both endeavoured to prevail with nurse to retire to her own bed but found it utterly impossible to succeed she thanked heaven she understood breeding better than that and so well bred was the good woman that we could scarce get her out of the room the whole night luckily us we both understood french by means of which we consulted together even in her presence upon the measures we were to take in our present exigency at length it was resolved that i should send letter by this young lad whom i have just before mentioned to our worthy friend the doctor desiring his company at our hut since we thought it utterly unsafe to venture to the town which we knew would be in an uproar on our account before the morning here booth made full stop smiled and then said he was going to mention so ridiculous distress that he could scarce think of it without laughing what this was the reader shall know in the next chapter chapter vii the story of booth surprising adventur es from what triﬂes dear miss matthews cried booth may some of our greatest distresses arise you not perceive i am going to tell you we had neither pen ink nor paper in our present exigency verbal message was now our only resource however we contrived to deliver it in such terms that neither nurse nor her son could possibly conceive any suspicion from it of the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https situation of our affairs indeed amelia whispered i might safely place any degree of conﬁdence in the lad he had been her foster and she had great opinion of his integrity he was in truth boy of very good natural parts and dr harrison who had received him into his family at amelia recommendation had bred him up to write and read very well and had taken some pains to infuse into him the principles of honesty and religion he was not indeed even now dischar ged from the doctor service but had been at home with his mother some time on account of the from which he was lately recovered i have said so much continued booth of the boy character that you may not be surprised at some stories which i shall tell you of him hereafter i am going now madam to relate to you one of those strange accidents which are produced by such train of circumstances that mere chance hath been thought incapable of bringing them together and which have therefore given birth in superstitious minds to fortune and to several other imaginary beings we were now impatiently expecting the arrival of the doctor our messenger had been gone much more than sufﬁcient time which to us you may be assured appeared not at all shorter than it was when nurse who had gone out of doors on some errand came running hastily to us crying out my dear young madam her ladyship coach is just at the door amelia turned pale death at these words indeed i feared she would have fainted if i could be said to fear who had scarce any of my senses left and was in condition little better than my angel while we were both in this dreadful situation amelia fallen back in her chair with the countenance in which ghosts are painted myself at her feet with complexion of very different colour and nurse screaming out and throwing water in amelia face harris entered the room at the sight of this scene she threw herself likewise into chair and called immediately glass of water which miss betty her daughter supplied her with to nurse nothing was capable of making any impression on her whilst she apprehended her young mistress to be in danger the doctor had now entered the room and coming immediately up to amelia after some expressions of surprize he took her by the hand called her his little sugar and assured her there were none but friends present he then led her tottering across the room to harris amelia then fell upon her knees before her mother but the doctor caught her up saying that posture child only to the almighty but i need not mention this singularity of his to you who know him so well and must have heard him often dispute against addressing ourselves to man in the humblest posture which we use towards the supreme being i will tire you with more particu lars we were soon satisﬁed that the doctor had reconciled us and our affairs to harris and we now proceeded directly to church the doctor having before provided licence us but where is the strange accident cries miss matthews sure you have raised more curiosity than you have satisﬁed indeed madam answered he your reproof is just i had like to have forgotten it but you can not wonder at when you reﬂect on that interesting part of my story which i am the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https before i mention this accident i must tell you what happened after amelia escape from her mother house harris at ﬁrst ran out into the lane among her servants and pursued us so she imagined along the road leading to the town but that being very dirty and violent storm of rain coming she took shelter in an alehouse about half mile from her own house whither she sent her coach she then drove together with her daughter to town where soon after her arrival she sent the doctor her usual privy counsellor in all her affairs they sat up all night together the doctor endeavouring by arguments and persuasions to bring harris to reason but all to purpose though he hath infor med miss betty seconded him with the warmest entreaties here miss matthews laughed of which booth begged to know the reason she at last after many apologies said it was the ﬁrst good thing she ever heard of miss betty nay said she and asking your pardon my opinion of your sister since you will have it i always conceived her to be the deepest of hypocrites booth fetched sigh and said he was afraid she had not always acted so kindly then after little hesitation proceeded you will be pleased madam to remember the lad was sent with verbal message to the doctor which message was more than to acquaint him where we were and to desire the favour of his company or that he would send coach to bring us to whatever place he would please to meet us at this message was to be delivered to the doctor himself and the messenger was ordered if he found him not at home to go to him wherever he was he fulﬁlled his orders and told it to the doctor in the presence of mrs harris oh the idiot cries miss matthews not at all answered booth he is very sensible fellow you will perhaps say hereafter he had not the least reason to suspect that any secrecy was necessary we took the utmost care he should not suspect madam this accident which appeared so unfortunate turned in the highest degree to our advantage harris sooner heard the message delivered than she fell into the most violent passion imaginable and accused the doctor of being in the plot and of having confederated with in the design of carrying of f her daughter the doctor who had hitherto used only soothing methods now talked in different strain he confessed the accusation and justiﬁed his conduct he said he was meddler in the family affairs of others nor should he have concerned himself with hers but at her own request but that since harris herself had made him an agent in this matter he would take care to acquit himself with honour and above all things to preserve young lady whom he had the highest esteem she is cries he and by heavens he said true most worthy generous and noble of all human beings you have yourself madam said he to the match i have at your request made the match and then he added some particulars relating to his opinion of which my modesty forbids to repeat nay but cries miss matthews i insist on your conquest of that modesty once we women not love to hear one another praises and i will be made amends by hearing the praises of man and of man whom perhaps added she with leer i shall not think much the better of upon that account in obedience to your commands then madam continued he the doctor was so kind to say he had enquired into my character and found that i had been dutiful son and an affectionate brother relations said he in which whoever dischar ges his duty well gives us the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https hope that he will behave properly in all the rest he concluded with saying that amelia happiness her heart nay her very reputation were all concerned in this matter to which he had been made instrumental he was resolved to carry her through it and then taking the licence from his pocket declared to harris that he would go that instant and marry her daughter wherever he found her this speech the doctor voice his look and his behaviour all which are sufﬁciently calculated to inspire awe and even terror when he pleases frightened poor harris and wrought more sensible effect than it was in his power to produce by all his ar guments and entreaties and i have already related what followed thus the strange accident of our wanting pen ink and paper and our not trusting the boy with our secret occasioned the discovery to harris that discovery put the doctor upon his metal and produced that blessed even t which i have recounted to you and which my mother hath since confessed nothing but the spirit which he had exerted after the discovery could have brought about well madam you now see married to amelia in which situation you will perhaps think my happiness incapable of addition perhaps it was so and yet i can with truth say that the love which i then bore amelia was not comparable to what i bear her now happy amelia cried miss matthews if all men were like you all women would be blessed nay the whole world would be so in great measure upon my soul i believe that from the damned inconstancy of your sex to ours proceeds half the miseries of mankind that we may give the reader leisure to consider well the foregoing sentiment we will here put an end to this chapter chapter viii in which our r eaders will pr obably be divided in their opinion of mr booth conduct booth proceeded follows the ﬁrst months of our marriage produced nothing remarkable enough to mention i am sure i need not tell miss matthews that i found in my amelia every perfection of human nature harris at ﬁrst gave us some little uneasiness she had rather yielded to the doctor than given willing consent to the match however by degrees she became more and more satisﬁed and at last seemed perfectly reconciled this we ascribed good deal to the kind ofﬁces of miss betty who had always appeared to be my friend she had been greatly assisting to amelia in making her escape which i had opportunity of mentioning to you before and in all things behaved so well outwardly at least to myself well her sister that we regarded her our sincerest friend about half year after our marriage two additional companies were added to our regiment in one of which i was preferred to the command of lieutenant upon this occasion miss the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https the ﬁrst intimation of disposition which we have since too severely experienced your servant sir says miss matthews then i ﬁnd i was not mistaken in my opinion of the lady shew any goodness in censorious prude miss matthews hesitated simile or an execration booth proceeded you will please to remember madam there was formerly an agreement between myself and harris that i should settle all my amelia fortu ne on her except certain sum which was to be laid out in my advancement in the army but our marriage was carried on in the manner you have heard such agreement was ever executed and since i was become amelia husband not word of this matter was ever mentioned by the old lady and myself i declare i had not yet awakened from that delicious dream of bliss in which the possession of amelia had lulled here miss matthews sighed and cast the tenderest of looks on booth who thus continued his story soon after my promotion harris one morning took an occasion to speak to on this affair she said that i had been promoted gratis to lieutenancy she would assist with money to carry yet step higher and if more was required than was formerly mentioned it should not be wanting since she was so perfectly satisﬁed with my behaviour to her daughter adding that she hoped i had still the same inclination to settle on my wife the remainder of her fortune i answered with very warm acknowled gments of my mother goodness and declared if i had the world i was ready to lay it at my amelia so heaven knows i would ten thousand worlds harris seemed pleased with the warmth of my sentiments and said she would immediately send to her lawyer and give him the necessary orders and thus ended our conversation on this subject from this time there was very visible alteration in miss betty behaviour she grew reserved to her sister well to she was fretful and captious on the slightest occasion nay she affected much to talk on the ill consequences of an imprudent marriage especially before her mother and if ever any little tenderness or endearments escaped in public towards amelia she never failed to make some malicious remark on the short duration of violent passions and when i have expressed fond sentiment my wife her sister would kindly wish she might hear much seven years hence all these matters have been since suggested to us by reﬂection while they actually past both amelia and myself had our thoughts too happily engaged to take notice of what discovered itself in the mind of any other person unfortunately us harris lawyer happened at this time to be at london where business detained him upwards of month and harris would on occasion employ any other our af fair was under an entire suspension till his the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https amelia who was now big with child had often expressed the deepest concern at her apprehensions of my being some time commanded abroad circumstance which she declared if it should ever happen to her even though she should not then be in the same situation at present would infallibly break her heart these remonstrances were made with such tenderness and so much affected that to avoid any probability of such an event i endeavoured to get an exchange into the body of troops which very rarely goes abroad unless where the king himself commands in person i soon found an ofﬁcer my purpose the terms were agreed on and harris had ordered the money which i was to pay to be ready notwithstanding the opposition made by miss betty who openly dissuaded her mother from it alledging that the exchange was highly to my disadvantage that i could never hope to rise in the army after it not forgetting at the same time some insinuations very prejudicial to my reputation soldier when everything was agreed on and the two commissions were actually made out but not signed by the king one day at my return from hunting amelia ﬂew to and eagerly embracing cried out billy i have news you which delights my soul nothing sure was ever so fortunate the exchange you have made the regiment you was formerly in is ordered gibraltar i received this news with far less transport than it was delivered i answered coldly since the case was so i heartily hoped the commissions might be both signed you say replied amelia eagerly you told everything was entirely settled that look of yours frightens to death i am running into too minute particulars in short i received letter by that very post from the ofﬁcer with whom i had exchanged insisting that though his majesty had not signed the commissions that still the bargain was valid partly urging it right and partly desiring it favour that he might go to gibraltar in my room this letter convinced in every point i was now informed that the commissions were not signed and consequently that the exch ange was not compleated of consequ ence the other could have right to insist on going and granting him such favour i too clearly saw i must it at the expense of my honou i was now reduced to dilemma the most dreadful which i think any man can experience in which i am not ashamed to own i found love was not so overmatched by honour he ought to have been the thoughts of leaving amelia in her present condition to misery perhaps to death or madness were insupportable nor could any other consideration but that which now tormented on the other side have combated them moment woman upon earth cries miss matthews can despise want of spirit in man more than myself and yet i can not help thinking you was rather too nice on this occasion you will allow madam answered booth that whoever offends against the laws of honour in the least instance is treated the highest delinquent here is excuse pardon and he doth nothing who leaves anything undone but if the conﬂict was so terrible with myself alone what was my situation in the presence of amelia how could i support her sighs her tears her agonies her despair could i bear to think myself the cruel cause of her sufferings so i was could i endure the thought of having it in my power to give her instant relief so it was and refuse it her the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https miss betty was now again become my friend she had scarce been civil to fortnight last past yet now she commended to the skies and severely blamed her sister whom she arraigned of the most contemptible weakness in preferring my safety to my honour she said many things on the occasion which i shall not now repeat in the midst of this hurricane the good doctor came to dine with harris and at my desire delivered his opinion on the matter here booth was interrupted in his narrative by the arrival of person whom we shall introduce in the next chapter chapter ix containing scene of differ ent kind fr om any of the pr eceding the gentleman who now arrived was the keeper or if you please so he pleased to call himself the governor of the prison he used so little ceremony at his approach that the bolt which was very slight on the inside gave way and the door immediately ﬂew open he had sooner entered the room than he acquainted miss matthews that he had brought her very good news which he demanded bottle of wine his due this demand being complied with he acquainted miss matthews that the wounded gentleman was not dead nor was his wound thought to be mortal that loss of blood and perhaps his fright had occasioned his fainting away but i believe madam said he if you take the proper measures you may be bailed i expect the lawyer here this evening and if you put the business into his hands i warrant it will be done money to be sure must be parted with that to be sure people to be sure will expect to touch little in such cases my own part i never desire to keep prisoner longer than the law allows not i i always inform them they can be bailed soon i know it i never make any bargain not i i always love to leave those things to the gentlemen and ladies themselves i never suspect gentlemen and ladies of wanting generosity miss matthews made very slight answer to all these friendly professions she said she had done nothing she repented of and was indifferent to the event all i can say cries she is that if the wretch is alive there is greater villain in life than himself and instead of mentioning anything of the bail she begged the keeper to leave her again alone with booth the keeper replied nay madam perhaps it may be better to stay little longer here if you have not bail ready than to buy them too dear besides day or two hence when the gentleman is past all danger of recovery to be sure some folks that would expect an extraordinary fee now can not expect to touch anything and to be sure you shall want nothing here the best of all things are to be had here money both eatable and drinkable though the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https it i sha turn my back to any of the taverns either eatables or wind the captain there need not have been so shy of owning himself when he ﬁrst came in we have had captains and other great gentlemen here before now and shame to them though i say it many great gentleman is sometimes found in places that become them half so well let tell them that captain booth let tell them that i see sir answered booth little discomposed that you are acquainted with my title well my name ay sir cries the keeper and i honour you the more it i love the gentlemen of the army i was in the army myself formerly in the lord of oxford horse it is true i rode private but i had money enough to have boug ht in quarter when i took it into my head to marry and my wife she did not like that i should continue soldier she was all private life and so i came to this business upon my word sir answered booth you consulted your wife inclinations very notably but pray will you satisfy my curiosity in telling how you became acquainte d that i was in the army my dress i think could not betray betray replied the keeper there is betraying here i am not person to betray you are so shy and peery you would almost make one suspect there was more in the matter and if there be i promise you you need not be afraid of telling it you will excuse giving you hint but the sooner the better that all others may be beforehand with you and ﬁrst come ﬁrst served on these occasions that all informers are odious there doubt of that and one would care to be an informer if he could help it because of the usage they always receive from the mob yet it is dangerous to trust too much and when safety and good part of the reward too are on one side and the gallows on the i know which wise man would chuse what the devil you mean by all this cries booth offence i hope answered the keeper i speak your good and if you have been upon the snafﬂing understand i am sure not i answered booth upon my honour nay nay replied the keeper with contemptuous sneer if you are so peery that comes to you must take the my part i know i would not trust robinson with twopence untold what you mean cries booth who is robinson and you know robinson answered the keeper with great emotion to which booth replying in the negative the keeper after some tokens of amazement cried out well captain i must say you are the best at it of all the gentlemen i ever saw however i will tell you this the lawyer and robinson have been laying their heads together about you above half an hour this afternoon i overheard them mention captain booth several times and my part i would not answer that murphy is not now gone about the business but if you will the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https to of the road or anything else i will step away to his worship thrasher this instant and i am sure i have interest enough with him to get you admitted an evidence and so cries booth you really take highwayman offence captain i hope said the keeper times go there are many wors men in the world than those gentlemen may be driven to distress and when they are i know more genteeler way than the road it hath been many brave man case to my knowledge and men of much honour too any in the world well sir said booth i assure you i am not that gentleman of honour you imagine miss matthews who had long understo od the keeper better than booth sooner heard his meaning explained than she was ﬁred with greater indignation than the gentleman had expressed how dare you sir said she to the keeper insult man of fashion and who hath had the honour to bear his majesty commission in the army you yourself own you know if his misfortunes have sent him hither sure we have laws that will protect such fellow you in insulting him fellow muttered the i would not advise you madam to use such language to you dare threaten replied miss matthews in rage venture in the least instance to exceed your authority with regard to and i will prosecute you with the utmost vengeance scene of very high altercation now ensued till booth interposed and quieted the keeper who was perhaps enough inclined to an accommodation in truth he waged unequal war he was besides unwilling to incense miss matthews whom he expected to be bailed out the next day and who had more money left than he intended she should carry out of the prison with her and any violent or unjustiﬁable methods the lady had discovered much too great spirit to be in danger of them the governor therefore in very gentle tone declared that if he had given any offence to the gentleman he heartily asked his pardon that if he had known him to be really captain he should not have entertained any such suspicions but the captain was very common title in that place and belonged to several gentlemen that had never been in the army or at most had rid private like himself to be sure captain said he you yourself own your dress is not very military he had on plain fustian suit and besides the lawyer says noscitur sosir is very good rule and i believe there is greater rascal upon earth than that same robinson that i was talking of nay i assure you i wish there may be mischief hatching against you but if there is i will all i can with the lawyer to prevent it to be sure murphy is one of the cleverest men in the world at the law that even his enemies must own and i recommend him to all the business i can and it is not little to be sure that arises in this place why one good turn deserves another and i may expect that he will not be concerned in any plot to ruin any friend of mine at least when i desire him not i am sure he could not be an honest man if he would booth was then satisﬁed that robinson whom he did not yet know by name was the gamester who had won his money at play and now miss matthews who had very impatiently borne this long interruption prevailed on the keeper to withdraw soon he was gone booth began to felicitate her upon the news of the wounded gentleman being in fair likelihood of recovery to which after short silence she answered there is something perhaps which you will not easily guess that makes your congratulations more agreeable the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https than the ﬁrst account i heard of the villain having escaped the fate he deserves i assure you at ﬁrst it did not make amends the interruption of my curiosi ty now i hope we shall be disturbed more till you have ﬁnished your whole story left off i think somewhere in the struggle about leavin g happy amelia and can you call her happy at such period cries booth happy ay happy in any situation answered miss matthews with such husband i at least may well think so who have experienced the very reverse of her fortune but i was not born to be happy i may say with the poet the blackest ink of fate was sure my lot and when fate writ my name it made blot nay nay dear miss matthews answe red booth you must and shall banish such gloomy thoughts fate hath i hope many happy days in store you you believe it mr booth replied she indeed you know the must you ca have forgot amelia in the world can have quite getfulness is not in our own power if it was indeed i have reason to i know not what i am proceed in that story booth so immediately complied with this request that it is possible he was pleased with it to say the truth if all which unwittingly dropt from miss matthews was put together some conclusions might it seems be drawn from the whole which could not convey very agreeable idea to constant husband booth therefore proceeded to relate what is written in the third book of this history book iii chapter in which mr booth r esumes his story if i am not mistaken madam continued booth i was just going to acquaint you with the doctor opinion when we were interrupted by the keeper the doctor having heard counsel on both sides that is to say harris my staying and miss betty my going at last delivered his own sentiments amelia she sat silent drowned in her tears nor was i myself in much better situation the commissions are not signed said the doctor i think you may be said to remain in your former regiment and therefore i think you ought to go on this expedition your duty to your king and country whose bread you have eaten requires it and this is duty of too high nature to admit the least deﬁciency regard to your character likewise requires you to go the world which might justly blame your staying at home if the case was even fairly stated will not deal so honestly by you you must expect to have every circumstance against the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https and most of what makes your defence omitted and thus you will be stigmatized coward without any palliation the malicious disposition of mankind is too well known and the cruel pleasure which they take in destroying the reputations of others the use we are to make of this knowledge is to afford handle to reproach bad the world is it seldom falls on any man who hath not given some slight cause censure though this perhaps is often aggravated ten and when we blame the malice of the aggravation we ought not to forget our own imprudence in giving the occasion remember my boy your honour is at stake and you know how nice the honour of soldier is in these cases this is treasure which he must be your enemy indeed who would attempt to rob you of therefore you ought to consider every one your enemy who by desiring you to stay would rob you of your honour you hear that sister cries miss betty y es i hear it answered amelia with more spirit than i ever saw her exert before and would preserve his honour at the expense of my life i will preserve it if it should be at that expense and since it is dr harrison opinion that he ought to go i give my consent go my dear husband cried she falling upon her knees every angel of heaven guard and preserve you can not repeat her words without being affected said he wiping his eyes the excellence of that woman words can paint miss matthews she hath every perfection in human nature i will not tire you with the repetition of any more that past on that occasion nor with the quarrel that ensued between harris and the doctor the old lady could not submit to my leaving her daughter in her present condition she fell severely on the army and cursed the day in which her daughter was married to soldier not sparing the doctor having had some share in the match i will omit likewi the tender scene which past between amelia and myself previous to my departure indeed i beg you would not cries miss matthews nothing delights more than scenes of tenderness i should be glad to know if possible every syllable which was uttered on both sides i will indulge you then cries booth far is in my power indeed i believe i am able to recollect much the greatest part the impression is never to be ef faced from my memory he then proceeded miss matthews desired but lest all our readers should not be of her opinion we will according to our usual custom endeavour to accommodate ourselves to every taste and shall therefore place this scene in chapter by itself which we desire all our readers who not love or who perhaps not know the pleasure of tenderness to pass over since they may this without any prejudice to the thread of the narrative chapter ii containing scene of the tender the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https the doctor madam continued booth spent his evening at harris house where i sat with him whilst he smoaked his pillow pipe his phrase is amelia was retired about half an hour to her chamber before i went to her at my entrance i found her on her knees posture in which i never disturbed her in few minutes she arose came to and embracing said she had been praying resolution to support the cruellest moment she had ever under gone or could possibly under go i reminded her how much more bitter farewel would be on when we never could meet in this world at least again i then endeavoured to lessen all those objects which alarmed her most and particularly the danger i was to encounter upon which head i seemed little to comfort her but the probable length of my absence and the certain length of my voyage were circumstances which oratory of mine could even palliate heavens said she bursting into tears i bear to think that hundreds thousands aught i know of miles or leagues that lands and seas are betwe en us what is the prospect from that mount in our garden where i have sat so many happy hours with my billy what is the distance between that and the farthest hill which we see from thence compared to the distance which will be between us you can not wonder at this idea you must remember my billy at this place this very thought came formerly into my foreboding mind i then begged you to leave the army why would you not comply i not tell you then that the smallest cottage we could survey from the mount would be with you paradise to it would be so ca my billy think so am i so much his superior in love where is the dishonour billy or if there be any will it reach our ears in our little hut are glory and fame and not his amelia the happiness of my husband go then purchase them at my expence you will pay few sighs perhaps few tears at parting and then new scenes will drive away the thoughts of poor amelia from your bosom but what assistance shall i have in my afﬂiction not that any change of scene could drive you one moment from my remembrance yet here every object i behold will place your loved idea in the liveliest manner before my eyes this is the bed in which you have reposed that is the chair on which you sat upon these boards you have stood these books you have read to can i walk among our beds of ﬂowers without viewing your favourites nay those which you have planted with your own hands can i see one beauty from our beloved mount which you have not pointed out to she went on the woman madam you see still prevailing since you mention it says miss matthews with smile i own the same observation occurred to it is too natural to us to consider ourselves only mr booth y shall hear he cried at last the thoughts of her present condition sugges ted but if said she situation even in health will be so intolerable how shall i in the danger and agonies of childbirth support your absence she stopt and looking on with all the tenderness imaginable cried out am i then such wretch to wish your presence at such season ought i not to rejoice that you are out of the hearing of my cries or the knowledge of my pains if i die will you not have escaped the horrors of parting ten thousand times more dreadful than this go go my billy the very circumstance which made most dread your departure hath perfectly reconciled to it i perceive clearly now that i was only wishing to support my own weakness with your strength and to relieve my own pains at the price of yours believe my love i am ashamed of myself caught her in my arms with raptures not to be exprest in words called her my heroine sure none ever better deserved that name after which we remained some time speechless and locked in each other embraces i am convinced said miss matthews with sigh there are moments in life worth purchasing with worlds the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https at length the fatal morning came i endeavoured to hide every pang of my heart and to wear the utmost gaiety in my countenance amelia acted the same part in these assumed characters we met the family at breakfast at their breakfast i mean we were both full already the doctor had spent above an hour that morning in discourse with harris and had in some measure reconciled her to my departure he now made use of every art to relieve the poor distressed amelia not by inveighing against the folly of grief or by seriously advising her not to grieve both of which were sufﬁciently performed by miss betty the doctor on the contrary had recourse to every means which might cast veil over the idea of grief and raise comfortable images in my angel mind he endeavoured to lessen the supposed length of my absence by discoursing on matters which were more distant in time he said he intended next year to rebuild part of his you captain says he lay the corner i promise you with many other instances of the like nature which produced i believe some good ef fect on us both amelia spoke but little indeed more tears than words dropt from her however she seemed resolved to bear her afﬂiction with resignation but when the dreadful news arrived that the horses were ready and i having taken my leave of all the rest at last approach ed her she was unable to support the conﬂict with nature any longer and clinging round my neck she cried farewel ever i shall never never see you more at which words the blood entirely forsook her lovely cheeks and she became lifeless corpse in my arms amelia continued so long motionless that the doctor well harris began to be under the most terrible apprehensions so they informed afterwards at that time i was incapable of making any observation i had indeed very little more use of my senses than the dear creature whom i supported at length however we were all delivered from our fears and life again visited the loveliest mansion that human nature ever af forded it i had been and yet was so terriﬁed with what had happened and amelia continued yet so weak and ill that i determined whatever might be the consequence not to leave her that day which resolution she was sooner acquainted with than she fell on her knees crying heaven i thank thee this reprieve at least oh that every hour of my future life could be crammed into this dear day our good friend the doctor remained with us he said he had intended to visit family in some afﬂiction i know says he i should ride dozen miles after afﬂiction when we have enough here of all mankind the doctor is the best of comforters his excessive makes him take vast delight in the ofﬁce so his great penetration into the human mind joined to his great experience renders him the most wonderful proﬁcient in it and he so well knows when to soothe when to reason and when to ridicule that he never applies any of those arts improperly which is almost universally the case with the physicians of the mind and which it requires very great judgment and dexterity to avoid the doctor principally applied himself to ridiculing the dangers of the siege in which he succeeded so well that he sometimes forced smile even into the face of amelia but what most comforted her were the arguments he used to convince her of the probability of my speedy if not immediate return he said the general opinion was that the place would be taken before our arrival there in which case we should have nothing more to than to make the best of our way home the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https amelia was so lulled by these arts that she passed the day much better than i expected though the doctor could not make pride strong enough to conquer love yet he exalted the former to make some stand against the latter insomuch that my poor amelia i believe more than once ﬂattered herself to speak the language of the world that her reason had gained an entire victory over her passion till love brought up reinforcement if i may use that term of tender ideas and bore down all before him in the evening the doctor and i passed another together when he proposed to to endeavour to leave amelia asleep in the morning and promised to be at hand when she awaked and to support her with all the assistance in his power he added that nothing was more foolish than friends to take leave of each other is true indeed says he the common acquaintance and friendship of the world this is very harmless ceremony but between two persons who really love each other the church of rome never invented penance half so severe this which we absurdly impose on ourselves i greatly approved the doctor proposa l thanked him and promised if possible to put it in execution he then shook by the hand and heartily wished well saying in his blunt way boy i hope to see thee crowned with laurels at thy return one comfort i have at least that stone walls and sea will prevent thee from running away when i had left the doctor i repaired to my amelia whom i found in her chamber employed in very different manner from what she had been the preceding night she was busy in packing up some trinkets in casket which she desired to carry with this casket was her own work and she had just fastened it i came to her her eyes very plainly discovered what had passed while she was engaged in her work however her countenance was now serene and she spoke at least with some chearfulness but after some time must take care of this casket billy said she must indeed here passion almost choaked her till ﬂood of tears gave her relief and then she i shall be the happiest woman that ever was born when i see it again i told her with the blessing of god that day would soon come answered she billy not soon week is an age yet the happy day may come it shall it must it will yes billy we shall meet never to part again even in this world i hope pardon my weakness miss matthews but upon my soul i can not help it cried he wiping his eyes well i wonder at your patience and i will try it longer amelia tired out with so long struggle between variety of passions and having not closed her eyes during three successive nights towards the morning fell into profound sleep in which sleep i left her and having drest myself with all the expedition imaginable singing whistling hurrying attempting by every method to banish thought i mounted my horse which i had ordered to be ready and galloped away from that house where all my treasure was deposited thus madam i have in obedience to your commands run through scene which if it hath been tiresome to you you must yet acquit of having obtruded upon you this i am convinced of that one is capable of tasting such scene who hath not heart full of tenderness and perhaps not even then unless he hath been in the same situation the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https iii in which mr booth sets forwar d on his journey well madam we have now taken our leave of amelia i rode full mile before i once suffered myself to look back but now being come to the top of little hill the last spot i knew which could give prospect of harris house my resolution failed i stopped and cast my eyes backward shall i tell you what i felt at that instant i assure you i am not able so many tender ideas crowded at once into my mind that if i may use the expressi on they almost dissolved my heart and now madam the most unfortunate accident came ﬁrst into my head this was that i had in the hurry and confusion left the dear casket behind the thought of going back at ﬁrst suggested itself but the consequences of that were too apparent i therefore resolved to send my man and in the meantime to ride on softly on my road he immediately executed my orders and after some time feeding my eyes with that delicious and yet heartfelt prospect i at last turned my horse to descend the hill and proceeded about hundred yards when considering with myself that i should lose time by second indulgence i again turned back and once more feasted my sight with the same painful pleasure till my man returned bringing the casket and an account that amelia still continued in the sweet sleep i left her i now suddenly turned my horse the last time and with the utmost resolution pursued my journey i perceived my man at his before i mention anything of him it may be proper madam to acquaint you who he was he was the foster of my amelia this young fellow had taken it into his head to go into the army and he was desirous to serve under my command the doctor consented to dischar ge him his mother at last yielded to his importunities and i was very easily prevailed on to list one of the handsomest young fellows in england you will easily believe i had some little partiality to one whose milk amelia had sucked but he had never seen the regiment i had opportunity to shew him any great mark of favour indeed he waited on my servant and i treated him with all the tenderness which can be used to one in that station when i was about to change into the the poor fellow began to droop fearing that he should longer be in the same corps with though certainly that would not have been the case however he had never mentioned one word of his dissatisfaction he is indeed fellow of noble spirit but when he heard that i was to remain where i was and that we were to go to gibraltar together he fell into transports of joy little short of madness in short the poor fellow had imbibed very strong affection though this was what i knew nothing of till long after when he returned to then i was saying with the casket i observed his eyes all over blubbered with tears i rebuked him little too rashly on this occasion says i is the meaning of this i hope i have not with if i thought you would shew such face to the enemy i would leave you behind honour need not fear that answered he i shall ﬁnd nobody there that i shall love well enough to make cry i was the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https with this answer in which i thought i could discover both sense and spirit i then asked him what had occasioned those tears since he had left he had sign of any at that time and whether he had seen his mother at harris he answered in the negative and begged that i would ask him more questions adding that he was not very apt to cry and he hoped he should never give such another opportunity of blaming him i mention this only an instance of his affection towards i never could account those tears any otherwise than by placing them to the account of that distress in which he left at that time we travelled full forty miles that day without baiting when arriving at the inn where i intended to rest that night i retired immediately to my chamber with my dear amelia casket the opening of which was the nicest repast and to which every other hunger gave way it is impossible to mention to you all the little matters with which amelia had furnished this casket it contained medicines of all kinds which her mother who was the lady bountiful of that country had supplied her with the most valuable of all to was lock of her dear hair which i have from that time to this worn in my bosom what would i have then given little picture of my dear angel which she had lost from her chamber about month before and which we had the highest reason in the world to imagine her sister had taken away the suspicion lay only between her and amelia maid who was of all creatures the honestest and whom her mistress had often trusted with things of much greater value the picture which was set in gold and had two or three little diamonds round it was worth about twelve guineas only whereas amelia left jewels in her care of much greater value sure cries miss matthews she could not be such paultry pilferer not on account of the gold or the jewels cries booth we imputed it to mere spite with which i assure you she abounds and she knew that next to amelia herself there was nothing which i valued so much this little picture such resemblance did it bear of the original that hogarth himself did never i believe draw stronger likeness spite therefore was the only motive to this cruel depredation and indeed her behaviour on the occasion sufﬁciently convinced us both of the justice of our suspicion though we neither of us durst accuse her and she herself had the assurance to insist very strongly though she could not prevail with amelia to turn away her innocent maid saying she would not live in the house with thief miss matthews now dischar ged some curses on miss betty not much worth repeating and then mr booth proceeded in his relation chapter iv sea piece the next day we joined the regiment which was soon after to embark nothing but mirth and jollity were in the countenance of every ofﬁcer and soldier and i now met the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https whom i had not seen above year before i passed several happy hours in which poor amelia image seldom obtruded itself to interrupt my pleasure to confess the truth dear miss matthews the tenderest of passio ns is capable of subsiding nor is absence from our dearest friends so unsupportable it may at ﬁrst appear distance of time and place really cure what they seem to aggravate and taking leave of our friends resembles taking leave of the world concerning which it hath been often said that it is not death but dying which is terrible here miss matthews burst into ﬁt of laughter and cried i sincerely ask your pardon but i can not help laughing at the gravity of your philosophy booth answered that the doctrine of the passions had been always his favourite study that he was convinced every man acted entirely from that passion which was uppermost can i then think said he without entertaining the utmost contempt myself that any pleasure upon earth could drive the thoughts of amelia one instant from my mind at length we embarked aboard transport and sailed gibraltar but the wind which was at ﬁrst fair soon chopped about so that we were obliged several days to beat to windward the sea phrase is during this time the taste which i had of seafaring life did not appear extremely agreeable we rolled up and down in little narrow cabbin in which were three ofﬁcers all of us extremely our sickness being much aggravated by the motion of the ship by the view of each other and by the stench of the men but this was but little taste indeed of the misery which was to follow we were got about six leagues to the westward of scilly when violent storm arose at which soon raised the waves to the height of mountains the horror of this is not to be adequately described to those who have never seen the like the storm began in the evening and the clouds brought on the night apace it was soon entirely dark nor had we during many hours any other light than what was caused by the jarring elements which frequently sent forth ﬂashes or rather streams of ﬁre and whilst these presented the most dreadful objects to our eyes the roaring of the winds the dashing of the waves against the ship and each other formed sound altogether horrible our ears while our ship sometimes lifted up it were to the skies and sometimes swept away at once into the lowest abyss seemed to be the sport of the winds and seas the captain himself almost gave up all lost and exprest his apprehension of being inevitably cast on the rocks of scilly and beat to pieces and now while some on board were addressing themselves to the supreme being and others applying comfort to strong liquors my whole thoughts were entirely engaged by my amelia thousand tender ideas crouded into my mind i can truly say that i had not singl consideration about myself in whic h she was not concerned dying to was leaving her and the fear of never seeing her more was dagger stuck in my heart again all the terrors with which this storm if it reached her ears must ﬁll her gentle mind on my account and the agonies which she must under go when she heard of my fate gave such intolerable pangs that i now repented my resolution and wished i own i wished that i had taken her advice and preferred love and cottage to all the dazzling charms of honour while i was tormenting myself with those meditations and had concluded myself certainly lost the master came into the cabbin and with chearful voice assured us that we had escaped the danger and that we had certainly past to westward of the rock this was comfortable news to all present and my captain who had been some time on his knees leapt suddenly up and testiﬁed his joy with great the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https person unused to the sea would have been astonished at the satisfaction which now discovered itself in the master or in any on board the storm still raged with great violence and the daylight which now appeared presented us with sights of horror sufﬁcient to terrify minds which were not absolute slaves to the passion of fear but so great is the force of habit that what inspires landsman with the highest apprehension of danger gives not the least concern to sailor to whom rocks and quicksands are almost the only objects of terror the master however was little mistaken in the present instance he had not left the cabbin above an hour before my man came running to and acquainted that the ship was half full of water that the sailors were going to hoist out the boat and save themselves and begged to come that moment along with him i tendered my preservation with this account which was conveyed to in whisper i acquainted both the captain and ensign and we all together immediately mounted the deck where we found the master making use of all his oratory to persuade the sailors that the ship was in danger and at the same time employing all his authority to set the pumps which he assured them would keep the water under and save his dear lovely peggy that was the name of the ship which he swore he loved dearly his own soul indeed this sufﬁciently appeared the leak was so great and the water ﬂowed in so plentifully that his lovely peggy was half ﬁlled before he could be brought to think of quitting her but now the boat was brought along side the ship and the master himself notwithstanding all his love her quitted his ship and leapt into the boat every man present attempted to follow his example when i heard the voice of my servant roaring forth my name in kind of agony i made directly to the but was too late the boat being already overladen put directly off and now madam i am going to relate to you an instance of heroic affection in poor fellow towards his master to which love itself even among persons of superior education can produce but few similar instances my poor man being unable to get with him into the boat leapt suddenly into the sea and swam back to the ship and when i gently rebuked him his rashness he answered he chose rather to die with than to live to carry the account of my death to my amelia at the same time bursting into ﬂood of tears he cried heavens what will that poor lady feel when she hears of this this tender concern my dear love endeared the poor fellow more to than the gallant instance which he had just before given of his af fection towards myself and now madam my eyes were shocked with sight the horror of which can scarce be imagined the boat had scarce got four hundred yards from the ship when it was swallowed up by the merciless waves which now ran so high that out of the number of persons which were in the boat none recovered the ship though many of them we saw miserably perish before our eyes some of them very near us without any possibility of giving them the least assistance but whatever we felt them we felt i believe more ourselves expecting every minute when we should share the same fate amongst the rest one of our ofﬁcers appeared quite stupiﬁed with fear i never indeed saw more miserable example of the great power of that passion i must not however omit doing him justice by saying that i afterwards saw the same man behave well in an engagement in which he was wounded though there likewise he was said to have betrayed the same passion of fear in his the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https the other of our ofﬁcers was less stupiﬁed if i may so express myself with hardiness and seemed almost insensible of his danger to say the truth i have from this and some other instances which i have seen been almost inclined to think that the courage well cowardice of fools proceeds from not knowing what is or what is not the proper object of fear indeed we may account the extreme hardiness of some men in the same manner the terrors of children at bugbear the child knows not but that the bugbea r is the proper object of fear the blockhead knows not that is so to the remaining part of the ship crew and the soldiery most of them were dead drunk and the rest were endeavouring fast they could to prepare death in the same manner in this dreadful situation we were taught that human condition should inspire men with absolute despair the storm had ceased some time the swelling of the sea began considerably to abate and we now perceived the man of war which convoyed us at great distance astern those aboard her easily perceived our distress and made towards us when they came pretty near they hoisted out two boats to our assistance these sooner approached the ship than they were instantaneously ﬁlled and i myself got place in one of them chieﬂy by the aid of my honest servant of whose ﬁdelity to on all occasions i can not speak or think too highly indeed i got into the boat so much the more easily great number on board the ship were rendered by drink incapable of taking any care themsel ves there was time however the boat to pass and repass so that when we came to call over names three only of all that remained in the ship after the loss of her own boat were missing the captain ensign and myself were received with many congratulations by our ofﬁcers on board the man of ofﬁcers too all except the captain paid us their compliments though these were of the rougher kind and not without several jokes on our escape the captain himself we scarce saw him during many hours and when he appeared he presented view of majesty beyond any that i had ever seen the dignity which he preserved did indeed give rather the idea of mogul or turkish emperor than of any of the monarchs of christendom to say the truth i could resemble his walk on the deck to nothing but the image of captain gulliver strutting among the lilliputians he seemed to think himself being of an order superior to all around him and more especially to us of the land service nay such was the behaviour of all the ofﬁcers and sailors to us and our soldiers that instead of appearing to be subjects of the same prince engaged in one quarrel and joined to support one cause we rather seemed to be captives on board an enemy vessel this is grievous misfortune and often proves so fatal to the service that it is great pity some means could not be found of curing it here booth stopt while to take breath we will therefore give the same refreshment to the reader chapter the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https arrival of booth at gibraltar with what ther befel him the adventures continued booth which i happened to from this day till my arrival at gibraltar are not worth recounting to you after voyage the remainder of which was tolerably prosperous we arrived in that garrison the natural strength of which is so well known to the whole world about week after my arrival it was my fortune to be ordered on sally party in which my left leg was broke with and i should most certainly have either perished miserably or must have owed my preservation to some of the enemy had not my faithful servant carried off on his shoulders and afterwards with the assistance of one of his comrades brought back into the garrison the agony of my wound was so great that it threw into fever from whence my surgeon apprehended much danger i now began again to feel my amelia and myself on her account and the disorder of my mind occasioned by such melancholy contemplations very highly aggravated the distemper of my body insomuch that it would probably have proved fatal had it not been the friendship of one captain james an ofﬁcer of our regiment and an old acquaintance who is undoubtedly one of the pleasantest companions and one of the natured men in the world this worthy man who had head and heart perfectly adequate to every ofﬁce of friendship stayed with almost day and night during my illness and by strengthening my hopes raising my spirits and cheering my thoughts preserved from destruction the behaviour of this man alone is sufﬁcient proof of the truth of my doctrine that all men act entirely from their passions bob james can never be supposed to act from any motives of virtue or religion since he constantly laughs at both and yet his conduct towards alone demonstrates degree of goodness which perhaps few of the votaries of either virtue or religion can equal you need not take much pains answered miss matthews with smile to convince of your doctrine i have been always an advocate the same i look upon the two words you mention to serve only cloaks under which hypocrisy may be the better enabled to cheat the world i have been of that opinion ever since i read that charming fellow mandevil pardon madam answered booth i hope you not agree with mandevil neither who hath represented human nature in picture of the highest deformity he hath left out of his system the best passion which the mind can possess and attempts to derive the effects or energies of that passion from the base impulses of pride or fear whereas it is certain that love exists in the mind of man that its opposite hatred doth and the same reasons will equally prove the existence of the one the existence of the other i know indeed replied the lady i never thought much about the matter this i know that when i read mandevil i thought all he said was true and i have been often told that he proves religion and virtue to be only mere names however if he denies there is any such thing love that is most certainly am afraid i can give him the lye myself i will join with you madam in that answered booth at any time the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https will you join with answered she looking eagerly at booth i know not what i was going to did you leave off would not interrupt i am impatient to know something what madam cries booth if i can give you any said she i must hear all i would not the world break the thread of your story besides i am afraid to pray sir go on well madam cries booth i think i was mentioning the extraordinary acts of friendship done by captain james nor can i help taking notice of the almost unparalleled ﬁdelity of poor atkinson that was my man name who was not only constant in the assiduity of his attendance but during the time of my danger demonstrated concern which i can hardly account my prevailing on his captain to make him sergeant was the ﬁrst favour he ever received at my hands and this did not happen till i was almost perfectly recovered of my broken leg poor fellow i shall never forget the extravagant joy his halbert gave him i remember it the more because it was one of the happiest days of my own life it was upon this day that i received letter from my dear amelia after long silence acquainting that she was out of all danger from her i was now once more able to perform my duty when so unkind was the fortune of war the second time i mounted the guard i received violent contusion from the bursting of bomb i was felled to the ground where i lay breathless by the blow till honest atkinson came to my assistance and conveyed to my room where sur geon immediately attended the injury i had now received was much more dangerous in my surgeon opinion than the former it caused to spit blood and was attended with fever and other bad symptoms so that very fatal consequences were apprehended in this situation the image of my amelia haunted day and night and the apprehensions of never seeing her more were so intole rable that i had thoughts of resigning my commission and returning home weak i was that i might have at least the satisfaction of dying in the arms of my love captain james however persisted in dissuading from any such resolution he told my honour was too much concerned attempted to raise my hopes of recovery to the utmost of his power but chieﬂy he prevailed on by suggesting that if the worst which i apprehended should happ en it was much better amelia that she should be absent than present in so melancholy an hour i know cried he extreme joy which must arise in you from meeting again with amelia and the comfort of expiring in her arms but consider what she herself must endure upon the dreadful occasion and you would not wish to purchase any happiness at the price of so much pain to her this argument at length prevailed on and it was after many long debates resolved that she should not even know my present condition till my doom either life or death was absolutely ﬁxed oh heavens how great how generous cried miss matthews booth thou art noble fellow and i scarce think there is woman upon earth worthy so exalted passion booth made modest answer to the compliment which miss matthews had paid him this drew more civilities from the lady and these again more acknowledgments all which we shall pass by and proceed with our history the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https vi containing matters which will please some r eaders two months and more had i continued in state of incertainty sometimes with more ﬂattering and sometimes with more alarming symptoms when one afternoon poor atkinson came running into my room all pale and out of breath and begged not to be surprized at his news i asked him eagerly what was the matter and if it was anything concerning amelia i had scarce uttered the dear name when she herself rushed into the room and ran hastily to crying y es it is it is your amelia herself there is nothing so difﬁcult to describe and generally so dull when described scenes of excessive tenderness can you think so says miss matthews surely there is nothing so charming booth our sex is by the want of tenderness in yours were they all like certainly man was ever your equal indeed madam cries booth you honour too much en the ﬁrst transports of our meeting were over amelia began gently to chide having concealed my illness from her in three letters whic h i had writ her since the accident had happened there was not the least mention of it or any hint given by which she could possibly conclude i was otherwise than in perfect health and when i had excused myself by assigning the true reason she booth and you know so little of your amelia to think i could or would survive you would it not be better one dreadful sight to break my heart all at once than to break it by degrees billy can anything pay the loss of this embrace i ask your ridiculous doth my fondness appear in your eyes how often answered she shall i assert the contrary what would you have say booth shall i tell you i envy booth of all the women in the world would you believe if i did i hope what am i saying pray make farther apology but go on after scene continued he too tender to be conceived by many amelia informed that she had received letter from an unknown hand acquainting her with my misfortune and advising her if she ever desired to see more to come directly to gibraltar she said she should not have delayed moment after receiving this letter had not the same ship brought her one from written with rather more than usual gaiety and in which there was not the least mention of my indisposition this she said greatly puzzled her and her mother and the worthy divine endeavoured to persuade her to give credit to my letter and to impute the other to species of wit with which the world greatly abounds this consists entirely in doing various kinds of mischief to our by belying one deceiving another exposing third and drawing in fourth to expose himself in short by making some the objects of laughter others of contempt and indeed not seldom by subjecting them to very great inconveniences perhaps to ruin the sake of the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https harris and the doctor derived the letter from this species of wit miss betty however was of different opinion and advised poor amelia to apply to an ofﬁcer whom the governor had sent over in the same ship by whom the report of my illness was so strongly conﬁrmed that amelia immediately resolved on her voyage i had great curiosity to know the author of this letter but not the least trace of it could be discovered the only person with whom i lived in any great intimacy was captain james and he madam from what i have already told you you will think to be the last person i could suspect besides he declared upon his honour that he knew nothing of the matter and man honour is i believe more sacred there was indeed an ensign of another regim ent who knew my wife and who had sometimes visited in my illness but he was very unlikely man to interest himself much in any affairs which did not concern him and he too declared he knew nothing of it and did you never discover this secret cried miss matthews never to this day answered booth i fancy said she i could give shrewd guess what so likely that booth when you left her should have given her foster brother orders to send her word of whatever befel you yet could not be neither then she would not have doubted whether she should leave dear england on the receipt of the letter it must have been by some other means that i own appeared extremely natural to if i had been left by such husband i think i should have pursued the same method madam cried booth it must have been conveyed by some other channel my amelia i am certain was entirely ignorant of the manner and poor atkinson i am convinced he would not have ventured to take such step without acquainting besides the poor fellow had i believe such regard my wife out of gratitude the favours she hath done his mother that i make doubt he was highly rejoiced at her absence from my melancholy scene well whoever writ it is matter very immaterial yet it seemed so odd and unaccountable an incident i could not help mentioning it from the time of amelia arrival nothing remarkable happened till my perfe ct recovery unless i should observe her remarkable behaviour so full of care and tenderness that it was perhaps without parallel booth cries the lady it is fully equalled i am sure by your gratitude there is nothing i believe so rare gratitude in your sex especially in husbands so kind remembrance is indeed more than return to such an obligation where is the mighty obligation which woman confers who being possessed of an inestimable jewe l is so kind to herself to be careful and tender of it i not say this to lessen your opinion of booth i have doubt but that she loves you well she is capable but i would not have you think so meanly of our sex to imagine there are not thousand women susceptible of true tenderness towards meritorious man believe booth if i had received such an account of an accident having happened to such husband mother and parson would not have held moment i should have leapt into the ﬁrst i could have found and bid deﬁance to the winds and there is true tenderness but in woman of the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https would not be understood all this while to reﬂect on booth i am only defending the cause of my sex upon my soul such compliments to wife are satire on all the rest of womankind sure you jest miss matthews answe red booth with smile however if you please i will proceed in my story chapter vii the captain continuing his story recounts some particulars which we doub t not to many good people will appear unnatural i was scarce sooner recovered from my indisposition than amelia herself fell this i am afraid was occasioned by the fatigues which i could not prevent her from under going on my account my disease went off with violent sweats during which the surgeon strictly ordered that i should lie by myself my amelia could not be prevailed upon to spend many hours in her own bed during my restless ﬁts she would sometimes read to several hours together indeed it was not without difﬁculty that she ever quitted my bedside these fatigues added to the uneasiness of her mind overpowered her weak spirits and threw her into one of the worst disorders that can possibly attend woman disorder very common among the ladies and our physicians have not agreed upon its name some call it fever on the spirits some nervous fever some the vapours and some the hysterics say more cries miss matthews i pity you i pity you from my soul man had better be plagued with all the curses of egypt than with vapourish wife pity madam answered booth pity rather that dear creature who from her love and care of my unworthy self contracted distemper the horrors of which are scarce to be imagined it is indeed sort of complication of all diseases together with almost madness added to them in this situation the siege being at an end the governor gave leave to attend my wife to montpelier the air of which was judged to be most likely to restor her to health upon this occasion she wrote to her mother to desire remittance and set forth the melancholy condition of her health and her necessity money in such terms would have touched any bosom not void of humanity though stranger to the unhappy sufferer her sister answered it and i believe i have copy of the answe r in my pocket i keep it by curiosity and you would think it more so could i shew you my amelia letter he then searched his book and ﬁnding the letter among many others he read it in the following words sister mamma being much disordered hath commanded to tell you she is both shocked and surprized at your extraordinary request or she chuses to call it order money you know my dear she says that your marriage with this man was entirely against her consent and the opinion of all your family i am sure i may here include myself the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https number and yet after this fatal act of disobedience she was prevailed on to receive you her child not however nor are you so to understand it the favourite which you was before she forgave you but this was christian and parent still preserving in her own mind just sense of your disobedience and just resentment on that account and yet notwithstanding this resentment she desires you to remember that when you second time ventured to oppose her authority and nothing would serve you but taking ramble an indecent one i ca help saying after your fellow she thought ﬁt to shew the excess of mother tenderness and furnished you with less than ﬁfty pounds your foolish voyage how can she then be otherwise than surprized at your present demand which should she be so weak to comply with she must expe ct to be every month repeated in order to supply the extravagance of young rakish ofﬁcer you say she will compassionate your sufferings yes surely she doth greatly compassionate them and so i too though you was neither so kind nor so civil to suppose i should but i forgive all your slights to well now formerly nay i not only forgive but i pray daily you but dear sister what could you expect less than what hath happened you should have believed your friends who were wiser and older than you i not here mean myself though i own i am eleven months and some odd weeks your superior though had i been younger i might perhaps have been able to advise you wisdom and what some may call beauty not always go together you will not be offended at this i know in your heart you have always held your head above some people whom perhaps other people have thought better of but why i mention what i scorn so much my dear sister heaven forbid it should ever be said of that i value myself upon my not but if i could believe men i hate and despise you know i my dear and i wish you had despised them much but jacta est jalea the doctor says you are to make the best of your fortune i mean my mamma may please to give you you know all is in her power let advise you then to bring your mind to your circumstances and remember i ca help writing it it is your own good the vapours are distemper which very ill become knapsack remember my dear what you have done remember what my mamma hath done remember we have someth ing of yours to keep and not consider yourself an only child nor favourite child but be pleased to remember dear sister your most affectionate sister and most obedient humble servant harris brave miss betty cried miss matthews i always held her in high esteem but i protest she exceeds even what i could have expected from her this letter madam cries booth you will believe was an excellent cordial my poor wife spirits so dreadful indeed was the effect it had upon her that she had read it in my absence i found her at my return home in the most violent ﬁts and so long was it before she recovered her senses that i despaired of that blest event ever happening and my own senses very narrowly escaped from being sacriﬁced to my despair however she came at last to herself and i began to consider of every means of carrying her immediately to montpelier which was now become much more necessary than before though i was greatly shocked at the barbarity of the letter yet i apprehended very ill consequence from it it was believed all over the army that i had married great fortune i had received offers of money if i wanted it from more than one indeed i might have easily carried my wife to montpelier at any time but she was extremely averse to the voyage the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https of our returning to england i had leave to and she grew daily so much better that had it not been the receipt of that i have just read to you i am persuaded she might have been able to return to england in the next ship among others there was colonel in the garrison who had not only offered but importuned to receive money of him i now therefore repaired to him and reason altering my resolution i produced the letter and at the same time acquainted him with the true state of my affairs the colonel read the letter shook his head and after some silence said he was sorry i had refused to accept his offer before but that he had now so ordered matters and disposed of his money that he had not shilling left to spare from his own occasions answers of the same kind i had from several others but not one penny could i borrow of any i have been since ﬁrmly persuaded that the honest colonel was not content with denying himself but took effectual means by spreading the secret i had so foolishly trusted him with to prevent from succeeding elsewhere such is the nature of men that whoever denies himself to you favour is unwilling that it should be done to you by any other this was the ﬁrst time i had ever felt that distress which arises from the want of money distress very dreadful indeed in married state what can be more miserable than to see anything necessary to the preservation of beloved creature and not be able to supply it perhaps you may wonder madam that i have not mentioned captain james on this occasion but he was at that time laid up at algiers whither he had been sent by the governor in fever however he returned time enough to supply which he did with the utmost readiness on the very ﬁrst mention of my distress and the good colonel notw ithstanding his having disposed of his money discount ed the captain draft you see madam an instance in the generous behaviour of my friend james how false are all universal satires against humankind he is indeed one of the worthiest men the world ever produced but perhaps you will be more pleased still with the extravagant generosity of my sergeant the day before the return of james the poor fellow came to with tears in his eyes and begged i would not be offended at what he was going to mention he then pulled purse from his pocket which contained he said the sum of twelve pounds and which he begged to accept crying he was sorry it was not in his power to lend whatever i wanted i was so struck with this instance of generosity and friendship in such person that i gave him an opportunity of pressing second time before i made him an answer indeed i was greatly surprised how he came to be worth that little sum and less at his being acquainted with my own wants in both which points he presently satisﬁed to the ﬁrst it seems he had plundered spanish ofﬁcer of ﬁfteen pistoles and to the second he confessed he had it from my wife maid who had overheard some discourse between her mistress and indeed people i believe always deceive themselves who imagine they can conceal distrest circumstances from their servants these are always extremely quicksighted on such occasions good heavens cries miss matthews how astonishing is such behaviour in so low fellow the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https i thought so myself answered booth and yet i know not on more strict examination into the matter why we should be more surprised to see greatness of mind discover itself in one degree or rank of life than in another love benevolence or what you will please to call it may be the reigning passion in beggar well in prince and wherever it is its energies will be the same to confess the truth i am afraid we often compliment what we call upper life with too much injustice at the expense of the lower it is rare thing to see instances which degrade human nature in persons of the highest birth and education so i apprehend that examples of whatever is really great and good have been sometimes found amongst those who have wanted all such advantages in reality palaces i make doubt sometimes contain nothing but dreariness and darkness and the sun of righteousness hath shone forth with all its glory in cottage chapter viii the story of booth continued booth thus went on we now took leave of the garrison and having landed at marseilles arrived at montpelier without anything happening to us worth remembrance except the extreme ickness of poor amelia but i was afterwards well repaid the terrors which it occasioned by the good consequences which attended it i believe it contributed even more than the air of montpelier to the perfect of her health i ask your pardon interrupting you cries miss matthews but you never satisﬁed whether you took the sergeant money you have made half in love with that charming fellow how can you imagine madam answered booth i should have taken from poor fellow what was of so little consequence to and at the same time of so much to him perhaps now you will derive this from the passion of pride indeed says she i neither derive it from the passion of pride nor from the passion of folly but methinks you should have accepted the offer and i am convinced you hurt him very much when you refused it but pray proceed in your story then booth went on follows amelia recovered her health and spirits daily we began to pass our time very pleasantly at montpelier the greatest enemy to the french will acknowledge that they are the best people in the world to live amongst little while in some countries it is almost easy to get good estate good acquaintance in england particularly acquaintance is of almost slow growth an oak so that the age of man scarce sufﬁces to bring it to any perfection the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https seldom contract any great intimacy till the third or at least the second generation so shy indeed are we english of letting stranger into our houses that one would imagine we regarded all such thieves now the french are the very reverse being stranger among them entitles you to the better place and to the greater degree of civility and if you wear but the appearance of gentleman they never suspect you are not one their friendship indeed seldom extends far their purse nor is such friendship usual in other countries to say the truth politeness carries friendship far enough in the ordinary occasions of life and those who want this accomplishment rarely make amends it by their sincerity bluntness or rather rudeness it commonly deserves to be called is not always so much mark of honesty it is taken to be the day after our arrival we became acquainted with mons bagillard he was frenchman of great wit and vivacity with greater share of learning than gentlemen are usually possessed of he lodged in the same house with us we were immediately acquainted and i liked his conversation so well that i never thought i had too much of his company indeed i spent so much of my time with him that amelia i know not whether i ought to mention it grew uneasy at our familiarity and complain ed of my being too little with her from my violent fondness my new acquaintance our conversation turning chieﬂy upon books and principally latin ones we read several of the classics together she could have but little entertainment by being with us when my wife had once taken it into her head that she was deprived of my company by bagillard it was impossible to change her opinion and though i now spent more of my time with her than i had ever done before she still grew more and more dissatisﬁed till at last she very earnestly desired to quit my lodgings and insisted upon it with more vehemence than i had ever known her express before to say the truth if that excellent woman could ever be thought unreasonable i thought she was so on this occasion but in what light soever her desires appeared to they manifestly arose from an affection of which i had daily the most endearing proofs i resolved to comply with her and accordingly removed to distant part of the town it is my opinion that we can have but little love the person whom we will never indulge in an unreasonable demand indeed i was under difﬁculty with regard to mons bagillard i could not possibly communicate to him the true reason quitting my lodgings so i found it difﬁcult to deceive him by counterfeit one besides i was appreh ensive i should have little less of his company than before i could indeed have avoided this dilemma by leaving montpelier amelia had perfectly recovered her health but i had faithfully promised captain james to wait his return from italy whither he was gone some time before from gibraltar nor was it proper amelia to take any long journey she being now near six months gone with child this difﬁculty however proved to be less than i had imagined it my french friend whether he suspected anything from my wife behaviour though she never i observed shewed him the least incivility became suddenly cold on his side after our leaving the lodgings he never made above two or three formal visits indeed his time was soon after entirely taken up by an intrigue with certain countess which blazed all over montpelier we had not been long in our new apartments before an english ofﬁcer arrived at montpelier and came to lodge in the same house with us this gentleman whose name the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https was of the rank of major and had so much singularity in his character that perhaps you never heard of any like him he was far from having any of those bookish qualiﬁcations which had before caused my amelia disquiet it is true his discourse generally turned on matters of feminine kind war and martial exploits being the ordinary topics of his conversation however he had sister with whom amelia was greatly pleased an intimacy presently grew between us and we four lived in one family the major was great dealer in the marvellous and was constantly the little hero of his own tale this made him very entertaining to amelia who of all the persons in the world hath the truest taste and enjoyment of the ridiculous whilst one sooner discovers it in the character of another one so well conceals her knowledge of it from the ridiculous person i can not help mentioning sentiment of hers on this head i think it doth her great honour i had the same neglect said she ridiculous people with the generality of the world i should rather think them the objects of tears than laughter but in reality i have known several who in some parts of their characters have been extremely ridiculous in others have been altogether amiable instance said she is the major who tells us of many things which he has never seen and of others which he hath never done and both in the most extravagant excess and yet how amiable is his behaviour to his poor sister whom he hath not only brought over hither her health at his own expence but is come to bear her company i believe madam i repeat her very words i am very apt to remember what she says you will easily believe from circumstance i have just mentioned in the major favour especially when i have told you that his sister was one of the best of girls that it was entirely necessary to hide from her all kind of laughter at any part of her brother behav iour to say the truth this was easy enough to the poor girl was so blinded with love and gratitude and so highly honoured and reverenced her brother that she had not the least suspicion that there was person in the world capable of laughing at him indeed i am certain she never made the least discovery of our ridicule i am well convinced she would have resented it besides the love she bore her brother she had little family pride which would sometimes appear to say the truth if she had any fault it was that of vanity but she was very good girl upon the whole and none of us are entirely free from faults you are fellow will answered miss matthews but vanity is fault of the ﬁrst magnitude in woman and often the occasion of many others to this booth made answer but continued his story in this company we passed two or three months very agreeably till the major and i both betook ourselves to our several nurseries my wife being brought to bed of girl and miss bath conﬁned to her chamber by surfeit which had like to have occasioned her death here miss matthews burst into loud laugh of which when booth asked the reason she said she could not forbear at the thoughts of two such nurses and did you really says she make your wife caudle yourself indeed madam said he i did and you think that so extraordinary the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https indeed i answered she i thought the best husbands had looked on their wives in time of festival and jollity what did you not even get drunk in the time of your wife delivery tell honestly how you employed yourself at this time why then honestly replied he and in deﬁance of your laughter i lay behind her bolster and supported her in my arms and upon my soul i believe i felt more pain in my mind than she underwent in her body and now answer honestly you really think it proper time of mirth when the creature one loves to distraction is under going the most racking torments well in the most immi nent danger i need not express any more tender circumstances i am to answer honestly cried she yes and sincerely cries booth why then honestly and sincerely says she may i never see heaven if i think you an angel of man nay madam answered but indeed you too much honour there are many such husbands nay have we not an example of the like tenderness in the majo r though to him i believe i shall make you laugh while my wife miss bath being extremely ill i went one day to the door of her apartment to enquire after her health well the major whom i had not seen during whole week i knocked softly at the door and being bid to open it i found the major in his sister warming her posset his dress was certainly whimsical enough having on woman bedgown and very dirty ﬂannel nightcap which being added to very odd person he is very awkward thin man near seven feet high might have formed in the opinion of most men very proper object of laughter the major started from his seat at my entering into the room and with much emotion and great oath cried out it you sir i then enquired after his and his sister health he answered that his sister was better and he was very well i did not expect sir cried he with not little confusion be seen by you in this situation i told him i thought it impossible he could appear in situation more becoming his character not answered he i am very much obliged to you that opinion but i believe sir however my weakness may prevail on to descend from it man can be more conscious of his own dignity than myself his sister then called to him from the inner room upon which he rang the bell her servant and then after stride or two across the room he said with an elated aspect i would not have you think booth because you have caught in this deshabille by coming upon little too can not help saying little too that i am my sister nurse i know better what is due to the dignity of man and i have shewn it in line of battle i think i have made ﬁgure there booth and becoming my character by i ought not to be despised too much if my nature is not totally without its weaknesses he uttered this and some more of the same kind with great maje sty or he called it dignity indeed he used some hard words that i did not understand all his words are not to be found in dictionary upon the whole i could not easily refrain from laughter however i conquered myself and soon after retired from him astonished that it was possible man to possess true goodness and be at the same time ashamed of it but if i was surprized at what had past at this visit how much more was i surprized the next morning when he came very early to my chamber and told he had not been able to sleep one wink at what had past between us were some words of yours says he must be further explained before we part you told sir when you found in the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https which i can not bear to recollect that you thought i could not appear in one more becoming my character these were the shall never forget them you imagine that there is any of the dignity of man wanting in my character you think that i have during my sister illness behaved with weakness that savours too much of effeminacy i know how much it is beneath man to whine and whimper about triﬂing girl well you or any man and if my sister had died i should have behaved like man on the occasion i would not have you think i conﬁned myself from company merely upon her account i was very much disordered myself and when you surprized in that repeat again in that situation nurse had not left the room three minutes and i was blowing the ﬁre fear it should have gone out this manner he ran on almost quarter of an hour before he would suffer to speak at last looking steadfastly in his face i asked him if i must conclude that he was in earnest earnest says he repeating my words you then take my character jest sir said i very gravely i think we know one another very well and i have reason to suspect you should impute it to fear when i tell you i was so far from intending to affront you that i meant you one of the highest compliments tenderness women is so far from lessening that it proves true manly character the manly brutus shewed the utmost tenderness to his portia and the great king of sweden the bravest and even ﬁercest of men shut himself up three whole days in the midst of campaign and would see company on the death of favourite sister at these words i saw his features soften and he cried out i admire the king of sweden of all the men in the world and he is rascal that is ashamed of doing anything which the king of sweden yet if any king of sweden in france was to tell that his sister had more merit than mine by i knock his brains about his ears poor little betsy she is the honestest worthiest girl that ever was born heaven be praised she is recovered if i had lost her i never should have enjoyed another happy moment in this manner he ran on some time till the tears began to overﬂow which when he perceived he stopt perhaps he was unable to go on he seemed almost choaked after short silence however having wiped his eyes with his handkerchief he fetched deep sigh and cried i am ashamed you should see this booth but nature will get the better of dignity i now comforted him with the example of xerxes i had before done with that of the king of sweden and soon after we sat down to breakfast together with much cordial friendship i assure you with all his oddity there is not better man in the world than the major indeed cries miss matthews with great scorn fool how can you mention such fellow with commendation booth spoke much he could in defence of his friend indeed he had represented him in favourable light possible and had particularly left out those hard words with which he hath observed little before the major interlarded his discourse booth then proceeded in the next chapter chapter the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https very extraor dinary matters miss bath continued booth now recovered so fast that she was abroad soon my wife our little partie quarree began to grow agreeable again and we mixed with the company of the place more than we had done before mons bagillard now again renewed his intimacy the countess his mistress was gone to paris at which my wife at ﬁrst shewed dissatisfaction and i imagined that she had friend and companion of her own sex miss bath and she had contracted the highest fondness each other that she would the less miss my company however i was disappointed in this expectation she soon began to express her former uneasiness and her impatience the arrival of captain james that we might entirely quit montpelier i could not avoid conceiving some little displeasure at this humour of my wife which i was forced to think little unreasonable little you call it says miss matthews good heavens what husband are you how little worthy answered he you will say hereafter of such wife my amelia one day we were sitting together i heard violent scream upon which my wife starting up cried out that miss bath voice and immediately ran towards the chamber whence it proceeded i followed her and when we arrived we there beheld the most shocking sight imaginable miss bath lying dead on the ﬂoor and the major all bloody kneeling by her and roaring out assistance amelia though she was herself in little better condition than her friend ran hastily to her bared her neck and attempted to loosen her stays while i ran up and down scarce knowing what i did calling water and cordials and despatching several servants one after another doctors and surgeons water cordials and all necessary implements being brought miss bath was at length recovered and placed in her chair when the major seated himself by her and now the young lady being restored to life the major who till then had engaged little of his own of any other person attention became the object of all our considerations especially his poor sister who had sooner recovered sufﬁcient strength than she began to lament her brother crying out that he was killed and bitterly bewailing her fate in having revived from her swoon to behold so dreadful spectacle while amelia applied herself to soothe the agonies of her friend i began to enquire into the condition of the major in which i was assiste d by surgeon who now arrived the major declared with great chearfulness that he did not apprehend his wound to be in the least dangerous and therefore begged his sister to be comforted saying he was convinced the surgeon would soon give her the same assurance but that good man was not so liberal of assurances the major had expected soon he had probed the wound he afforded more than hopes declaring that it was very ugly wound but added by way of consolation that he had cured many much worse when the major was drest his sister seemed to possess his whole thoughts and all his care was to relieve her grief he solemnly protested that it was more than ﬂesh wound and not very deep nor could he apprehended be in the least dangerous and the cold expressions of the surgeon he very well accounted them from motive too obvious to be mentioned from these declarations of her brother and the interposition of her friends and above all i believe from that vast vent which she had given to her fright miss bath seemed little paciﬁed amelia therefore at last prevailed and terror abated curiosity became the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https passion i therefore now began to enquire what had occasioned that accident whence all the uproar arose the major took by the hand and looking very kindly at said dear booth i must begin by asking your pardon i have done you an injury which nothing but the height of friendship in can be an excuse and therefore nothing but the height of friendship in you can forgive this preamble madam you will easily believe greatly alarmed all the company but especially i answered dear major i forgive you let it be what it will but what is it possible you can have done to injure replied he i am convinced man of your honour and dignity of nature by must conclude to be one of the highest injuries i have taken out of your own hands the doing yourself justice i am afraid i have killed the man who hath injured your honour i mean that villain i can not proceed you madam said he to my wife concerned and i know what is due to the dignity of your sex amelia i observed turned pale at these words but eagerly begged him to proceed madam answered he i am commanded by lady it is part of my dignity to obey he then proceeded to tell us that bagillard had rallied him upon supposition that he was pursuing my wife with view of gallantry telling him that he could never succeed giving hints that if it had been possible he should have succeeded himself and ending with calling my poor amelia an accomplished prude upon which the major gave bagillard box in the ear and both immediately drew their swords the major had scarce ended his speech when servant came into the room and told there was fryar below who desired to speak with in great haste i shook the major by the hand and told him i not only forgave him but was extremely obliged to his friendship and then going to the fryar i found that he was bagillard confessor from whom he came to with an earnest desire of seeing that he might ask my pardon and receive my forgiveness before he died the injury he had intended my wife at ﬁrst opposed my going from some sudden fears on my account but when she was convinced they were groundless she consented i found bagillard in his bed the major sword had passed up to the very hilt through his body after having very earnestly asked my pardon he made many compliments on the possession of woman who joined to the most exquisite beauty was mistress of the most impregnable virtue proof of which he acknowledged the vehemence well ill success of his attempts and to make amelia virtue appear the brighter his vanity was so predominant he could not forbear running over the names of several women of fashion who had yielded to his passion which he said had never raged so violently any other my poor amelia and that this violence which he had found wholly unconquerable he hoped would procure his pardon at my hands it is unnecessary to mention what i said on the occasion i assured him of my entire forgiveness and so we parted to say the truth i afterwards thought myself almost obliged to him meeting with amelia the most luxuriously delicate that can be imagined i now ran to my wife whom i embraced with raptures of love and tenderness when the ﬁrst torrent of these was little abated to my dear said she your goodness prevent you from thinking little unreasonable in expressing so much uneasiness at the loss of your company while i ought to have rejoiced in the thoughts of your being the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https entertained i know you must and then consider what i must have felt while i knew i was daily lessening myself in your esteem and forced into conduct which i was sensible must appear to you who was ignorant of my motive to be mean vulgar and selﬁsh and yet what other course had i to take with man whom denial scorn could abash but if this was cruel task how much more wretched still was the constraint i was obliged to wear in his presence before you to shew outward civility to the man whom my soul detested fear of any fatal consequence from your suspicion and this too while i was afraid he would construe it to be an encouragement you not pity your poor amelia when you reﬂect on her situation pity cried i my love is pity an adequate expression esteem adoration but how my love could he carry this on so secretly letters he offered many but i never would receive but one and that i returned him good i would not have such letter in my possession the universe i thought my eyes contaminated with reading it brave cried miss matthews heroic i protest i wish that did not bear the stamp and image of my dear i pierce my heart through vein and die to let it out again and you can really cried he laugh at so much tenderness i laugh at tenderness mr booth answered she thou knowest but little of calista i thought formerly cried he i knew great deal and thought you of all women in the world to have the all women take care booth said she by heaven if you thought so you thought truly but what is the object of my tenderne an object well madam says he i hope you will ﬁnd one i thank you that hope however says she cold it is but pray go on with your story which command he immediately obeyed chapter containing letter of very curious kind the major wound continued booth was really slight he believed it so that in very few days he was perfectly well nor was bagillard though run through the body long apprehending to be in any danger of his life the major then took aside and wishing heartily joy of bagillard recovery told i should now by the gift it were of heaven have an opportunity of doing myself justice i answered i could not think of any such thing that when i imagined he was on his i had heartily and sincerely forgiven him right replied the major consistent with your honour when he was on his but that forgiveness was only conditional and is revoked by his recovery i told him i could not possibly revoke it that my anger was really hath anger cried he with the matter the dignity of my nature hath been always my reason drawing my sword and when that is concerned i can readily ﬁght with the man i love with the man i hate the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https not tire you with the repetition of the whole argument in which the major did not prevail and i really believe i sunk little in his esteem upon that account till captain james who arrived soon after again perfectly reinstated in his favour when the captain was come there remained cause of our longer stay at montpelier to my wife she was in better state of health than i had ever known her and miss bath had not only recovered her health but her bloom and from pale skeleton was become plump handsome young woman james was again my cashier far from receiving any remittance it was now long time since i had received any letter from england though both myself and my dear amelia had written several both to my mother and sister and now at our departure from montpelier i bethought myself of writing to my good friend the doctor acquainting him with our journey to paris whither i desired he would direct his answer at paris we all arrived without encountering any adventure on the road worth relating nor did anything of consequence happen here during the ﬁrst fortnight you know neither captain james nor miss bath it is scarc worth telling you that an affection which afterwards ended in marriage began now to appear between them in which it may appear odd to you that i made the ﬁrst discovery of the lady ﬂame and my wife of the captain the seventeenth day after our arrival at paris i received letter from the doctor which i have in my and if you please i will read it you i would not willingly any injury to his words the lady you may easily believe desired to hear the letter and booth read it follows my dear i will now call you so you have neither of you now any other parent in this world of this melancholy news i should have sent you earlier notice if i had thought you ignorant of it or indeed if i had known whither to have written if your sister hath received any letters from you she hath kept them secret and perhaps out of affection to you hath reposited them in the same place where she keeps her goodness and what i am afraid is much dearer to her her money the reports concerning you have been various so is always the case in matters where men are ignorant when man knows what the truth is every man thinks himself at liberty to report what he pleases those who wish you well son booth say simply that you are dead others that you ran away from the siege and was cashiered my daughter all agree that she is saint above and there are not wanting those who hint that her husband sent her thither from this beginning you will expect i suppose better news than i am going to tell you but pray my dear children why may not i who have always laughed at my own afﬂictions laugh at yours without the censure of much malevolence i wish you could learn this temper from take my word it nothing truer ever came from the mouth of heathen than that sentence ﬁt quod bene fertur onus footnote the burthen becomes

how severely is every little rub every triﬂing accident lamented and if fortune showers down any of her heavier storms upon us how wretched we presently appear to ourselves and to others the reason of

pounds good heaven how much richer are you than millions of people who are in want of nothing farewel and know your sincere and af fectionate friend there madam cries booth how you like the letter oh extremely answered she the doctor is charming man i always loved dearly to hear him preach i remember to have heard of harris death above year before i left the country but never knew the particulars of her will before i am extremely sorry it upon my honour oh fy madam cries booth have you so soon forgot the chief purport of the doctor letter ay ay cried she these are very pretty things to read i acknowledge but the loss of fortune is serious matter and i am sure man of booth understanding must think so one consideration i must own madam answered he good deal bafﬂed all the doctor arguments this was the concern my little growing family who must one day feel the loss nor was i so easy upon amelia account upon my own though she herself put on the utmost chearfulness and stretched her invention to the utmost to comfort but sure madam there is something in the doctor letter to admire beyond the philosophy of it what think you of that easy generous friendly manner in which he sent the hundred pounds very noble and great indeed replied she but pray go on with your story i long to hear the whole chapter xi in which mr booth r elates his r eturn to england nothing remarkable i remember happened during our stay at paris which we left soon after and came to london here we rested only two days and then taking leave of our travellers we set out wiltshire my wife being so impatient to see the child which she had left behind her that the child she carried with her was almost killed with the fatigue of the journey we arrived at our inn late in the evening amelia though she had great reason to be pleased with any part of her sister behaviour resolved to behave to her if nothing the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https ever happened she therefore sent kind note to her the moment of our arrival giving her her option whether she would come to us at the inn or whether we should that evening wait on her the servant after waiting an hour brought us an answer excusing her from coming to us so late she was disordered with cold and desiring my wife by means to think of venturing out after the fatigue of her journey saying she would on that account defer the great pleasure of seeing her till the morning without taking any more notice of your humble servant than if such person had been in the world though i had very civilly sent my compliments to her i should not mention this triﬂe if it was not to shew you the nature of the woman and that it will be kind of key to her future conduct when the servant returned the good doctor who had been with us almost all the time of his absence hurried us away to his house where we presently found supper and bed prepared us my wife was eagerly desirous to see her child that night but the doctor would not suffer it and he was at nurse at distant part of the town and the doctor assured her he had seen him in perfect health that evening she suf fered herself at last to be dissuaded we spent that evening in the most agreeable manner the doctor wit and humour joined to the highest chearfulness and good nature made him the most agreeable companion in the world and he was now in the highest spirits which he was pleased to place to our account we sat together to very late hour so excellent is my wife constitution that she declared she was scarce sensible of any fatigue from her late journeys amelia slept not wink all night and in the morning early the doctor accompanied us to the little infant the transports we felt on this occasion were really enchanting nor can any but fond parent conceive i am certain the least idea of them our imaginations suggested hundred agreeable circumstances none of which had perhaps any foundation we made words and meaning out of every sound and in every feature found out some resemblance to my amelia she did to but i ask your pardon dwelling on such incidents and will proceed to scenes which to most persons will be more entertaining we went hence to pay visit to miss harris whose reception of us was i think truly ridiculous and you know the lady i will endeavour to describe it particularly at our ﬁrst arrival we were ushered into parlour where we were suffered to wait almost an hour at length the lady of the house appeared in deep mourning with face if possible more dismal than her dress in which however there was every appearance of art her features were indeed skrewed up to the very height of grief with this face and in the most solemn gait she approached amelia and coldly saluted her after which she made very distant formal courtesy and we all sat down short silence now ensued which miss harris at length broke with deep sigh and said here is great alteration in this place since you saw it last heaven hath been pleased to take my poor mother to itself here she wiped her eyes and then continued i hope i know my duty and have learned proper resignation to the divine will but something is to be allowed to grief the best of mothers so she was to us both and if at last she made any distinction she must have had her reasons so doing i am sure i can truly say i never wished much less desired it the tears now stood in poor amelia eyes indeed she had paid too many already the memory of so unnatural parent she answered with the sweetness of an angel that she was far from blaming her sister emotions on so the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https occasion that she heartily joined with her in her grief that nothing which her mother had done in the latter part of her life could efface the remembrance of that tenderness which she had formerly shewn her her sister caught hold of the word efface and rung the changes upon face cried she miss emily you must not expect to repeat names that will be ever odious i wish indeed everything could be faced that that was possible we might then have still enjoyed my poor mother i am convin ced she never recovered her grief on certain occasion she ran on and after many bitter strokes upon her sister at last directly charged her mother death on my marriage with amelia i could be silent then longer i reminded her of the perfect reconciliation between us before my departure and the great fondness which she expressed nor could i help saying in very plain terms that if she had ever change d her opinion of i was not conscious of having deserved such change by my own behaviour i was well convinced to whose good ofﬁces i owed it guilt hath very quick ears to an accusation miss harris immediately answered to the charge she said such suspicions were more than she expected that they were of piece with every other part of my conduct and gave her one consolation that they served to account her sister emily unkindness well to herself to her poor deceased mother and in some measure lessened the guilt of it with regard to her since it was not easy to know how far woman is in the power of her husband my dear amelia reddened at this reﬂection on and begged her sister to name any single instance of unkindness or disrespect in which she had ever offended to this the other answered i am sure i repeat her words though i can not mimic either the voice or air with which they were spoken miss emily which is to be the judge yourself or that gentleman i remember the time when i could have trusted to your judgment in any affair but you are now longer mistress of yourself and are not answerable your actions indeed it is my consta nt prayer that your actions may not be imputed to you it was the constant prayer of that blessed woman my dear mother who is now saint above saint whose name i can never mention without tear though i ﬁnd you can hear it without one i can not help observing some concern on so melancholy an occasion it seems due to decency but perhaps i always wish to excus you you are forbid to cry the idea of being bid or forbid to cry struck so strongly on my fancy that indignation only could have prevented from laughing but my narrative i am afraid begins to grow tedious in short after hearing near an hour every malicious insinuation which fertile genius could invent we took our leave and separated persons who would never willingly meet again the next morning after this interview amelia received long letter from miss harris in which after many bitter invectives against she excused her mother alledging that she had been driven to she did in order to prevent amelia ruin if her fortune had fallen into my hands she likewise very remotely hinted that she would be only trustee her sister children and told her that on one condition only she would consent to live with her sister this was if she could by any means be separated from that man she was pleased to call who had caused so much mischief in the family i was so enraged at this usage that had not amelia intervened i believe i should have applied to magistrate that picture which there was so much reason to suspect she had stolen and which i am convinced upon search we should have found in her possession the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https nay it is possible enough cries miss matthews i believe there is wickedness of which the lady is not capable this agreeable letter was succeeded by another of the like comfortable kind which informed that the company in which i was being an additional one raised in the beginning of the war was reduced so that i was now lieutenant on whilst we were meditating on our present situation the good doctor came to us when we related to him the manner in which my sister had treated us he cried out soul i pity her heartily this is the severest resentment he ever expresses indeed i have often heard him say that wicked soul is the greatest object of compassion in the world sentiment which we shall leave the reader little time to digest chapter xii in which mr booth concludes his story the next day the doctor set out his parsonage which was about thirty miles distant whither amelia and myself accompanied him and where we stayed with him all the time of his residence there being almost three months the situation of the parish under my good friend care is very pleasant it is placed among meadows washed by clear m and ﬂanked on both sides with downs his house indeed would not much attract the admiration of the virtuoso he built it himself and it is remarkable only its plainness with which the furniture so well agrees that there is one thing in it that may not be absolutely necessary except books and the prints of hogarth whom he calls moral satirist nothing however can be imagined more agreeable than the life that the doctor leads in this homely house which he calls his earthly paradise all his parishioners whom he treats his children regard him their common father once in week he constantly visits every house in the parish examines commends and rebukes he ﬁnds occasion this is practised likewise by his curate in his absence and so good an effect is produced by this their care that quarrels ever proceed either to blows or beggar is to be found in the whole parish nor did i ever hear very profane oath all the time i lived in it but to return from so agreeable digression to my own affairs that are much less worth your attention in the midst of all the pleasures i tasted in this sweet place and in the most delightful company the woman and man whom i loved above all things melancholy reﬂexions concerning my unhappy circumstances would often steal into my thoughts my fortune was now reduced to less than forty pounds i had already two children and my dear amelia was again with child one day the doctor found sitting by myself and employed in melancholy contemplations on this subject he told he had observed growing of late very serious the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https he knew the occasion and neither wondered at nor blamed he then asked if i had any prospect of going again into the army if not what scheme of life i proposed to myself i told him that i had powerful friends i could have but little expectations in military way that i was incapable of thinking of any other scheme all business required some knowledge or experience and likewise money to set up with of all which i was destitute must know then child said the doctor i have been thinking on this subject well you i can think i promise you with pleasant countenance these were his words to the army perhaps means might be found of getting you another commission but my daughter seems to have violent objection to it and to be plain i fancy you yourself will ﬁnd glory make you amends your absence from her and my part said he i never think those men wise who any worldly interest forego the greatest happiness of their lives if i mistake not says he country life where you could be always together would make you both much happier people i answered that of all things i preferred it most and i believed amelia was of the same opinion the doctor after little hesitation proposed to to turn farmer and offered to let his parsonage which was then become vacant he said it was farm which required but little stock and that little should not be wanting i embraced this offer very eagerly and with great thankfulness and immediatel y repaired to amelia to communicate it to her and to know her sentiments amelia received the news with the highest transports of joy she said that her greatest fear had always been of my entring again into the army she was so kind to say that all stations of life were equal to her unless one afforded her more of my company than another to our children said she us breed them up to an humble fortune and they will be contented with it none added my angel happiness or indeed are capable of it who make any particular station necessary ingredient thus madam you see degraded from my former rank in life longer captain booth but farmer booth at your service during my ﬁrst year continuance in this new scene of life nothing i think remarkable happened the history of one day would indeed be the history of the whole year well pray then said miss matthews let us hear the history of that day i have strange curiosity to know how you could kill your time and if possible ﬁnd out the very best day you can if you command madam answered booth you must yourself be accoun table the dulness of the narrative nay i believe you have imposed very difﬁcult task on the greatest happiness is incapable of description i rose then the moment you waked undoubtedly said miss the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https usually said he between ﬁve and six i will have usually cried miss matthews you are conﬁned to day and it is to be the best and happiest in the year nay madam cries booth then i must tell you the day in which amelia was brought to bed after painful and dangerous labour that i think was the happiest day of my life i protest said she you are become farmer booth indeed what happiness have you painted to my imagination you put in mind of newspaper where my lady is delivered of son to the great joy of some illustrious family why then i assure you miss matthews cries booth i scarce know circumstance that distinguished one day from another the whole was one continued series of love health and tranquillity our lives resembled calm sea the dullest of all ideas cries the lady i know said he it must appear dull in description who can describe the pleasures which the morning air gives to one in perfect health the ﬂow of spirits which springs up from exercise the delights which parents feel from the prattle and innocent follies of their children the joy with which the tender smile of wife inspires husband or lastly the chearful solid comfort which fond couple enjoy in each other conversation these pleasures and every other of which our situation was capable we tasted in the highest degree our happiness was perhaps too great fortune seemed to grow envious of it and interposed one of the most cruel accidents that could have befallen us by robbing us of our dear friend the doctor i am sorry it said miss matthews he was indeed valuable man and i never heard of his death before long may it be before any one hears of it cries booth he is indeed dead to us but will i hope enjoy many happy years of life you know madam the obligations he had to his patron the earl indeed it was impossible to be once in his company without hearing of them i am sure you will neither wonder that he was chosen to attend the young lord in his travels his tutor nor that the good man however disagreeable it might be in fact it was to his inclination should comply with the earnest request of his friend and patron by this means i was bereft not only of the best companion in the world but of the best counsellor loss of which i have since felt the bitter consequence greater advantage i am convinced can arrive to young man who hath any degree of understa nding than an intimate converse with one of riper years who is not only able to advise but who knows the manner of advising by this means alone youth can enjoy the beneﬁt of the experience of age and that at time of life when such experience will be of more service to man than when he hath lived long enough to acquire it of himself from want of my sage counsellor i now fell into many errors the ﬁrst of these was in enlar ging my business by adding farm of one hundred year to the parsonage in renting which i had also bad bargain the doctor had before given good one the consequence of which was that wherea s at the end of the ﬁrst year i was worth upwards the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https pounds at the end of the second i was near half that sum worse the phrase is than nothing second folly i was guilty of in uniting families with the curate of the parish who had just married my wife and i thought very good sort of woman we had not however lived one month together before i plainly perceived this good sort of woman had taken great prejudice against my amelia which if i had not known something of the human passions and that high place which envy holds among them i should not have been able to account so far was my angel from having given her any cause of dislike that she had treated her not only with civility but kindness besides superiority in beauty which i believe all the world would have allowed to amelia there was another cause of this envy which i am almost ashamed to mention it may well be called my greatest folly you are to know then madam that from boy i had been always fond of driving coach in which i valued myself on having some skill this perhaps was an innocent but i allow it to have been childish vanity i had an opportunity therefore of buying an old coach and harness very cheap indeed they cost but twelve pounds and i considered that the same horses which drew my waggons would likewise draw my coach i resolved on indulging myself in the purchase the consequence of setting up this poor old coach is inconceivable before this my wife and myself had very little distinguished ourselves from the other farmers and their wives either in our dress or our way of living they treated us their equals but now they began to consider us elevating ourselves into state of superiority and immediately began to envy hate and declare war against us the neighbouring little squires too were uneasy to see poor renter become their equal in matter in which they placed so much dignity and not doubting but it arose in from the same ostentation they began to hate likewise and to turn my equipage into ridicule asserting that my horses which were well matched any in the kingdom were of different colours and sizes with much more of that kind of wit the only basis of which is lying but what will appear most surprizing to you madam was that the curate wife who being lame had more use of the coach than my amelia indeed she seldom went to church in any other manner was one of my bitterest enemies on the occasion if she had ever any dispute with amelia which all the sweetness of my poor girl could not someti mes avoid she was sure to introduce with malicious sneer my husband doth not keep coach madam nay she took this opportuni ty to upbraid my wife with the loss of her fortune alledging that some folks might have had good pretensions to coach other folks and better too they brought better fortune to their husbands but that all people had not the art of making brick without straw you will wonder perhaps madam how i can remember such stuff which indeed was long time only matter of amusement to both amelia and myself but we at last experienced the mischievous nature of envy and that it tends rather to produce tragical than comical events my neighbours now began to conspire against they nicknamed in derision the squire farmer whatever i bought i was sure to buy dearer and when i sold i was obliged to sell cheaper than any other in fact they were all united and while they every day the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https on my lands with impunity if any of my cattle escaped into their ﬁelds i was either forced to enter into or to make amends fourfold the damage sustained the consequences of all this could be other than that ruin which ensued without tiring you with particulars before the end of four years i became involved in debt near three hundred pounds more than the value of all my effects my landlord seized my stock rent and to avoid immediate conﬁnement in prison i was forced to leave the country with all that i hold dear in the world my wife and my poor little family in this condition i arrived in town ﬁve or six days ago i had just taken lodging in the verge of the court and had writ my dear amelia word where she might ﬁnd when she had settled her affairs in the best manner she could that very evening i was returning home from fray happening in the street i endeavoured to assist the injured party when i was seized by the watch and after being conﬁned all night in the was conveyed in the morning before justice of peace who committed hither where i should probably have starved had i not from your hands found most unaccountable and here give leave to assure you my dear miss matthews that whatever advantage i may have reaped from your misfortune i sincerely lament it nor would i have purchased any relief to myself at the price of seeing you in this dreadful place he spake these last words with great tenderness he was man of consu mmate good nature and had formerly had much affection this young lady indeed more than the generality of people are capable of entertaining any person whatsoever book iv chapter containing very mysterious matter miss matthews did not in the least fall short of booth in expressions of tenderness her eyes the most eloquent orators on such occasions exerted their utmost force and at the conclusion of his speech she cast look languishingly sweet ever cleopatra gave to antony in real fact this booth had been her ﬁrst love and had made those impressions on her young heart which the learned in this branch of philosophy afﬁrm and perhaps truly are never to be eradicated when booth had ﬁnished his story silence ensued of some minutes an interv al which the painter would describe much better than the writer some readers may however be able to make pretty pertinent conjectures by what i have said above especially when they are told that miss matthews broke the silence by sigh and cried why is booth unwilling to allow the happiness of thinking my misfortunes have been of some little advantage to him sure the happy amelia would not be so selﬁsh to envy that pleasure not if she was the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https fondest she is the happiest of women good heavens madam said he you call my poor amelia the happiest of women indeed i answered she briskly booth there is speck of white in her fortune which when it falls to the lot of sensible woman makes her full amends all the crosses which can attend her perhaps she may not be sensible of it but if it had been my blest booth could i have thought when we were ﬁrst acquainted that the most agreeable man in the world had been capable of making the kind the tender the affectionate husb amelia in those days was unknown heaven had not then given her prospect of the happiness it intended her but yet it did intend it her sure there is fatality in the affairs of love and the more i reﬂect on my own life the more i am convinced of heavens how thousand little circumstances crowd into my mind when you ﬁrst marched into our town you had then the colours in your hand you passed under the window where i stood my glove by accident dropt into the street you stoopt took up my glove and putting it upon the spike belonging to your colours lifted it up to the window upon this young lady who stood by said miss the young ofﬁcer hath accepted your challenge i blushed then and i blush now when i confess to you i thought you the prettiest young fellow i had ever seen and upon my soul i believe you was then the prettiest fellow in the world booth here made low bow and cried dear madam how ignorant was i of my own happiness would you really have thought so answered she however there is some politeness if there be sincerity in what you say the governor of the enchanted castle interrupted them and entering the room without any ceremony acquainted the lady and gentleman that it was time and addressing booth by the name of captain asked him if he would not please to have bed adding that he might have one in the next room to the lady but that it would come dear that he never let bed in that room under guinea nor could he af ford it cheaper to his father answer was made to this proposal but miss matthews who had already learnt some of the ways of the house said she believed booth would like to drink glass of something upon which the governor immediately trumpeted forth the praises of his and without waiting any farther commands presently produced lar ge bowl of that liquor the governor having recommended the goodness of his punch by hearty draught began to revive the other matter saying that he was just going to bed and must ﬁrst lock but suppose said miss matthews with smile the captain and i should have mind to sit up all night w ith all my heart said the governor but i expect consideration those matters my part i enquire into what doth not concern but single and double are two things if i lock up double i expect half guinea and i sure the captain can not think that out of the way it is but the price of bagnio miss matthews face became the colour of scarlet at those words however she mustered up her spirits and turning to booth said what say you captain my own part i had never less inclination to sleep which hath the greater charms you the punch or the pillow i hope madam answered booth you have better opinion of than to doubt my preferring miss matthews conversation to either i assure you replied she it is compliment to you to say i prefer yours to sleep at this time the governor then having received his fee departed and turning the key left the gentleman and the lady to the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https imitation of him we will lock up likewise scene which we not think proper to expose to the eyes of the public if any readers should be disappointed on this occasion we will recommend such readers to the apologies with which certain gay ladies have lately been pleased to oblige the world where they will possibly ﬁnd everything recorded that past at this interval but though we decline painting the scene it is not our intention to conceal from the world the frailty of booth or of his fair partner who certainly past that evenin g in manner inconsistent with the strict rules of virtue and chastity to say the truth we are much more concerned the behaviour of the gentlema n than of the lady not only his sake but the sake of the best woman in the world whom we should be sorry to consider yoked to man of worth nor honour we desire therefore the natured and candid reader will be pleased to weigh attentively the several unlucky circumstances which concurred so critically that fortune seemed to have used her utmost endeavours to ensnare poor booth constancy let the reader set before his eyes ﬁne young woman in manner ﬁrst love conferring obligations and using every art to soften to allure to win and to enﬂame let him consider the time and place let him remember that booth was young fellow in the highest vigour of life and lastly let him add one single circumstance that the parties were alone together and then if he will not acquit the defendant he must be convicted i have nothing more to say in his defence chapter ii the latter part of which we expect will please our r eader better than the former whole week did our lady and gentlem an live in this criminal conversation in which the happiness of the former was much more perfect than that of the latter though the charms of miss matthews and her excessive endearments sometimes lulled every thought in the sweet lethar gy of pleasure yet in the intervals of his ﬁts his virtue alarmed and roused him and brought the image of poor injured amelia to haunt and torment him in fact if we regard this world only it is the interest of every man to be either perfectly good or completely bad he had better destroy his conscience than gently wound it the many bitter reﬂections which every bad action costs mind in which there are any remains of goodness are not to be compensated by the highest pleasures which such an action can produce so it happened to booth repentance never failed to follow his transgressions and yet so perverse is our judgment and so slippery is the descent of vice when once we are entered into it the same crime which he now repented of became reason doing that which was to cause his future repentance and he continued to sin on because he had begun his repentance however returned still heavier and heavier till at last it ﬂung him into melancholy which miss matthews plainly perceived and at which she could not avoid expressing the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https in obscure hints and ironical compliments on amelia superiority to her whole sex who could not cloy gay young fellow by many years possession she would then repeat the compliments which others had made to her own beauty and could not forbear once crying out upon my soul my dear billy i believe the chief disadvantage on my side is my superior fondness love in the minds of men hath one quality at least of fever which is to prefer coldness in the object confess dear will is there not something vastly refreshing in the cool air of prude booth fetched deep sigh and begged her never more to mention amelia name will cries she did that request proceed from the motive i could wish i should be the happiest of womankind y would not sure madam said booth desire sacriﬁce which i must be villain to make to any desire answered she are there any bounds to the desires of love have not i been sacriﬁced hath not my ﬁrst love been torn from my bleeding heart i claim prior right sacriﬁces i can make them too and would sacriﬁce the whole world at the least call of my love here she delivered letter to booth which she had received within an hour the contents of which were these dearest madam only who truly know what love is can have any conception of the horrors i felt at hearing of your conﬁnement at my arrival in town which was this morning i immediately sent my lawye r to enquire into the particulars who brought the agreeable news that the man whose heart blood ought not to be valued at the rate of single hair of yours is entirely out of all danger and that you might be admitted to bail i presently ordered him to go with two of my tradesmen who are to be bound in any sum your appearance if he should be mean enough to prosecute you though you may expect my attorney with you soon i would not delay sending this i hope the news will be agreeable to you my chariot will attend at the same time to carry you wherever you please you may easily guess what violence i have done to myself in not waiting on you in person but i who know your delicacy feared it might offend and that you might think ungenerous enough to hope from your distresses that happiness which i am resolved to owe to your free gift alone when your good nature shall induce you to bestow on what man living can merit i beg you will pardon all the contents of this hasty letter and the honour of believi ng dearest madam your most passionate admirer and most obedient humble servant damon booth thought he had somewhere before seen the same hand but in his present hurry of spirits could not recollect whose it was nor did the lady give him any time reﬂection he had scarce read the letter when she produced little bit of paper and cried out here sir here are the contents which he fears will offend she then put of hundred pounds into booth hands and asked him with smile if he did not think she had reason to be offended with so much insolence before booth could return any answer the governor arrived and introduced rogers the attorney who acquainted the lady that he had brought her dischar ge from her conﬁnement and that chariot waited at the door to attend her wherever she pleased she received the dischar ge from rogers and said she was very much obliged to the gentleman who employed him but that she would not make use of the chariot she had notion of leaving that wretched place in triumphant manner in which resolution when the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https found her obstinate he withdre w did the governor with many bows and many ladyships they were sooner gone than booth asked the lady why she would refuse the chariot of gentleman who had behaved with such excessive respect she looked earnestly upon him and cried how unkind is that question you imagine i would go and leave you in such situation thou knowest but little of calista why you think i would accept this hundred pounds from man i dislike unless it was to be serviceable to the man i love i insist on your taking it your own and using whatever you want of it booth protested in the solemnest manner that he would not touch shilling of it saying he had already received too many obligations at her hands and more than ever he should be able he feared to repay how unkind answered she is every word you say why will you mention obligations love never confers any it doth everything its own sake i am not therefore obliged to the man whose passion makes him generous i feel how inconsiderable the whole world would appear to if i could throw it after my heart much more of this kind past she still pressing the upon him and he absolutely refusing till booth left the lady to dress herself and went to walk in the area of the prison miss matthews now applied to the governor to know by what means she might procure the captain his liberty the governor answered he can not get bail it will be difﬁcult matter and money to be sure there must be people doubt expect to touch on these occasions when prisoners have not wherewithal the law requires to entitle themselves to justice why they must be beholden to other people to give them their liberty and people will not to be sure suffer others to be beholden to them nothing whereof there is good reason how should we all live if it was not these things well well said she and how much will it cost how much answered he how much let see he hesitated some time and then answered that ﬁve guineas he would undertake to procure the captain his dischar ge that being the sum which he computed to remain in the lady pocket to the gentleman he had long been acquainted with the emptiness of it miss matthews to whom money was dirt indeed she may be thought not to have known the value of it delivered him the bill and bid him get it changed if the whole says she will procure him his liberty he shall have it this evening the whole madam answered the governor soon he had recovered his breath it almost forsook him at the sight of the black word there might be people i am not one of those hundred nor nothing like myself i said i will be content with ﬁve guineas and i am sure that little enough what other people will expect i can not exactly say to be sure his worship clerk will expect to touch pretty handsomely his worship himself he never touches anything that is not to speak of but then the constable will expect something and the watchman must have something and the lawyers on both sides they must have their fees ﬁnishing w ell said she i leave all to you if it costs twenty pounds i will have him dischar ged this you must give his dischar ge into my hands without letting the captain know anything of the matter the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https governor promised to obey her commands in every particular nay he was so very industrious that though dinner was just then coming upon the table at her earnest request he set out immediately on the purpose and went he said in pursuit of the lawyer all the other company assembled at table usual where poor booth was the only person out of spirits this was imputed by all present to wrong cause nay miss matthews herself either could not or would not suspect that there was anything deeper than the despair of being speedily dischar ged that lay heavy on his mind however the mirth of the rest and pretty liberal quantity of punch which he swallowed after dinner miss matthews had ordered very large bowl at her own expense to entertain the good company at her farewell so far exhilarated his spirits that when the young lady and he retired to their tea he had all the marks of gayety in his countenance and his eyes sparkled with good humour the gentleman and lady had spent about two hours in tea and conversation when the governor returned and privately delivered to the lady the dischar ge her friend and the sum of pounds ﬁve shillings the rest having been he said disbursed in the business of which he was ready at any time to render an exact account miss matthews being again alone with booth she put the dischar ge into his hands desiring him to ask her questions and adding i think sir we have neither of us now anything more to at this place she then summoned the governor and ordered bill of that day expense long scores were not usual there and at the same time ordered hackney coach without having yet determined whither she would go but fully determined she was wherever she went to take mr booth with her the governor was now approaching with long roll of paper when faint voice was heard to cry out hastily where is he presently female spectre all pale and breathless rushed into the room and fell into mr booth arms where she immediately fainted away booth made shift to support his lovely burden though he was himself in condition very little different from hers miss matthews likewise who presently recollected the face of amelia was struck motionless with the surprize nay the governor himself though not easily moved at sights of horror stood aghast and neither of fered to speak nor stir happily amelia the governess of the mansions had out of curiosity followed her into the room and was the only useful person present on this occasion she immediately called water and ran to the lady assistance fell to loosening her stays and performed all the ofﬁces proper at such season which had so good an effect that amelia soon recovered the disorder which the violent agitation of her spirits had caused and found herself alive and awake in her husband arms some tender caresses and soft whisper or two passed privately between booth and his lady nor was it without great difﬁculty that poor amelia put some restraint on her fondness in place so improper tender intervie she now cast her eyes round the room and ﬁxing them on miss matthews who stood like statue she soon recollected her and addressing her by her name said sure madam i can not be mistaken in those features though meeting you here might almost make suspect my memory the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https matthews face was now all covered with scarlet the reader may easily believe she was on account pleased with amelia presence indeed she expected from her some of those insults of which virtuous women are generally so liberal to frail sister but she was mistaken amelia was not one who thought the nation would thrive till all the whores were burnt alive her virtue could support itself with its own intrinsic worth without borrowing any assistance from the vices of other women and she considered their natural inﬁrmities the objects of pity not of contempt or abhorrence when amelia therefore perceived the visible confusion in miss matthews she presently called to remembrance some stories which she had imperfectly heard she was not naturally attentive to scandal and had kept very little company since her return to england she was far from being mistress of the lady whole history however she had heard enough to impute her confusion to the right cause she advanced to her and told her she was extremely sorry to meet her in such place but hoped that very great misfortune was the occasion of it miss matthews began by degrees to recover her spirits she answered with reserved air i am much obliged to you madam your concern we are all liable to misfortunes in this world indeed i know not why i should be much ashamed of being in any place where i am in such good company here booth interposed he had before acquainted amelia in whisper that his conﬁnement was at an end the unfortunate accident my dear said he which brought this young lady to this melancholy place is entirely determined and she is now absolutely at her liberty myself amelia imputing the extreme coldness and reserve of the lady to the cause already mentioned advanced still more and more in proportion she drew back till the governor who had withdrawn some time returned and acquainted miss matthews that her coach was at the door upon which the company soon separated amelia and booth went together in amelia coach and poor miss matthews was obliged to retire alone after having satisﬁed the demands of the governor which in one day only had amounted to pretty considerable sum he with great dexterity proportioned the bills to the abilities of his guests it may seem perhaps wonderful to some readers that miss matthews should have maintained that cold reserve towards amelia so barely to keep within the rules of civility instead of embracing an opportunity which seemed to offer of gaining some degree of intimacy with wife whose husband she was so fond of but besides that her spirits were entirely disconcerted by so sudden and unexpec ted disappointment and besides the extreme horrors which she conceived at the presence of her rival there is i believe something so outrageously suspicious in the nature of all vice especially when joined with any great degree of pride that the eyes of those whom we imagine privy to our failings are intolerable to us and we are apt to aggravate their opinions to our disadvantage far beyond the reality the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https iii containing wise observations of the author and other matters there is nothing more difﬁcult than to lay down any ﬁxed and certain rules happiness or indeed to judge with any precision of the happiness of others from the knowledge of external circumstances there is sometimes little speck of black in the brightest and gayest colours of fortune which contaminates and deadens the whole on the contrary when all without looks dark and dismal there is often secret ray of light within the mind which turns everything to real joy and gladness i have in the course of my life seen many occasions to make this observation and booth was at present very pregnant instance of its truth he was just delivered from prison and in the possession of his beloved wife and children and which might be imagined greatly to augment his joy fortune had done all this him within an hour without givin g him the least warning or reasonable expectation of the strange reverse in his circumstances and yet it is certain that there were very few men in the world more seriously miserable than he was at this instant deep melancholy seized his mind and cold damp sweats overspread his person so that he was scarce animated and poor amelia instead of fond warm husband bestowed her caresses on dull lifeless lump of clay he endeavoured however at ﬁrst much possible to conceal what he felt and attempted what is the hardest of all tasks to act the part of happy man but he found supply of spirits to carry on this deceit and would have probably sunk under his attempt had not poor amelia simplicity helped him to another fallacy in which he had much better success this worthy woman very plainly percei ved the disorder in her husband mind and having doubt of the cause of it especially when she saw the tears stand in his eyes at the sight of his children threw her arms round his neck and embracing him with rapturous fondness cried out my dear billy let nothing make you uneasy heaven will i doubt not provide us and these poor babes great fortunes are not necessary to happiness my own part i can level my mind with any state and those poor little things whatever condition of life we breed them to that will be sufﬁcient to mainta in them in how many thousands abound in afﬂuence whose fortunes are much lower than ours it is not from nature but from education and habit that our wants are chieﬂy derived make yourself easy therefore my dear love you have wife who will think herself happy with you and endeavour to make you so in any situation fear nothing billy industry will always provide us wholesome meal and i will take care that neatness and chearfulness shall make it pleasant one booth presently took the cue which she had given him he ﬁxed his eyes on her minute with great earnestness and inexpressible tenderness and then cried my amelia how much are you my superior in every perfection how wise how great how noble are your sentiments why can i not imitate what i so much admire why can i not look with your constancy on those dear little pledges of our loves all my philosophy is bafﬂed with the thought that my amelia children are to struggle with cruel hard unfeeling world and to buffet those waves of fortune which have overwhelmed their father here i own i want your ﬁrmness and am the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https an excuse wanting it am i not the cruel cause of all your wretchedness have i not stept between you and fortune and been the cursed obstacle to all your greatness and happiness say not so my love answered she great i might have been but never happy with any other man indeed dear billy i laugh at the fears you formerly raised in what seemed so terrible at distance now it approaches nearer appears to have been mere let this comfort you that i look on myself at this day the happiest of women nor have i done anything which i not rejoice in and would if i had the gift of prescience again booth was so overcome with this behaviour that he had words to answer to say the truth it was difﬁcult to ﬁnd any worthy of the occasion he threw himself prost rate at her feet whence poor amelia was forced to use all her strength well entreaties to raise and place him in his chair such is ever the fortitude of perfect innocence and such the depression of guilt in minds not utterly abandoned booth was naturally of sanguine temper nor would any such apprehensions he mentioned have been sufﬁcient to have restrained his joy at meeting with his amelia in fact reﬂection on the injury he had done her was the sole cause of his grief this it was that enervated his heart and threw him into agonies which all that profusion of heroic tenderness that the most excellent of women intended his comfort served only to heighten and aggravate the more she rose in his admiration the more she quickened his sense of his own unworthiness after disagreeable evening the ﬁrst of that kind that he had ever passed with his amelia in which he had the utmost difﬁculty to force little chearfulness and in which her spirits were at length overpowered by discerning the oppression on his they retired to rest or rather to misery which need not be described the next morning at breakfast booth began to recover little from his melanc holy and to taste the company of his children he now ﬁrst thought of enquiring of amelia by what means she had discovered the place of his conﬁnement amelia after gently rebuki ng him not having himself acquainted her with it informed him that it was known all over the country and that she had traced the original of it to her sister who had spread the news with malicious joy and added circumstance which would have frightened her to death had not her knowledge of him made her give little credit to it which was that he was committed murder but though she had discredite d this part she said the not hearing from him during several successive posts made her too apprehensive of the rest that she got conveyance therefore herself and children to salisbury from whence the stage coach had brought them to town and having deposited the children at his lodging of which he had sent her an account on his

from the prison though he had mentioned nothing of his conﬁnement but he sent away his letters after nine at night the fellow to whom they were entrusted had burnt them both the sake of putting the twopence in his own pocket or rather in the pocket of the keeper of the next to the account which amelia gave him it served rather to raise than to satisfy his curiosity he began to suspect that some person had seen both him and miss matthews together in the prison and had confounded her case with his and this the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https of murder made the more probable but who this person should be he could not guess after giving himself therefore some pains in forming conjectures to purpose he was forced to rest contented with his ignorance of the real truth two or three days now passed without producing anything remarkable unless it were that booth more and more recovered his spirits and had now almost regained his former degree of chearfulness when the following letter arrived again to torment him dear bill y to convince you i am the most reasonable of women i have given you up three whole days to the unmolested possession of my fortunate rival i can refrain longer from letting you know that i lodge in dean street not far from the church at the sign of the pelican and trumpet where i expect this evening to see you believe i am with more af fection than any other woman in the world can be my dear billy your af fectionate fond doating f ma tthews booth tore the letter with rage and threw it into the ﬁre resolving never to visit the lady more unless it was to pay her the money she had lent him which he was determined to the very ﬁrst opportunity it was not at present in his power this letter threw him back into his ﬁt of dejection in which he had not continued long when packet from the country brought him the following from his friend dr harrison sir lyons january 21 though i am now on my return home i have taken up my pen to communicate to you some news i have heard from england which gives much uneasiness and concerning which i can indeed deliver my sentiments with much more ease this way than any other in my answer to your last i very freely gave you my opinion in which it was my misfortune to disapprove of every step you had taken but those were all pardonable errors can you be so partial to yourself upon cool and sober reﬂexion to think what i am going to mention is so i promise you it appears to folly of so monstrous kind that had i heard it from any but person of the highest honour i should have rejected it utterly incredible i hope you already guess what i am about to name since heaven forbid your conduct should afford you any choice of such gross instances of weakness in word then you have set up an equipage what shall i invent in your excuse either to others or to myself in truth i can ﬁnd excuse you and what is more i am certain you can ﬁnd none yourself i must deal therefore very plainly and sincerely with you vanity is always contemptible but when joined with dishonesty it becomes odious and detestable at whose expence are you to support this equipage is it not entirely at the expence of others and will it not ﬁnally end in that of your poor wife and children you know you are two years in arrears to if i could impute this to any extraordinary or common accident i think i should never have mentioned it but i will not suffer my money to support the ridiculous and i must say criminal vanity of any one i expect therefore to ﬁnd at my return that you have either dischar ged my whole debt or your equipage let beg you seriously to consider your circumstances and condition in life and to remember that your situation will not justify any the least unnecessary expence simply to be poor says my favourite greek historian was not held scandalous by the wise athenians but highly so to owe that poverty to our own indiscr the project gutenberg ebook

had this letter come at any other time it would have given booth the most sensible afﬂiction but so totally had the affair of miss matthews possessed his mind that like man in the most raging ﬁt of the gout he was scarce capable of any additional torture nay he even made an use of this latter epistle it served to account to amelia that concern which he really felt on another account the poor deceived lady therefore applied herself to give him comfort where he least wanted it she said he might easily perceive that the matter had been misrepresented to the doctor who woul d not she was sure retain the least anger against him when he knew the real truth after short conversation on this subject in which booth appeared to be greatly consoled by the arguments of his wife they parted he went to take walk in the park and she remained at home to prepare him his dinner he was sooner departed than his little boy not quite six years old said to amelia la mamma what is the matter with poor papa what makes him look so if he was going to cry he is not half so merry he used to be in the country amelia answered oh my dear your papa is only little thoughtful he will be merry again soon then looking fondly on her children she burst into an agony of tears and cried oh heavens what have these poor little infants done why will the barbarous world endeavour to starve them by depriving us of our only friend my dear your father is ruined and we are undone children presently accompanied their mother tears and the daughter why will anybody hurt poor papa hath he done any harm to anybody my dear child said the mother he is the best man in the world and therefore they hate him upon which the boy who was extremely sensible at his years answered nay mamma how can that be have not you often told that if i was good everybody would love all good people will answered she why they love papa then replied the child i am sure he is very good so they my dear said the mother but there are more bad people in the world and they will hate you your goodness why then bad people cries the child are loved by more than the good matter that my dear said she the love of one good person is more worth having than that of thousand wicked ones nay if there was such person in the world still you must be good boy there is one in heaven who will love you and his love is better you than that of all mankind this little dialogue we are apprehensive will be read with contempt by many indeed we should not have thought it worth recording was it not the excellent example which amelia here gives to all mothers this admirable woman never let day pass without instructing her children in some lesson of religion and morality by which means she had in their tender minds so strongly annexed the ideas of fear and shame to every idea of evil of which they were susceptible that it must require great pains and length of habit to separate them though she was the tenderest of mothers she never suffered any symptom of malevolence to shew itself in their most triﬂing actions without discouragement without rebuke and if it the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https with any

appears in unamiable light amelia with the assistance of little girl who was their only servant had drest her dinner and she had likewise drest herself neat any lady who had regular sett of servants could have done when booth returned and brought with him his friend james whom he had met with in the park and who booth absolutely refused to dine away from his wife to whom he had promised to return had invited himself to dine with him amelia had none of that paultry pride which possesses so many of her sex and which disconcerts their tempers and gives them the air and looks of furies if their husbands bring in an unexpected guest without giving them timely warning to provide sacriﬁce to their own vanity amelia received her husband friend with the utmost complaisance and good humour she made indeed some apology the homeliness of her dinner but it was politely turned compliment to james friendship which could carry him where he was sure of being so ill entertained and gave not the least hint how magniﬁcently she would have provided had she expected the favour of so much good company phrase which is generally meant to contain not only an apology the lady of the house but tacit satire on her guests their intrusion and is at least strong insinuation that they are not welcome amelia failed not to enquire very earnestly after her old friend james formerly miss bath and was very sorry to ﬁnd that she was not in town the truth was james had married out of violent liking of or appetite to her person possession had surfeited him and he was now grown so heartily tired of his wife that she had very little of his company she was forced therefore to content herself with being the mistress of large house and equipage in the country ten months in the year by hersel the other two he indulged her with the diversions of the town but then though they lodged under the same roof she had little more of her husband society than if they had been one hundred miles apart with all this she was woman of calm passions she made herself contented she had never had any violent affection james the match was of the prudent kind and to her advantage his fortune by the death of an uncle was become very considerable and she had gained everything by the bargain but husband which her constitution suf fered her to be very well satisﬁed without when amelia after dinner retired to her children james began to talk to his friend concerning his affairs he advised booth very earnestly to think of getting again into the army in which he himself had met with such success that he had obtained the command of regiment to which his brother was these preferments they both owed to the favour of fortune only though there was objection to either of their military characters yet neither of them had any extraordinary desert and if merit in the service was the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https recommendation booth who had been twice wounded in the siege seemed to have the fairest pretensions but he remained poor lieutenant and the others were we have said one of them and the other had regiment such rises we often see in life without being able to give any satisfactory account of the means and therefore ascribe them to the good fortune of the person both colonel james and his brother were members of parliament the uncle of the former had left him together with his estate an almost certain interest in borough so he chose to confer this favour on colonel bath circumstance which would have been highly immaterial to mention here but it serves to set forth the goodness of james who endeavoured to make up in kindness to the family what he wanted in fondness his wife colonel james then endeavoured all in his power to persuade booth to think again of military life and very kindly offered him his interest towards obtaining him company in the regiment under his command booth must have been madman in his present circumstances to have hesitated one moment at accepting such an offer and he well knew amelia notwithstanding her aversion to the army was much too wise to make the least scruple of giving her consent nor was he it appeared afterwards mistaken in his opinion of his wife understanding she made not the least objection when it was communicated to her but contented herself with an express stipul ation that wherever he was commanded to go the regiment was now abroad she would accompany him booth therefore accepted his friend proposal with profusion of acknowledgments and it was agreed that booth should draw up memorial of his pretensions which colonel james undertook to present to some man of power and to back it with all the force he had nor did the friendship of the colonel stop here you will excuse dear booth said he if after what you have told he had been very explicit in revealing his affairs to him i suspect you must want money at this time if that be the case i am certain it must be i have ﬁfty pieces at your service this generosity brought the tears into booth eyes and he at length confest that he had not ﬁve guineas in the house upon which james gave him bill twenty pounds and said he would give him thirty more the next time he saw him thus did this generous colonel generous he really was to the highest degree restore peace and comfort to this little family and by this act of beneﬁcence make two of the worthiest people two of the happiest that evening here reader give leave to stop minute to lament that so few are to be found of this benign disposition that while wantonness vanity avarice and ambition are every day rioting and triumphing in the follies and weakness the ruin and desolation of mankind scarce one man in thousand is capable of tasting the happiness of others nay give leave to wonder that pride which is constantly strugglin g and often imposing on itself to gain some little eminence should so seldom hint to us the only certain well laudable way of setting ourselves above another man and that is by becoming his benefactor the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https containing an eulogium upon innocence

the sunday the only day he could venture without the verge in the present state of his affairs and pay her what she had advanced him in the prison but she had not so long patience the third day while he was sitting with amelia letter was brough t to him he knew the hand he immediately put it into his pocket unopened not without such an alteration in his countenance that had amelia who was then playing with one of the children cast her eyes towards him she must have remarked it this accident however luckily gave him time to recover himself amelia was so deeply engaged with the little one that she did not even remark the delivery of the letter the maid soon after returned into the room saying the chairman desired to know if there was any answer to the letter what letter cries booth the letter i gave you just now answ ered the sure cries booth the child is mad you gave letter y es indeed i did sir said the poor girl why then sure fate cries booth i threw it into the ﬁre in my reverie why child why did you not tell it was letter bid the chairman come up stay i will go down myself he will otherwise dirt the stairs with his feet amelia was gently chiding the girl her carelessness when booth returned saying it was very true that she had delivered him letter from colonel james and that perhaps it might be of consequence however says he i will step to the and send him an account of this strange accident which i know he will pardon in my present situation booth was overjoyed at this escape which poor amelia total want of all jealousy and suspicion made it very easy him to accomplish but his pleasure was considerably abated when upon opening the letter he found it to contain mixed with several very strong expressions of love some pretty warm ones of the upbraiding kind but what most alarmed him was hint that it was in her miss matthews power to make amelia miserable herself besides the general knowledge of ens quid faemina possit he had more particular reasons to apprehend the rage of lady who had given so strong an instance how far she could carry her revenge she had already sent chairman to his lodgings with positive command not to return without an answer to her letter this migh t of itself have possibly occasioned discovery and he thought he had great reason to fear that if she did not carry matters so far purposely and avowedly to reveal the secret to amelia her indiscretion would at least effect the discovery of that which he would at any price have concealed under these terrors he might i believe be considered the most wretched of human beings innocence how glorious and happy portion art thou to the breast that possesses thee thou fearest neither the eyes nor the tongues of men truth the most powerful of all things is thy strongest friend and the brighter the light is in which thou art displayed the more the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https thy transcendent beauties guilt on the contrary like base thief suspects every eye that beholds him to be privy to his transgressions and every tongue that mentions his name to be proclaiming them fraud and falsehood are his weak and treacherous allies and he lurks trembling in the dark dreading every ray of light lest it should discover him and give him up to shame and punishment while booth was walking in the park with all these horrors in his mind he again met his friend colonel james who soon took notice of that deep concern which the other was incapable of hiding after some little conversation booth said my dear colonel i am sure i must be the most insensible of men if i did not look on you the best and the truest friend i will therefore without scruple repose conﬁdence in you of the highest kind i have often made you privy to my necessities i will now acquaint you with my shame provided you have leisure enough to give hearing i must open to you long history since i will not reveal my fault without informing you at the same time of those circumstances which i hope will in some measure excuse it the colonel very readily agreed to give his friend patient hearing so they walked directly to at the corner of garden where being in room by themselves booth opened his whole heart and acquainted the colonel with his amour with miss matthews from the very beginning to his receiving that letter which had caused all his present uneasiness and which he now delivered into his friend hand the colonel read the letter very attentively twice over he was silent indeed long enough to have read it oftener and then turning to booth said well sir and is it so grievous calamity to be the object of young lady affection especially of one whom you allow to be so extremely handsome nay but my dear friend cries booth not jest with you who know my amelia well my dear friend answered james and you know amelia and this lady too but what would you have you i would have you give your advice says booth by what method i shall get rid of this dreadful wom an without discovery and you really cries the other desire to get rid of her can you doubt it said booth after what i have communicated to you and after what you yourself have seen in my family i hope notwithstanding this fatal slip i not appear to you in the light of proﬂigate well answered james and whatever light i may appear to you in if you are really tired of the lady and if she be really what you have represented her i endeavour to take her off your hands but i insist upon it that you not deceive in any particular booth protested in the most solemn manner that every word which he had spoken was strictly true and being asked whether he would give his honour never more to visit the lady he assured james that he never would he then at his friend request delivered him miss matthews letter in which was second direction to her lodgings and declared to him that if he could bring him safely out of this terrible affair he should think himself to have still higher obligation to his friendship than any which he had already received from it booth pressed the colonel to go home with him to dinner but he excused himself being he said already engaged however he undertook in the afternoon to all in his power that booth should receive more alarms from the quarter of miss matthews whom the colonel undertook to pay all the demands she had on his friend they then separated the colonel went to dinner at the king arms and booth returned in high spirits to meet his the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https next day early in the morning the colonel came to the house and sent his friend who lodged but at little distanc the colonel told him he had little exaggerated the lady beauty however he said he excused that you might think perhaps cries he that your inconstancy to the ﬁnest woman in the world might want some excuse be that it will said he you may make yourself easy it will be i am convinced your own fault if you have ever any further molestation from miss matthews booth poured forth very warmly great profusion of gratitude on this occasion and nothing more anywise material passed at this interview which was very short the colonel being in great hurry he had he said some business of very great importance to transact that morning the colonel had now seen booth twice without remembering to give him the thirty pounds this the latter imputed intirely to forgetfulness he had always found the promises of the former to be equal in value with the notes or bonds of other people he was more surprized at what happened the next day when meeting his friend in the park he received only cold salute from him and though he past him ﬁve or six times and the colonel was walking with single ofﬁcer of great rank and with whom he seemed in earnest conversation yet could not booth who was alone obtain any further notice from him this gave the poor man some alarm though he could scarce persuade himself that there was any design in all this coldness or forgetfulness once he imagined that he had lessened himself in the colonel opinion by having discovered his inconstancy to amelia but the known character of the other presently cured him of his suspicion he was perfect libertine with regard to women that being indeed the principal blemish in his character which otherwise might have deserved much commendation generosity and friendship but he carried this one to most unpardonable height and made scruple of openly declaring that if he ever liked woman well enough to be uneasy on her account he would cure himself if he could by enjoying her whatever might be the consequence booth could not therefore be persuaded that the colonel would so highly resent in another fault of which he was himself most notoriously guilty after much consider ation he could derive this behaviour from nothing better than capriciousness in his friend temper from kind of inconstancy of mind which makes men grow weary of their friends with more reason than they often are of their mistresses to say the truth there are jilts in friendship well in love and by the behaviour of some men in both one would almost imagine that they industriously sought to gain the af fections of others with view only of making the parties miserable this was the consequence of the colonel behaviour to booth former calamities had afﬂicted him but this almost distracted him and the more so he was not able well to account such conduct nor to conceive the reason of it amelia at his return presently perceived the disturbance in his mind though he endeavoured with his utmost power to hide it and he was at length prevailed upon by her entreaties to discover to her the cause of it which she sooner heard than she applied judicious remedy to his disordered spirits either of those great mental phys icians tully the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https could have thought of she used many arguments to persuade him that he was in an error and had mistaken getfulness and carelessness designed neglect but this physic was only eventually good and its efﬁcacy depended on her being in the right point in which she was not apt to be too positive she thought ﬁt to add some consolation of more certain and positive kind admit said she my dear that james should prove the unaccountable person you have suspected and should without being able to alledge any cause withdraw his friendship from you surely the accident of burning his letter is too triﬂing and ridiculous to mention why should this grieve you the obligations he hath conferred on you i allow ought to make his misfortunes almost your own but they should not i think make you see his faults so very sensibly especially when by one of the greatest faults in the world committed against yourself he hath considerab ly lessened all obligations sure if the same person who hath contributed to my happiness at one time doth everything in his power maliciously and wantonly to make miserable at another i am very little obliged to such person and let it be comfort to my dear billy that however other friends may prove false and ﬁckle to him he hath one friend whom inconstancy of her own nor any change of his fortune nor time nor age nor sickness nor any accident can ever alter but who will esteem will love and doat on him ever so saying she ﬂung her snowy arms about his neck and gave him caress so tender that it seemed almost to balance all the malice of his fate and indeed the behaviour of amelia would have made him completely happy in deﬁance of all adverse circumstances had it not been those bitter ingredients which he himself had thrown into his cup and which prevented him from truly relishing his amelia sweetness by cruelly reminding him how unworthy he was of this excellent creature booth did not long remain in the dark to the conduct of james which at ﬁrst appeared to him to be so great mystery this very afternoon he received letter from miss matthews which unravelled the whole affair by this letter which was full of bitterness and upbraiding he discovered that james was his rival with that lady and was indeed the identical person who had sent the note to miss matthews when in the prison he had reason to believe likewise well by the letter by other circumstances that james had hitherto been an unsuccessful lover the lady though she had forfeited all title to virtue had not yet so far forfeited all pretensions to delicacy to be like the dirt in the street indifferently common to all she distributed her favours only to those she liked in which number that gentleman had not the happiness of being included when booth had made this discovery he was not so little versed in human nature any longer to hesitate at the true motive to the colonel conduct he well knew how odious sight happy rival is to an unfortunate lover i believe he was in reality glad to assign the cold treatment he had received from his friend to cause which however injustiﬁable is at the same time highly natural and to acquit him of levity ﬁckleness and caprice which he must have been unwillingly obliged to have seen in much worse light he now resolved to take the ﬁrst opportunity of accosting the colonel and of coming to perfect explanation upon the whole matter he debated likewise with himself whether he should not throw himself at amelia feet and confess crime to her which he found so little hopes of concealing and which he foresaw would occasion him so many difﬁculties the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https to endeavour to conceal happy had it been him had he wisely pursued this step since in all probability he would have received immediate forgiveness from the best of women but he had not sufﬁcient resolution or to speak perhaps more truly he had too much pride to confess his guilt and preferred the danger of the highest inconveniences to the certainty of being put to the blush chapter vi in which may appear that violence is sometimes done to the name of love when that happy day came in which unhallowed hands are forbidden to contaminate the shoulders of the unfortunate booth went early to the colonel house and being admitted to his presence began with great freedom though with great gentleness to complain of his not having dealt with him with more openness why my dear colonel said he would you not acquaint with that secret which this letter hath disclosed james read the letter at which his countenance changed more than once and then after short silence said booth i have been to blame i own it and you upbraid with justice the true reason was that i was ashamed of my own folly booth if i have not been most consumm ate fool very dupe to this woman and she hath particular pleasure in making so i know what the impertinence of virtue is and i can submit to it but to be treated thus by must forgive dear booth but your success was kind of triumph over which i could not bear i own i have not the least reason to conceive any anger against you and yet curse if i should not have been less displeased at your lying with my own wife nay i could almost have parted with half my fortune to you more willingly than have suffered you to receive that triﬂe of my money which you received at her hands however i ask your pardon and i promise you i will never more think of you with the least on the account of this woman but her if i not enjoy her by some means or other whatever it costs i am already above two hundred pounds out of pocket without having scarce had smile in return booth exprest much astonishment at this declaration he said he could not conceive how it was possible to have such an affection woman who did not shew the least inclination to return it james gave her hearty curse and said pox of her inclination i want only the possession of her person and that you will allow is very ﬁne one but besid es my passion her she hath now piqued my pride how can man of my fortune brook being refused by whore since you are so set on the business cries booth you will excuse my saying so i fancy you had better change your method of applying to her she is perhaps the vainest woman upon earth your bounty may probably you little service nay may rather actually disoblige her vanity is plainly her predominant passion and if you will administer to that it will infallibly throw her into your arms to this i attribute my own unfortunate success while she relieved my wants and distresses she was daily feeding her own vanity whereas every gift of yours asserted your superiority it rather offended than please d her the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https generally love to be of the obliging side and if we examine their favourites we shall ﬁnd them to be much oftener such they have conferred obligations on than such they have received them from there was something in this speech which pleased the colonel and he said with smile i know how it is will but you know women better than i perhaps colonel answered booth i have studied their minds more i however much envy your knowledge replied the other i never think their minds worth considering however i hope i shall proﬁt little by your experience with miss matthews damnation seize the proud insolent harlot the devil take if i love her more than i ever loved woman the rest of their conversation turned on booth affairs the colonel again reassumed the part of friend gave him the remainder of the money and promised to take the ﬁrst opportunity of laying his memorial before great man booth was greatly overjoyed at this success nothing now lay on his mind but to conceal his frailty from amelia to whom he was afraid miss matthews in the rage of her resentment would communicate it this apprehension made him stay almost constantly at home and he trembled at every knock at the door his fear moreover betrayed him into meanness which he would have heartily despised on any other occasion this was to order the maid to deliver him any letter directed to amelia at the same time strictly charging her not to acquaint her mistress with her having received any such orders servant of any acuteness would have formed strange conjectures from such an injunction but this poor girl was of perfect simplicity so great indeed was her simplicity that had not amelia been void of all suspicion of her husband the maid would have soon after betrayed her master one afternoon while they were drinkin g tea little betty so was the maid called came into the room and calling her master forth delivered him card which was direc ted to amelia booth having read the card on his return into the room chid the girl calling him saying if you can read child you must see it was directed to your mistress to this the girl answered pertly enough i am sure sir you ordered to bring every letter ﬁrst to you this hint with many women would have been sufﬁcient to have blown up the whole affair but amelia who heard what the girl said through the medium of love and conﬁdence saw the matter in much better light than it deserved and looking tenderly on her husband said indeed my love i must blame you conduct which perhaps i ought rather to praise it proceeds only from the extreme tenderness of your affection but why will you endeavour to keep any secrets from believe my own sake you ought not you can not hide the consequences you make always suspect ten times worse than the reality while i have you and my children well before my eyes i am capable of facing any news which can arrive what ill news can come unless indeed it concerns my little babe in the country which doth not relate to the badness of our circumstances and those i thank heaven we have now fair prospect of retrieving besides dear billy though my understanding be much inferior to yours i have sometimes had the happiness of luckily hitting on some argument which hath afforded you comfort this you know my dear was the case with regard to colonel james whom i persuaded you to think you had mistaken and you see the event proved in the right the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https both herself and booth did the excellence of this good woman disposition deceive her and force her to see everything in the most advantageous light to her husband the card being now inspected was found to contain the compliments of james to booth with an account of her being arrived in town and having brought with her very great cold amelia was overjoyed at the news of her arrival and having drest herself in the utmost hurry left her children to the care of her husband and ran away to pay her respects to her friend whom she loved with most sincere affection but how was she disappointed when eager with the utmost impatience and exulting with the thoughts of presently seeing her beloved friend she was answered at the door that the lady was not at home nor could she upon telling her name obtain any admission this considering the account she had received of the lady cold greatly surprized her and she returned home very much vexed at her disappointment amelia who had suspicion that james was really at home and the phrase is was denied would have made second visit the next morning had she not been prevented by cold which she herself now got and which was attended with slight fever this conﬁned her several days to her house during which booth ofﬁciated her nurse and never stirred from her in all this time she heard not word from james which gave her some uneasiness but more astonishment the tenth day when she was perfectly recovered about nine in the evening when she and her husband were just going to supper she heard most violent thundering at the door and presently after rustling of silk upon her staircase at the same time female voice cried out pretty loud bless what am i to climb up another pair of stairs upon which amelia who well knew the voice presently ran to the door and ushered in james most splendidly drest who put on formal countenance and made formal courtesie to her old friend if she had been her very distant acquaintance poor amelia who was going to rush into her friend arms was struck motionless by this behaviour but her spirits she had an excellent presence of mind she presently understood what the lady meant and resolved to treat her in her own way down therefore the company sat and silence prevailed some time during which james surveyed the room with more attention than she would have bestowed on one much ﬁner at length the conversation began in which the weather and the diversions of the town were well canvassed amelia who was woman of great humour performed her part to admiration so that stander would have doubted in every other article than dress which of the two was the most accomplished ﬁne lady after visit of twenty minutes during which not word of any former occu rrences was mentioned nor indeed any subject of discourse started except only those two above mentioned james rose from her chair and retired in the same formal manner in which she had approached we will pursue her the sake of the contrast during the rest of the evening she went from amelia directly to rout where she spent two hours in croud of company talked again and again over the diversions and news of the town played two rubbers at whist and then retired to her own apartment where having past another hour in undressing herself she went to her own the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https and his wife the moment their companion was gone sat down to supper on piece of cold meat the remains of their dinner after which over pint of wine they entertained themselves while with the ridiculous behaviour of their visitant but amelia declaring she rather saw her the object of pity than anger turned the discourse to pleasanter topics the little actions of their children the former scenes and future prospects of their life furnished them with many pleasant ideas and the contemplation of amelia recovery threw booth into raptures at length they retired happy in each other it is possible some readers may be less surprized at the behaviour of james than was amelia herself since they may have perhaps received so favourable an impression of that lady from the account given of her by booth that her present demeanour may seem unnatural and inconsistent with her former character but they will be pleased to consider the great alteration in her circumstances from state of dependency on brother who was himself better than soldier of fortune to that of being wife to man of very large estate and considerable rank in life and what was her present behaviour more than that of ﬁne lady who considered form and show essential ingredients of human happiness and imagined all friendship to consist in ceremony court esies messages and visits in which opinion she hath the honour to think with much the lar ger part of one sex and small number of the other chapter vii containing very extraor dinary and pleasant incident the next evening booth and amelia went to walk in the park with their children they were now on the verge of the parade and booth was describing to his wife the several buildings round it when on sudden amelia missing her little boy cried out where little billy upon which booth casting his eyes over the grass saw shaking the boy at little distance at this sight without making any answer to his wife he leapt over the rails and running directly up to the fellow who had ﬁrelock with bayonet ﬁxed in his hand he seized him by the collar and tript up his heels and at the same time wrested his arms from him serjeant upon duty seeing the affray at some distance ran presently up and being told what had happened gave the centinel hearty curse and told him he deserved to be hanged stander gave this information booth was returned with his little boy to meet amelia who staggered towards him fast she could all pale and breathless and scarce able to support her tottering limbs the serjeant now came up to booth to make an apology the behaviour of the soldier when of sudden he turned almost pale amelia herself he stood silent whilst booth was employed in comforting and recovering his wife and then addressing himself to him said bless lieutenant could i imagine it had been your honour and was it my little master that the rascal used so am glad i did not know it i should certainly have run my halbert into him the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https presently recognised his old faithf ul servant atkinson and gave him hearty greeting saying he was very glad to see him in his present situation whatever i am answered the serjeant i shall always think i owe it to your honour then taking the little boy by the hand he cried what vast ﬁne young gentleman master is grown and cursing the soldier inhumanity swore heartily he would make him pay it amelia was much disordered with her fright she did not recollect her foster till he was introduced to her by booth but she sooner knew him than she bestowed most obliging smile on him and calling him by the name of honest joe said she was heartily glad to see him in england see my dear cries booth what preferment your old friend is come to you would scarce know him i believe in his present state of ﬁnery i am very well pleased to see it answered amelia and i wish him joy of being made an ofﬁcer with all my heart in fact from what booth said joined to the serjeant laced coat she believed that he had obtained commission so weak and absurd is human vanity that this mistake of amelia possibly put poor atkinson out of countenance he looked at this instant more silly than he had ever done in his life and making her most respectful bow muttered something about obligations in scarce articulate or intelligible manner the serjeant had indeed among many other qualities that modesty which latin author honours by the name of ingenuous nature had given him this notwithstanding the meanness of his birth and six years conversation in the army had not taken it away to say the truth he was noble fellow and amelia by supposing he had commission in the guards had been guilty of af front to that honourable body booth had real affection atkinson though in fact he knew not half his merit he acquainted him with his lodgings where he earnestly desired to see him illustration he seized him by the collar amelia who was far from being recovered from the terrors into which the seeing her husband engaged with the soldier had thrown her desired to go home nor was she well able to walk without some assistance while she supported herself therefore on her husband arm she told atkinson she should be obliged to him if he would take care of the children he readily accepted the ofﬁce but upon offering his hand to miss she refused and burst into tears upon which the tender mother resigned boot h to her children and put herself under the serjeant protection who conducted her safe home though she often declared she feared she should drop down by the way the fear of which so affected the serjeant besides the honour which he himself had the lady he knew how tenderly his friend loved her that he was unable to speak and had not his nerves been so strongly braced that nothing could shake them he had enough in his mind to have set him trembling equally with the lady when they arrived at the lodgings the mistress of the house opened the door who seeing amelia condition threw open the parlour and begged her to walk in upon which she immediately ﬂung herself into chair and all present thought she would have fainted away however she escaped that misery and having drank glass of water with little white wine mixed in it she began in little time to regain her complexion and at length assured booth that she was perfectly recovered but declared she had never under gone so much and earnestly begged him never to be so rash the future she then called her little boy and gently the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https saying you must never so more billy you see what mischief you might have brought upon your father and what you have made suffer la mamma said the child what harm did i i did not know that people might not walk in the green ﬁelds in london i am sure if i did fault the man punished enough it he pinched almost through my slender arm he then bared his little arm which was greatly discoloured by the injury it had received booth uttered most dreadful execration at this sight and the serjeant who was now present did the like atkinson now returned to his guard and went directly to the ofﬁcer to acquaint him with the soldier inhumanity but he who was about ﬁfteen years of age gave the serjeant great curse and said the soldier had done very well that idle boys ought to be corrected this however did not satisfy poor atkinson who the next day soon the guard was relieved beat the fellow most unmercifully and told him he would remember him long he stayed in the regiment thus ended this triﬂing adventure which some readers will perhaps be pleased at seeing related at full length none i think can fail drawing one observation from it namely how capable the most insigniﬁcant accident is of disturbing human happiness and of producing the most unexpected and dreadful events reﬂexion which may serve to many moral and religious uses this accident produced the ﬁrst acqua intance between the mistress of the house and her lodgers hitherto they had scarce exchanged word together but the great concern which the good woman had shewn on amelia account at this time was not likely to pass unobserved or unthanked either by the husband or wife amelia therefore soon she was able to go invited ellison that was her name to her apartment and desired the favour of her to stay to supper she readily complied and they past very agreeable evening together in which the two women seemed to have conceived most extraordinary liking to each other though beauty in general doth not greatly recommend one woman to another it is too apt to create envy yet in cases where this passion doth not interfere ﬁne woman is often pleasing object even to some of her own sex especially when her beauty is attended with certain air of affability was that of amelia in the highest degree she was indeed most charming woman and i know not whether the little scar on her nose did not rather add to than diminish her beauty ellison therefore was much charmed with the loveliness of her fair lodger with all her other engaging qualities she was indeed so taken with amelia beauty that she could not refrain from crying out in kind of transport of admiration upon my word captain booth you are the happiest man in the world your lady is so extremely handsome that one can not look at her without pleasure this good woman had herself none of these attractive charms to the eye her person was short and immoderately fat her features were none of the most regular and her complexion if indeed she ever had good one had considerably suf fered by time her good humour and complaisance however were highly pleasing to amelia nay why should we conceal the secret satisfaction which that lady felt from the compliments paid to the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https since such of my readers like her best will not be sorry to ﬁnd that she was woman chapter viii containing various matters fortnight had now passed since booth had seen or heard from the colonel which did not little surprize him they had parted so good friends and he had so cordially undertaken his cause concerning the memorial on which all his hopes depended the uneasiness which this gave him farther encreased on ﬁnding that his friend refused to see him he had paid the colonel visit at nine in the morning and was told he was not stirring and at his return back an hour afterwards the servant said his master was gone out of which booth was certain of the falsehood he had during that whole hour walked backwards and forwards within sight of the colonel door and must have seen him if he had gone out within that time the good colonel however did not long suffer his friend to continue in the deplorable state of anxiety the very next morning booth received his memorial enclos ed in letter acquainting him that james had mentioned his affair to the person he proposed but that the great man had so many engagements on his hands that it was impossible him to make any further promises at this time the cold and distant stile of this letter and indeed the whole behaviour of james so different from what it had been formerly had something so mysterious in it that it greatly puzzled and perplexed poor booth and it was so long before he was able to solve it that the reader curiosity will perhaps be obliged to us not leaving him so long in the dark to this matter the true reason then of the colonel conduct was this his unbounded generosity together with the unbounded extravagance and consequently the great necessity of miss matthews had at length overcome the cruelty of that lady with whom he likewise had luckily rival above all the desire of being revenged on booth with whom she was to the highest degree enraged had perhaps contributed not little to his success she had sooner condescended to familiarity with her new lover and discovered that captain james of whom she had heard so much from booth was other than the identical colonel than she employed every art of which she was mistress to make an utter breach of friendship between these two this purpose she did not scruple to insinuate that the colonel was not at all obliged to the character given of him by his friend and to the account of this latter she placed most of the cruelty which she had shewn to the former had the colonel made proper use of his reason and fairly examined the probability of the fact he could scarce have been imposed upon to believe matter so inconsistent with all the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https of booth and in which that gentleman must have sinned against all the laws of honour without any visible temptation but in solemn fact the colonel was so intoxicated with his love that it was in the power of his mistress to have persuaded him of anything besides he had an interest in giving her credit he was not little pleased with ﬁnding reason hating the man whom he could not help hating without any reason at least without any which he durst fairly assign even to himself henceforth therefore he abandoned all friendship booth and was more inclined to put him out of the world than to endeavour any longer at supporting him in it booth communicated this letter to his wife who endeavoured usual to the utmost of her power to console him under one of the greatest afﬂictions which i think can befal man namely the unkindness of friend but he had luckily at the same time the greatest blessing in his possession the kindness of faithful and beloved wife blessing however which though it compensates most of the evils of life rather serves to aggravate the misfortune of distressed circumstances from the consideration of the share which she is to bear in them this afternoon amelia received secon d visit from ellison who acquainted her that she had present of ticket the oratorio which would carry two persons into the gallery and therefore begged the favour of her company thither amelia with many thanks acknowledged the civility of ellison but declined accepting her offer upon which booth very strenuously insisted on her going and said to her my dear if you knew the satisfaction i have in any of your pleasures i am convinced you would not refuse the favour ellison is so kind to offer you you are lover of music you who have never been at an oratorio can not conceive how you will be delighted i well know your goodness my dear answered amelia but i can not think of leaving my children without some person more proper to take care of them than this poor girl ellison removed this objection by offering her own servant very discreet matron to attend them but notwithstanding this and all she could say with the assistance of booth and of the children themselves amelia still persisted in her refusal and the mistress of the house who knew how far good breeding allows persons to be pressing on these occasions took her leave she was sooner departed than amelia looking tenderly on her husband said how can you my dear creature think that music hath any charms at this time or indeed you believe that i am capable of any sensation worthy the name of pleasure when neither you nor my children are present or bear any part of it an ofﬁcer of the regiment to which booth had formerly belonged hearing from atkinson where he lodged now came to pay him visit he told him that severa l of their old acquaintance were to meet the next wednesday at tavern and very strongly pressed him to be one of the company booth was in truth what is called hearty fellow and loved now and then to take chearful glass with his friends but he excused himself at this time his friend declared he would take denial and he growing very importunate amelia at length seconded him upon this booth answered well my dear since you desire i will comply but on one condition that you go at the same time to the oratorio amelia thought this request reasonable enough and gave her consent of which ellison presently received the news and with great the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https may perhaps be asked why booth could go to the tavern and not to the oratorio with his wife in truth then the tavern was within hallowed ground that is to say in the verge of the court of ﬁve ofﬁcers that were to meet there three besides booth were conﬁned to that air which hath been always found extremely wholesome to broken military constitution and here if the good reader will pardon the pun he will scarce be offended at the observation since how is it possible that without running in debt any person should maintain the dress and appearance of gentleman whose income is not half so good that of porter it is true that this allowance small it is is great expense to the public but if several more unnecessary charges were spared the public might perhaps bear little encrease of this without much feeling it they would not i am sure have equal reason to complain at contributing to the maintenance of sett of brave fellows who at the hazard of their health their limbs and their lives have maintained the safety and honour of their country when they ﬁnd themselves taxed to the support of sett of drones who have not the least merit or claim to their favour and who without contributing in any manner to the good of the hive live luxuriously on the labours of the industrious bee chapter ix in which amelia with her friend goes to the oratorio nothing happened between the monday and the wednesday worthy place in this history upon the evening of the latter the two ladies went to the oratorio and were there time enough to get ﬁrst row in the gallery indeed there was only one person in the house when they came amelia inclinations when she gave loose to them were pretty eager this diversion she being great lover of music and particularly of handel compositions ellison was i suppose great lover likewise of music she was the more impatient of the two which was rather the more extraordinary these entertainments were not such novelties to her they were to poor amelia though our ladies arrived full two hours before they saw the back of handel yet this time of expectation did not hang extremely heavy on their hands besides their own chat they had the company of the gentleman whom they found at their ﬁrst arrival in the gallery and who though plainly or rather roughly dressed very luckily the women happened to be not only but person of very lively conversation the gentleman on his part seemed highly charmed with amelia and in fact was so though he restrained himself entirely within the rules of good breeding yet was he in the highest degree ofﬁcious to catch at every opportunity of shewing his respec t and doing her little services he procured her book and and held the candle her himself during the whole entertainment at the end of the oratorio he declared he would not leave the ladies till he had seen them safe into their chairs or coach and at the same time very earnestly entreated that he might have the honour of waiting on them upon which ellison who was very the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https answered ay sure sir if you please you have been very obliging to us and dish of tea shall be at your service at any time and then told him where she lived the ladies were sooner seated in their hackney coach than ellison burst into loud laughter and cried i be hanged madam if you have not made conquest and what is very pleasant i believe the poor gentleman takes you single lady nay answered amelia very gravely i protest i began to think at last he was rather too particular though he did not venture at word that i could be offended at but if you fancy any such thing i am sorry you invited him to drink tea why so replied ellison are you angry with man liking you if you are you will be angry with almost every man that sees you if i was man myself i declare i should be in the number of your admirers poor gentleman i pity him heartily he little knows that you have not heart to dispose of my own part i should not be surprized at seeing serious proposal of marriage i am convinced he is man of fortune not only by the politeness of his address but by the ﬁneness of his linen and that valuable diamond ring on his ﬁnger but you will see more of him when he comes to tea indeed i shall not answered amelia though i believe you only rally i hope you have better opinion of than to think i would go willingly into the company of man who had an improper liking ellison who was one of the gayest women in the world repeated the words improper liking with laugh and cried my dear booth believe you are too handsome and too prude how can you affect being offended at what i am convinced is the greatest pleasure of womankind and chieﬂy i believe of us virtuous women i assure you notwithstanding my gaiety i am virtuous any prude in europe far be it from madam said amelia to suspect the contrary of abundance of women who indulge themselves in much greater freedoms than i should take or have any pleasure in taking i solemnly protest if i know my own heart the liking of all men but of one is matter quite indif ferent to or rather would be highly disagreeable this discourse brought them home where amelia ﬁnding her children asleep and her husband not returned invited her companion to partake of her homely fare and down they sat to supper together the clock struck twelve and news being arrived of booth ellison began to express some astonishment at his stay whence she launched into general reﬂexion on husbands and soon passed to some particular invectives on her own ah my dear madam says she i know the present state of your mind by what i have myself often felt formerly i am stranger to the melancholy tone of midnight clock it was my misfortune to drag on heavy chain above ﬁfteen years with sottish but how can i wonder at my fate since i see even your superior charms can not conﬁne husband from the bewitching pleasures of bottle indeed madam says amelia i have reason to complain booth is one of the soberest of men but now and then to spend late hour with his friend is i think highly excusable doubt cries ellison if he can excuse himself but if i was here booth came in and interrupted the discourse amelia eyes ﬂashed with joy the moment he appeared and he discovered less pleasure in seeing her his spirits were indeed little elevated with wine so to heighten his good humour without in the least disordering his understanding and made him such delightful company that though it was past one in the morning neither his wife nor ellison thought of their beds during whole hour early the next morning the serjeant came to booth lodgings and with melancholy countenance acquainted him that he had been the night before at an alehouse where he the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https murphy an attorney declare that he would get warrant backed again st one captain booth at the next board of greencloth i hope sir said he your honour will pardon but by what he said i was afraid he meant your honour and therefore i thought it my duty to tell you i knew the same thing happen to gentleman here the other day booth gave atkinson many thanks his information i doubt not said he but i am the person meant it would be foolish in to deny that i am liable to apprehensions of that sort i hope sir said the serjeant your honour will soon have reason to fear man living but in the mean time if any accident should happen my bail is at your service far it will go and i am housekeeper and can swear myself worth one hundred pounds which hearty and friendly declaration received all those acknowledgments from booth which it really deserved the poor gentleman was greatly alarmed at the news but he was altogether much surprized at murphy being the attorney employed against him all his debts except only to captain james arose in the country where he did not know that murphy had any acquaintance however he made doubt that he was the person intended and resolved to remain close prisoner in his own lodgi ngs till he saw the event of proposal which had been made him the evening before at the tavern where an honest gentleman who had post under the government and who was one of the company had promised to serve him with the secretary at war telling him that he made doubt of procuring him whole pay in regiment abroad which in his present circumstances was very highly worth his acceptance when indeed that and gaol seemed to be the only alternatives that of fered themselves to his choice booth and his lady spent that afterno on with incident which we should scarce have mentioned had it not been that amelia gave on this occasion an instance of that prudence which should never be off its guard in married women of delicacy before she would consent to drink tea with ellison she made conditions that the gentleman who had met them at the oratorio should not be let in indeed this circumspection proved unnecessary in the present instance such visitor ever came circumstance which gave great content to amelia that lady had been little uneasy at the raillery of ellison and had upon reﬂexion magniﬁed every little compliment made her and every little civility shewn her by the unknown gentleman far beyond the truth these imaginations now all subsided again and she imputed all that ellison had said either to raillery or mistake young lady made fourth with them at whist and likewise stayed the whole evening her name was bennet she was about the age of twenty but sickness had given her an older look and had good deal diminished her beauty of which young she was she plainly appeared to have only the remains in her present possession she was in one particular the very reverse of ellison being altogether remarkably grave the other was gay this gravity was not however attended with any sourness of temper on the contrary she had much sweetness in her countenance and was perfectly well bred in short amelia imputed her grave deportment to her ill health and began to entertain compassion her which in good minds that is to say in minds capable of compassion is certain to introduce some little degree of love or friendship amelia was in short so pleased with the conversation of this lady that though woman of impertinent curiosity she could not help taking the ﬁrst opportunity of enquiring who the project gutenberg ebook of amelia volume 1 by henry fielding https ellison said that she was an unhappy lady who had married young clergyman love who dying of consumption had left her widow in very indifferent circumstances this account made amelia still pity her more and consequently added to the liking which she had already conceived her amelia therefore desired ellison to bring her acquainted with bennet and said she would go any day with her to make that lady visit there need be ceremony cried ellison she is woman of form and i saw plainly she was extremely pleased with booth i am convinced i can bring her to drink tea with you any afternoon you please the two next days booth continued at home highly to the satisfaction of his amelia who really knew happiness out of his company nor scarce any misery in it she had indeed at all times so much of his company when in his power that she had occasion to assign any particular reason his staying with her and consequently it could give her cause of suspicion the saturday one of her children was little disordered with feverish complaint which conﬁned her to her room and prevented her drinking tea in the afternoon with her husband in ellison apartment where noble lord cousin of ellison happened to be present though that lady was reduced in her circumstances and oblige d to let out part of her house in lodgings she was born of good family and had some considerable relations his lordship was not himself in any ofﬁce of state but his fortune gave him great authority with those who were ellison therefore very bluntly took an opportunity of recommending booth to his consideration she took the ﬁrst hint from my lord calling the gentleman captain to which she answe red ay i wish your lordship would make him so it would be an act of justice and i know it is in your power to much greater things she then mentioned booth services and the wounds he had received at the siege of which she had heard faithful account from amelia booth blushed and was silent young virgin at the hearing her own praises his lordship answered cousin ellison you know you may command my interest nay i shall have pleasure in serving one of booth character my part i think merit in all capacities ought to be encouraged but i know the ministry are greatly pestered with solicitations at this time however booth may be assured i will take the ﬁrst opportunity and in the mean time i shall be glad of seeing him any morning he pleases all these declarations booth was not wanting in acknowledgments to the generous peer any more than he was in secret gratitude to the lady who had shewn so friendly and uncommon zeal in his favour the reader when he knows the character of this nobleman may perhaps conclude that his seeing booth alone was lucky circumstance he was so passionate an admirer of women that he could scarce have escaped the attraction of amelia beauty and few men i have observed have such disinterested generosity to serve husband the better because they are in love with his wife unless she will condescend to pay price
